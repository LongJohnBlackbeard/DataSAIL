2021-05-07 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Just say “no”.  Pretty easy.
2021-05-07 19:43:34,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I would look into getting your son out of that resort, it seems pretty shitty that they would just lock him up like that without internet access. How much is he even paying to stay there, and for 3 years?"
2021-05-07 19:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Well at least buy the book from them by William O Neal, you can set a stock screener up by their CAN SLIM method plus there’s some good Chart learning in there. Set him up a paper trade on ThinkOrSwim for free and let him have at the paper trading. I use to subscribe long ago and only bought print. It always arrived out in the sticks the next day. It was surprising. I figure the local paper printed it and delivered. It’s the only way."

2021-05-07 19:54:33,wallstreetbets,It took me a little to figure out just because the price goes down doesn’t mean institutions are selling. More often than not it’s price discovery and what  someone wants to pay for the stock at the time. Watching institutions creep in is key and also knowing what sector is favored.

2021-05-07 19:48:27,wallstreetbets,I’m betting on the earnings call. The stock is oversold. And if they announce even a single bit of good news about multilayered cells etc this will ducking explode to the moon for real. So The risk/reward is worth it.
2021-05-07 19:49:49,wallstreetbets,And I don’t mind holding it for at least a year. I’ll keep on buying more on dips because I’m probably retarded.
2021-05-07 19:55:35,wallstreetbets,lol good train of thought. But remember what market cycle we're in. Apple and Amazon  had blow earns and didn't even move. They both have billions of dollars of cash and rule the world. QS is going to move on earns. I just don't see it and if it did. It will be about 1 % to 3 % just to have the stock go lower the next week. The market right now and probably for the rest of the year. Doesn't like these type of stocks.

2021-05-07 18:55:25,wallstreetbets,Could have been a comment in the daily
2021-05-07 18:46:35,wallstreetbets,"I think Ge is an interesting long-term play. Short term, I think it’ll move with the markets and lack a solid catalyst to make it double(unless it miraculously tripled dividends). It manufactures military engines and equipment, as well as allegedly being a leading player in carbon capture. Personally I am long term bullish, and I believe it has a maximum loss of 90% in case of catastrophe because the military certainly isn’t going to let a military aircraft engine manufacturer go bankrupt to the point of not being able to do r & d. I think rolls Royce is a similarly tuned company that might be worth checking out as Britain has been a covid laggard. Any kind of dividend increase or dividend payout with orderly book keeping will likely be viewed as bullish for the industry as a whole."
2021-05-07 18:35:53,wallstreetbets,I dumped it as I don’t like the reverse split coming up.

2021-05-07 18:23:53,wallstreetbets,Technically you can short a stock till it hits zero.  That was the goal for GME.  They thought it was a bankruptcy story waiting to happen.  Hold shorts and a company goes bankrupt you don't ever have to cover them.

NGL, Earnings on Monday have me nervous, (I'm now bag holding 100 shares of Rocket at $21.79) but then again, with Rocket dragging down this stonk, I think an earnings miss is already priced in, so the stock, IMO goes sideways, or up on Earnings news, assuming earnings isn't a totally unexpected disaster."
2021-05-07 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m in big on this one. Loaded up more today and yesterday. It’ll pop up again and I’ll walk with the gains.

TLDR - this one is a good buy (not financial advice)"
2021-05-07 19:14:38,wallstreetbets,"Great DD and you didn't even mention the high possibility for a raised or special dividend.

Fun fact: if UWM had paid 100% of their Q4 profit back to Class A shareholders (public shares which receive the regular dividend), the dividend would have been **$13 per share**. That's not a typo. They've only been public for two quarters (the second ER being Monday after market), the current $0.1 dividend could be considered an opening bid of sorts for their shareholders

This company has cash, and they are in an industry that doesn't hoard it. 

The share price reflects an expectation of a bad ER like RKT just had, not a blowout, and I'm expecting a blowout. I like the stock. 1200 shares in the IRA and 390 5/21 contracts from $7.5 to $12.5 in my retard account"

2021-05-07 18:46:32,wallstreetbets,"AMC I'd still be worried about, their cash burn is incredible and they weren't doing so hot pre pandemic.  With the debt they took on it's going to be a big hole to dig out of.  GME while not a store I cared for has an easier pivot back to profitability"
2021-05-07 19:06:32,wallstreetbets,"UWMC has only paid dividends once as well...

UWMC may have a slightly higher rate, but the stock price is only going down. It costs more than the 0.5% to hold it."
2021-05-07 19:14:10,wallstreetbets,"When you go on Google Finance, UWMC shows dividend yield. RKT does not. UWMC's dividend is regular. RKT's was one time.

""The price is only going down"" - do you prefer buying shoes when they are on sale or would you prefer to buy them after a price increase?"
2021-05-07 19:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Dividend yield tells you how much of a return you'll earn from income alone over any given year based on the stock's most recent price.

2021-05-07 19:53:33,wallstreetbets,Gross margin will be down for UWMC even if revenues are up and Q2 forecast will be for even smaller gross margin on sale. This will likely get crushed by the street AH Monday.

I dove into the financials and couldn't find any decline in the actual company since the failed BA acquisition. Seems like Wall St just soured on the company after BA backed out because of covid + 737 max financial problems. BA was valuing the company around $5-6bn for acquisition, and current market cap is $2.4bn. Lots of upside here.

2021-05-07 19:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Nothing yet, will likely jump up to several hundred thousand a share the second 005 is put into effect though, and right now it seems that it is a bottle that is barely, and desperately being held closed."
2021-05-07 19:03:58,wallstreetbets,I see the same price as yesterday
2021-05-07 19:05:01,wallstreetbets,So should I invest?
2021-05-07 19:09:51,wallstreetbets,People have been saying “its going to jump because of X” for months now
2021-05-07 19:09:49,wallstreetbets,If you do not have some game stop stock right now your ass is literally hanging out in the wind. It would be absolutely foolish not to invest as much as you can at this point. It's the sort of thing that can make you an overnight millionaire with minimal investment. Buy some hold it till it's well over 100k a share at some point here in the next 2-3 months.
2021-05-07 19:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and dtcc 005 is the big one that the SEC and other big players are likely waiting for before they let off the leash, and let things get nuts as it is the primary piece of their firewall to prevent total market collapse. It has become very clear that the price is being heavily manipulated in order to prevent it from popping off, and there is a very good chance that the SEC is playing a part in it directly so they can finish putting in rules in order to protect the greater market."
2021-05-07 19:11:00,wallstreetbets,100k bro is that even possible
2021-05-07 19:13:09,wallstreetbets,How will it reach 100k?
2021-05-07 19:17:49,wallstreetbets,Hey! I got some shares and holding. But at this point I have very little faith its going to go past 4 digits IF it does
2021-05-07 19:14:28,wallstreetbets,"100k is a low end number, most estimates put it being in the 1 million to 10 million per share range, but yes given the numbers at play currently it is very possible."
2021-05-07 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,"It is due to certain hedgefunds like Citadel massively naked shorting the stock, and then retail coming in and buying up those shorts to the point that they now own more stock than what was ever issued by the company. Eventually those hedgefunds that shorted are going to have to cover their short possition, which will likely happen when they are forced to via a margin call. When this happens they will be facing a ton of retail holders who are currently refusing to sell as a group for anything less than 6 to 8 figures per share, and they not only have to buy back every share in order to cover their shorts, they will have to buy back many shares twice over because they shorted the stock by more shares than actually exist. Basically, they fucked up HARD. Based on the numbers there is a real chance it could reach 10 million per share, so 100k is a lowend estimate."
2021-05-07 19:39:20,wallstreetbets,"For GameStop to trade above 100k it would need to be valued near the stocks on the DOW, all of them. Combined. So no. That won’t happen"
2021-05-07 19:29:32,wallstreetbets,"Dont listen to this retards, do you even read them? 500k a share lmao. They are delusional and WILL lose all their money. All of it. Just my 2 cents"
2021-05-07 19:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Wait till 005 passes, which is going to be within the next few weeks. There is a good chance that the regulatory agencies are in cahoots with the shorted hedges to keep it from going off before then, because the economic effects otherwise could be extremely devastating to the country, like 08 times a hundred. Put it this way, if this thing wasn't a ticking time bomb, they wouldn't be having multiple congressional hearings over it."
2021-05-07 19:29:16,wallstreetbets,I honestly can't tell who's serious and who's sarcastic anymore.
2021-05-07 19:23:33,wallstreetbets,"71 million shares outstanding, if the price per share got to $1mil GameStop as a company would be worth $71trillion. The last global GDP I can find is ~$80trillion. I'm sorry, but that's not even sort of close to possible.

I really hope it works out well for everybody and you all make a lot of money but dial it waaayyyy back if you want to be taken seriously at all"
2021-05-07 19:15:17,wallstreetbets,How and why will it go that high?
2021-05-07 19:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Jesus stop it. You are sick and its just embarrassing, wtf"
2021-05-07 19:30:13,wallstreetbets,Lmao I know I just didn’t wanna be rude and call him fucking retarded
2021-05-07 19:31:25,wallstreetbets,"I am dead serious my man, this is what the math is currently looking like for this stock. In the end after a year or two it will likely be a solid 600 dollar stock, but during the short squeeze the price is going to go absolutely bonkers, and it not a matter of if, but when that happens."
2021-05-07 19:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh it wouldn't stay that price for very long, but there will almost certainly be a brief moment where it goes that crazy. It is the primary reason that the SEC is likely helping contain the stock price until after 005 passes in order to prevent a greater market collapse. Also from the looks of it only about 23 million are noninsider shares that would be actually sellable at that price for the brief moment that it will be available. Personally i think we will see a million dollar+ spike, and then settle closer to the 100k range within a day where it will hover for a few days before crashing down to a normal market value in the 120-150's range where it will slowly climb back up to around the 600 range as a ""real"" stock price over the course of a year or two."
2021-05-07 19:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Dude, they literally had an 8 hour congressional hearing over Game stop stock YESTERDAY. That is not freakin normal."
2021-05-07 19:49:08,wallstreetbets,"> this is what the math is currently looking like for this stock. 

Humor me - what is this math?"
2021-05-07 19:45:35,wallstreetbets,You sound like someone who went in at $480/share and is having a hard time accepting reality
2021-05-07 19:31:39,wallstreetbets,"I could see a squeeze peak of $1k, and I'd admit I might be as much as $10k wrong, either scenario would still be a pretty sweet profit for shareholders.  $100k plus would be earth shattering in a way that I don't think is possible, but good luck and godspeed"
2021-05-07 19:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol 3 different hearings with top top people (citadel, Robinhood, and Melvin ceo, sec chairman, dtcc president and finra). Most brokerage halted trading, Reddit and discord shut down. All that because they were scared of it going nomore than $1k."
2021-05-07 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Naw i did pick up a hundred and fifty or so in the 40 to 120 range though. Seriously though, I'm not stating anything that hasn't been massively backed up by hundreds of experts pouring over the available info. They literally had an 8 hour congressional hearing over Game Stop Stock yesterday, and the price movement on the day to day is wonky as all hell. Say what you want, but something fucky is going on with this stock."

In any case the cost to potential reward is so low for this stock that it would be foolish for anyone not to have a few shares on hand just in case it does go nuts."
2021-05-07 19:34:31,wallstreetbets,"If it wasn't going to be earth shattering, the SEC, and congress wouldn't be involved with trying to keep it contained until new regs are passed. This shit is very likely going to get crazy, but even if it ONLY makes it to 500, which it already has once before it was emergency shut down by some big time illegal shit, that is still more than a good reason to be holding as much as you can. This is a solid stock, with growth potential, that just so happens to have a lottery ticket glued onto it."
2021-05-07 19:54:07,wallstreetbets,"Something has been going on for months, doesn’t mean it’s going to break out to anything you’re saying. I’m going to estimate your 18-24 and YOLOD all your money in, I’ll also bet you’re exaggerating shares and reducing your average."
2021-05-07 19:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Wrong on all counts lol, I'm in my 40's, and basically chucked some pocket change at it. I didn't pull this shit out of my butthole dude, this is what the various DD on the subject has been saying for months, and I have yet to see anything that discredits any of it."

Edit* - from my state's government website. Since nobody believes that these laws are loose as fuck in some places.

""Common law marriage, also known as marriage without formalities or informal marriage, is a valid and legal way for a couple to marry in Texas. Texas law states that a common law marriage may be proved by evidence that the couple:

“agreed to be married”; and

“after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife”; and they

“represented to others that they were married”"

2021-05-07 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,I think it’s going to dump to at least 16.50ish (.618 fib) before it bottoms now that we’ve take out everything stitch of support. You’ve got a clean 5 waves way up and it’s forming a clean 3 wave correction. It also looks like we broke below the neckline of giant H&S. I sold calls against my shares like 10 days ago but I’m mad I didn’t do more protect from this sell off. Shoulda added some puts too.

2021-05-07 17:48:50,wallstreetbets,I can't believe they capable of this it's surreal. I lost alot of money in the stock market and I thought it was rigged from the patterns that was obvious. Now! I feel like I literally been rob over 100k and all of this confirmed my suspicion. Sad
2021-05-07 19:14:04,wallstreetbets,Feels like they've been squeezing us ever since
2021-05-07 17:41:55,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the amc and gme prices? Citadel aint suffering

And I see resistance levels on GME 

Both increasing in interests and FTD. You may not see it reflected in the price now. But it's coming. Idk when. Idk how. But I know they going down"
2021-05-07 17:49:14,wallstreetbets,I'm not losing lol. I'm up 6k in AMC and I'm doing incredible on just slightly otm calls
2021-05-07 17:57:25,wallstreetbets,No one is losing unless they're selling
2021-05-07 19:20:11,wallstreetbets,ooooh
2021-05-07 17:57:27,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t mean that most are doing well. I got in at $4 and sold at $14, took my 15k+ profits and called it a day. I noticed since then the stock has gone down a quite a bit. These new investors that jumped into GME and AmC tend to be very emotional investors. Emotional investing is really bad and will lead to more  losses than gains. Investing is about profit not waiting for some random squeeze that may or may not happen. If I were you, I would take the 6k profit and dump it  into stocks with better fundamentals."
2021-05-07 17:53:39,wallstreetbets,No one every lost money taking profit.  If you are not here to make money you are in the wrong game.
2021-05-07 19:14:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know. That's why I lock profit anything over 30% usually. Sometimes I diamond hand because neither the gain is 30% nor the loss is 20%. Often those with 10-12% loss tank on the next day. Also, often the one I close at 30-80% or even at 10% due to large exposure moons to 400-500% the next day except two gme calls that I diamond handed and closed at 1600% next day."

2021-05-07 19:26:16,wallstreetbets,My grandfather used to come back from the horse races and talk about all his winners but he never had any money. You sir tell the full story. I shall endeavor to do the same. I jumped into baba early but averaged down. CLNE was that s*** show this week but last night I came to the conclusion that if the investment banks were pushing it down to buy a bargain I too would buy that bargain. Averaged myself down under $10 a share. Was confident that PLTR would bounce off the 20 support so I held on to my 22 C's. When the support failed so did my stomach. Hoping for a small miracle next week to correct that situation so I'm betting against you on that one.
2021-05-07 17:43:58,wallstreetbets,You weren’t kidding... this not playing by the rules or logic is maddening. Just greed on behalf of the manipulators.
2021-05-07 19:09:14,wallstreetbets,"Holding $CLNE after finding your DD and doing some of my own. I've been doing some self education whilst having a slow period at work so still getting to grips with the graph analysis. Looking to average down next week with the RSI getting close to oversold alongisde the bullish sentiment on this thread and the DD post. 

Would love to know what drives you to these summaries and identify good stocks? I guess it's a bit of fundamental and technical but which do you rely on more? Is it like 70% technical followed by fundamental and market senitment?

Edit: Spelling"
2021-05-07 18:51:45,wallstreetbets,DASH puts or flat out shorting over 140 is one of the best trades out there Imo

2021-05-07 19:17:00,wallstreetbets,"Really sad I missed out on CVS. I’d been playing them for awhile but thought they’d have a harder time breaking 80 than they did. Lots of money left on the table for that one. 

Holding bags on CLNE but slowly averaging down today. Your buy in the afternoon probably prevented my next few limit orders from hitting on the next batch of shares (small position, mind you). All my calls are sep at the moment, spread across strikes. 

BE and BABA been picking up calls here and there on limit orders. Also grabbed some LMND calls yesterday on that monster dip.

DASH and UPST I mis timed and had to let run down without me :(  they’d been on my short list for awhile, but I wasn’t checking my short list often enough.  Did similar play to your Tesla timing with puts... should have held longer but that stock makes me nervous - it tends to swing wildly on no news. 

Not on your list but managed to grab a few bucks on the downswing of ATER and hoping RCII will melt up some more though it seems to somewhat just follow the market these days."
2021-05-07 18:48:17,wallstreetbets,"GRUB and PCG made me some dough this week but CLNE dragged me down hard. BE's price right now is stellar imo.

Any thoughts on $WY? I entered a position a few days back and cleared a 50% swing. Im thinking about going long here.  
Same with $CLF, i kicked myself for not grabbing June 20's on sale last week."

All that aside, thanks so much for sharing your insight when you don’t have to say shit. It’s kinda scary when you make it look so easy but this course of action better than 95% of the junk out there. Lucky to have come across your stuff. Only recommendation would be to have a confidence indicator, I mean you have sooo many plays! Well that’s my dream request. Oh another request, why Nrdrage? Origin story please. Thanks again"

2021-05-07 18:48:23,wallstreetbets,"> had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"" 

That was me!! Sorry sir I read you agreed that BABA should be 310 and FOMO'd in lol"
2021-05-07 19:37:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm obviously a genius, because despite your very positive track record here exactly the counters I chose from your ETF are all taking me to Wendy's. Got some bags on ENPH and CLNE, and averaged down some on CLNE today. PSFE and BABA are doing fine if not amazing (BABA I got in before the fine announcement). Not particularly worried at the moment though. My biggest holdings are in CLNE and BABA. Like you I think BABA is a no brainer. I've been convinced by your DD on CLNE and the new legislation looks really exciting."

2021-05-07 17:40:08,wallstreetbets,P/e of 3 even if rates rise unless they lose two thirds of their revenue this valuation is unjustified
2021-05-07 18:53:35,wallstreetbets,">I'm not sure why anyone would want in on mortgage company stocks right now. 

Interest rates rising won't hurt too much. RKT is still printing money (not quite as fast as the Fed), but it's throwing off free cash flow in a huge way. People will still buy houses, even if rates go back where they were pre-pandemic. It's a solid company, and eventually the stock will come back. Now that expectations are tamped back down, it might get a nice pop on earnings next quarter."
2021-05-07 18:43:03,wallstreetbets,"The whole casino bet, also I think a lot thought after the huge dip it would pick up not further double down on that.

I also am pretty sure Quickbooks isn’t public unless they’re owned by RKT.  Reading so many posts it makes me think some people post only trying to out dumb the previous posts.
If, as you say, everyone is building houses in 2021 and the market looks out 6+ months then how does RKT do as well as they’ve done so far in 21’ next year?  Didn’t their earnings release yesterday say they don’t expect re-fi’s and new purchases won’t be as active in 22’?  That’s why the shares hit $16.50 yday, and down another $1 today.  Look for a company with easy comps and growing not plateauing."

2021-05-07 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Huang was playing games in options to make dogshit companies like GSX moon for no reason. 

Isn't there a good possibility that this is the same magic that gets Cathy's stocks to moon for no reason? Huang is heavily invested in ARK. He was putting his thumb on the scales. Why do you think Huang's crashes are timed perfectly with ARKs recent plunge from February onwards?

Baghodlers gonna get taken to task this quarter, mark my words. (This is not financial advice I'm a retard)"

2021-05-07 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,I dont know how anyone times a sale correctly. I think theres still room for CVS to grow so i kind of want to hold them but if it dips between now and the end of the month I'll be sad
2021-05-07 17:28:38,wallstreetbets,I knew it was risky holding these going into earnings but my faith in the company strengthened my hands. So glad I held on
2021-05-07 17:39:54,wallstreetbets,Omg … why did you sell leaps?  … those decays are so slow .

2021-05-07 16:24:49,wallstreetbets,I'd be careful.  Or at least sell some if not all.  You have solid gains on the options.  Theta is going to dwindle that away over the next two weeks if you don't sell.
2021-05-07 16:37:39,wallstreetbets,Close to exp. options aren't about perfectly timing an exit.

AMZN was at 3340 just before the open, closed at 3291

Zoom peaked at 304, closed at 295

The returns It's generated so far on the 5 dates I've tested in February-March (left out Jan because the Jan 28th volatility would have made it too easy and been a massive outlier): 
110%
73%
246%
621%
190%

Someone tell me what I'm missing here? If this is real why aren't we all doing this?

Editing to clarify, was buying them when it was going up 1-3% in a day, 5% rare, but the point remains the same.

Second edit: some of you don't understand that VXX decays over time, and that you don't need to see the future for this strategy, just buy puts anytime VXX spikes up more than a percent or two a bit out of the money and a couple months out. Then collect gains in a month or on a day VXX gets fucked."

2021-05-07 18:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Hello All,

I just wanted to say with a heavy heart, that I have outgrown WSB. Its not the community's fault, but rather me realizing my true potential as a trader and increasingly seeing that I have more in common with the successful greats that I read books about. There comes a time in everyone's life where they grow and must leave behind the things that once amused them. With that, its hard to give up a community that has provided me so much over the years, but its time to spread my wings and fly. 

Sincerly,
A Successful Trader

It’s overpriced LOL ok everyone is booking ABNB and they will be for the foreseeable future. Go try to book anytime for the summer - DD away. There is almost nothing. Meanwhile, the Hyatt’s of the world have sooooo much space. Next Friday! Or maybe tears. We’ll see."

I don’t take any DD seriously that talks about short squeeze plays any more. Laziest of the lazy DD"
2021-05-07 16:00:01,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that retail doesn't have enough money left to initiate a short squeeze in any more companies. It seems that most of our ape money is already tied up in GME, AMC, etc or we're holding bags of some other stocks. Since nobody's selling those stocks, it's unlikely that there will be more money on the sidelines left for other stocks.

It also seems that the hedge funds are just shorting the entire market in general given it's sky high valuation. Bill Ackman certainly did so publicly. That could be why we see higher short interest in a larger number of stocks. So far the recent short squeeze attempts have resulted in ape bag holders so I think it may be a little dangerous to jump in attempting to initiate a short squeeze."
2021-05-07 16:09:36,wallstreetbets,Fuck I wish I had the capitol to play this game. Put in 600 left with 300. Lol

2021-05-07 15:48:32,wallstreetbets,Gme is my only play
2021-05-07 18:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze? What the hell are you talking about. Low borrow fee, lot of shares to short, low shorted volume, already overvalued (30-50 fairvalue). This can go “to the moon” only when we will have shuttles to discharge wastes in the space."
2021-05-07 17:46:49,wallstreetbets,"The only real short squeeze is GME, everything else is a distraction."
2021-05-07 16:39:50,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt this be for next quarter or do they book these profits in first quarter of the year?
2021-05-07 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been booking places on AirBnB this year. 2/3 of the time, the host contacts me directly to arrange the booking outside the app to avoid the insane fees AirBnB charges. Both the host and renter come out ahead. The one time I booked through AirBnB the support was awful when I had an issue 

AirBnB is screwed"
2021-05-07 16:04:43,wallstreetbets,"The fucking worst.  It's the one edge I think we still have as hoteliers.  Granted, some of my competitors charge a 'resort fee' which is just as bad.  Or like $20 a night for parking.  My partners and I just laugh and laugh, knowing what bad blood that sows with customers.  Hidden fees can suck it."
2021-05-07 16:30:19,wallstreetbets,VRBO is a much better deal. No reason to still be using AirBNB.
2021-05-07 16:03:30,wallstreetbets,"I don't see them as mutually exclusive!  I was scared as shit when ABNB started taking off in the town where our motel is located.  Instead, business is thriving, and so is our ABNB listing."
2021-05-07 16:09:45,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yeah!  Fingers crossed it stays strong for you guys, and that there's no resurgence or sneaky variant.  So fucking done with this shit.  At least with vaccines I don't have to wear a mask all damn summer (only when entering a guest room or working the desk, rest of the property is outdoors)."

2021-05-07 16:01:11,wallstreetbets,What makes you say that?
2021-05-07 16:07:10,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis, can't argue with it, except for one thing:  I bag held TLRY and just got out, moved 1/2 my money to google, and the other 1/2 sidelined with aim to pick up GME.  I don't think bag holders are afraid to move money if they see a chance to recoup.  I dunno.  Personally, I'm looking for a short squeeze WITH a stock I don't mind bag holding if everything goes sideways.  GME is a perfect example, I wouldn't mind bag holding GME (I'm not though), and I don't mind bag holding AirBNB.  I always ask the same question: will this company be here and doing well in 10 years. With AirBNB I think yes."
2021-05-07 16:15:58,wallstreetbets,Rule 1:  Never sit down to a No-Limit game with a short stack.
2021-05-07 16:15:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-05-07 15:57:14,wallstreetbets,"No worries, I'm adding 10-20k GME to my position.  Literally hovering over the buy button.  May wait till Monday am.  But I just stumbled on this AirBNB potential short squeeze and thought it was interesting.  Particularly because I actually LIKE the company, as opposed to some of these other stocks we apes get suckered into solely for the squeeze."
2021-05-07 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Right. So earnings catch up to justify price or the mean will correct itself.

Or, now hear me out, the fed removes seven trillion from their balance sheet and pops the asset bubble it has created. That will get the market to take a 70% haircut and return to mean valuations."
2021-05-07 18:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. It's a tech stock, of course it has low book value. Don't pull a flipping Graham Dodd on us"
2021-05-07 16:22:47,wallstreetbets,Hmm makes sense. But it may not go to a high enough price to force shorts to cover. Just be careful.
2021-05-07 16:02:18,wallstreetbets,Hey I was doing the same thing. I ended up only getting 10 shares on the dip before market close.
2021-05-07 19:20:02,wallstreetbets,U shorting gme as well? This mind set is what got Melvin in trouble.
2021-05-07 19:27:01,wallstreetbets,"No. Learn my lesson on meme stocks after tsla (got destroyed) Plus much easier shorts. Dkng, dash, and riot I’m heavily short.

Melvin wasnt wrong just part of the game and he got caught. I have been as well."
2021-05-07 19:29:48,wallstreetbets,So there is bunch more factors than looking at book.

2021-05-07 16:23:01,wallstreetbets,i think this is part of old news finally confirmed by a press release.  With all the weekly volatility even if there's a jump in the price we can't say for sure this news was the reason.

2021-05-07 16:01:55,wallstreetbets,"About damn time someone recognizes VZIO. Good brand, undervalued. I bought in the week they IPOd and the volume has been low AF like no one has noticed it.  Not only are they #2 with TVs but also...

*multiple Gold Stevie Award for customer service 

*Gold Stevie Award for Company of the year 

*Digiday named them the best connected TV platform 

*composite rating was upgraded to 97 from 92

*RS rating was upgraded to 86 from 79

Also consider this....most bars and restaurants i go into have Vizio TVs all over the place. Hell, one I was eating lunch in probably had 20 TVs, all utilizing Smartcast alone. Theres also been rumors of the Smartcast taking $ from and competing with Roku. With stimmy checks and tax returns, im assuming their sales have increased as well. Im no market genius but I think VZIO is gonna be a beast. I like the stock and the company. Best ""value"" TV I've ever purchased. Nice soundbars as well. 

Bottom line, BUY VZIO. It been my best performer this shitty month."
2021-05-07 16:14:36,wallstreetbets,So buy day after earnings drop on 5/12. Got it 👍
2021-05-07 15:46:42,wallstreetbets,"I do like this stock as well, its held strong since the listing and is projected to go much higher in the next few years with its  Roku type of technology"
2021-05-07 15:43:07,wallstreetbets,"To be more specific on Vizio...

* \#2 TV market share in North America from 2018 to 2020 
* \#1 soundbar market share in North America from 2018 to 2020

To get a glimpse of Vizio's potential, look at a 5-year graph of Roku. $19 to $300+.

Sell hardware at low margins to get your ecosystem inside the home, then make huge profits by monetizing it through advertising/software platform. It's a tried and trued model....

I am extremely excited about this one."
2021-05-07 18:25:26,wallstreetbets,Own a Vizio tv and own shares; have an upvote.

2021-05-07 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,"I have a Vizio and SmartCast is that thing that makes me swear when I accidentally hit the button for it. I'm kinda thinking people have mostly bought TVs already, given they were locked up for a year. They're probably going to spend their money on going anywhere that isn't the same four walls they've been looking at since March before last. Add to that there's a semiconductor shortage going on that makes manufacturing sufficient amounts of any tech a dicey proposition... think I'm gonna pass on this one."
2021-05-07 16:10:41,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had known about it sooner....thankfully, someone I follow wrote about it on Twitter, and I got in about 3 weeks after the IPO. Wish I could have gotten in under $22...oh well."
2021-05-07 16:53:15,wallstreetbets,You’re a special kinda ape aren’t ya?
2021-05-07 16:21:39,wallstreetbets,wouldn't have worked for ROKU
2021-05-07 15:56:36,wallstreetbets,But Roku's competition vs Vizios was  much smaller. Just saying. But good stuff non the less. Will look into it.
2021-05-07 15:57:55,wallstreetbets,"VZIO TV shipments have continued to increase every year...2020 wasn't some sudden spike.

They are also investing a lot of money back into improving both the hardware and SmartCast.

>They're probably going to spend their money on going anywhere that isn't the same four walls they've been looking at since March before last.

Cord cutting sped up during pandemic. I think your analysis might be a bit overly simplistic....not to mention Vizio has barely been monetizing their SmartCast platform. Lots of low hanging fruit here..."
2021-05-07 16:15:33,wallstreetbets,"If the numbers continue to progress like expected, the difference between $22 or $25 cost basis will be minuscule 🚀"
2021-05-07 16:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Hell, I accidentally stumbled upon it digging for companies to buy in to. Its almost like they tried to keep it quiet or some shit bcus there was no chatter anywhere about it."
2021-05-07 16:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Well, I think there are two ways to look at it.

1. Vizio monetizing its current user base. Including a big chunk who are currently coming near the end of life of the older TVs that didn't have a smart OS. SmartCast as a whole is barely 3 years old, and Vizio has a lot of room to milk $ off of it.
2. Expanding market share. Vizio is known as the best price/value brand...and using some of the cash from the IPO, William Wang (founder) has stated that they plan to reinvest to better improve the hardware."
2021-05-07 17:32:01,wallstreetbets,"""Barely been monetizing"" why? Because they like leaving money on the table?"
2021-05-07 16:20:01,wallstreetbets,"It was because it was the last week of March, right?

Interest rate tantrum, tech tantrum, etc...not the best time to go IPO for a tech company lol. Not to mention everyone thinks of them as just another TV hardware business. Once the narrative shifts to the platform side like what dominates for Roku....look out above."
2021-05-07 17:18:06,wallstreetbets,"I own a vizio , about to throw it in the garbage.  But they so make decent TVs.  I mean it's not a bad play.  Definitely looks like a good long hold."

2021-05-07 18:46:37,wallstreetbets,"I used to follow Centerra (was into Thompson Creek before they bought them).

The KGC mine is why I got out.  Local government is straight up corrupt and always creating dubious charges.  I expected them to nationalize the mine with no compensation by this point, surprised to see they are still involved."
2021-05-07 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,"i doubled my position today, sold my entire barrick stake to do so. 

&#x200B;

Forward P/E is now 3.5 .... if some cash flows get effected from kumtor it will still be forward P/E <5 ..... the whole mine is not a write off obvously as the government has alot of money 530 million $ to be exact (\~10% of GDP) invested in CG shares they are not going to trash that if they have even some level of intelligence not to mention  if they want to cause the yesterday 730 million stake to today's 530 million $ USD stake in CG to continue to deteriorate... And have also the warrants go to 0 (KGC has 10 million warrants on CG exercisable at $10/share), as well as have industrial output and GDP collapse to tune of 25%+ and 13%+ they will agree on nothing... There is no way they can appoint a new manager and totally take ownership over without hampering all of that as well as having the value of their shares drop... There is no expertise internally in the country to be successful to mine and market this project abroad without damaging its value substantially. They are stupid but I don't think they are that stupid I think the most likely outcome is some more % will be given to KGC aka it won't be a total loss for CG... Not to mention if they don't agree on something no one will want to do partnerships or JVs in this country ever."
2021-05-07 15:07:33,wallstreetbets,i'd say its a high risk buy with a 500% upside from these levels even if a further 10-15% of the total future cash flows under the existing agreements are given over to KGC (the krygz state owned company that the mine operates under with centerra as the partner in KGC) CGAU $CGAU $[CG.TO](https://CG.TO) $CG

2021-05-07 15:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Man, I love GME. Made me a lot of money. But retards keep feeding Theta gang week over week. Burn-out is real. Soon all the YOLOs will be done. And institutional investors will pull out, leaving retail to hold the bags.   


GME is trading way above fundamentals. Short term, the stock may take a hit. But long term, this is a serious value play. Idiots stop buying FDs and feeding the market makers. This isn't a quick buck stock anymore, its a long term play."

Also, the lack of interest your post is getting is bullish. If this post took off and was heavily upvoted then you could be almost certain that ET would Exxon Valdez."

2021-05-07 17:43:46,wallstreetbets,"I have said it once, and I will say it again. Short selling is how market makers and hedge funds create a monopoly for themselves and the fortunate too-big-to-fail companies. They short small caps, buy large caps and keep it going. They drive the shares down to nothing, and when the company eventually has to do a share dilution to help release a new innovative product, the company has to sell 10x more shares to cover cost, and it bails out the short sellers. It’s fucking sad how criminally our financial system is run. There needs to be a ban on short selling in order to temporarily halt illegal manipulation and creation of monopolies."
2021-05-07 17:02:48,wallstreetbets,Bought in earlier today. Believer here
2021-05-07 16:05:57,wallstreetbets,"They will close their positions soon. Too many great things happening with INO for it to stay in the $6 range for long. Plus, the shorts already made their money on INO because most of them shorted back when it was much higher."

2021-05-07 14:49:49,wallstreetbets,They are heavily shorted because their PR sucks.

2021-05-07 17:47:15,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know, but what I know is heavily short selling a company trying to treat Brain Cancer is a dick move

2021-05-07 19:36:03,wallstreetbets,"> The purpose of the financial system is supposed to be allocating capital to good projects, not forcing them down to oblivion

That’s not how it works. That’s not how any of this works."
2021-05-07 18:10:47,wallstreetbets,"Nothing I can do about the downvotes. Inovio have a very good products being developed in their pipeline but they are not giving a lot of details about them. Poor communications towards the retail investors that's why shorts are making a killing because of it.  

Remember the controvery about the 3 hour vaccine development that Kim said last year. The company did not even followed up or explained their side when Citron came out with a hit piece and shorted them. Like I said, their PR sucks."
2021-05-07 18:07:35,wallstreetbets,"I disagree on the fundamentals part of it as someone who regularly invests in biotech. But, that’s just my opinion. I read the DD, but OP failed to mention the many other glioblastoma drugs undergoing clinical trials that are much further along."
2021-05-07 18:09:07,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good point then, any particular thing on top of your head I might want to check out ?"
2021-05-07 18:12:07,wallstreetbets,"INO has personally been on my shitlist for a while now so if you see something I don't then I could be wrong lol. 

I'm happy to give some recommendations! Right now I'm mainly only interested in 3 things: IP companies, drugs for obesity, and drugs for cosmetics. I can give you a breakdown of either."
2021-05-07 18:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah which companies are you looking at for obesity thing ? I’m not a lot into health companies usually, might go more in depth from now

Also what indicators do you recommend looking at first in this industry ?"
2021-05-07 18:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Have you looked at geovax (govx)? I stay out of pharma, but Covid research led me to it and its IP looks very attractive though I’ve only done a cursory look and haven’t done dd yet."
2021-05-07 18:26:41,wallstreetbets,"NVO is pushing a drug called semaglutide through phase III right now that is by far the safest biotech play I've seen in along time. The drug is already approved for type II diabetes so there's little doubt that it wont pass. [Patients lost about 15% of fat](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183). What makes this really interesting is NVO is already one of the largest producers of insulin so they already have both the scale, and infrastructure to produce it profitably. 

The risks of it is some patients experienced GI issues during trials so they discontinued the trial, and they didn't have a wide range of demographics which the FDA likes to see. I don't see these as huge risks since most doctors will probably prescribe something along with it to handle the GI issues, and the original FDA study for type II diabetes did include a wide range of demographics. 

Don't expect huge swings as it's a $100B company. But, it's already profitable so it's less risky. It will get approved, and make money. It's just hard to predict when, or how much."
2021-05-07 18:28:27,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t, but I can add it to my list! Even though I’m a software dev biotech is my background so doing research into companies is how I scratch my nerd itch."
2021-05-07 18:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Check it out and let me know what you think, I’ve only started to look into the technology but if it’s not a fraud it’s an easy long-term at least five bagger."
2021-05-07 18:42:03,wallstreetbets,I'm a bit slow with research because I tend to go overkill with it. Could you possibly give me just a quick elevator pitch on why you think it's a 5 bagger? Not being a dick. I just typically do 40-120 hours of research into a biotech company before making a play. My interest is piqued.
2021-05-07 19:01:16,wallstreetbets,"Overkill is necessary which is why I keep qualifying my statements. Geovax has an IP over modified vaccinia Ankara virus like particles (mva-vlp) which is to say they have a great vector and a method to ready the immune system for battle. They’re  working on hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Lassa while headway on HIV is in the works too. Also, they have DoD and NIH funding. Their pipeline and seals of approval are exciting but don’t take my word because I haven’t done research yet and I filed it away as a potential multibagger."
2021-05-07 14:37:56,wallstreetbets,Don't worry.  There are no capital gains here.
2021-05-07 14:44:08,wallstreetbets,I’m a CPA- your original purchase attributes (purchase date & cost basis) would apply to your newly received shares. No need to hold another year.
2021-05-07 14:38:29,wallstreetbets,"I too would like to know, I know imma get fucked next year with taxes tbh"
2021-05-07 14:37:45,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about the Tilray/Aphria merger?
2021-05-07 14:40:09,wallstreetbets,"That’s a really good question… I could be wrong but my understanding is that because of the Merger and them giving you the agreed upon shares in exchange for your holdings, that your purchase date of the original holdings should be the date that sticks. 

Maybe check one of the tax/accounting subreddits and see if someone can definitively answer it though."
2021-05-07 14:41:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m very sure that you get grandfathered in; in all aspects of the matter.

My biggest question is whether or not dollar cost averaging changes the date of security buy in. 

But I’m sure you’re fine. And if you were to be audited you’d be fine. Even if it was a problem the IRS would understand it and you’d just have to pay the tax."
2021-05-07 14:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Depends on whether the merger was a taxable event or not. If taxable then you had a sale and purchase of a new stock, if not-taxable then your original date of purchase is how you figure your holding period. The merger materials should have mentioned whether it is taxable or not. Also if it happened during 2020 your brokerage 1099 for 2020 should have the the gain (or loss) reported if it was taxable."
2021-05-07 17:56:25,wallstreetbets,Wait..... you guys are making money?
2021-05-07 14:56:22,wallstreetbets,Pay your taxes fag
2021-05-07 14:39:04,wallstreetbets,ask your accountant. also looks like you don't know the difference between capital gain vs short term.
2021-05-07 14:43:06,wallstreetbets,Your book cost (your money) doesn't change but gets redistributed over your new shares. Ideally most brokerages do this for you but it can take a week or so. So you should see a new avg. Cost per share. Capital gains would then be attributed apon sale of those new shares.
2021-05-07 15:01:04,wallstreetbets,what capital? im on infinite margin.
2021-05-07 15:20:07,wallstreetbets,">I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes.

If you wait a year, then you pay the long term  capital gains tax.

If you do not wait a year, you pay your standard income tax rate for the capital gains."
2021-05-07 14:43:02,wallstreetbets,"This. Yup, only capital loss here"
2021-05-07 14:50:30,wallstreetbets,Hahahahaha
2021-05-07 14:45:50,wallstreetbets,"Damn it, Rob.  

We're trying to run a casino here.  

Actually being helpful just encourages this type of behaviour."
2021-05-07 14:59:05,wallstreetbets,Only if the merger was a non-taxable event. Some mergers are taxable and it is treated as if you sold the old stock and bought new shares.
2021-05-07 15:23:06,wallstreetbets,"Wish I could get fucked by taxes, sex with taxes would be welcome for this capital loser."
2021-05-07 14:43:05,wallstreetbets,"No, Devon Energy"
2021-05-07 14:47:10,wallstreetbets,"I will thanks. At least I hope that is the answer because on Robinhood it says my gains are the entire value of the stock. So according to them I had zero equity in the stock, then it went up to $3500 so I don't want to pay ALL that in taxes when I actually only made a profit of $1750. Since the original. amount I invested was about $1750"
2021-05-07 14:49:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes that too, because according to Robinhood my profit is the entire value of my shares as I had zero shares at first, then was given $3500 worth when the merger happened. So my profit in app says $3500 when the original investment was $1750 in the stock that was merged. So my profit was $1750, not $3500."
2021-05-07 14:42:32,wallstreetbets,🤣. Doesn’t even also know between one and all Dr. Feltcher
2021-05-07 14:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Yes I do,  that is specifically why I was asking the question about the yearlong hold for long term gains."
2021-05-07 15:29:43,wallstreetbets,It’s an all stock deal!
2021-05-07 14:53:28,wallstreetbets,Nice buy
2021-05-07 15:08:51,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood probably doesn’t have a better way to show your cost for the new shares on your portfolio holdings page, but they should provide you with an actual account statement that will reconcile your cost basis and time in that investment. Check your statement. It may take a little time to reflect this, but by year’s end it should be clear."
2021-05-07 14:59:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I haven’t found a full explanation but you may be on the hook for some of gains, but that shouldn’t apply to the cost basis. The third paragraph in the link mentions a “tax bomb” that can occur during an all stock merger. 

https://www.aefonline.org/blog/defuse-capital-gains-tax-bomb"
2021-05-07 15:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Edit your post and also ask about when is a security anniversary when you’ve been buying shares continuously for a year. 

My guess is the amount of shares you purchased that day of one year and one day ago. 

I think I answered my own question maybe though lol"
2021-05-07 14:45:49,wallstreetbets,why would you avoid CAPITAL GAIN over SHORT TERM?????
2021-05-07 14:55:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, got it when it was  WPX energy. Basically doubled my money."
2021-05-07 15:40:34,wallstreetbets,"r/tax answered this for me. 

So the year period is from the very first date of purchase. Plus the way Robinhood posts my gains is incorrect. It's the new value minus the original value. Like how a sane person would calculate it. 

But as far as your question, I'm pretty sure that it goes from the last day you purchased shares, for those specific shares. So if you bought 100 and then 100 more 6 months later, then sold all 200 of them 6 months after that . You'd pay full taxes on half of them, and 0% on the original half

But I'm not a tax expert. This is not investment or tax advice."
2021-05-07 14:54:06,wallstreetbets,Not sure what you think I don't understand. I completely understand that to avoid capital gains you have to hold a stock for a year and be under a certain tax bracket.
2021-05-07 15:51:02,wallstreetbets,I’m sure that’s how it works. It makes sense
2021-05-07 15:14:56,wallstreetbets,"You don't avoid capital gains - you get your gain classified as long-term capital gain instead of short-term capital gain, which has different tax implications. You're not dodging taxes altogether. 

(not tax advice)"
2021-05-07 15:21:35,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-07 15:20:56,wallstreetbets,It's the same though. It's a 0% tax rate for me on long term gains as I am in the correct tax bracket.
2021-05-07 15:24:27,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, since I make under $40,000 a year, and the gains from the sale wouldn't push me over 40k, the capital gains is taxed at 0%.

Is this incorrect?"
2021-05-07 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I could have worded it better, but it seems like we're talking about semantics. 

But from my understanding since I make under 40k a year, and the gains from the sale wouldn't put me over 40k, then the gains is taxed at 0%

Am I wrong about this?"
2021-05-07 15:34:41,wallstreetbets,"I see what you're saying. I believe you are correct on that. That would totally change the way I invest (for better or worse). I have to pay 15% capital gains long term, and 30% short term. The rebalancing is such a bitch that I mainly have to stick to ETFs. At 0% I'd own more individual stocks."
2021-05-07 15:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the increase in tax brackets on salary is a bitch. I had to deal with that a few years ago. Sometimes it's actually better to make less money. 

 From my understanding you've got to be careful about selling only a certain amount too. So you don't get pushed up in the tax bracket 
That's basically what I did last year, single stocks, hoping for easy gains, and it worked. I 5x'ed my original investment. Now I'm trying to stay in the same bracket by staggering what I sell. Because if I sold all of it I'd get fucked hard. 

Lol, at least I think that's how it works. I should probably just meet with a financial planner instead of getting advice from Reddit huh? Lol"
2021-05-07 16:20:16,wallstreetbets,"No that's not how it works, tax brackets are progressive.  If you go $1 into the next tax bracket only that $1 is taxed at that new bracket's rate.  Think of it like a series of buckets that spill into each other - once the 0% bracket is filled up the rest spills into the 10% bracket, and once that's filled up the extra spills into the 12% bracket and so on.  You only pay the tax rate on the income within each bucket.  So if you just barely go into the next bracket, you only pay that new tax rate on the portion that spilled into that bracket, and the rest of the money gets taxed according to whatever bracket it is in.

Capital gains have different rates and brackets than normal income, but you can think of capital gains as ""floating"" to the top of your income.  So if you earn $40k at a job, and have $25k in long term capital gains, the $40k is at the bottom and gets taxed according to regular tax brackets.  The next $25k from capital gains ""floats"" on top of that and you pay taxes on that portion based on the long term capital gains rates.  So $40k is taxed according to regular tax brackets, and THEN the next $25k is taxed according to capital gains brackets."

2021-05-07 18:36:37,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty sure the clearing house is on the hook for any responsible bankrupt parties that trade under them. After that I believe there is an insurance allotment(not sure how much). Last, there are always the tax payers because we all know the low-middle class earners will always be the ones stuck with the burden in case anything ever goes belly up(too big to fail was a horrible idea and only empowered them long term)."
2021-05-07 14:12:07,wallstreetbets,"As mentioned previously, you don't appear to know what you are talking about or are intentionally lying.

If I get margin called and go bankrupt then it is on the broker to cover, that is a brokers responsibility and is why they are generally very careful. You loosing money means someone else gaining it. The entire system is based on the promise of you being able to pay.

All the rest about borrowed shares is BS as well, but have told you that in your comment on the other thread due to dilution of the tradeable float.

You aren't a cat, most probably a weasel."
2021-05-07 13:51:53,wallstreetbets,Meow
2021-05-07 14:10:51,wallstreetbets,"have you seen the option spreads on GME???  There is no volume so its pointless. its a waiting game

&#x200B;

Reasons for the short attacks on GME,  to scare people of out of their shares. The media is doing the best they can but nobody isn't going to listen to Cramer and goonies.

&#x200B;

good job guys, keep it up and we will end this games as winners. this is chess not checkers"

2021-05-07 14:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Again, borrowed shares are borrowed from YOUR broker. The broker has no one they owe those shares too. Brokers own their own pool of shares, so do market makers. If a broker does not own a position in a stock you want to short. YOU have to get an account with another broker who does. Nothing i said was a lie, you just don't like what it means for your understanding and strategy. Get your emotions out of the market guy.

If the person who shorted stock goes bankrupt.. how are you getting your money from him? Be honest with that question guy."

2021-05-07 13:51:10,wallstreetbets,I like this one and have some shares here but I think CURALEAF is the cannibis stock to have they are the only company with licenses in every state it's legal in and they just bought the largest cannibis producer in Europe so I believe they are the largest legal cannibis provider in the world
2021-05-07 13:57:19,wallstreetbets,"""Continuously buying companies"" is only good if you get good value and/or develop synergies. A large majority of acquisitions in this sector have been in the bad to terrible range, way overpaying for assets that will generate very little fcf ."

2021-05-07 14:09:41,wallstreetbets,"This isn't really DD, just anecdotal evidence from a friendly neighbourhood pothead.  All of the currently available legal weed is mostly garbage (way too dry, not very strong, poorly grown, poorly trimmed, you can taste the pesticides, has fucking seeds, not the weight that's advertised, you can hear the leftover butane popping in their shatter, etc).  When I can get weed (and concentrates and edibles) for less than half the price that's also like twice as good from an illegal street dealer,  I'm going to do that.

The standards almost every one of these companies have for their products wouldnt even been seen as acceptable in the eyes of 16 year old highschool weed dealers lol.  They spend more time on their packaging than the actual product.  It's just all mass produced, poorly grown/processed absolute fucking garbage, but as said, way more expensive (at least here in Canada).  

Until I see an improvement in the products sold, I won't be buying any major weed stocks, but if these guys can actually produce a quality product at reasonable prices, they could really compete, because ya, current standards are abysmally low.

Edit; the drinks at dispensaries are pretty tasty and reasonably priced though, I'm a huge fan of those"

Grow Generation I like a little bit and IIPR I like what they do too

And PLTR has done nothing but lose money for me all month I thought they were gonna break 21 this morning but they are taking a shit again now heading back down to probably 19.50 or below hopefully earnings on Tuesday will give some kind of bump"

But that's why their are lots of companies and everyone has their preference but for me aging the long game with this and especially when the states that just legalized for for recreational start selling commercially and these companies can finally start trading on NASDAQ they will be the Amazon and Google to Canada's Yahoo and AOL I mean Tilray and Aphria"

Where would you recommend I go to learn the basics??  I have about $3000 and three months to turn things around for my family, and save our house from being sold at auction.  I’m disabled, my 70 yr old husband (a brilliant Engineering Program Manager, who can’t even get an interview let alone a job due to ageism), and our disabled daughter are trying to save our home of 33 years.  A YOLO of $3000 is the miracle we need, I just don’t know where to invest (or how to invest).

Also, do you know if DFV (“Roaring Kitty”) teaches classes, or if he ever shares his investment picks?  I’m not trying to get super-wealthy (although it would be a welcome change XD), I’m just trying to avoid homelessness.

If you read it that way, and also disagree with it being so simple, I wonder why you choose to read it that way.

I took this as a ""I made a calculated risky bet and it paid off, check out my gains, ain't it fun when you win, be careful"".

You seem to take it as ""I'm rich and you would be too if you were as smart as me. Just do your dd and you'll be rich too, losers"". The you rail against that take for being preposterous. But you don't consider it so absurd as to think maybe you misread it.

Idk, I don't see it that way, but then again, I'm up 6 digits in Amazon because I'm a genius like OP."

You should know most people here are losing money on bad gambles."

2021-05-07 13:57:41,wallstreetbets,Or how about this...don’t be a idiot and yolo your last 3k into options to save your fucking family? How much equity do you have in your home? You should sell that bish ASAP
2021-05-07 18:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Learn about stocks, very basic TA (support & resistance, most of the other things are just astrology), what usually happens at specific events (earnings, mergers, buyouts... for example if a company A acquires another company B, the share price of A *usually* dips even if the acquisition is perceived as good), basic understanding of monetary policy and how interest rates impact stocks (especially growth stocks), how to read a balance sheet at least superficially, then options (calls/puts, implied volatility, time-value of an option, leverage effect). All of this can be learned for free on Investopedia. Also check out Khanacademy (also free).

Next, start paper-trading (ie trade with fake money, in TradingView for example you can do that) for a few months until you get the hang of it, and only then maybe start playing \*\*responsibly\*\* with real money.

Your horizon of three months is unrealistic and $3000 is too much when you have too many things at stake and can't afford to lose money in a senseless way (it's not rare to lose the entire investment on a bad options play here, I lost more than $10k last year on stupid trades). Will you be able to face your family and tell them you just lost $3k on a single YOLO? I personally was embarrassed when it was >$10k despite it not being a crushing loss for me. From what you're describing, this sub is NOT for you. Also you might be approached by private Discords claiming to offer tutorships (you might have already gotten a few DMs), just avoid them, they prey on weakness."

2021-05-07 13:01:53,wallstreetbets,where do you imagine all this inflow is going to?

2021-05-07 12:21:57,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-05-07 13:05:58,wallstreetbets,"That is what I am trying to understand. The definition of inflow/outflow is as follows:

 ""Flows can be divided into inflows—flows that add to stocks—and outflows—flows that deplete the stocks. The difference between inflows and outflows is called net inflows. The figure illustrates the relationship between stocks and flows. If the inflow is greater than the outflow or net inflow is positive, the stock will be rising; if the inflow is less than the outflow, net inflow is negative, and the stock will be falling""

This is why I cannot understand how the stock is falling after 5 straight days of a much higher inflow. I am hoping someone with a much better understanding can help me better understand what other variables could cause such a thing."
2021-05-07 13:38:40,wallstreetbets,I will do just that based on the amazing DD of you're request. At least you didn't post a bunch of rocket ships ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)

2021-05-07 12:55:07,wallstreetbets,"Are buybacks going to continue their popularity if capital gains taxes go up or would we start to see more dividend increases instead? If cap gains rates are the same or higher than ordinary income rates, the only advantages to buybacks over dividends would be the ability of investors to time when they they take gains. Companies might say they are buying in at low prices but every company always thinks their stock is undervalued."
2021-05-07 13:38:08,wallstreetbets,I'd look for that to happen (if it happens) after quarterly profit sharing.
2021-05-07 17:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Have no idea where banks are higher than pre Covid with interest rates stuck at nothing. Yes, releasing reserves is a tailwind. On the other side there’s no interest rates, and the continued pressure they’re all seeing on capital ratios due to the system being absolutely flooded with deposits. This will lead to either dilutive issuances of preferred stock, or less capital returned to shareholders via buybacks / dividends. But whatever they’re all acting like growth stocks so fuck me."

2021-05-07 19:16:23,wallstreetbets,Bank stocks are probably the worse investment in this moment in time the amount of bad debt in the market will make 08 look like Disneyland. There’s been low rates for over 10 years for a reason to trap people in debt by over borrowing. With inflation set to heat up watch when the rates need to rise. A lot of people on tracker mortgages who haven’t locked in a longer term fixed rate will cause a fire sale in the housing market.
2021-05-07 13:21:31,wallstreetbets,"I'll bite!!!!  Buffet recognizes that interest rates are at historic lows, putting extreme pressure on Banks' ability to make money organically by lending.  The release of loan reserves are one-time offsets to this and will most likely not offset the loss in net operating income and earnings from the low rates."
2021-05-07 15:54:39,wallstreetbets,Because the top is in and everybody thinks these buybacks are healthy. Heck no. They are buying back so much because THE FED AND ITS MEMBERS OWN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BANK STOCK. They will all individually cash out and the banks themselves will be stuck holding the bag of losses. Happens every time
2021-05-07 13:17:35,wallstreetbets,"although this is WSB, i will entertain an intelligent question. the short and simple answer is, we do not know until we see the bill. Currently, qualified dividends are treated the same as long term capital gains and the biden administration has not mentioned if the long term capital gains tax increase will also affect qualified dividends in the same manner.

&#x200B;

you have to remember, executive pay is all based around share buybacks, where they hold for a year until they can sell for long term capital gains, and its quite easy to get around paying state taxes on capital gains as well (if your rich and have a primary residence in multiple states)"
2021-05-07 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,Well said 👏👏👏
2021-05-07 15:05:53,wallstreetbets,"So this means buy bank stocks? Forgive me. Not enough brain wrinkle.

I read a DD on here recently that was comparing Buffet’s move to correlate with Michael Burry’s sentiment that a new economic collapse was coming.

Could this be impacted by failures in the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market?

2021-05-07 15:21:04,wallstreetbets,"I personally stay away from Bank stocks, especially since the 2010 Recession they're kissing-cousins to a public utility (limiting their investment potential).  Even though the KBW Bank Index has beat the S&P and NASDAQ recently, it's in Overbought territory and due for a correction.

Also, even if the Fed raises interest rates to combat inflation, people aren't going to be borrowing money since they'll be focused on $5/gal gasoline and $10/Tendie Chicken.

If you believe a shitstorm is coming, look to precious metals (physical-backed, not ETFs or commodities investment vehicles) .  They're the traditional inflation-hedge and shelter against risky assets during economic downturns."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CD Project and the CyberDunk 2020 - and the rebound Put your bananas aside, I have something for your handful of brain cells.

Let's quickly recap the Cyberdunk 2077 release:

* Awesome teaser trailer 8 years ago.
* Insane hype train accelerating over the years:
   * I mean just look at videos like this from 2019: [WhatAPromoVidSoCoolDisGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2KozvzdKr4)
   * Keanu Reeves
* Stock hits $128
* Release postponed to December
* Stock drops to $88, rises again to $119
* Release:
   * Bugs bugs bugs
   * Bad graphics on old consoles
   * Big shitstorm
* Stock dips and dips and dips and dips… Now around $42

**Ok just sounds like they totally botched it. But did they?**

1. Bugs everywhere..  
Does anyone remember the Witcher 3 release though? It was also pretty buggy. Ok, maybe not AS much. But still, CD Project has a history of releasing buggy games and fixing the issues later on. Witcher 3 is now one if not the most iconic RPG games. Search [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/36ewbt/official_bug_thread/?sort=confidence), browse [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpAGtIdANK4) or whatever to get an impression of the bugs.  
For Cyberpunk they have [plans for fixing and free DLCs already released](https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-our-commitment-to-quality/). Given their history, I trust CD Project to fix the game and make it one of the best.
2. [13.7 mio. copies sold in 2020](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/management-board-report-on-the-activities-of-the-cd-projekt-group-and-cdc-projekt-sa-in-2020.pdf) (65)  
This is the number of copies sold in 20 days. To put this into some relation, CD Project sold [20 mio. of Witcher 1, 2 and 3 together](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2016/03/FY_2015_results_presentation.pdf) (4) in the whole year of 2015, the release year of Witcher 3 (which was released in may, so 8 months of selling).  
Also worth mentioning: [Only with the pre-orders](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/current-report-no-652020.pdf)  of digital distribution channels (\~8 mio.) CD Project covered all  development cost of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as all marketing and  promotional cost until the end of 2020. So the revenue on more than 5  mio. is solely going into the pockets.  
So overall some damn good  numbers. And there is still potential. Consider that some degenerates  like myself didn't buy the game yet but probably will, when most bugs  are fixed.  
CD Project also wants to massively extend the Cyberpunk universe.
3. The refunding campaign  
Following up to the disastrous release, CD Project started a refund campaign for Cyberpunk 2077.  
I couldn't find the number in official documents, but [some sources](https://www.ign.com/articles/cdpr-issued-some-30000-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) say 30 000 copies were refunded.  
This is 0.2% of the sold copies!! Doesn't look like a bad game to me. I wouldn't be worried if the refund numbers would exceed 1% or more, and even that is so far from where we are. Sounds a lot for shitstorm and media cryout. 
4. The hack  
[CD Project got hacked](https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660)! And the attackers stole the source code from Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk!  
Ok, cool down. Pick up your banana again. CD Project gives a shit about  copy protection. None of their games have any, because they believe that  people who love the games will pay for them. Their Backups weren't compromised. So again just negative media coverage.
5. The Witcher  
Is not suddenly gone. The games sell and there is more in the pipeline. A  next gen version of Witcher 3 and an AR mobile game (hunting monsters in  the real world instead of throwing Pokeballs at them) are announced  this year.  
You probably also watched the Netflix series in your  basement, missing some action of your wife and her boyfriend upstairs.  It was the most successful series on Netflix until then. CD Project has  all rights on Witcher. So guess what's gonna happen when the second  series is released in August.
6. The financials  
I don't want to overload your brain cells. Just let me tell you the company is rock solid. Liabilities could be paid right away. Net margin of >30% since 2015.  
If you think you can handle more numbers, check the [report](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/consolidated-financial-statement-of-the-cd-projekt-group-for-2020.pdf).
7. Conclusion  
It seems to me that the sky high anticipation paired with the disappointment was the best food for the media, journalists, click baiters and everyone who could profit from a dramatic coverage. And boy they did. If it was such a  bad game, more people would have used the refund campaign, so it was probably trashtalked it into oblivion.  
That's why the numbers speak a different language. Cyberpunk seems to be a success and the Witcher was always gonna continue.  
So looking at the whole picture, what has happened, what is going on and what is coming, I can only see this stock going upward.
8. Positions  
Holding 30 @ $87.08, 30 @ 74.49, and now bought another 30 @ $47.27

**TL;DR**

* Cyberpunk was financially a huge success, despite the bad media coverage.
* The Witcher will fuel the rockets with a Witcher 3 overhaul, a mobile AR game release and the second season on Netflix.
* Solid financials.
* Ticker is OTGLF
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you find anything about the short interest, that would be something interesting to look at, too. I just found [this](https://otcshortreport.com/company/OTGLF/), stating that the daily percentage of volume shorted in April in some  days was <2% and some days >96%. Can anyone with a brain help me?

Do your own DD and don't just buy stonks because some retard says it's good when he made only losses with it.  
Numbers converted to USD from EUR or PLN."
2021-05-07 13:25:28,wallstreetbets,"I've heard rumors that during the Witcher 3 times, they had a ton of obviously incredibly talented employees, but whom were being underpaid because they were in Poland. After Witcher 3 came out, they didn't get raises so most of them left for other studios. CP2077 didn't really start until after Witcher 3 completed. 

Hard to imagine they get back to that level of competency without paying higher salaries and reducing profit. And they've burned all their hype or goodwill with CP2077, which is a truly broken clunky game at the core. No amount of bug fixes will help. Witcher 3 was a little buggy at first but the actual game was incredible and deep from the start."

2021-05-07 16:25:30,wallstreetbets,"you can’t be fucking serious man, the cyberpunk fiasco was one of the worst launches in history of gaming. i love how you spin this and cherry pick but here’s the reality not lalaland that you live in :

• Cyberpunk is not back on consoles even half a year after release, that’s how bad it is

• the game is still full of bugs, 5 patches later and it’s still a buggy mess

• Promoted features that don't even exist in the game, straight up lying to customers faces. Demo gameplay rigged with features that don't even exist in the final game

• DLC not even announced

• the game only sold because of the hype, go to Steam and check the numbers, nobody plays Cyberpunk anymore

• top dogs at CDPR rewarding themselves with 5 mil $ bonuses while employees work their asses off 15 hours a day + overtime

• worst management ever putting all the resources in marketing instead of R&D, forcing developers to release unfinished garbage

• top employees who made Witcher great left the company

• lawsuites from stakeholders or did you forgot about those ?

Do you work at CDPR in marketing cause you’re hyping this stock like they hyped Cyberpunk last year."

2021-05-07 17:02:14,wallstreetbets,"I was honestly surprised at how little attention AC:Valhalla received regarding the bugs it was full of. There were easily 20 game breaking bugs when it was released, at least a dozen ongoing bugs that were discovered within the first month of its release, and every update creates new issues. I think CyberPunk just caught the media's attention and CD Projekt experienced an overreaction with its stock.


Edit: after reading some other replies, the stock may actually be at appropriate levels lol. I still stand by my feelings towards Valhalla, though."
2021-05-07 19:43:51,wallstreetbets,It's true. I work in the same industry and even the best jobs there pay less than half of what they pay in other parts of the world.

2021-05-07 11:50:30,wallstreetbets,I mean you've got to be close to profit? Unless you bought at the peak peak. Just average down. Even big money is bullish on it
2021-05-07 11:59:47,wallstreetbets,"I really like nokia because of its new smartphone that can compete with the iphone and galaxy but costs 400 bucks. They also have 2 decades of RD invested into 5g video technology and its paid them dividends. Companies like verizon are paying them royalties for the right to use their 5g video tech in their own equipment. Nokia has cash on hand for operations to the tune of years and a very profitable model currently with great growth potential for the future.

In all Nokia is absolutely undervalued in my amateur opinion. 7 bucks is a more appropriate 2021 price target in my opinion, but the big banks are being cautious, probably to keep hype from blowing it up too soon before they secure their own positions in the stock. (Totally speculating on that last part though)🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-07 11:31:45,wallstreetbets,"in a dd discussion no one here is an expert untill proofs. DOn't want to be rude, but 284 is pretty unrealistic in a medium period...

2021-05-07 15:36:13,wallstreetbets,"i just read the wiki from hmd global. 

foxxconn only build the iphones.

hmd global build, develope and design them under the label Nokia."
2021-05-07 15:52:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah i see now that they have an agreement from 2016 for the rights to produce them for the next 10 years. Should nokia chose in 2026 to renew this it will likely be a lucrative deal to both companies. Perhaps i need to take a position if HMD if they are public.
2021-05-07 18:58:53,wallstreetbets,And we have stock with the name nokia on it. Yw
2021-05-07 16:05:54,wallstreetbets,the smartphone market is not as lucrative as you think. so Nok should focus on 5g .

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is this too good to be true or am I missing something? I’m pretty new to options but noticed that JNJ 2023 140 strike price calls are trading at $31.40 which puts the break even at $171.40. The current price is $168.52 meaning it would have to increase $2.88 to hit that break even point. That’s less than a 2% gain needed with 2 years still left on the call. Am I missing something here?

Disclosure: I just bought a call because it seems too good to pass up. Please correct me if I’m an idiot but I look at this as free leverage"
2021-05-07 11:13:34,wallstreetbets,You’re giving up the dividends.
2021-05-07 11:27:06,wallstreetbets,You can sell PMCC to more than make up for the dividends!
2021-05-07 11:30:07,wallstreetbets,You’re not “getting 100 shares” you’re gambling on a contract that will allow you to buy 100 shares at the strike price and your contract will lose value over time if the current stock price does not increase. Options can make you a ton of money but obviously with high reward comes super high risk as in if your call is below the strike price or your put is above the strike price at expiration then your option will expire worthless and you lose everything you bought
2021-05-07 12:19:08,wallstreetbets,"it was a lot better about a week ago, a strike lower and june expiry."
2021-05-07 11:31:45,wallstreetbets,What’s the bid-ask spread?
2021-05-07 13:08:34,wallstreetbets,Stock market will likely have crashed by then and it will not have fully recovered yet. Maybe.
2021-05-07 14:54:46,wallstreetbets,yea....  if this bull market continues...  Which it isn't.  So as long as the stock goes up or stays flat you'll break even or make a little dough but if it goes down your going to lose money.  Not worth it IMO.
2021-05-07 11:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Fair point! it is 2.42% which is a nice dividend but I look at this as I get 100 shares (for 2 years) for $3,140 versus $16,852 and I’m bullish on JNJ. 

Edit: I suppose the dividend is guaranteed money where mine is far from it"
2021-05-07 11:28:50,wallstreetbets,What is pmcc?
2021-05-07 11:43:48,wallstreetbets,"This person is just looking at it from a different perspective than you.

The contract gives you the right to purchase the shares, so in essence if the stock moves the way you want it to you can reap the benefits. For all intents and purposes you own the stock. If you want to realize your gains or buy the stock, you can because someone has committed those shares to you.

Also for a two year option you are actually protect against a crash. If that stock falls 35% and you own 100 shares you lose roughly 5k. If you own the option you lose 3k. Yes you can hold it for longer, but not every one has 10-20 years to wait for gains, so the option actually provides short term protections.

Its all gambling, so tacking that word on for your argument just makes it sound worse than it really is."
2021-05-07 11:39:19,wallstreetbets,Completely understand this which is why I don’t buy near terms calls. Only leaps im bullish on the stock on.
2021-05-07 11:39:56,wallstreetbets,$31.80 vs $32.30
2021-05-07 15:20:44,wallstreetbets,Loser for real lol^
2021-05-07 11:34:21,wallstreetbets,They might pay so many dividends that the price is the same as now to make sure you don't get it from that call.
2021-05-07 16:14:27,wallstreetbets,"A poor man's covered call is essentially buying a long term call and then selling shorter term calls that are more out of the money against it. 

I really like [this video](https://youtu.be/Q8A0WXbXXgA) from Kamikaze Cash. He lays it out very straightforward.



(If links not allowed I apologize and will remove this comment.)"
2021-05-07 11:42:13,wallstreetbets,Just looked it up. It’s poor mans covered call. Actually looks pretty viable here! Good tip! But I’ll likely do more research on pmcc first
2021-05-07 12:17:06,wallstreetbets,"I see what you’re saying. I used the word gambling because theoretically if you hold that option and it doesn’t go the way you want you can get burnt but if you own the shares outright you don’t lose unless you sell, the gains and losses are all unrealized until that sell button is hit. But yeah a 2 year call for a stock to move up less than 3% is a pretty safe bet if OPs dd looks good I don’t know anything about the company I was just more so explaining that this isn’t free money and there’s still serious risks to consider. I wasn’t arguing against anything at all this seems like a pretty safe play"
2021-05-07 11:35:27,wallstreetbets,The price of the stock usually drops the amount of dividend when it's paid.
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TA from an unbiased perspective on the game you are playing. First off, shout out to that ape that made that meme of Trump saying millions and billions over and over again, that was funny as heck. But this is not financial advice nor am I am financial advisor this is simply my personal opinion.

But, what I will say is that I analyze data for a living, I monitor patterns and trends, and heck I even taught math. Empirical knowledge is the best knowledge because it is backed by evidence and observation whether that is done personally or gathered through research, and that my friends is how I like to make my decisions as you should too.

In this TA (I am even hesitant to do a TA on $GME due to volatility) but I promise to be as objective as possible. I enjoy finding trades, and I love to find solid entry points, but what I have found out over the years is that it is nearly impossible to perfectly time the bottom or the top which is why certain indicators are essential is recognizing a solid set up.

To make this super easy to understand I have narrowed down this T.A. to 4, yes only 4 indicators for you. RSI (relative strength index), Bollinger Bands, EMA (exponential moving average), and OBV (on balance volume).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alvmfjxvqpx61.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=48483d32c481c5090b1f35fd3c17a324d49b1646

RSI: Quick note - RSI under 30 is over sold, RSI over 70 is over bought which is why you will see strong upward advances (traders like to load up at low levels such as 30 and below and stock goes up) or corrections (traders like to sell off at these levels 70 and above and stock goes down). Bullish zone is between 40 to 85+ (stock will gradually increase).

$GME: The diagram above illustrates the Day chart. The RSI has never dropped below 40 since JULY 2020! The 40 range has developed a solid support which is why I think the stock will continue to rise. Regardless of every dip the stock experienced it has bounced off of the support and gradually increased which represents a bullish signal.

Bollinger Bands: Quick note - When Bollinger bands squeeze (the white lines) around the stock price means a lower volatility rate meaning high volatility is on its way. The direction of the volatility is dependent on other indicators which you will see how they all correlate.

$GME: Not trying to get ahead of myself, but with an increasing RSI, increasing OBV, and the stock remaining above the 55 EMA all indicators point up.

55 EMA: Quick note - everything as we know always deviates towards the mean (average). This is more than just stocks, look it up its wild. Why do you think the mean is one of the most used (and useful) forms of measurements? This can be applied to everything involving numbers. Anyway, anytime a stock remains above the 55 EMA (I use 55 because its a part of Fibonacci, that's a whole rabbit hole of it's own), it represents another bullish signal.

$GME: The yellow line represents the 55 EMA and anytime the stock came close or dropped slightly under we saw it bounce off and continue up. As of now it is currently trading along the 55 EMA with the Bollinger bands squeezing and if history continues to repeat itself we should see an increase in price.

OBV: Quick note - OBV is an indicator of momentum, and measures buying and selling pressure. In simple terms an increasing OBV shows that the volume on days when the stock price is increasing is greater than the volume on days when the stock price is decreasing. More buyers than sellers.

$GME: Increasing OBV, more buy volume than sell volume which will result in higher prices.

TLDR; I like numbers, I am good with numbers, and throughout this T.A. the goal was to remove all biases and stick to the technicals and fundamentals of what the stock was showing me. I notice a bullish RSI above 40 since July 2020, I notice Bollinger bands squeezing on the day chart, I notice a strong support at the 55 EMA, and I notice a constant increase in the OBV. I like to find solid trades that have potential and I see a lot of potential here. Not financial advice."

2021-05-07 14:44:18,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking of buying it last summer when it was like $4/share, but I just don't think gamestop is a $10b+ company, and don't really want to fomo in at a price I think is 5-10x higher than what id consider a fair value.  They haven't made a profit in 3 years, sales have been decreasing consistently over that time, they haven't really done anything that shows me they're updating their business model, I just personally don't like stocks with cult-mentalities surrounding them, etc.  I don't really care about investor sentiment/speculation, I just don't see it as a good value to buy at $160, and feel like more pain is coming.  

As I said, you do you, I'm not rooting against GME, or really care if you guys make money on it, but I'm not putting my money into it right now, because ya, I feel like I missed the boat and don't want to pay more than $10-20/share for it, so I won't.

I am not currently in GME so I have no skin in the game but I believe the company was on cruise control until Ryan Cohen join and brought along Amazon and Chewy staff. They obviously were missing untapped resources in the gaming world and are now forward thinking instead of cruise control. When I read about how they are changing things, I think TopGolf of the gaming industry and TopGold is extremely profitable. Now is the price where it is at right now reasonable? Honestly, maybe. I don't think it is retail investors that are keeping the price where it is at and instead big money that either is trying to kill other big money or sees a solid opportunity."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My first DD: I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshot First of all this is all just my speculation and not financial advice. I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months. I am not a financial advisor or professional. What I am is a physician with at least some literacy, though not expertise, in oncology. In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training. Without further ado...I present my first DD:

I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron\_rgen\_is\_rumored\_to\_be\_buying\_out\_ino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/)). The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had ""MD"" in it so it caught my attention...but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC (epic is the #1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar) and anyone asking that probably 1) is actually a doctor and 2) doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate...the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician...not much unlike the famous Dr. Burry

That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to ""do my own DD"" as they say. Now I am not 100% sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that  I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well (ok just a little well), right?

Background

I open the patent application and read up on it. My first impression? Lol you can't treat GBM. For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma)) that is one of the few ""death sentences"" that exist in medicine. I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch. Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this. Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much. Patients die within a year basically 100% of the time even with advances such as ""gamma knife"" radiation. I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable. But then I read more about their tech and the patent and....wait a second this actually sounds legit. So now to break down some of the science behind this....

Methods

INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes. To put it in non-doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain. Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment) due to what is called the blood brain barrier. Your brain is (reasonably so) walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there. Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either. In particular the medicine they have developed (INO 5401) is a PD-1 inhibitor, but delivered into the brain. As soon as I saw PD-1 this peaked my interest hard. anti PD-1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that ""uncloak"" cancer from hiding from your immune system. The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab)) which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma. The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug. That's where INO comes in with their patented tech.

Results

Go to the patent link above and click ""images"". This is the money shot. MRI on left = v bad cancer. MRI on the right = cancer is dead. What. Yep. Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution. Mind blowing. Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD-1 inhibitors is varied. Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS. I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away...but only in some patients. I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured. Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment. Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro-oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously? Google her.

Conclusion

Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money? I go look up the study. This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective (phase 1 = is the drug safe, phase 2 = does the drug work...did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies?). I saunter over to clinical[trials.gov](https://trials.gov) (the federal website where all clinical trials are listed) and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021. The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol...meaning they have 99% of their data and the study is essentially complete. I then saunter over to [google.com](https://google.com) (the worlds largest search engine) and look for other data they have. Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html)). ""Overall survival"" and ""Progression free survival"" are the holy grails of results in cancer research. The fact that they have 80% progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing. I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent. But again ... how is it that this is gonna moon soon? Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences. [https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc\_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf). Dates: May 12, May 18. Not just a one tiered moon shot, but a two tiered moon shot! 

Discussion

In conclusion: their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug, to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent. Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings. I don't know what I'm more excited about...a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon. I like the stock. I like the tech. I like the implications to cancer treatment.

Disclosures: No affiliation with any of the above companies. I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning. I have no idea what I'm doing. In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know."

2021-05-07 18:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Fellow MD here. Looking at their listing at [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03491683](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03491683), a couple of important points to correct:

1. INO-5401 is ""a combination of 3 separate DNA plasmids targeting Wilms tumor gene-1 (WT1) antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) genes.
2. The actual PD-1 inhibitor is Regeneron's cemiplimab, which is being delivered by IV infusion
3. Inovio's technology is the use of plasmids in combination w/ electroporation to allow cellular uptake of the plasmids. The plasmids are being delivered intramuscularly followed by electroporation, I assume of the surrounding tissue? I don't understand your conclusion about BBB penetration based on this. Unless the PD-1 inhibitor can actually make its way past the BBB, its utility is questionable.

That being said, if the 80% progress-free survival is actually true, that is indeed impressive."

I saw their 18 month interim results on GBM and realized how big Inovio was going to be so started buying in. They will apply for abbreviated P3, orphan drug status for the GBM treatment within months.

Their GBM drug is not a PD-1 inhibitor. It is given with a PD-1 inhibitor and standard of care chemo. Their drug is a therapeutic vaccine that targets the body to make killer T-cells that along with chemo and PD-1 inhibitors literally eats away the cancer.

The killer T cells appear to be the missing piece.

From an investment standpoint, their Covid vaccine has caused all the fluctuations the last year, but their oncology therapeutic options that are coming are beyond promising. They are the most advanced therapeutic vaccine company in the world from a clinical trial standpoint. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses) Not investment advice. I have a doctorate in retard."

If the data is so clearcut, and the need is so unmet then why hasn't there been any noise around review from the FDA?  For example, in the precision oncology space the rumor is Amgen is expecting approval for AMG-510/Sotorasib/Lumakras KRAS G12C sooner rather then later.  But this follows the FDA giving it a breakthrough designation ([https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20201214/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-sotorasib-for-lung-cancer-subset](https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20201214/fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-status-to-sotorasib-for-lung-cancer-subset)) followed by clearing it for accelerated review ([https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20210217/fda-grants-priority-review-to-sotorasib-for-lung-cancer-subset](https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20210217/fda-grants-priority-review-to-sotorasib-for-lung-cancer-subset)). Also every healthcare company presents at an investor conference like that and their presentations don't sound data heavy.

Edit: for context, I’m a big believer of trading based on a product. As a diabetic I bought a ton of DXCM in 2017 around $40 when there was a 60% sell off because analysts thought Abbott Freestyle Libre was going to eat their lunch. As someone who used the product, I knew the libre would never hold a candle to what the DXCM did. And I wasn’t footing the bill, insurance was. And now Dexcom is a Fortune 500 company trading in the $400s. Didn’t look at the balance sheet, didn’t look at their cash flows. All I knew is what the products were and how they impacted my life.

To be honest I wish he had gone quicker or had been cured. I can only imagine how brutal the last year was for him. Died at 51 because the medicine couldn’t get through the barrier, plus your body can only handle so much chemo and radiation.

2021-05-07 11:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Doc, here's a quick observation:

Go back and look at a one-year chart of the stock. In June 2020, this stock peaked at $33 ATH. And has since bled off down to its current level of $6.80.  So ask yourself:  Why?  What did they announce, or what was the news event that drove their price from $11 to $33?

Don't get me wrong, the DD you've presented is impressive, and frankly, a bit over my head, but I believe you.  Or should I say, I believe that you believe in the science/tech.

So, to further your studies in investing, you need to understand what caused the run up last June, and more importantly, why did it retrace $27 down to its current level?  **And why will it be different this time?**

Then, you will have an answer on whether or not this is a good investment.  But I like what you've done here.  Good stuff."

2021-05-07 15:48:36,wallstreetbets,Stock gapped down a couple weeks ago. Did some quick research and it's because their funding for covid vaccine stage 3 trial funding fell through. So if that ever gets funded again this company has a potential covid vaccine on top of this. The stock is also oversold! It's at its lowest point it's been in the past year! This means risk of the stock dropping any lower is very slim. It'll only go up from here especially with your 🔥DD. Thanks for the post! Taking a big position on this one.

It’s very manipulated everytime they’ve had good news the stock plummets. The thing is coiled hard and what’s beautiful about science is once we get the data out infront of the world, it’s going to make the US government look incompetent and hopefully expose more corruption in our current big pharma fda patty cake. 

I would also recommend looking into $LEXX they are infusing lipids with chemicals, Ai nicotine, Tylenol, cannabis etc.. basically what this means is everyone could produce with less product since our body is pretty inefficient at up taking drugs through our stomach. The lipid infusion allows it to be absorbed as a fat. Or something. You’re a doctor so I figured I’d chime in if you’re interested. I’m 6000 in INO and under 1000 on lexx due to the recent rs split

I’m a comp sci ape and have worked with big medical it corps and in general fascinated by  Medicine and the body."
2021-05-07 13:48:14,wallstreetbets,"This is your dd? You are an MD but you couldn’t take 5 minutes to learn the treatment strategies and factual survival statistics for GBM? 
Just so you can learn, the treatment for GBM is surgery+radiation (not with gamma knife)+chemo (with Temozolomide)+TTF.  Average survival is typically closer to 2 years (not the 100% 1 year you quoted). 

Next, while I don’t know if this drug is good or not 80%  PFS at 6 months doesn’t mean very much. It is certainly not mind blowing (as you have suggested). You need longer follow up before you can decide if this is effective. 

I hope, for your wife’s boyfriend’s sake you are more careful in your clinical work than the sloppy dd you have presented here."
2021-05-07 11:30:47,wallstreetbets,It's etiquette here to post your positions with your DD. Otherwise it just reeks of P&D.
2021-05-07 14:39:30,wallstreetbets,"The only reason why I am not 100% on board with this is because how fucking often are people getting brain cancer? The target audience for this is relatively small which means it would be hard to generate revenue. On top of that how expensive is the treatment? Would most insurances cover it?

I’m not really a huge fan of investing in medical because of stuff like this. But cool share, let me know if anybody agrees / disagrees. I’d like to see some counter arguments."
2021-05-07 13:39:46,wallstreetbets,Sounds like someone is bag holding their covid vaccine stocks.
2021-05-07 17:19:20,wallstreetbets,"Your DD is legit. However Phase 3 results will be years away. Overall survival for GBM is <5% at 5 years so maybe not a decade long, but still....long.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with other pharma/biotech publicly traded companies in development stage. From Phase 2 to the end of 3, they usually undergo many new share issues as well as reverse stock splits. This can easily cut your capital down 80-90%. Meanwhile the CEOs take millions in compensation every year as their company burns cash in clinical trials.

I'm not willing to tie up capital for years like that and watch it depreciate.

When Phase 3 data is close to release I might take a chance on it then.

If you look at $CVM, they're a similar play, game changing immunotherapy drug for head and neck scc. Phase 3 data is due any day now and if it meets primary outcome it will moonshot and likely get bought out by big pharma."
2021-05-07 18:18:00,wallstreetbets,"OP, I've been skeptical on INO for awhile. I frequently invest in biotetch because that's my background. I think it's very misleading to state it's the only drug for GBM as [a quick google search shows that there are a handful of drugs much further along in clinical trials.](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Glioblastoma&age_v=&gndr=&type=&rslt=&phase=2&phase=3&Search=Apply). The company has also gotten in trouble with their device in the past with the FDA. The talk I'm seeing for a buyout is way too immature. Targeting buyouts is a viable strategy in biotech, but that's only **after** a drug is approved, and they still have a ways to go before that."

Good progress, but still no reason for a BO. Kim has spoken at numerous conferences and each one gets hyped in advance and he says nothing meaningful and the stock drops. Kim is a scientist, hes not a go PR guy for the firm which is part of the problem. He was bitten hard by words he said to Trump and Citron almost bankrupted his company. Kim would not sell his company especially not for a measly $30  a share. If there were legs to this story, shorts would have known and started to cover.

it will. a medication that is effective, especially for a disease like GBM, would have to be covered. it would be unethical not to.

2021-05-07 14:25:40,wallstreetbets,I am a radiation oncologist and the op is spot on. You are correct as well. For patients with GBM they have maximal safe resection of tumor followed by TMZ (temozolimide)+ concurrent external beam radiotherapy assuming they are fit as per Stupp trial. GBM 2 year OS 27%. Median survival 15 months. This drug similar to PD-1 inhibitors for melanoma will be a god send for my brain cancer patients.

2021-05-07 14:56:16,wallstreetbets,"I addressed insurance coverage in another comment. Short answer: absolutely. 

Market size does not really matter. Someone of the most profitable drugs in the world are for orphan diseases. They just increase the price. 

One of the very sad things about the state of medicine in our country, and if I had a magic wand I wound undo this and all the potential trendies from this trade, is that people (and by extension their insurance. It’s not possible to justify not covering a drug that is fda approved due to cost alone) will essentially pay any price for life saving medication. Drugs don’t follow normal supply demand economics because if a Tesla is too expensive you don’t buy it but if your chemo is too expensive you mortgage your house."

2021-05-07 15:15:12,wallstreetbets,"The only reason INOs Covid drug isn’t on the market is because the FDA put the hold on p2, which was entirely due to “questions” about the Cellectra device."
2021-05-07 14:41:30,wallstreetbets,True enough. Technically their vaccine sequence has several plasmid coding in it. Complicated unless medicinal background. Biggest takeaway...it actually works on a devastating cancer.
2021-05-07 16:26:37,wallstreetbets,"Covid vaccines have potential billions in revenue. I think Pfizer reported 26 billion, and Moderna 19 billion for 2021. Inovio tapping into Covid vaccine market (if their P2 data is good) would be very substantial. It’s largely the reason for the wild last year in pricing which appears to have bottomed out.

GBM is estimated to be a 1 billion/year market or so by 2025. Inovio’s GBM treatment would instantly become standard of care for treatment in all patients, so they would heavily capitalize on that market on something that would be sustainable.

The Covid market is unpredictable due to nature of variants, whether it becomes endemic (think yearly flu shots) or if it’s a one and done. Combine that with the fact there is fierce competition, it’s very difficult to predict that market. If their Covid vaccine is successful, it’s just icing on the cake.

Their HPV and GBM cancer vaccines would bring more profit in one year than Inovio’s current market cap. I have no doubt both will be successful in cancer. They are both close to market - HPV with full approval likely this year, and GBM will enter a P3 and I’m expecting it to be fast tracked.

This also would serve as a proof of concept of their other cancer vaccines in P1/P2 which would be even bigger markets potentially. Breast cancer, prostate, anal, head and neck... When the first cancer vaccine gets approval, it will chain validate the science in the entire pipeline.

The real money and the future of medicine is their pipeline. It just starts with GBM/HPV"

When they started Operation Warp Speed, the DoD promised funding of Phase II and III drug trials of numerous companies, INO being one of them.  Once Warp Speed delivered Pfizer, Moderna and JnJ, they pulled the funding for INO.  So it has definitely stalled."

2021-05-07 13:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Lol you're absolutely right but institutions like to use it as an excuse to drive stock prices down into the dirt.  Everyone with a brain realizes that a biotech/pharma/medical research/etc company currently undergoing clinical trials isn't going to be profitable, but it's almost used as an excuse to load up the shorts.

Btw your op sent shivers down my spine as I read it, haven't felt the fuzzies like this in quite sometime in regards to a stock (although Im probably biased from how much the cancer subject hits home for me)"
2021-05-07 17:08:14,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The source of the funding, how well they were funded, and by whom, is much more important. Heavy investment in R&D for illnesses with unmet needs isn't expected to have good financials for a few years. Innovative drugs are a long play, from all perspectives. Source: big Pharma, worked on M&A of small biotech firms."

2021-05-07 16:22:44,wallstreetbets,I'm a Canadian and the above Canadian is spot on. So is the guy above that and op. For Canadians with oncology backgrounds have safe resection of information followed by BPM (bestmanagementpractices)+ concrurrent external info capability assuming they are fit as per literacy trial.
2021-05-07 15:01:40,wallstreetbets,"The OP was not spot on in his review of survival statistics for gbm. 
I’m aware that I’m correct thanks. 
I haven’t seen the data to suggest this drug will be a “god send” yet. It looks like they had 70% OS at 18 months in 20 non methylated patients. That is better than OPs “mind blowing” 80% PFS at 6 months which is not impressive at all, but obviously we shall see the longer term data. 
As I said I don’t know if this drug is good. You need longer follow up in way more patients before talking about anything “sent from god” when we are discussing gbm."
2021-05-07 16:26:01,wallstreetbets,"Gamma knife is just a type of radiosurgery and is rarely indicated for GBM bc the tumor infiltrates around 2-3 cm into surrounding brain tissue. Radiosurgey is primarily useful in treating cancers in organs that are arranged in parallel units (think liver, lung where you can afford to burn/lose some margin of healthy tissue) or where the edges are well defined (like brain mets).  There is a limited role for radiosurgery in localized recurrent GBM cases but even then the data is skewed by patient selection. 

Popular media likes to cite gammaknife bc radiosurgery is thought of as a pinnacle in technical advances (and it is)... it's just not a good option for this type of tumor"
2021-05-07 15:09:36,wallstreetbets,"10-12 months would be median survival without treatment. 
Gamma knife is not used for gbm. It is not an “advance” germane to this disease and only makes it sound like you don’t really treat gbm or know much about it. 

Again, I don’t know if this drug is any good (I hope it’s amazing!) but I don’t think you do either and the data does not seem to be there yet."

I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought the sign was bullish in premarket???? This is so fucked."

2021-05-07 11:25:07,wallstreetbets,"You went from one meme stock to another and got lucky for now. These stocks will eventually recover. PLTR is an old company that has not turned into a great money making machine yet. Their business model doesn't scale for the valuations people here want it to have. If you understand what they do and see where they are going, go for it. Cathie seems to believe in it, still she has lost millions from it so far. 

Of the two stocks I think RKT has more upside, but it could take a long time. You're right in getting rid of it for another with a better return in the near term."
2021-05-07 16:54:56,wallstreetbets,I'm not against rocket .. actually if this goes up faster then rkt then I'll buy rkt again for long term .. I'm just trying to make up my loss

2021-05-07 11:46:59,wallstreetbets,"😁 I'm all for the GameStop hold - if only to screw the big guys....But silver actually is a great investment, just not SLV which has JP Morgan as custodian and has been known to be short on SLV for a long time. Paid a billion in lawsuits last year for manipulating the market and has been accused of doing far worse for decades.

Demand for actual silver is at historic levels - used in most electronics, cars, solar panels etc. Add to that monetary value as a hedge against rising inflation. It has to go up. It reached $50 over a decade ago when demand was far lower, and the dollar itself was worth far less. You're telling me it's worth less than half at $25? There's nowhere else to go but up. JP Morgan and gang just need to get out of the way first - and for that to happen physical demand has to cause defaults on contracts. When people asking for delivery suddenly don't get it - price is going to go through the roof. A lot of smart people are saying demand is far higher than the number crunchers are showing because they're not properly accounting for hedge purchases as ""demand"" because they're not asking for delivery.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html)

Just don't buy SLV. PSLV or something with physical allocation, not just paper promises that won't put any immediate demand on the real system.

That's my 2 cents. I'm new to all this so please tell me how i'm wrong if you disagree. I will happily listen."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bear Case for Verizon ($VZ) During the last panic in market Verizon stock ran from 56 to 59.5 pretty unusual for low volatility stocks.  RSI and CCI are both above 80.

The main reason people are buying Verizon is to park their cash until they have some certainty in market.

&#x200B;

People are following on daddy Buffett to use VZ stock as bond but with one problem with their current debt load being so high and competition between carriers for customers heating up they don't have any money to increase dividends.

Right now VZ network is thought as best in country but this going to come under pressure very soon or they will need to seriously invest into their infrastructure.

They recently sold Yahoo and AOL to Apollo (kind good) but they will be missing on these revenue anymore.

Beside all these technicals are on your side, RSI and CCI are both in overbought territory.

Multiple ways to play since IV is so low. Do your own DD, feel free to point in whole in my DD.

2021-05-07 10:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Their service is ass like half the tech companies around. Telecom giants are terrible and infrastructure is the only thing keeping them alive.

2021-05-07 13:19:27,wallstreetbets,"I think unless you can predict a dividend cut, there is no way any sort of option play is a smart idea. VZ could be a long term giant in the making, given how much focus they are putting towards 5g infrastructure.

Wait, 5G isn't that great for smartphones and such, it doesn't change too much. That is true, but think of self driving cars that need to talk to each other in high speeds, or IoT needing faster speeds to communicate properly. If Verizon can get good 5G infrastructure in place, imagine how easy it would be to rent it out or charge people to use it, so it is more B2B rather then B2C."
2021-05-07 10:43:43,wallstreetbets,that's not true. VZ is the leading cell phone provider and no one can beat that at this current moment. It's a cash generating machine while they are #1 in the cellphone business. I understand they failed on FIOS but their DIvidend is so attractive and secure.
2021-05-07 12:35:56,wallstreetbets,I hope Apollo can restore Yahoo to pre-covid quality.
2021-05-07 13:33:44,wallstreetbets,"Also in the long term they might not have access to a company like ASTS, and therfore will be force to go bankrupt."

2021-05-07 10:46:43,wallstreetbets,"attractive yes, secure not sure with their current debt load. Also as the price for stock get bid up it's not so attractive anymore.  


Btw there are only 3 main carriers others are gaining more subs, maybe not the highest quality ones. So I wouldn't call VZ top carrier just yet."
2021-05-07 14:20:19,wallstreetbets,"I've been a customer of theirs for past 10 years. Two months ago coverage in my area has gone to shit. Not sure what is going on.

All that being said. They are not the same company they were a few years ago is all I'm saying."
2021-05-07 12:33:47,wallstreetbets,"They will pay down debt. But is it enough.   


Also what about loss of revenue from sale of this business."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to Play $TGT’s Q1 ER Since I posted about my optimistic outlook regarding Target’s movement back to 200 following the Q4 ER that saw an overreaction that led to the stock price falling to as low as 167, TGT has since surged to all time highs. 

I predicted that TGT would eclipse 200 & trade sideways from there, however as soon as I realized that 200 was not the celling I rolled my calls out to higher strike prices & have been riding the wave up & up. 

In spite of TGT’s strong surge after the plunge from early March, I believe that results from the Q1 earnings report will push the stock up another 5-10%. The best way to play earnings is through call debit spreads. That way you are shielded from some degree of IV crush & set a PT for yourself. It can result in you being pissed in an event where a stonk surges 15-20% after a killer ER, but hoping for that is risky because it is incredibly rare for a retail stock. 

Current positions: (38 $260/$270 10/15 call spreads) (13 $227.50/$230 5/21 call spreads)"
2021-05-07 10:44:59,wallstreetbets,any ER play is a gamble but any retail will most likely beat ER during pandemic as people are flooding with their $1400 stimulus check to buy stupid things
2021-05-07 10:48:11,wallstreetbets,"no concern about an earnings rug pull as we've seen lately?  $TGT looks overbought here to me, with some small gaps to fill, Im surprised at the melt up above $200"
2021-05-07 13:46:57,wallstreetbets,Theres really no reason for it to be trading this high. It’s  extremely overbought on just about every chart. It slips lower then somehow gets propped up by insane 5 minute volume. I can see this selling off pretty hard before earning for a possible refuel.

Second, she obviously knows her way around a dick... some of the longest lasting marriages come from a good BJ on a regular basis... not just birthdays.

She has motivation to make sure it works, and the means to do so."

He is going to give away his whole fortune after he dies. His wealth is not all tied to stocks. My theory is that they're sick of each other and the stocks being high right now is a win/win for them. It wasn't even months ago they were talking about Gates putting microchips in vaccines. There are fucking plenty of evil people out there being corrupt in the open and people want to put their tin foil hats on instead of doing something about the actual problems.

Like at least for hetero men the diseases that are easily transmissible are very treatable, or cause minimal harm. And AIDS is basically impossible to catch that way (and now treatable as well)

Compared to the amount of effort men expend chasing tail, the downside risk of STDs is really not that large. Also a rich man can hire a high-class prostitute who is very unlikely to carry STDs as she has fewer clientele and gets tested regularly (Although a higher class prostitutes probably insist on it unless you become a regular and/or pay her a ton of money).

I'm not trying to paint him as some sort of incorruptible philanthropist god but at this point his brand/image is the only thing he's looking to improve. What can't he afford at the moment and even if those stocks in his position were to tank he already sold billions of his Microsoft position off so he has the liquid to do/buy whatever he needs at this point.

2021-05-07 14:56:36,wallstreetbets,Or maybe he's just not a shallow fuck?
2021-05-07 17:45:15,wallstreetbets,The brain is the largest sex organ they say... Maybe she's wicked smart and funny and nice to be around. Maybe she pulls in 20 year olds for them to share.
2021-05-07 18:13:39,wallstreetbets,you been watching too many movies real life is different homies

2021-05-07 14:05:43,wallstreetbets,"it's true, the bastard fucked my dog"
2021-05-07 16:57:33,wallstreetbets,True fact: Bezos cums from the top of his head. That’s why his eye is weird- it keeps dripping in his one eye.
2021-05-07 17:12:08,wallstreetbets,">Yeah I’m sure Bezos fucks whatever he wants to, whenever he wants to.

Sounds like he's fucking his employees, too."
2021-05-07 14:24:23,wallstreetbets,He probably fucks his blood boy.

2021-05-07 17:14:35,wallstreetbets,He's no prize. Put him in a bicycle basket and he'd look just like ET.

That’s right, he took his billionaire little rich dick out and he pissed on my fucking wife, and he said his dick was THIS BIG.

2021-05-07 15:57:49,wallstreetbets,"You really don't have to be fat to hold an opinion that sometimes you want something that goes deeper than skin. Bezos literally could get any woman he wanted, but he chose her for a reason. You may get beautful 10/10 thots, who have shallow personalities and you cannot hold a genuine conversation with them, but then you go and find a 7/10, but you love spending time with them and talking. I'm sure there are 10/10s out there who are also a great personality and match for you, but it takes time and effort to find them, maybe he settled for  7/10 looks but 10/10 personality for him."
2021-05-07 19:27:53,wallstreetbets,Fatter than your wife and mom? That’s how I’m fucking them both.
2021-05-07 16:56:18,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, ""DD"" ever since GME has been so shitty. And I'm not even ragging on the GME situation, I made bank off of it. I just wish the subreddit didn't fall into mediocrity, as weird as that is to say about *this* subreddit."

2021-05-07 16:27:31,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-05-07 18:08:08,wallstreetbets,Hahaha! Nice work.
2021-05-07 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,I don’t care how powerful he is. When I roll over in the middle of the night the last thing I want to see is ET. But that’s just me being picky because it’s something I will never have to worry about. Not like he’s going to be knocking on my door no matter how many deliveries I get. 🙂
2021-05-07 16:20:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah alternatively he fucks 10/10 on the side anytime he feels like it. Cute story though
2021-05-07 19:57:38,wallstreetbets,Wsb is now just a P&D with 8 million actual retards on top of 2 million who only pretended to be retarded.
2021-05-07 19:14:33,wallstreetbets,I pulled an article from the Irish Examiner. I think I know who I trust on this matter.
2021-05-07 18:55:53,wallstreetbets,"It's the British tradition in America. Takes a lot of religion to make it stick.

France has the lowest divorce rate in the western world. They view sex as a fun activity, like having a beer at the pub, and marriage as a partnership for family. 

But French girls don't shave their pits. So there really is no winning with the opposite sex."
2021-05-07 17:22:42,wallstreetbets,Bet he got it next day with prime though
2021-05-07 16:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Now, that’s funny"

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HNDL Upon doing some research, I found that this fund pays over 7% guaranteed , in dividends. Very safe place to put retirement money and to make contributions to. I hope the price per share will rise somewhat as it is traded like stock, but if it stays where it’s at, that’s beneficial as well, because more shares can be acquired and at a low cost. I have 50k in the fund which means, without the price per share going up, I’ll be netting $3500 in dividends on a regular basis. IMO it’s not a bad play, but I’m not offering advice, I just have a question... are there any other funds or stocks that pay out guaranteed dividends as high or higher than this one?

Wow. That's a lot of billions those hedge funds have to pay back eventually on all the shares they shorted. That is why I'm still holding on to my shares. I believe and I know those dumb hedge funds have to eventually buy back all the shares they shorted. They continue to pay a daily interest until they buy them back. Eventually, the interest will be so high, they will be losing money by paying the interest and will have to buy back the shares. Sorry hedge funds, I don't have paper hands. Diamond hands all the way. Hilarious video"

2021-05-07 11:15:47,wallstreetbets,"When someone is caught naked shorting they get fined and sanctioned (usually). The fines are paid towards the broker who owns the shares that were borrowed. If the borrower can't cover the shares (if they dont exist for example) bankruptcy happens and that is it.

Those fake shares do not exist indefinitely


If you are owed 15 shares from melvin and only 5 exist so you get 5 shares and melvin goes bankrupt.. where do you think your extra shares and cash is coming from? Where does that money exist?"
2021-05-07 17:48:53,wallstreetbets,Based on how these loans work they still default to originator I believe

2021-05-07 11:21:04,wallstreetbets,"Think you don't understand how this works, those shares are borrowed and then sold into the market, you now have 2 shares where you had 1. Its the whole point, you dilute the float and short, driving the price down.

If the borrowed can't cover the shares, it is bigger than bankruptcy, the prime broker then has to cover them as that is the premise of the system.

Those fake shares exist until covered.

5 shares can easily become 15 shares, melvin pays 1% on their borrow, but at some point they have to cover.

Why do you think the borrow rate has stayed so low with only 20m ish tradeable float."

2021-05-07 11:24:42,wallstreetbets,"No you don't understand how this works. Float is NOT the total amount of shares. Its the amount of shares available to short. Typically shares owned by brokers and market makers. Short interest can shrink simply by more of the total amount being made available to the float stack.

Good luck kid, naked shorting doesn't create fake shares, it borrows shares not available to borrow but do exist in someones portfolio. It does not create an infinite loop.

And even if it did, as soon as bankruptcy is declared all financial obligations to repay your position have been wiped out cutting off the infinite loop idea.

Also large long positions by other hedge funds closing free up more shares to cover these positions. 

USE YOUR BRAIN man, logical outcomes."

2021-05-07 16:14:59,wallstreetbets,This more or less sums it up. No real company is going to buy out MVIS for big money when they'll be pennies on the dollar as soon as the meme thing runs its course. This is a penny stock if I've ever seen one. I'd rather own shares of that $100m Deli. At least they have steady revenue and can pay dividends in sandwiches. :)

2021-05-07 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it isn't a surprise at all. I work in economic development and across California emoloyers have the exact same complaints, they can't fill positions. A good chunk are shit tier jobs that people are passing on because unemployment is paying close or more and because they can find a better job. Jobs are out there for people who want a job and as long as there isn't some other economic contraction before unemployment runs out job numbers will continue to be primed for a huge jump. If anything it is forcing employers to consider better pay rates. I had a large retail distribution employer say they had to push their entry wage up $1.75 to even get applications and they still get turned down by job seekers. 

Expect job numbers to remain good but miss expectations until expanded unemployment benefits get closer to ending."

2021-05-07 09:01:00,wallstreetbets,Sure. Tech stocks are trading at high multiples look at apple and Google close to a 30x multiple. So if bond rates go up people pull their money out of high multiple tech stocks into bonds. Because of this bad employment number the bond rate and chances of rate increases go lower which means more money flowing into tech for longer.

2021-05-07 11:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where this guy lives. Electricians in the US make on average $59,190 ($1,138 a week). It varies by state but the average unemployment is around $300 a week + $300 stimulus or $600 a week max unemployment. The equivalent of a 40 hour week @ $15/hr.

It would make fiscal sense for a laid off McDonald's worker or waitress at Bob's greasy spoon but if you make a bit more than $15 it does not make $$$ sense."

2021-05-07 14:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Everyone should be paid more. Why shouldn’t a fast food worker be paid $45k a year? Similarly, why do college graduates with engineering degrees get offered $50k coming out of school? 

The problem is not “why are these poor people being paid so much”, it’s that EVERYONES being paid too little. $22 an hour after taxes in la county (not downtown) is just barely enough to not have to live paycheck to paycheck. 

Those same people getting paid less than that at McDonald’s can’t just move to a cheaper cost of living area because that costs money too. Money they don’t have. Which is why they’re working at McDonald’s. They didn’t choose to be born there and they didn’t choose to be born poor."

2021-05-07 17:25:29,wallstreetbets,"It's barely enough to get by here, and it's still more than a lot of jobs pay here, hence why people would rather go on unemployment and not come back. They can actually pay some bills right now. If the electrician wants employees he should pay them what they are worth. I get paid what I'm worth and I have no intention of going on unemployment. However, if I was living paycheck to paycheck, you bet your ass I would take the unemployment.

Even if those wages are unprofitable, it means the company shouldn't exist. If I need 6 people to run my lemonade stand but I can't afford to pay them a living wage then I should let a couple people go, and if I can't make it work after that, then I shouldn't be running a lemonade stand. The last thing that I should be doing is expecting them to go on government assistance to make up the difference between their poverty wage and a living wage.

Obviously large employers have a larger responsibly. Walmart could help the economy a lot by paying their employees enough that they can spend on more than just the bare necessities. Then people have more money to spend on lemonade and I can hire more people because business is better for me. The only difference for Walmart is that their owners and shareholders get to hoard fewer billions."
2021-05-07 12:42:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah that electrician anecdote is horse shit. There's high demand in the trades because of a lack of qualified people in the industry. It's been going on for years. Not because of unemployment benefits.
2021-05-07 12:43:13,wallstreetbets,"Exactly my points - in NY an electrician making $1138 a week would make about $850 a week on unemployment. If you value not having to work at all more than the extra $300, you'll stay at home. Some people are like that."
2021-05-07 12:58:14,wallstreetbets,"You're forgetting that unemployment isn't the only benefit. You get $600/week for unemployment, plus another $100-200/week in supercharged SNAP benefits, plus the stimulus checks that went out taking some of the pressure off your budget.

Now you're faced with the choice between $1,138/week to do a physically demanding  job vs. $800/week to stay at home smoking weed and doing the occasional cash job for your friends/family/neighbors.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"#ArchegosDIY - Trading with 25x leverage through Q1 and the May market pullback: Pros and Cons **Disclaimer:** Using options and trading with high leverage implies massive risk. This material is for educational purposes only.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hidden Gem I just posted two articles about $VOD. This is a telecommunications company with a $54 bil market cap that has just entered a partnership with Goggle and Qualcomm. 

Shorts have been feasting on this for some time but there is just too much good news to keep this down for long. It’s currently up 44% YTD not to mention gains this entire week since the news hit.  

I currently have quite a few leap call options with a strike price for $35 going into next year. This stock was over $100 in its prime IMO its headed back there.  Do your DD and you will probably agree. 

The best part: $35 call options are dirt cheap going into next year. Add that up with some increased volume and a short squeeze 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-07 06:16:44,wallstreetbets,Why would anyone jump in *after* a 44% moon?
2021-05-07 10:39:22,wallstreetbets,"After doing a bit of research this company seems kinda crap honestly. 

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-best-mobile-phone-networks-worst-vodafone-o2-a8882301.html

Kind of an old article (2019), but I found it interesting. Also plenty of articles from last year as well. I’ll have to look into it a bit more, but unless this company makes a huuuge turn around, I don’t think they’ve really got much of a future. Also, they’ve been on the decline for the past 20 years. I don’t think a 75% increase (referring to the $35 calls in Jan 2021) in less than a year is anywhere near realistic. 

On a positive side, the recent news seems decent. Not sure if it’s a saving Grace, but at least they are trying to improve their really shitty customer service. Also, this company is huge and a lot of people rely on them for internet, so they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. 

that being said, I bought 15 of the calls you were talking about for dirt cheap. Would have bought more, but this last week has made me broke as shit. Appreciate the tip. 😁"

2021-05-07 10:23:47,wallstreetbets,But in all seriousness I think all this needs is volume and eyes on it. Hard for them to control the shorting after that.  Just my opinion.
2021-05-07 12:19:09,wallstreetbets,Another one. https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/kenmei-technologies-partners-vodafone-group-111000006.html
2021-05-07 12:20:50,wallstreetbets,About 20 years ago. But we are here to talk about the future right?  I’m not investing in the past. Only brought up the previous price to show you a possible ceiling. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VOD/vodafone-group/stock-price-history
2021-05-07 06:22:11,wallstreetbets,"Touche...

But cash is better than bags."
2021-05-07 06:33:41,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
2021-05-07 06:40:56,wallstreetbets,I see your point but I’ve been watching it a long time. Shorts have been keeping it down for whatever reason. It gains almost everyday then gives the gains right back. That is until the recent news. As for it being a Boomer Stock I would say yes and no.  Yeah it’s a telecom BUT it’s now partnered up with GOOGLE and seems to be focused on 5G which will be necessary for everything form AR/VR to driverless cars.  They’re heavy into cloud services too. These guys are banking on the future. Boomers could give a f@ck less about that.
2021-05-07 12:20:30,wallstreetbets,Nice. So you holding till January 2022 huh
2021-05-07 06:33:04,wallstreetbets,OP is dropping bags
2021-05-07 17:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Order us some golf shoes, otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive. Impossible to walk in this muck."
2021-05-07 06:35:58,wallstreetbets,If that’s the case look at this stock like it’s Ocean’s 11.
2021-05-07 06:34:34,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-07 06:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I forgot a word. I said it's a fairly safe Boomer stock. I'm not shit-talking it. I'm saying it's a decent play, not some P&D scam.

Whenever I travel I pick up a VOD simcard if they're available in the country I'm visiting."
2021-05-07 12:22:53,wallstreetbets,That I’m not sure about yet. It depends on how high this baby goes. I’m not die hard $VOD fan like DFV is for $GME but I do feel a little sentimental after holding through all the bs (which is still going on).  I would definitely be a legend if I did HODL and it 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-07 07:13:30,wallstreetbets,Dropping bags? Nope will hold until next year unless it moons.  Doesn’t matter to me calls were cheap. I would have cashed out earlier this week if I was worried. I was up. Long term hold for me. Just wondering how no one else is seeing this.
2021-05-07 06:46:03,wallstreetbets,Nice. You’ve done business with them. Your value to this thread is greatly appreciated.
2021-05-07 12:24:13,wallstreetbets,Sometimes we hit a good one sometimes we don’t. How long have you had this play
2021-05-07 12:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Been holding since the beginning of this year.  Lost some money trying to time it with options that’s when I learned how much they’re shorting it. That’s when I went a year out.  Once I seen the longevity, people’s dependence on it overseas and the partnerships they were looking to get into I kept adding to my position."
2021-05-07 12:29:04,wallstreetbets,They are lucky the volume is so low otherwise they wouldn’t be able to keep this crap up.
2021-05-07 12:28:52,wallstreetbets,Whats your position sir
2021-05-07 12:30:04,wallstreetbets,I have slightly under 1000 calls $35 strike for 1/2022
2021-05-07 12:30:37,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck sir, let’s spread the word"
2021-05-07 12:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Thank you my good man. Yup, that’s why I’m here. Hoping this info will catch on. The low volume is where most of their power is right now (the shorts).  I am very curious to see what happens with more eyes on it."

2021-05-07 14:57:57,wallstreetbets,"Reposting this from last night as a public service announcement. 

AMC on 1/1/2020 (ie pre-covid): 

Enterprise value: $10.8 billion
Market cap: $700 million
Net debt: $10.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$0.57 per share

As of 5/6/2021:

Enterprise value: $15.6 billion (!!)
Market cap: $4.5 billion (!!)
Net debt: $11.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$3.42 per share 

AMC has more debt right now ($11.1bn) than the value of the entire business *pre-covid* ($10.8bn). So even if covid never happened, the stock would be worthless and even the debt wouldn’t recover everything. 

Somehow the business is worth 50% more now AFTER covid. Even with forward EPS down 700%. And even with more movies going direct to streaming and producers cutting the exclusive theatre window? bruh.

I feel like if you lose money on AMC, you should also have to write “I’m a dumb motherfucker” 1000 times on a chalkboard."

2021-05-07 09:26:58,wallstreetbets,"This is going to sound a bit tin-foil-hat-ish, but I think that the stimulus might be the reason so few people took jobs in April compared to expectations.

A family of 4 under the cutoff line of $75k income would have seen a $5600 check combined with extra ue benefits, probably means the job hunt could be put off for a month...; the checks were the biggest income infusion ever from government, so that may be a part of the story here.

May/June reports will be very important to tell whether that played a big role in what happened.

There is absolutely no way that the economy could/would grow 7-10% with ue gains that slow unless people were actively putting off taking jobs due to the stimulus being so massive that it actually replaced a month or two of income (which it in fact did for families that got it with 1-3 kids)."

""The QQQ/tech complex still holds a lot of puts & negative gamma, which should invoke high volatility today. We mark 330 as support, and remind NQ/QQQ traders to respect the “vanna”, as implied volatility has such a large impact on puts. If markets do decide to rally today, you may get more upside in QQQ/IWM vs S&P because of that negative gamma position.""

""...dealers may have to buy back futures if QQQ rallies. Additionally we show a fairly impactful expiration (blue vs red line) which suggest that tonight’s expiration creates some additional dealer buying flows into Monday""

They don’t look at the individual companies merits when doing so. PLTR still a great long term play but can’t fight these short term trends. Gotta hold a year or so.

Watch for Goldilocks. Don’t want this coming in too hot or concerns about Fed tightening will mount. Too cold and the economy is not rebounding as quickly as it should. Seeing how the Fed is the biggest fear facing markets today, a ‘too cold’ scenario would be preferred.

TBH this report is not as big as a market-moving event as it used to be. Weekly initial jobless claims are more watched these days. Those have been beating estimates, making the ‘too hot’ scenario one to look out for.

All of this follows another record close for the Dow. Tech stocks even rebounded, with the Nasdaq snapping a four-day losing streak. This could be the start of the ‘final parabolic meltup’ that David Hunter has been talking about ([indeed David is predicting](https://twitter.com/davehcontrarian/status/1390335874777468937?s=21) that exact scenario)"

so let me start by saying that im 5 foot 7, 295 lbs (mostly muscle), but my doctor is concerned about my eating habits? I thought this was a good weight to be? anyways, my daily eating habits is very simple. For breakfast: 5 green eggs and 3 slices of ham, for lunch: order culvers burger from door dash (i like to have it delivered because it's harmful to the environment if I drive) with strawberry milkshake (my daily dairy serving) and then for dinner i'll either have a frozen pizza or chicken wings with 6-7 beers, and then a 1/2 pint of haggan das ice (i get raspberry chocolote so that way im getting fruit too). anyways the news from the doctor was NOT good and im REALLY scared

What's next? - who knows...

The government should hand out flyers explaining basic economics to absolute morons.

There will be no excessive inflation, the EU and the US are not Turkey, Zimbabwe or Venezuela. They can print as long as they want.Nothing will happen, this is proven by countless empirical studies. Government debt simply does not lead to hyperinflation in developed countries.

2021-05-07 10:58:50,wallstreetbets,"It's simple, but fucked.

Everything is overbought. Like, really overbought. And everyone knows it. But the valuations are justified by fed QE and stimulus and unemployment injections.

Once the economy recovers, all stocks are overbought and fucked, which actually means bad news = good news. Because bad news = more government and fed  intervention.

If unemployment had dropped, people would be worried that unemployment checks would slow and the fed might raise rates, which would've caused a panic selloff.

Basically we built a house of cards."

And as you noted, he surely recognizes that if he returns, any stock he ""likes"" will be bought through the roof. Then he'll certainly get harassed by Congress again."

2021-05-07 08:30:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah i’ve seen similar situations where the ape broke out and killed for this type of shit.
2021-05-07 08:24:35,wallstreetbets,It is actually a mating ritual. The ape has accepted the offer
2021-05-07 07:23:50,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see this without the glass in between. I'd give the human 10 seconds before Harambe flings him to the moon

It would spread on twitter, facebook

dave thomas would rise from the grave and refuse them service at Wendy's

casinos would close up shop under the threat of bankruptcy when they tried to enter

severely obese women would deny them sex, as thats beneath them

porn sites would refuse them entry for any amount of money

myspace tom would come out from the woodwork and unfriend them

Hell, seppuku would be a waste of time, as Jesus would bitchslap them back to the beginning of time."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fastly drops 27% after release of Q1-21 results - Price roller coaster Fastly released its Q1-21 performance on Thursday, after which the stock price dropped a whopping 27%. The company generated revenues of $84.9 million (35% YoY) vs. $85.1 million market consensus. Net loss per share was $0.12 vs. an expected $0.11.

These are not big misses but make the company one of the few high-growth cloud players that underperformed market expectations.

However, the company also lowered its guidance for Q2: Fastly forecasts revenues of $84 - $87 million and a net loss of $0.16 - $0.19 per share, compared to the market consensus of $92 million in revenue and a net loss of $0.08 per share, thereby disappointing investors.

Lastly, Adriel Lares will step down as CFO of the company after 5 years.

[Shareholder letter](https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/1Q21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)

The company is now trading at a PPS of $42, compared to its high of $119 only 3 months ago, representing a TEV / NTM revenue multiple of 11.9x.

2021-05-07 07:39:42,wallstreetbets,Just wanted to get someone else opinion if it’s worth buying the dip. What makes you feel so negative about future prospects? Is it a bad product? management? Or simply not the right pick for the upcoming inflation?
2021-05-07 07:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Good questions. 

Right now it’s not really a time to pour money into tech growth stocks. With the real economy picking up steam, people are investing more into cyclicals and commodities.

Now don’t get me wrong. Some tech stocks might still be worth looking into if they post aggressive growth and also are close to making money.

But does Fastly fulfill that criteria? They have less growth now and also missed expectations on all fronts. All while COVID is not fully over yet.

If you are interested in Fastly because of their product, why don’t you put the money into NET instead?

But as I also said, Fastly might very well have a dead cat bounce in the near future. If you have an itch to gamble a bit, that could be a valid play 🎰🎰🎰"

Regarding rates it’s a bit of a guessing game. The only question is when not if. The important thing is not the date when the rates are adjusted, but which day the Fed communicates those changes. That could happen end of this year.

Why it won’t be very fast: none of the rising prices so far have to do with shortages that cannot be solved quickly and are clearly transitory. Semiconductors can easily be produced, trees can be logged.

Pay attention to the only thing that cannot be supplied on short notice: Labour.

OP paid $2.76 (x 100, because options are in batches of 100 shares) per contract for 99 contracts for a purchase price of $27,324.  

They're betting that by August 20, 2021 the stock price of PLTR will be above $20 (strike).  If it is, they have the right to purchase 9900 shares of PLTR at $20, regardless of the price (99 contracts x 100 shares each.)   Alternately, as he price goes up, the cost/value per contract will and they can just sell the contract to someone who does want to execute on the purchase (because buying 9900 shares at $20/ea is almost $200k.) 

If the price is not above $20 by this date and OP hasn't sold the contracts by that date, they'll expire worthless and OP loses their  $27324.00."

2021-05-07 06:03:33,wallstreetbets,Fidelity makes money on their mutual funds and interest from customers deposits.  The free trading for them is a loss leader to get more clients to put more money in
2021-05-07 09:01:53,wallstreetbets,"That's correct.

The people who demand there be no PFOF are similar to the people who demand ads be removed from websites that they use for free."
2021-05-07 14:55:22,wallstreetbets,"I found it no easier to use than any of the other brokerages I've worked with. If anything, the commitment to oversimplifying actually made certain things more difficult or obtuse. The UI is not good, it's minimalist to a fault.   
Free options and stock trades are sort of the equivalent to a hotel advertising they have air conditioning. If someone doesn't have it, either they're beyond bad, or they're good enough that you won't need it.   
That's why I left them, not because of Gamestop."
2021-05-07 06:06:37,wallstreetbets,I would say it works pretty well. I dumped a decent amount into a managed account with them after switching from RH. I also do my cash management with them as my primary bank as well.

Right now the market cap is at \~2.9billion or lower depending on outstanding shares/the latest buyback. They have for the past three years paid a +$0.3 dividend.

2021-05-07 05:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Someone else about a month ago posted that you should buy Jan 22 $300C on BRK.B as he believed the IV was so low that it would have to go up. I commented there that he has no idea what he is talking about with IV, that said perhaps you can make money if BRK.B itself goes up. Well guess what, BRK.B went up in that time a nice amount and while IV did not go up, that guy if he held the options tripled his money (just due to BRK.B going up and not on his theory about IV).

Basically similar to buying LEAPs on SPY (both have similar IV, so not a lot of premium), just perhaps Warren Buffett has a better historical rate of return.

In any case, congrats."

Hey fellow apes,

Been   following the this GME Saga since end of January and today i really  saw  something that differs from the last week and months and made  myself a proud XX-Holder.

Please see below screenshot of the Premarket bid/asks.

Untill  today i never recognised such low volumes of sales on the ask side in  premarket ( current time in 9:54 ( central european time ).

Anyone  else sees that and thinks it might be the first signs of the recent  rule changes, if not please don't hesitate and shed some light into this  matter?"

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Support for those that recognize By now everyone's has heard the AMC earnings call! Our Silverback leader AA stuck up for each and every ape and redditor out there.
He stood up to credit suisse and made sure Meg fully understood 3.2M apes own the float! They along with their leadership procoded the liquidity to run the tables and stave off bankruptcy and now thanks to these efforts have more liquidity than ever in the life of AMC
As I think back on today's ER there has only been two CEOs that have publicly thanked all of the apes for saving their company and not letting them be another Toys r us 
GMEs RC and AMCs AA.
I could be wrong but I haven't heard NIO ceo or SNDL ceo or even Blackberry CEO be so grateful to the apes and blue collar workers of America for keeping their companies in business 
For this reason in the morning I will begin liquidating my portfolio and placing my money where people and companies appreciate us investors and us retards and autists
AMC has already publicly stated apes own the float to the tune of 4/5 that's over 80%. Imagine if every ape believed in Top Gun or their first video game or their first cop a feel in the AMC theaters growing up..And felt they believed in keeping the American and European, Korean, Chinese, and so on dreams alive and dug deep and bought just one 9 dollar share of AMC or a fractional of GME with 9 dollars how the world might be in a few days. I by no means mean everyone buy cause if you don't believe in the people and companies that believe in us and have our backs cause we have theirs and have great fundamentals then yeah you shouldn't buy into it. But ... if you believe in fundamentals if you like the companies and their leadership and you,  just like them want to see the blue collar workers of America and Europe take back what we have built then buy a share to show back your appreciation. I truly believe AMC and GME might be in fact the first companies ever owned by the hard working people of America and not the ones in the ivory towers! Aaron said it best a year ago if I wanted to speak to our investors I'd go to China and speak with a company or two out there that owned us.. today I speak on behalf of the 3.2M redditors and apes on youtube and who knows.... if enough people like the stocks you might just make some money along the way! And might just cause a margin call or twenty! Apes Stick Togerher! 

TLDR: sticking by the Silverbacks that stick by the apes and have our backs as much as we have theirs and appreciate what we've done for their companies !"

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CORSAIR GAMING (CRSR) criminally undervalued. The stock launched in early november, shortly after reporting revenue of 457 million dollars with 36 million in net earnings, after the launch the stock spiked at 50 dollars a share riding the wave of the gaming stock boom. However, as the price has been slowly pissing away the financials are looking more and more sexy.

Q1 2021 financials where absolutely amazing for Corsair with 530 million in revenue and 46 million net earnings. This coincides with the huge increase in advertising budget of the company spending millions on partnerships with twitch and youtube creators.
Despite this the timid investing boomers appear to still be concerned that the gaming stocks will all be crippled when all of us retards get out of lockdown and become active members of society.
As we are all hopefully self aware enough to know this will not happen.

Obviously I am not an expert on investing but there's no risk in pointing out this obvious discrepancy in how the company is doing and that green line going down appearing to defy logic."

&#x200B;

The gist of it though: 

Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy.

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)).

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR.

Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"
2021-05-07 03:50:03,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on what it should be valued right now?
2021-05-07 08:27:13,wallstreetbets,"PE ratio isn't horrible compared to many 'growth stocks', but it is still kinda considered a tech stock.  Market seems to be getting more wary of stocks with rapid growth, especially tech and those with high PE.

Looks like CRSR found support around $30.  I'd expect it to keep going up unless their financials and revenue take a bad turn,  only I'd expect the growth of the stock price to be much slower going forward with sell offs any time it starts to rise too fast.  

Just an opinion I pulled out my ass, but it makes sense to me and my brain.  I am holding a measly 10 shares, so bias included."

People laughed at or ignored Roaring Kitty/DFV when he presented his position and thesis a year ago. The dude was doing 4 hour live streams on youtube and had 20 people at the most back last September when I first tuned in - and even then people were giving him shit in the live chat. Everyone seems to forget Rod Alzmann as well he was doing great DD on GME then as well with no attention.

Anyway, if you're looking for the ""next big investor"" then look at the guy/gal who does a huge amount of in-depth and passionate DD on 1 or 2 stocks, has a sizeable position on it, and has little to no online following and who everyone thinks is batshit crazy."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WHAT IS GOING ON WITH EHTH?!?! Alright you smooth brained apes! I got a question for you! Why did eHealth (ticker: EHTH) report positive Q1 Results on April 29th, see their stock price jump 10% on April 3oth, and then on that same day, see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price????

Well, I used the one wrinkle in my silky smooth brain to:

* Value EHTH over $100 per share and;
* Speculate that HIG Capital might be pushing the stock price down

**Who is eHealth?**

eHealth is an insurance brokerage. Insurance companies use brokerages like eHealth and its competitors to sell insurance to individuals, families, and small businesses. As long as the people stay active (aka pay their premiums) to the insurance companies, the insurance companies pay a commission over to the brokerages. So the more people they enroll into a plan, and the longer they stay, the more they earn.

eHealth operates their business in two segments: (1) Medicare, and (2) Individual, Family and Small Business. The Medicare segment represents the majority of the business and constituted approximately 89%, and 88% of revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Medicare-related health insurance plans including medicare advantage, medicare supplement, and medicare part D prescription drug plans.

The biggest bulk of their business is from the Medicare Advantage Insurance Plans so I’ll talk about that market really quickly. Medicare Advantage is a health insurance alternative to the Original Medicare. These Plans may have lower out-of- pocket costs than Original Medicare, which is why people prefer this over the original. Generally, people aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare.

So how big is the total addressable market? Well, according to their annual report, there are “10,000 people on average turning 65 **every day** over the next ten years”.  This translates to approximately 3.65M new potential enrollees per year. eHealth and its competitors all claim that the market is growing quickly and that they’ve barely tapped the market. In 2020, eHealth approved only 387k members (approximately 1% of people eligible).  Its direct competitors, GoHealth and SelectQuote, have made similar claims about the size of the market and have comparable market share.

Additionally, eHealth has ecommerce platforms that organize and present health insurance information in various formats that enable individuals, families, and small businesses to research, analyze, compare, and purchase a range of health insurance plans. As each year passes, new annual cohorts of eligible seniors become more tech savvy.  As the market transitions online, eHealth’s cost of acquisitions decreases.

**So what is eHealth worth?**

As briefly mentioned eHealth spends money upfront to acquire a new member for Insurance Companies, and throughout the life of the policy, the insurance companies pay eHealth in the form of commissions. In light of the business model, the key metrics the company uses for each business segment is:

* Approved Members - represents the number of individuals on submitted applications that were approved by the relevant insurance carrier for the identified product during the current period.
* Lifetime Value (LTV) – Estimated Monthly Commissions x Estimated Months the policy will be active
* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – Average cost to acquire a new member through different channels such as the ecommerce platform or through TV ads.

Using the averages for these metrics from 2017 to 2020, I do the sum of the parts valuation below:

&#x200B;

[Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/nr9u8xhtumx61.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=c023d4f78527cf8d4972b1390285aa3803fb5970)

I think the valuation might be conservative because:

* The multiple I used is low relative to my expectations of growth
* CAC should decrease relative to historical because more members are being acquired through the ecommerce platform rather than more costly channels
* Management has expressed that they are trying to control the fixed expenses and historical have shown it go down as a % of revenues YOY.

**Why do I think HIG Capital is holding the stock down?**

Now we get to the speculative part. Since the stock’s big drop in late January (missed Q4 earnings estimates), the stock has been trending upwards. Notable upward pricing movements have been caused by SEC filings revealing that some well -established activist value funds (Starboard Value and Hudson Executive Capital) have entered positions into EHTH. Then, on April 29, EHTH ended the day on $70 a share and released its Q1 earnings results after hours. It was overwhelmingly positive. EHTH outperformed and beat its top line and earnings estimates.

So what happened on April 30th? The stock price started off strong and rose 10% to about $77 a share and then started cratering by 9:40, ending the day at $71 a share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3veojj9yumx61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=1912d43d9e1a19d6780acd7a80e1e13210075b7a

Why? HIG Capital just so happens to finalize its $225 million investment of convertible stocks in EHTH on April 30th. See the filing date below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ipz5h44zumx61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7888f4436eb38766adff24377be1976fa48c8b26

Reading the terms of the agreement, it looks beneficial for HIG to have EHTH’s stock price be depressed until May 31st. The reason is because of the conversion terms. After May 31st, HIG gets to convert their investment of $225M preferred stock into equity based on the following formula:

Shares of Equity = Accrued Value of Preferred Stock/Conversion Price

Per the investment agreement, the conversion price is 125% X the Arithmetic Price Average for 120 days following January 29, 2021, subject to a max of $90 and a min of $50. So the lower the conversion price, the more shares of Equity they get.  Conversely, the higher the conversion price, the less shares they get.

Further evidence of this can be seen in abnormal trading volumes since the day of the earnings report:

I’m speculating that it’s HIG doing it because there’s no other noticeable market participant that would want to push the stock price down. Additionally, I think it’s only one party than a coordinate group of individuals all coincidentally pushing trades at the same time to cause several Millions of dollars’ worth of EHTH stock to be traded at any given time. I mean, the amount of money from these trades is almost $20M.

**So what?**

Anyone buying shares would be able to buy shares of EHTH at artificially depressed prices. Furthermore, if enough demand pushes the price high enough, then it could push HIG's conversion price to increase, causing less of the value to be accretive to HIG and more to common equity. So if the stock price goes up, equity investors gains on two fronts!

**Risks:**

Investing has risks and you can lose money. From a fundamentals standpoint, EHTH:

* Might not be able to maintain or Increase its approved members or LTV
* Might not be able to maintain or decrease its CAC
* Might be affected negatively by other externalities such as regulation

Additionally, HIG might be able to pull off a conversion that’s value accretive from equity investors to them.

Finally, my thesis on HIG is highly speculative and I could be completely off on this one. It really could be because there are other big investors that don't believe in EHTH anymore...

**Disclaimer:**

I may have made mistakes in my analysis or I might have missed information. You gotta do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. If you lose money, it’s entirely your fault.  FYI, I have call options in EHTH. Also, I’m not a great proofreader so I might have typos…

**TLDR:**

* Valued EHTH at more than $100
* Speculating that HIG Capital is artificially pushing the stock price down because of its investment in preferred stock
* They want to keep the stock price depressed to they can convert for more equity shares and have more value accretive to them
* Because of their hanky-panky, we are presented with an attractive opportunity to buy the stock at depressed prices and potentially push the stock price up high enough that it’s more value accretive to us than to HIG"
2021-05-07 02:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Without delving too much into specifics, I had options way back in 2019/2020 and made some decent money on the fall. Main point is their accounting model literally allows them to book any form of customer retention and book future returns as revenue today. (Think Enron and mark to market) 

Huge amount spent on mass marketing to scoop up any kind of customer which can leave after a few months and usually do (they have high customer turn over) 

Listened to a few analyst calls and you can hear very specific wording that sounds ... less then vanilla. Insider selling is also VERY high. 

Lastly, as much as your DD might provide an opp, there are better risk/return values on other stocks etc, why try to pick a side in EHTH with all their problems and potential manipulation."

2021-05-07 04:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Actually fuck it, could be a good opp. Added time in calendar to do some DD, will let you know the play when I make one. This HIG conversion is VERY interesting. If true it’s blatant market manipulation but probably legal."
2021-05-07 03:52:54,wallstreetbets,"Respectfully disagree. Their Revenue Recognition, although aggressive, is in compliance with US GAAP. The intention of the new Revenue Recognition principle was to help represent the true economics of businesses where originally, the costs are incurred up front and the revenues come later (like tech companies). EHTH and its Competitors use this standard so it seems to be an industry norm. 

That being said, accounting in general has limitations that don't allow it to fully represent the true economics of all businesses all the time. So you have to apply some judgement. 

The key thing is how you're going to convert accounting numbers to free cash flow. In the case Medicare Advantage, let's say each member has a life of 3 years.  You would recognize the full amount of the customer acquisition cost in the current year as a cash outflow, recognize a third of revenue in the current year as a cash inflow, a third of revenue in the following year as a cash inflow, and then recognize the last third in the year after as a cash inflow. 

If you think management is full of shit and you think the life is... Say 2 years you could adjust your model for 2 years of inflows. 


Any chance you can point me to the specific instances where the wording was less than vanilla?"
2021-05-07 04:56:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm not an expert on this ticker but this is also what I've heard, and honestly the charts looks like dog shit, and short term this is going to deflate, at least not break $75 anytime in the near future. I see a lot of short sentiment here (which btw to the post op this doesn't mean it's ""artificially deflated"", it just means people think it's a shit stock). People have been saying $80 target forever, and it's disappointed all of those people. Good luck OP, I honestly hope I'm wrong, but I am definitely not a buyer."
2021-05-07 12:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'll be honest. The HIG market manipulation is speculation and I don't have enough evidence to say it was 100% them. I'm not even sure if this information is publicly available. BUT the trading activity occurring after the finalization of the deal is highly suspect! 

The other obvious party that wants the stock to go down could be Muddy Waters. But just the chronology of events makes them second to HIG."
2021-05-07 04:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Vanilla comment was from meetings in 2019/20 so May not be relevant today. 

Perhaps I just need to look at all the recent news / announcements as I was trading this 2 years back, things can change. Models adapt etc. 

Maybe they were just bullshitting their way to the top and are now capitalizing on it. The DD post provides a lot of useful info. 

I was just latching onto muddy waters research from back in the day. Easy money."
2021-05-07 08:09:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not entirely sure why the negative sentiment but what I've seen is generally the following:

&#x200B;

* Market Participants that held the stock from it's high to it's drop and now have a bad taste when thinking about EHTH and its management
* Momentum traders who see a stock going down and think that because it's been going down that it'll keep going down - Their viewpoint is based on recent price movements and would unknowingly feed into the game I think HIG is playing
* People who read the Muddy Waters Report and buy into it.

&#x200B;

Here are my thoughts on the Muddy Waters Report:

&#x200B;

* Misleading/Aggressive Accounting - as mentioned, in another post EHTH is in compliance with US GAAP and there is nothing misleading about it.  Accounting doesn't always represent economic realities so you have to make your own judgements about how to convert Accounting to Free Cash Flow. Refer to my comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6r47x/what\_is\_going\_on\_with\_ehth/gx90izx?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6r47x/what_is_going_on_with_ehth/gx90izx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* Churn - They accused EHTH of measuring churn in a way that favors them but if you look up how churn is normally calculated (in the tech industry for example), it's not actually as underhanded as Muddy Waters makes it out to be. I actually think the way they measure churn makes a lot of sense. 
* Retention - EHTH has actually been addressing this head on. They think that churn is caused by the external agents selling plans to people that doesn't actually fit their needs so they were seeing a lot of churn from that subset of members. To address that they've started moving more agents in house and have updated their training process. They updated their payment structure so that agents get paid based on members staying longer. Also they have started to recapture individuals that switch within Medicare Advantage. They continue to report churn the same way without netting it out with the members they recaptured. 
* Cash Burn - There's huge cash burn if you're a growing company. Nothing scandalous about this. But Muddy Waters combines the cash burn with its opinion that EHTH has unprofitable growth to makes it look worse than it is. 
* Management Selling Stock - Management sells for a lot of reasons (pay for vacation, pay for divorce, or they have a lot of their net worth tied to one company and want to diversify, etc) But they only buy when they think the stock is going to go up.  The Muddy Waters Report came out in April 2020 and Management has purchased stock   in July and August 2020 in the $70s.

2021-05-07 12:17:26,wallstreetbets,"yeah, I think part of the challenge was that they started selling Medicare advantage around 2017. So there wasn't a lot of historical data for them to forecast churn. One of the reasons there was a drop in price in the past was because they got more data showing increased churn and then reported it! 

The Muddy Water Report conveyed their churn like they were intentionally being misleading. But I think they made a good faith estimate of churn, found out it was higher than originally calculated, and then reported it honestly."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Are we headed for a massive failure in the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market, which would have massive repercussions on the economy as a whole? https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-says-stock-market-boom-ebullient-investors-warrant-caution-2021-05-06/

decent article by Reuters today on the possible bubble worries but its much deeper. there is a host of issues.. the income of the commercial real estate holders has been inflated due to covid and the need to keep the mortgages afloat. 

So as the income has gotten inflated and these properties were bought up during covid, real estate prices rose like crazy, Im sure you noticed. So all the mortgages come in with inflated incomes but there is a selection of mortgages which yield higher premiums as they carry more risk. As maybe you know these are bundled, rated, and sold. Called Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities and there are plenty of CMBS ETFs worth total of hundreds of billions, if not over a trillion, on the market. With very large institutional holdings, obviously, which have large holdings.

The FED released their [Financial Stability Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20210506.pdf) today. Basically saying valuations are high. Equities more than doubled the avg annual growth (22.5 to 9%) last year, treasury securities have tripled avg annual growth (26 to  8.3%), high yield and unrated bonds have almost quadrupled it (25 to 7.1). Not to mention the risk premiums on high yield unrated bonds are to 2008 levels. 

Here is a key paragraph from the report on the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities market: ""Other indicators continue to show strains in CRE markets. Vacancy rates continue to increase, and rent growth has declined fur-ther. Additionally, delinquency rates on com-mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which usually contain riskier loans, remain elevated. Finally, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks, on net, reported weaker demand for most CRE loans and tighter lending standards in the fourth quarter of  2020 (figure 1-14)""

So basically, Commerial Real Estate is on an obvious bubble, about to come back down, and when it does, it is going to create a whole lot of turmoil. It will be reminiscent of 2008 as the bonds fail and tumble the house of cards.. again. Fuck.

Now Im sure if I know this, much smarter people do and have started hedging a market failure. So I have been paying attention to larger market options plays and noticed 60 million in puts bought on the S&P 500 today 7/16 strike 4000, 7/30 strike 3900, 9/17 strike 3100 and 3000 (30+million spent on just 9/17). All in large bulk orders. 

I am of the thesis we are about to see a massive correction on this mess.

I have no bear position and am sharing it as soon as I can because I think it is important."

""John M Griffen and Alex Priest are, respectively, a prominent professor of finance and a Ph.D. candidate at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. In a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) released last November, they sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019.

“Overall,” they write, “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” This was just the average, however: Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse, “having more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.”

UT Study referenced: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3671162](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162)

TLDR: The Dollar General that you go to while your wife is with her boyfriend is getting a loan on overstated operating income, when it goes under it's put back in another CMBS security with a slightly different address.  


""Flynn also alleges in the complaint that changes in names and addresses when loans are moved out of old trusts and into new ones are not an accident but suggestive of deliberate obfuscation. “The correlation of name and address changes with inflated numbers,” he says, “is something like 95 percent.”""

This thing involves like most big banks so nothing to see here....people (companies in this case drunk on low rates and ass loads of debt with low rates) always pay their mortgage....right"
2021-05-07 04:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Here is where greed always gets the best of the greedy: mortgages increase and increase and increase to the point where they become unaffordable and the people just quit.

There you are then with your super duper building. It’s empty and nobody’s showing up to replace the previous tenants because you made it unaffordable. Unaffordable: an inability to afford a product or service. Then the show stops. 

Every month the property is empty is a month of no income. Also: there’s a raging pandemic, people weren’t coming to the office anyway. What is the first thing companies do in that kind environment: they call everybody they regularly pay money to in order to renegotiate their contracts. And when that equation no longer works, it’s adios boys and girls, smell you later.

Eventually you’ll price everybody out of the market. Which you can be smug about until you realise that it means you’re not getting paid anymore, by anyone. Smart!"
2021-05-07 02:13:00,wallstreetbets,"This is the logical progression due to covid. May not necessarily happen too soon. But if everyone is working from home, businesses don't want to pay 30k or 5k in rent each month if no one's in the office. So as those leases expire, they won't get renewed. If no one fills their spot then you have increased vacancies. Increased vacancies for longer durations will lead to defaults to foreclosures to firesale prices and/or auctions.

A proxy for this is WeWork although they deal with much smaller customers. They'll see turnover quicker than the rest of the commercial market but they'll also see stagnation quicker."

2021-05-07 08:27:13,wallstreetbets,"This probably counts as confirmation bias for me. I’ve had a long term bear view of commercial real estate without factoring in systemic fraud, based upon electrification of transportation. Catalysts. In order of likely occurence:

1. Work from home. Well addressed by everyone already, and already underway.
2. Electric cars leading to a glut of prime corner real estate. Well over 90% of charging is done at home. The grid is everywhere. Gas stations will not survive. They are expensive sites to repurpose due to possible ground contamination, but again these are high traffic, valuable corners. (I usually lump car dealerships in here too).
3. When autonomy is solved and transportation as a service becomes the norm parking lots will be huge empty wastelands of easily repurposed square footage. There are 5 parking spots for each car in this country because our cars are parked north of 95% of the day. If car usage of even just 50% of the day is achieved by robotaxis or auto-ubers or whatever the fuck you want to call them... well you can see the implications.
4. Future developments such as electric VTOL, expansion of immersive online environments, loops and hyperloops etc. all can have outsized impact.

So, any one know how to trade something with so many near and long term looming disruptions?

2021-05-07 18:52:43,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for directing me to the rabbit hole of looking up bonds held by iShare CMBS and then the SEC filings about holdings!

I'm seeing a lot of 95%+ physical occupancy numbers at origination in the first bond I found info on ([https://sec.report/Document/0001056404-21-005425/](https://sec.report/Document/0001056404-21-005425/)), and not a lot of change in the current occupancy rate. **How much does this need to drop on average for these to go underwater?** Of course, there is more to consider like the rental rates even if they can maintain 95%+, but I'm ignoring that for the moment.

My guess is that these rates are high because leases have yet to expire, and many who have moved out will be looking to sublease (I'm office-hunting right now and many are sublease from companies who have decided to go remote or close satellite offices - sometimes post-renovation having never occupied!).

**Any feelings about how much income or occupancy needs to drop?** I've also reached out to my CRE guy to get his feels for what the REAL occupancy rates are.

If we each chip in our brain cell, perhaps we can untangle these numbers and find out where the jankiest bonds are. While we can't short the bonds without our hunting license, we CAN short the ETF's that hold them.

This idea of refinancing or buying, to the point of having no inventory left, because interest rates were so low and you could get a 25 years fixed rate that basically meant a discount on the house, was a stupid one.

Any construction on a house this year, will cost AT LEAST 25 % more than normal. And that, my friends, will make a lot of people fold.

2021-05-07 05:09:49,wallstreetbets,"I think it may be too soon to call this yet. A lot depends on how quickly new leases are being signed now because it seems we are at the point where if cash flows pick up we very well may skip a major wave of defaults, whereas if cash flows keep on plummeting it is going to be bad. That said, for those concerned about inflation who have excess cash, buying real estate might be something they want to do, so perhaps we see people come in and buy the properties, perhaps at a discount, and the mortgages get paid back and the new owner is much less leveraged. The new owner has their supposed inflation hedge and the mortgage issue is cleaned up."

To pile on, you can look at Manhattan real estate as a microcosm of what's going on.  You have empty retail space after empty retail space, with rent prices that no business either can, or wants to afford, and the property owners, hoping to just flip the property, can't just lower the rental price because that would reduce the income, thereby reducing the value of the property to the next buyer, so the space sits empty while the investors hope some new sucker will come in and pay the rent so they can flip their investment to the next commercial property speculator/investor.  This is very similar behavior to 2008, where people (investors) would buy homes on 3 year ARMs, or interest only loans, with no intention of ever living in them, they just wanted to flip the property at a higher price later. 

Now add alleged systemic fraud into that mix, as highlighted by that Ryan Grim article, and that's where we are, just waiting around to see who gets caught holding the bag."

Box stores were what started the decline, the internet is what ended its life... the last faint pulse in the corpse will cease once work from home becomes a part of standard business practice (and they're already drafting up the strategies for it at most companies) 

I travel for business a lot and am old enough to remember a bit of my adult life, outside the information age, when commercial real estate was needed and vibrant. Been a lot of places, seen a lot of things. Doesn't matter where you go these days, high end or low, all those strip malls, all those little standalones alongside the major artery highways, are a byproduct of the 70s-90s when commercial real estate generated fantastic cash flow WHILE allowing you to hold the underlying asset. 

Now go look at it. Its a complete fucking mess. Basically derelict. People just don't need buildings to sell shit anymore. Strip malls are always filled with the same nonsense businesses (payday advance, restaurants, pawnbrokers, hair parlors, coffee places, ""We Buy Gold"", Oriental Massage...), all of which fold up on a relatively short timeline. 

There just isn't the metabolism for CRE that there once was... and now add work from home? Forget it.

2021-05-07 01:19:29,wallstreetbets,"Banks take deposits and loan out those deposits in the form of loans.  They pay an interest rate on the deposit (they are buying money) and earn an interest rate on a loan (they are selling money).

When regulations say you can't make more loans because you don't have enough deposits, a bank can either sell the loans on their books or securitize them.  If they are mortgages, they securitize them into mortgage backed securities.  They can be commercial or residential.

Let's say a bank has a million in loans and can make no more loans until they take in more deposits or reduce their loan positions.  They can 1) sell loans in a very slow process 2) securitize that pool of loans by delivering them to a trust.  In both cases they raise cash to make new loans, and offload the risk they were previously carrying by holding those loans.  


The benefit of creating a security out of the loans is that you can trade it quickly.  Whole loan transactions take FOREVER by comparison."
2021-05-07 01:50:53,wallstreetbets,"RKT creates loans and sells them, and I believe only in the residential space.  So they don't own loans, other than what they have in their pipeline.  If they retain servicing (MSRs) rights on their residential mortgages, these actually increase in value as rates go up because REFIs at lower rates are the enemy of MSRs.  Puts on RKT wouldn't create an exposure to CMBS risk.  However, a slowing mortgage and REFI market would put pressure on RKT's revenue stream, because they make money creating loans. Not by holding them.

Puts on REITS with high exposure to the commercial MBS market or commercial loan market.  Or actual ownership of commercial properties.  But beware, CMBS can be way more resilient than the economy makes them out to be.

CIT used to have tons of commercial loan exposure but IDK if they still do, post reorganization.

Saved by COVID! I have friends who built a far nicer building closer to the hospital and with agreements from the hospital administration to lease (evidently non-binding). The hospital backed out and now there’s a beautiful, empty, 4 story competitor to my potential 70’s refurb strip mall."
2021-05-07 08:56:19,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for that perspective. I could not agree more.

I’m going to say that we have come to appreciate the social importance of a hair salon. It’s about as basic as it gets, that doesn’t make it any less essential. I say: give our hair care professionals the room they need!

Of course, they don’t need a 10-story building or an entire mall.

I have to say that I don’t mind going to a store to buy things. There is a social function besides merely shopping for the thing. Also: Amazon needs competition.

I can see where the professional real estate market is going to face an ‘adjustment'. I can’t imagine that companies have mourned the fact that they don’t have to lease huge amounts of office space and that they are just giddy about all that money they’re not spending.

I’m happy I’m not in real estate, it’s not going to be a fun business to be in."

2021-05-07 04:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Ehh. I see WeWork as nimble/small enough to pivot a little bit. They could come out of the pandemic ""stronger"" by taking over leases for cheap, thus growing their own footprint, and being the ""leader"" of the future of work -- hybrid remote/in-person companies seeking temporary, flexible office space for meetings and/or events in different regions.

&#x200B;

There really aren't many B2B companies that exist that provide consistent work/event space throughout the country other than WeWork (or what they could become)...other than maybe hotels.

&#x200B;

Also WeWork as a brand and marketing company probably has a longer runway, in addition to the fact that they've had enough VC money to stay afloat and are set to be publicly traded. Basically they're not terribly different than Uber (not that I'm suggesting either company has a particularly bright financial future).

&#x200B;

Point is: WeWork may actually be set up to come out of the pandemic *stronger* than they were before since they are smaller/more nimble and aren't weighed down by real estate holdings, merely leases."

So based on what my mom has been telling me, and what I’ve noticed, over the last year we’ve seen historically low interest rates being issued on homes due to the pandemic.  And people are buying homes now more than ever.  The problem is people are buying homes quite literally faster than people can build them so there’s a very low supply in homes at the moment, yet a constant demand.  This leads to inflation and the bubble that the og poster was talking about being formed.

2021-05-07 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,"You're thinking along the right track, at least as I expect the future to unfold.  Businesses where physical colocation of the customer and the worker will persist.  Whether this is a requirement or not (it is not for a fantastic and growing amount of companies) will determine whether a companies employees do their work in an office or home.  No office can compete with the benefits of remote work, they just can't.  You instantly shrink your talent pool you can draw from to almost nothing, take on huge equipment and maintenance costs, the lease, etc.  It's really a monumental cost for any business to take on - with no clear return on that investment.  On balance, offices likely destroy value rather than create it.  

So once an appreciable portion of the public works remotely... shit changes.  More than you expect.  Expect a rebirth of local communities.  Neighborhoods will be a thing again.  Because people will actually be present, and humans are abundantly social animals.  The scale of change might take decades to fully be realized, but computers and the Internet basically solved the problem that the Industrial Revolution created.  Industrial Revolution required factories with a centralized workforce, which birthed dense cities, and resulted in a large pile of nearly-identical goods.  That invented the problem that would rule the next century - Distribution.  Solving that problem built empires.  Empires that have been eroding and failing and dying since 1990.  The Internet, by and large, solved it.  It's not a valuable thing to solve any more.  In fact, most of those empires got built in ways that restrict them from even taking advantage of the Internet, so they persist with negative value, actively destroying rather than creating.

But let me cut this short or I'll be ranting all day like the madman I likely am... There are 2 things to consider to predict our future.  What things changed as a cost of adopting central-factory-driven practices?  Those changes are no longer paying for themselves.  (Offices are one, born from the back offices of manufacturing factories and run the same way today)  Second, what things did we accept we would have to do without in order to have that structure?

We're going to stop paying those costs.  And we're going to stop doing without.  We're going to have to pick something that factories offered and do without that, sure, but we'll feel the tradeoff is worth it eventually.  But I'm serious when I say the scale is more than anyone can possibly imagine.  The Industrial Revolution changed religion.  It changed medicine (its why you were told you'd go blind if you touched yourself).  It changed architecture (unless you have a house with only a common room and kitchen).  It changed families (its why you didn't have kids as a teen and why thats socially unacceptable).  We shouldn't expect all these sorts of things to just reverse, of course, but they are most definitely on the table."

Prices fell, 1st and 2nd lien loans on homes had balances that looked like they would never be equal to the value of the home, so people defaulted.   


Currently we have excess demand and no supply of houses.  So prices will continue to rise.  And there is a price floor in the SFR (single family rental) machine that is sucking up supply as it comes to market.     


When rates go up. it will be hard times for non-bank mortgage originators, for sure.  No one is refi-ing their 30 year 2.75% mortgage any time soon.  And the upward trend of home price appreciation will slow, but home prices won't collapse again unless supply shifts dramatically."

2021-05-07 01:31:27,wallstreetbets,"not really, I mean, yes they are getting all the holes, but not in this case.  It actually enables economic growth.  You don't have 300k now but you want a house, so you buy the money (take out a loan).    


they earn the spread.  They borrow money from you at 0.5% in an overnight savings account, and lend it out for 30 years at 3.5%.  This is called ""maturity transformation"". They earn 3% on the amount deposited, then lent out, less the reserve requirement.  This earnings stream is called net interest margin.    


In your savings account, you are taking overnight risk and it is FDIC insured.  In a mortgage, the bank is taking 30 year risk, and so is compensated for the time risk plus credit risk.  This is the basis for how a ""normal yield curve"" functions.  Tying money up for longer creates risk that should be compensated for.    


If you lent your friend money for a week at an interest rate, you could give him a lower rate because you know what his condition will be in a week.  If you lend to him for 5 years, you might want a higher interest rate to compensate for that default risk, reinvestment risk, etc.  
On securitization...

Take a bank in south florida, lots of retirees, not a lot of loan demand, but tons of deposits.  They need to sell the money they are buying to make NIM.  They can do so by buying loans from a bank in, lets say Arizona, where there is a population growth of young people that want loans but don't have deposits.  Now the Florida bank is earning money on it's deposits it holds, and the Arizona bank has freed up capital to make new loans, spurring economic growth.  Securitization, if used prudently, is a great thing."
2021-05-07 01:26:05,wallstreetbets,Duh?
2021-05-07 02:11:00,wallstreetbets,"The bigger issue is that when interest rates go up, they will originate less mortgages.  Remember, they aren't holding those loans to mid-low income borrowers.  They originate the loan and then immediately turn around and sell it, getting it off their balance sheet.    


If they retain servicing for loans to low quality borrowers, that could potentially be a problem.  But retaining servicing is a hedge for an origination pipeline slowing down.    


If you make 0.50% servicing a loan pool of a billion dollars, the slower it pays down the higher the value of that cash flow.  If interest rates drop, those loans refi, and you no longer have that cash flow stream because those loans get refi-ed out of the MSRs.  It's basically the same as owning mortgage IO CMOs.  You are long prepayment risk"

Desires and wishes inevitably succumb to numbers.  What you propose is companies ignoring clear competitive advantage for - what - creature comforts.  Mostly for executives and manager parasites, sure, so they've got say, but that just delays the inevitable, it doesn't prevent it.  The benefits of remote work are extremely expansive.  What does it do to corporate HR departments?  Legal?  Corporations are large beasts nowadays, and they've got a lot of moving pieces, and each will radically change in their necessity, size, etc.  The problems they deal with will change, so they will change in response.  

Sales will obviously persist as a needed service.  But... it will definitely change.  If the majority of your customers no longer have a central office, how do you cope?  If they have a central office, but the departments your product appeals to are fully remote now, how do you cope?  When your competitors are hiring people living in 'the boonies' and to maintain your once-a-week-in-office comfort you can only pay 33% more for entry level positions so they can manage the rent near the metropolis that has the amenities your CEO likes which is increasingly barren... how long do you think this will remain sustainable?"

The CMBS market can be more stable than the economy makes it out to be.  They are often structured with first loss pieces, and credit stratified.  So AAA piece holders have pretty good protection against losses.    


CMBS are often issued in tranches, both time and credit tranched.  

And remember, they are mortgages, so the underlying collateral in a CMBS trust has liquidation value.  They are secured.  You could have problems with servicers and cash flows and stuff in specific CMBS issues, but during the last financial crisis, which was much longer and likely worse for commercial properties, there weren't too many problems, relative to residential.  


But you will definitely probably see some CMBS deals blow up.  Also they are likely capable of being delivered to the discount window, so banks that hold AAA rated pieces of these deals can raise cash without liquidating at firesale prices.  


Read the link, it isn't a terrible description of how they work, and is pretty digestible.

2021-05-07 14:05:36,wallstreetbets,"2 things I can think of:
1. I highly doubt whoever is purchasing these cmbs' are doing any appraisal valuations other than taking whatever is provided by the seller. 
2. Appraisers absolutely will inflate values if paid to do so. There's a reason that the appraisal regulations changed after 2008 and the creation of the CFPB. This happened widely in the past.  The only issue here is these are mostly CONSUMER regulations, and this is specifically commercial. Very little oversight in this area changed after 2008. 

For context, I used to personally call appraisers myself to get valuations on CRE in the past. You build a relationship with these guys. While yes they're licensed and whatnot, it's still just an opinion of value. If I hypothetically provided them with some slightly inflated leases from a tenant that were indeed executed by the tenant, they wouldn't have changed anything unless it was substantially outside of market numbers.  In the case of the Dollar General leases that were researched, that's most likely what they did; say you're paying 100k a month while you're really paying 50k.  It's fraud. 

This is just my two cents from my experiences. I'm so retarded I eat 🖍🖍🖍 and shit 🌈."
2021-05-07 18:20:41,wallstreetbets,"It's a weird response since, especially the last part, feeds right into why WeWork would be a great alternative service for small/mid-size companies that don't need semi-permanent inflexible office space. WeWork would be perfect for any company's sales team members looking for space to prepare for meetings.

Companies have and WILL gladly pay thousands per month for corporate WeWork subscriptions for their staff to work at a physical location anywhere in the world.

The larger point is that while the trend will be towards remote, it won't come all at once. Or rather, as quarantine/travel restrictions are lifted, many companies aren't going to completely eschew physical office space.

We can agree it won't go back to what it was before, yes a bit of a charade for middle managers to have a presence in order to justify their salaries.

However, the whole idea of working 10 hours per week, while certainly healthy and a nice fantasy, isn't realistic either as long as there are driven people willing to earn more money. And it's a very American (and Japanese) thing to obsess over work.

As people are given options to work with companies that have limited or no physical presence, allowing full remote work, that does NOT mean all employees will prefer working from home -- you might like it, but there are plenty who went through the pandemic and realize working from home, at least 100% of the time, is not desirable.

What the means is we'll see two things:

* Higher wages offered for companies that demand/prefer on-premise staff
* Most companies will hire remote staff when new roles are needed
* Many companies will operate hybrid on-premise/remote going forward

Again, fully remote is a long-term fantasy that you might want, but that's not how the corporate world works."
2021-05-07 10:48:18,wallstreetbets,Earnings are past tense. Commodity stocks are tied directly to commodity prices. There is very little arbitration that can done between those assets. These demand you see are all just artificial spin to justify a bubble price.

Currently steel prices are still increasing, not even flattening. 

There is no artificial demand for steel. The demand exists and it is very real. I'm obviously very interested in this discussion as I have a lot riding on it, so if you have some real concerns or information that you believe will push the steel industry down, please go tell all at /r/Vitards."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLUG: The Cash Shredder **tl;dr: PLUG uses its shareholders' hard-earned cash to fund a money-losing business which may never be economical, with big profits for mega-cap retailers along the way.**

It's me, the [butt plug gay bear](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) from a few weeks ago. Remember when PLUG was over 30 bucks a share? Good times, I could get the June $20 puts for like 50 cents. Not anymore!

I want to talk to you today about how PLUG makes its money. The usual way to answer this question is by reading the latest 10-K -- but PLUG still hasn't filed a 10-K for 2020 despite being [10 days](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921038399/tm219753d3_8k.htm) from losing compliance with NASDAQ listing rules and risking being de-listed. This would be bad for the stock.

The 10-K (people in the industry* call it just a ""K"" for short) is pretty long and boring anyway, but luckily the SEC makes companies file financial statements every quarter, so we can look at [the Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm) to see what PLUG was doing during the first 9 months of 2020.

Take a look at the Statement of Cash Flows on page 7. The first column of numbers indicates how much money PLUG got or made from doing stuff over those 9 months, with regular numbers meaning they made money and numbers in (parentheses) meaning they used money. In the course of doing business stuff, PLUG burned an astonishing amount of cash -- something like $182 million, which I get by adding the ""net cash used in operating activities"" line to the ""purchases of property, plant and equipment"" and ""purchases for construction of leased property"" lines. They also spent another $40 million on acquisitions. All that money has to come from somewhere. But if it's not coming from business activities, then where?

Look no further than the ""net cash provided by financing activities"" line -- a robust $590 million. More than half of that is from ""proceeds from public offerings, net of transaction costs"" -- selling stock. How does Plug Power make its money? By selling stock (and issuing convertible debt).

If you go back and look at the [2019 K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020002267/plug-20191231x10k.htm) -- sorry, I know it's long -- they will tell you outright that this is the only way they've ever made money: ""We have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation."" They've lost $1.4 billion in their lifetime as a public company, according to the Q. But they think they're on the right track: ""In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused."" 

So let's talk just a bit about those early adoption markets. If you know anything about PLUG, you likely know that they sell hydrogen fuel cell systems (the brand name is ""GenKey"") to Amazon and Walmart for use in forklifts. But you might not know why Amazon and Walmart might be interested in such a thing. This is -- I apologize -- another bit where you have to read a bit more. If you go back to the latest Q and read Note 12, you will see that Amazon and Walmart got warrants -- effectively, call options with a strike price a bit over $1, so effectively shares right now -- to buy these fuel cells from PLUG. Amazon has paid PLUG $200M and gotten 30 million shares in return (currently worth north of $600M) -- whenever the stock was over $8 from 2017 to late 2020, Amazon could turn a profit by buying stuff from PLUG and immediately trashing it. (That breakeven point for AMZN is now considerably higher, at about $33.) Walmart has paid something like $50 million for 13 million shares, also a nice profit. (Their breakeven is still at $8 -- what does it say about PLUG's products that Walmart isn't buying more of them?)

Where is this money that Amazon and Walmart is making coming from, by the way? Well, it's coming from the people they sell the stock to -- but more broadly it's coming from PLUG shareholders as a group, because the supply of PLUG stock is expanding. 

PLUG is probably not going to de-list from the NASDAQ. They need to raise money from the equity markets to survive, and they can do that much more easily and efficiently on a big exchange than they could on the pink sheets. But they're going to have to restate their accounts from the last few years because of these warrants -- and it's not clear that they'll be able to make such a deal again. If you want to support the transition to clean energy, find a nice cobalt miner or battery company or something; don't try and catch this falling knife.

*Despite [some guesses in the comments of my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/gu03v8s/) investing's just my hobby. But I don't want to fault /u/nastysnacks' deductive powers; they correctly concluded that I'm betting against PLUG, maybe on the evidence of my stated position."

I get it, its easy to disregard fundamentals when  you bought at $22+ in January during the GameStop short squeeze, and now  you're suffering the cognitive dissonance from having to catch a  falling knife in an attempt to ""average down"" on your FOMO based  speculative bet.

There won't be another short squeeze, current short interest is at less than 2%.  The company simply does not make money nor create value for shareholders.

I’m not going to try and convince anyone of anything you’ve said nothing to convince me they aren’t on the right track I know that much.  If they can execute what they want to do and that falls on Chen then the company has a ton of potential for the future, there is always a chance they won’t execute and I’d like to see a few nice earnings reports but it’s a gamble on the future. I’m pretty sure people were saying the same thing about AMD back in the day.  I want to be apart of a turnaround story more than I’m worried about losing a couple bucks personally so I’ll hold till the end of time if I have to or they go to zero I don’t care.

2021-05-07 00:51:57,wallstreetbets,The company was around $7 before the hype train. Nothing has really changed with the company since then. Just because you bought at $20 doesn't mean it was ever worth that much.

We all yell and scream the hedges are the ones fucking with us, but in reality it's these fuckers buying options and telling us "" this is the way buy the stock"". Down vote if you want.

2021-05-07 01:11:56,wallstreetbets,I’ve been banging this drum since the start. This company has steadily shrunk since 2015. They are a tech company that cannot compete with other tech companies and get bullied out of every business they’re in.

2021-05-07 13:33:22,wallstreetbets,"I mean yeah you're not wrong we all should have sold at $20+ and re-bought in now but I did and still think fair market for this business is [\>$60 a share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) acutally having done fundamental diligence.

You'll find all of us $BB bagholders have the same regrets but we all share a long-term belief in the Company - There's a reason why many of us didnt sell during the height of the meme craziness and that's b/c we think -market fluctuations aside - this is a good business with great prospects. It's hard to time the markets and I've gotten my balls raked over coals last few months but long term continue to believe in the company's strategy, its cybersecurity and IoT businesses (esp. teh automotive segment), and its relative value compared to competitors in the space."

Or at least that’s what I tell myself, thankfully I only spent like 200$ on them"

They have a great future and I have no doubt people that bought in at any price this past year will go green, it's just a very slow change over from all you retards thinking it's just a shitty cell maker.  

It may take 2+ years, but this is not gme this is a legit buy and hold.  Sucks it got caught up with everything else because it has essentially the same value as pltr which is at $20 while bb is at $8, fucking explain that"
2021-05-07 08:36:20,wallstreetbets,That's not a long term play. That's a 0% interest loan to everyone selling BB stock.

2021-05-07 16:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Except your analysis is fundamentally flawed - BB is valued at a far lower P/S for many many reasons. It hasn't got anywhere near the revenue growth of a company like crowdstrike. BB revenue between FY20 - 21 dropped 10%, Crowdstrike grew 80%, Zscaler grew 46%, PNW 18%, Sailpoint 27%. You're comparing a declining company with booming companies and expecting them to share the same valuation.

Not to mention - you're either unaware, or not mentioning the **actual** competitors to BB. Blackberry's Cylance/UEM is more comparable to VMware, or Cisco. Both of which have P/S of around 5, like BB. Companies like Zscaler and SPT don't really have endpoint management or security software, and Crowdstrike's tech blows BB out of the water. Tbh most UES/M companies tech blows BB out of the water - Microsoft, Symantec, VMware etc. PNW UES isn't the best - but they've got a myriad of fantastic enterprise security products besides that, and they don't trade at multiples like Crowdstrike. Don't just lump all companies at the same valuations because they're in the cybersec space - that shows a serious lack of information about the nuances of the industry.

And BB isn't really a serious company when talking about cybersec. This is popular misinformation spread around this sub - when companies are talking seriously about enterprise security, at the top of their minds isn't BB.

Also it's a plain lie to say BB has a moat on all its products. They're barely a competitor on UEM/S. The only moat is QNX, which is an incredibly low revenue product - literally like 4$ or less per car per year.

Saying Chen takes his compensation primarily in stock is also stupid. Most CEOs take their compensation primarily in stock - it's how boards and shareholders enforce that share price is a priority to CEOs. Chen also has sold millions upon millions of stock - he's clearly not forseeing some huge price increase."
2021-05-07 08:57:51,wallstreetbets,There hasn't really been many good BB  DDs. Most of it is drooling shitters posting the same 5 articles and completing misunderstanding the same articles. See the posts a week or so back where there were claims the patent portfolio sale would be like $20bn.

The EV/AV revolution is a high stakes race, Tesla got significantly ahead in many areas, legacy auto companies got caught with their pants around their ankles. Now the scramble ensues. I think Tesla will keep their superior edge in battery, motor design, and are changing the game on manufacturing of car frames and large components. But Tesla is having trouble with repeated fatal accidents from “FSD” which is a misnomer...they haven’t figured it out. Plus I highly doubt the OS will pass the scrutiny and security measures it needs to have in place to avoid hacking. BB has already achieved higher levels of approval and clearance then Tesla, Tesla can’t compete with BB in Data mining/sharing because Tesla would never sell its tech and capabilities to a competitor for obvious reasons. BB is not a direct competitor to all, so no concerns about who can or can’t be potential customers...the answer is everyone."

2021-05-07 06:38:05,wallstreetbets,"I work in the industry (20y now), and have been in many equivalent partnership teams.

Tech giants invest broadly and the vast majority of what they do invest in never sees market, or does and then doesn’t gain market share and dies.  They speculate on horizons and only need a few things to truly land.

I mean for your sake I hope you’re right - and this is the one that lands, but the reality is that this is a massive must have for BB and just another Tuesday for AWS.

Feel free to check my comment history re: BB, I do not have any faith in their ability to deliver - and it’s from spending years in the same circles and watching the talent leave. They’ve been stripped of nearly all their true talent.  They are not the shining standard of tech competency and tech skill that people think they are, just by saying they have QNX and are security focused...but not really having any insight into who they employ and what the market sense is.

Like I said I hope I’m wrong for all the bag holders, but all the DD being posted of late is shallow, low effort glossary print bullshit that’s weak and filled with confirmation bias.

Secondly, what big companies are BB shareholders exactly? Because the largest BB shareholders that are institutions are all fund/management companies - which own BB because the individual investors have asked for it, or because it's bundled with a few hundred other companies in a mutual fund, meaning they clearly don't care that much about BB.

Thirdly - who the fuck cares about big companies being shareholders? Being big doesn't make them right. If we followed what ""big companies"" invest in, we'd be bagholding AOL, MySpace and Skype.

Edit: and regardless - BB could be a great company. Doesn't mean the DDs post around here aren't delusional and shit. They're not mutually exclusive."

They have been working closely on a treatment for brain cancer, GBM, together. The market for GBM treatment globally is around $400 million with current treatments essentially palliative in nature \[2,3\].

Regeneron ($RGN) is rumored to be buying out Inovio ($INO) at around $30 a share. Look for news on Bloomberg terminal and ([https://www.prnewswire.com/](https://www.prnewswire.com/)) in the next 7 days. With Inovio currently around \~$6.5 this would equate to 500% gain on common share and of course much more on call options. This stock is also heavily shorted by Citadel et al.

2021-05-07 10:33:43,wallstreetbets,"https://uspto.report/patent/app/20210128710 

The date on the patent application is from yesterday! Ignore anyone talking about a buyout rumor. The CEO won't sell the company. 

That said this is a great buy and hold below $7, or if you're like me, hold because you're already rekd and what else are you going to do. Ive been averaging down from $20. It could go to $3 before going up but there is so much good stuff in the pipeline in phase 2/3 and they are well funded. They could be announcing phase 3 or EUA for their covid vaccine in China next week, but they have a tendency to overpromise and not meet deadlines, so there's that. Shareprice will likely go to $3 if they don't announce something big on the 10th.

By end of the year I am fairly confident they will be vaccinating the world for covid. They have a best in class, room temp stable vaccine, and great partnerships. They also have poor management struggling to take advantage of opportunities. It's a mixed bag but I've invested most of my Roth (not much) and 80k in my brokerage account. 

They are also the world's best opportunity to put covid behind us, not just in the US, but in places like Brazil Europe India and China, potentially a massive market."

2021-05-07 05:58:44,wallstreetbets,"$INO worth much more than 30$ per share. It's current SP is because is so shorted, as many other biotech that haven't bring products to market yet. However Inovio has an impressive pipeline and  now, after many years of investigation, is very close to succeed and any time within next year will go beyond 100$. 

All these beside that has developed one of the best covid vaccines (96% efficacy and stable at room temperature during months) that will be very useful at countries with not much infrastructure for low temperature storage. 

I'm long at $INO and I will not give away may shares at that price. 

Joining Inovio worth it!!"

2021-05-07 00:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Because the market cap may only be 1.2b right now, but if they held out and forced regeneron to do a hostile takeover where they have to report 10%+ holdings, it’ll likely cause the stock to spike. What you will typically see is that larger corporations will short the hell out of small cap pharmaceuticals in order to get a cheaper price, and possibly run competition out of the business. It’s too big to fail 2020(been happening since the beginning of time)."
2021-05-07 00:38:32,wallstreetbets,I have no idea. Maybe negotiation based on their other patents and products. Either way good for $REGN.
2021-05-07 06:37:46,wallstreetbets,Once they try to buy INO stock on the open market they have to file with the SEC at 5% ownership level.  With rumors of a buyout that would ignite something akin to a short squeeze and the price could ramp like it did for GME.  With 15 products in the pipeline and many at P2 and P3 $30 is still a bargain.
2021-05-07 08:10:18,wallstreetbets,If you try to buy 1% of almost any stock in a short period of time you will double the price in the process. They need to work out these things separately.

2021-05-07 13:21:40,wallstreetbets,The one in the news today is dated May 6.
2021-05-07 01:02:57,wallstreetbets,Just look at your bloomberg terminal tomorrow afternoon.
2021-05-07 11:13:06,wallstreetbets,"He said check Bloomberg this afternoon. But yeah, I doubt it."
2021-05-07 16:39:43,wallstreetbets,"Here's your answer... https://www.inovio.com/dna-medicines-pipeline/

10 vaccines in phase 2 trials, one in phase 3, tons of partnerships, vaccine awards a lot of years in the last 5.  They are definitely not a one trick pony. From what I've read, many long term holders are in it for the hpv or other vaccines. I found out about ino in the fomo covid rush last year, blown away by their covid vaccine: great efficacy, minimal side effects, shelf stable at room temp- potential for global reach. They are also working on a pancovid booster but they have been pushed out of the US market for covid.  Their vaccine requires an electroporation device that the fda has blocked for their covid vaccine for undisclosed reasons, though it has gotten the CE mark in Europe, and the vaccine safety with the delivery device far exceeds other approved vaccines- part of why ino bag holders (like myself) sound like a bunch of raving conspiracy theorists. The science is a whole industry startrek like game changer IF they can get anything to market. 

Unfortunately you have to weigh their lack of FDA or BP connections, what many would call poor management and their targeting by short sellers. Citron made a killing off of them over the last year. 

I was really angry after watching the share price plummet repeatedly over the last year after any good news.  At this point I'm not sure the manament is terrible, but they are playing by the book, and without BP board members, they seem to be at a serious disadvantage for getting anything fast tracked in the US. They are also pursuing partnerships outside of the USA for covid trials which I would call strategic.

I'm a dumb noob investor with a poor track record picking stocks like INO, so do your own DD."
2021-05-07 07:00:41,wallstreetbets,"So tell us, where did this ""rumor"" come from?"

2021-05-07 06:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Kind of like GME right,  a dead video game retailer,  makes sense."
2021-05-07 00:41:51,wallstreetbets,"They don’t have to report for a while after they take that position... a joint patent more likely means a partnered deal. Would be great if they bought INO but I think you might be looking through your money goggles. Again I’m long REGN so I hope your right, just manage expectations."
2021-05-07 00:40:06,wallstreetbets,That explains a lot tbh! What other examples like this have you seen in the past?
2021-05-07 00:50:31,wallstreetbets,is that whats happening with vaxart right now......?
2021-05-07 00:52:07,wallstreetbets,They seem to be working together on their products. Maybe a mutually beneficial takeover.
2021-05-07 07:47:23,wallstreetbets,No 🤡 INO can’t even answer FDAs questions.
2021-05-07 09:53:47,wallstreetbets,So that would be about 6 Milion shares?
2021-05-07 00:47:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know but is that up?
2021-05-07 09:45:36,wallstreetbets,I think it has a pipeline with great potential.    When will it generate revenue is the question.   But reposting unfounded rumors is dumb.    The buyout rumor resurfaces every few months.
2021-05-07 01:29:02,wallstreetbets,Hope it’s true !

2021-05-07 07:37:10,wallstreetbets,Completely agree....the joint patent is very positive and newsworthy when approved but it does suggest that the survival rate at 24 months is looking good!!
2021-05-07 00:43:24,wallstreetbets,Well it’s likely to drop quite a bit prior to announcement if history repeats itself.
2021-05-07 00:42:08,wallstreetbets,Immunomedics. Look at pretty much any small cap pharmaceutical company. Even the ones with a really strong pipeline are seeing 20%+ short interest.
2021-05-07 10:47:10,wallstreetbets,maybe 2M based on 200 million outstanding ...I better say more like 5% of pure long volume superimposed on a  normal day will double the price.  I think this stock doubled in a couple days a bit back 65 million was the vol.  So imagine that is not all long..many many profit takers initiated trades too..so those who felt compelled to buy in probably didn't outnumber them like 95:5 more like 60:40

2021-05-07 00:47:00,wallstreetbets,"Well... I really like the business that they are into and how they can use different waste to make Biogas or fuel.... but I won't like to know they're competitors and what are offering? Also, can they scale any high from they're current position?"
2021-05-07 00:44:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah long long long term. Most companies get lots of funding but the expectations end up being bigger than they can live up to. I personally love this idea but the math that goes into it is almost always wrong( too many variables). They usually end up selling to a energy company for a loss
2021-05-07 00:59:25,wallstreetbets,"Great question.  Biogas has been a byproduct of landfills, factory farms,  etc. for decades. I proposed one of the first major biogass production programs to Chambers Development back in 1988 (I was a kid straight out of college).

But so many subsidies were given to the fossil fuel industry that leveraging the landfill byproducts were always not feasible. 

It's not new,  but innovations in technology to make it more efficiently effective and cost competitive is creating new awareness."
2021-05-07 00:52:18,wallstreetbets,Really? That's interesting... I would think that with what they are offering they would have some type of edge... I still very impressive what they are doing and how it is helping the environment ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)

- large investors are moving money from tech to other industries because they describe it as “high growth, high risk” (fucking retards don’t know how to make money)

- Earnings have been mostly positive but still stocks are falling for no fucking reason

What this means for the typical traders in this sub: we’re gonna be fucking millionaires just load up on more and more calls or write puts 20-30 days out and watch the big number go up and up till you can buy your new lambo 

Easy tendies and the more it falls the more money you make just keep buying more and more calls and you’ll be rich it’s impossible for stocks to go down

Most are not generating YoY growth to support even that number, and a large portion of the companies are trading at higher prices than that. Undervalued is the last word I would use to describe the tech sector. You have industrials and utilities trading at P/E under 10 in a lot of cases, and a lot of money potentially pouring in from the infrastructure plan. There's been a sector rotation the last couple of weeks. Look at industrials and companies that are likely to be involved in the infra plan. Look at CAT, MTZ, TTEK, PWR, ACM, STRL, X to name a few. Compare that to the nasdaq the last few weeks.

Continuing to go all in on tech at this point is just chasing the market. You might make money, but there are lower hanging fruit right now."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"🏊🏼‍♂️💸 $HAYW POOL BOOM & CHLORINE SHORTAGE I’ll start off by saying my family has owned pool company for over 30 years in Texas and since COVID we have had record months back to back ever since. $HAYW pool equipment company (Hayward) is our largest supplier. They just did IPO two months ago but have been in business since 1925. They posted their first quarter earnings on the stock market and beat EPS expectations by 517%. In other words they did more than their whole year EPS expectation in the first quarter. EPS expectation for whole year $0.64 or $.016 per quarter and in Q1 they hit $1.16 or a full year run rate of $4.64 EPS. Multiple by 15x EPS should give stock price of $69 (GIGGIDY) currently at $24.


FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2021 HIGHLIGHTS

Gross profit increased to $159.9 million, an increase of $84.3 million, or 111.5%.

Net Income increased by 455% to $36.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted Net income increased by 344% to $63.6 million.

Operating income increased by 533% to $79.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in operating income was driven by higher net sales and improved operating leverage partially offset by increased SG&A related to volume and IPO costs.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 200% year-over-year to $107.3 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1,110 basis points to 32.1%


This was in first 3 months of the year which is worst time for pool business imagine what it will do during summer. 

After earnings were reported yesterday Morgan Stanley upgraded their price target from $18 to $30. BULL AF. 

Being that almost all numbers represented at least doubled the stock price should do the same if not more considering those figures were based on the worst time of year for the industry.

2021-05-07 00:02:25,wallstreetbets,Chris griffin? Is that you?
2021-05-07 01:55:33,wallstreetbets,"Only first paragraph in, but sounds like we are going to be swimming in the tendies!

btw: peter schiff noted that pool chemicals increased in price in his latest podcast"
2021-05-07 01:23:50,wallstreetbets,Lol bro did you not read the part where I said my family has owned pool business over 30 years. Your expertise is laughably inferior my guy. Chlorine is the most common use by far and for those who switch to saltwater guess what Hayward makes those too bud.
2021-05-07 05:46:26,wallstreetbets,I keep hearing about this chlorine shortage. Glad I have a saltwater pool
2021-05-07 00:07:27,wallstreetbets,$LESL 🤝 $HAYW
2021-05-07 10:02:57,wallstreetbets,"I work for a pool supplier, we have millions of dollars in POs for Hayward because they are sooo behind on getting product to us. Their main competitor Pentair is probably worse. Idk if it is bullish or bearish but we would be selling a lot more of their product if we had it."
2021-05-07 00:41:08,wallstreetbets,It already had a huge jump. Looks like a high risk play.

2021-05-06 23:55:44,wallstreetbets,Wow much wow. Really liking the optimism of all these Pool related stocks
2021-05-06 23:57:28,wallstreetbets,"But -- if factory was closed for covid, they should have shortage of supply now.  Also everyone got a pool last summer and thjngs are opening up....  Like public pools?

Ya or no?"
2021-05-06 23:56:47,wallstreetbets,what factors does chlorine shortage change
2021-05-07 11:49:24,wallstreetbets,"How much of this growth is sustainable?   


How much of the pool maintenance market is commercial (hotels, gyms, public pools) vs residential?"
2021-05-07 16:16:09,wallstreetbets,luv u
2021-05-07 16:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I know very little but isn't a p/e ratio of 2300 a bit much? Even on bullish year.

Edit. 2800, see how little I know."
2021-05-07 01:17:12,wallstreetbets,there are a lot of chlorine alternatives for pool so shortage is really not a thing
2021-05-07 00:05:51,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-07 00:29:42,wallstreetbets,$30 June calls 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-07 00:23:22,wallstreetbets,You’re welcome brother thank you 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-07 08:28:51,wallstreetbets,Exactly 🚀🚀🚀🚀 and I’ll check out his new vid already follow his crazy ass
2021-05-07 18:48:33,wallstreetbets,I don't use any pool chemicals in my pool
2021-05-07 08:41:23,wallstreetbets,Check your pool equipment. Guarantee it’s Hayward. Largest maker of saltwater pool equipment too
2021-05-07 10:39:53,wallstreetbets,That’s bullish af
2021-05-07 00:51:18,wallstreetbets,Every undervalued stock has a huge jump and continues to have huge jumps after until correctly valued
2021-05-07 08:30:02,wallstreetbets,Well don’t be such a sensitive bitch and learn to laugh with happiness at the thought of making money
2021-05-07 00:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Never said factory was closed for COVID lol. Shortage of supply is more a result of chlorine being used for everything from pools to disinfectants / cleaning products to a lot of other shit. Clorox, chlorine lol. 

Whether it’s a swimming pool in backyard or public pool they all need chlorine"
2021-05-07 01:17:35,wallstreetbets,The largest Chlorine producing factory burned down. That's why there is a shortage in Chlorine.
2021-05-06 23:58:17,wallstreetbets,Simple supply and demand. Limited supply creating surge in costs creating surge in margins and as a result profits. They also are largest manufacturer of pool equipment so every new pool gets new equipment
2021-05-07 12:06:44,wallstreetbets,Just think for every neighborhood with one community pool there’s more than 10 pools in that neighborhood.
2021-05-07 16:26:02,wallstreetbets,Luv u more
2021-05-07 17:18:59,wallstreetbets,How are you getting 2800?
2021-05-07 01:25:35,wallstreetbets,Lol bro did you not read the part where I said my family has owned pool business over 30 years. Your expertise is laughably inferior my guy. Chlorine is the most common use by far and for those who switch to saltwater guess what Hayward makes those too bud.
2021-05-07 00:09:44,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, i'm in!"
2021-05-07 18:49:09,wallstreetbets,Big if true
2021-05-07 17:46:13,wallstreetbets,Oh it is. They’re a good company
2021-05-07 10:49:36,wallstreetbets,"The only question is will there be a tipping point where pools are get so expensive to build that people stop building them? Also if you tell a home owner that wants a pool for the summer that its going to take half a year just to get started, at what point do people start holding off?"
2021-05-07 15:48:08,wallstreetbets,Nah fuck them dude you're in the right. Trying to help people out and give good info and you got people being dicks for no reason. You're doing great man
2021-05-07 10:19:21,wallstreetbets,Who’s being a sensitive bitch now?
2021-05-07 01:25:12,wallstreetbets,No that made it a bit worse but is not the reason why. It’s a recent intensifier to an already existing issue. OLN is the largest producing factory and they did not burn down.
2021-05-07 17:25:32,wallstreetbets,Just what robinhood says. Don't hate me just asking. I think your research is legit.
2021-05-07 01:58:28,wallstreetbets,Gotta respect the condescending 'bud'! This man knows his pools!
2021-05-07 04:22:47,wallstreetbets,The bud was a nice touch there. Truly an artist at work with the entire English language at his disposal. But for real tho what a dick lol
2021-05-07 04:23:50,wallstreetbets,Got room for one more?
2021-05-07 18:51:47,wallstreetbets,"That was a fast reply.

I use the grocery store version of everything you need, same but way cheaper, muratic acid, and bleach.

Actually I do use cya, so I did lie that is a pool chem....."
2021-05-07 11:07:32,wallstreetbets,Either is possible but highly unlikely any point in 2021. People have record high levels of equity with record low interest rates meaning easy and affordable financing
2021-05-07 16:25:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro
2021-05-07 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, then wouldn't OLN be a good play? Since they ideally supply the chlorine to these pool companies? I hope I am not missing something (great DD btw!)"
2021-05-07 17:39:16,wallstreetbets,Robinhood also says 100% buy lol
2021-05-07 17:38:37,wallstreetbets,This quarter they did 334 million. I actually met with my Hayward rep for the southern region had some drinks and he’s at 4x what he was doing same time last year as of today. Doesn’t think it will stop anytime this year. So let’s be conservative and say 250 million per quarter x4 average so 1 billion dollars. Market cap is currently 7 billion.
2021-05-07 17:40:04,wallstreetbets,Also they weren’t founded in 2017 they were founded 1925. Robinhood just has shit info
2021-05-07 17:42:12,wallstreetbets,Earnings per share of $1.11 per quarter or $4.44 over a full year. Stock price $23. At current price P/E is 6 standard is 15 which would bring price to $66. And that’s assuming EPS doesn’t get better during summer which it will. It’s a pool company for Christ sake they do better in summer than winter
2021-05-07 08:40:06,wallstreetbets,Yea me being condescending is being a dick but thinking you know more than somebody whose family has been in industry over 30 years isn’t 🙄
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"For those who actually watched the entire House Committee Part 3 and still think Gary Gensler is on our side. Full disclosure, I own many shares of both GME and AMC. Therefore, I was very interested in hearing everything Gensler and crew had to say. For anyone who actually sat through that garbage, I feel for you as well. 

That scripted act put on for the public was an embarrassment. For the most part, they were served up softball questions easily hit out of the park. If you listened closely to what Gary Gensler said and the way he reacted when thrown the couple of hardballs to him, you’d have to know that he’s definitely not on the side of the little man investor. 

He leaned HEAVILY towards more regulation of investors on “APPS” and social media, even though he said we do have a right to free speech unless it crossed certain thresholds. His answers to questions heavily leaned towards the larger firms. There was no serious indication that he would be cracking down on the RIDICULOUS naked shorting of the markets (which by the way NOBODY wanted to address, which in and of itself says it all). 

This dog and pony show was completely read off of a script verbatim. It was a complete embarrassment on many levels. I highly suggest each and every one of you take 4 hours (useless) out of your day to see if you honestly feel Gary Gensler, Congress, FINRA and the DTCC has your back afterwards. 

Fingers crossed that I’m completely way off, but the jury is still out as he’s just been in the position for a few weeks."
2021-05-06 23:33:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah I recorded the part where he ducked the question about Robinhood’s “kill switch” button and then he was asked again to answer the question whether or not it should be allowed and he giggled out of nervousness and made a weird mouth gesture trying to hide his discomfort of completely ignoring the question.
2021-05-06 23:27:28,wallstreetbets,These hearings have certainly taught me one thing. My vote counts and I need to start nit picking the reasons I am voting for people. I will not vote for a representative that shows blatant corruption or ignorance to issues.
2021-05-07 03:54:41,wallstreetbets,"Heres my counterpoint. Hes clearly head and shoulders above the dinosaur exhibit of congress interviewed in pure market knowledge and technology. To me, he carefully dodged his way out of any market indicators and deferred to his future judgement in place of talking about the pure fuckery we already know has happened from RH and Spitadel. 


So yea, not what I was hoping to hear but at the same time, he left a pretty clean sheet from covering his own ass, and I'm pretty enamored by his skill. I wish I had that composure during my disasters at work. I'm bullish af because he didnt reveal his hand, we probably have the float, and this moment is the defining moment of his career for the rest of his life. I'm just an ape that love tendies and banana, but I've got a good feeling about him."
2021-05-06 23:35:11,wallstreetbets,Dog and pony for sure
2021-05-07 01:25:17,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure there was some shit he knows that he didn't say.    Isn't that pretty much part of the job?
2021-05-07 01:43:24,wallstreetbets,On the part about social media he wasn't against it.  He was against the fact that companies like citadel lurk and post fud and manipulate ppl on here.  Kind of like what is going on here.  And with ongoing investigations he can't answer everything. Yet everytime they tried to shift blame on retail investors he would point the finger at things that the HFs were doing.  You should look more at the paid off representatives.  Maybe Gary was trying to  not disrespect the crooked fvcks and not secure yet in his role but whatever. Seems like there isn't really enough information yet.  I'm not saying one way or another really but this seems like a little Kenny post.

2021-05-07 02:12:40,wallstreetbets,After this meeting i concluded the dtcc 2.2bn charge was made up as cover for the market manipulation they pulled in Jan. Its so crystal clear since not a single question were on this. Silence is defeaning.
2021-05-07 01:38:27,wallstreetbets,I watched 1rst hearing. And i saw usa politics are true clowns with no iq. Why should i watch 2-3 part? My time cost more then circus
2021-05-07 02:43:10,wallstreetbets,"I didn't find the way he told retail to keep suggestions up and keep focusing on improvements and keep ""being loud"" basically, with some enthusiasm clearly seen on his face and some insistence on his behalf.

But I think there's only **so much** he can say at this very critical and volatile time. Perhaps afterwards."
2021-05-07 05:28:55,wallstreetbets,"It came across that the vast majority of people on the committee have no idea what they are talking about and why.  Highly disappointing, but totally unsurprising - same with politics worldwide."
2021-05-06 23:44:10,wallstreetbets,No politican is on the everyman side
2021-05-07 06:27:56,wallstreetbets,"He's gotta play politics dude. If he comes straight out and says the whole system's corrupt and starts pointing fingers and people who basically fund these politicians, he's going to hit a lot of roadblocks trying to do anything."
2021-05-07 06:59:17,wallstreetbets,"""Well, I've only been here for three weeks.""

""We hired the first african american into SEC and he's still there doing great."""
2021-05-07 08:41:44,wallstreetbets,"I share in your frustration, but, for the sake of a critical perspective:

Do you expect much from a televised hearing? What’s he going to do, talk real tough and piss off institutional stakeholders for the sake of empty rhetoric? Do a bunch of populist grandstanding and spook the markets into a “correction”? 

Additionally, as far as I understand, naked shorting is a huge structural component of day-to-day retail markets, esp for the kind of commission-free online trading that most of us do. Is now the time to make structural changes to markets, when we’re in a phase people are calling the “everything bubble” and the economy is still reeling from the many negative impacts of the virus?

Substantive regulatory changes like the ones you’re likely hoping for require sustained pressure and they happen when, after a lot of deliberation, politicians finally put pens to paper and draft legislation (or do away with it).

The mood in these groups has changed a lot of late... seeing more racially/politically divisive speech, desperate appeals to greed, overgeneral anti-establishment screeds, and a pretty gross sense of entitlement. Short squeezes are highly speculative plays and sometimes they don’t go off. If you like the stock then hold it. A short squeeze would be awesome for me personally given some of what is in my portfolio, but I know it may or may not go off without a hitch. If you’re investing soundly in stock that you feel positively about, you should only really expect returns commensurate with the terms on which they do business.

Sorry to rant. I’m just sick of some of the kinds of discourse I’m seeing here lately. Lots of negative and unhelpful content."
2021-05-07 09:16:26,wallstreetbets,"I’ve said it before, no one is looking out for us 🦍 except us apes. Money put him in that position and money can remove him from that position. His primary job is to keep the 1% rich and happy while pacifying everyone else. Keep all this in mind."
2021-05-07 10:06:15,wallstreetbets,"The biggest disappointment to me is that someone actually believed any of those people give a flying fuck about you. Government, Wall st., the banks...They're here to take your money, the end."
2021-05-07 16:24:57,wallstreetbets,"SEC is the Chief Wiggum of the financial sector. It can’t investigate, it can’t regulate, it can’t enforce, and is simply standing there aloof, taking a taxpayer salary, smiling, eating the free donuts that the hedge funds send their way. Yeah, they’re job is to protect investors . . . the hedge funds. What a joke."
2021-05-07 18:17:47,wallstreetbets,He's one of them...good olde boys club.
2021-05-07 00:19:18,wallstreetbets,That guy sucks
2021-05-07 00:21:27,wallstreetbets,Welp 🥺 at least we have each other. Apes together strong 🤜🤛
2021-05-07 03:27:20,wallstreetbets,"I took parts of it differently.  He seemed very concerned that citadel has a conflict of interest and essentially a monopoly (he kept saying concentrated or concentration) on retail order flow that gives them an unfair, risky, and potentially dangerous position in the market."
2021-05-07 04:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, im from Europoor and how could anybody fucking believe, that the SEC would be on the ""little mans side""?. Are you fucking serious? 

After all those hearings and shit we read, im slowly more inclined to believe, that even RH may be on our side and is used by the ""big boys"" as an escape goat for January. 
Sure as shit, everybody is painting them as the bad guy and i hope the lesson we learned over the last 5 months of this whole ordeal is, that everything those bought out whores say, is what they are told to say. Kenny Gs 5!! fking lawyers sitting in with him at the first meeting should tell you enough.

When all of this goes tits up, you can bet your last tendie, that RH and us retail investors will be painted as the bad guys, while the FED and the SEC will shove billions in ""bail outs"" to those WS whores, no matter who is at the helm. 

So no, nothing is gonna fucking happen, some poor schmuck will go to prison like in 08 and the pillaging and raping of WS will continue as it always did"
2021-05-07 00:00:36,wallstreetbets,Be real careful mentioning what you own on this sub. Might piss of the banhammer unfortunately. This place is not ours anymore :(
2021-05-07 01:33:45,wallstreetbets,Clown world. What did you expect?
2021-05-07 03:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Among other things, the SEC now is considering tightening notification requirements for short selling and securities lending and Gensler reaffirmed that social media (i.e. reddit) falls under free speech. What more did you expect?

Problem was all the other congressmen that either have no clue what´s going on or are cleary in the pocket of big money."
2021-05-07 04:46:33,wallstreetbets,"what do you expect ?? a fuckin hardcore drama show ?? a full blown investigation just in yo face at these hearings ??

you should be happy that guy reckognized our concerns, pfof, shorting, citadel.

if there would be any other chairman there we would be fukt"
2021-05-07 05:36:16,wallstreetbets,Don’t have to watch any or hear any of them. They live next to each other so I think he will helps????? He used to be one of them🤮
2021-05-07 07:25:13,wallstreetbets,"The hearing seemed to be written for 3 specific ideals:   
   
- Soothing investor sentiment via making the hearing sound/feel good.
   
- Using GME visability to grandstand off-topic positions for future political soundbites (climate/diversity)
  
- provide a platform for distraction via political unity/discourse (i.e. ""look forward to working with you"" and ""unlike my colleagues from the other side of the aisle"")    
   
What the hearing did not do:
Answer any serious question about the effect of rampant naked short selling and its disastrous effects on the market. 

There were a few mentions of the ""squeeze"" back in January but no mention of a potential future squeeze. I'm willing to bet that was intentional....  and by ""bet"", I mean ""hold"". 💎🙌"
2021-05-07 08:37:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a cynic, so when I saw tons of apes around here jumping up and down, I'm like...... r we sure about this guyyy?"
2021-05-07 10:57:29,wallstreetbets,"I was as well upset I mean this was the meeting I was really waiting for to see what the SEC is going to do, very unhappy he hid behind “I have only been here for 3 weeks” so why didn’t they get someone who was there for longer than 3 weeks. All I can say is the more they bury their heads in the sand the more the world watches these events, they have made a laughing stock of the American finance system."

Then the rep basically just asks the guy to answer the question I just asked. He responds with only having the job for 3 weeks and quickly realizes that’s probably not the best answer. He giggles like a little bitch and shows his discomfort in trying to hide the fact that he is ignoring the question. It was a yes or no question. “Do you think companies should have a kill switch?”

The question that was presented was whether or not it should be allowed that Robinhood can basically shut down the ability to buy and sell shares at any given time. 

From every single perspective and angle, anyone can see this is eventually going to cost someone prison time. 

But because we don’t have anyone with enough power and our “voice” is a bunch of ppl calling themselves retarded apes lol, things may not change. 

The system has been proven to be rigged and it was proven, yet nobody is talking about it. 

I’m ashamed of every single celebrity out there who isn’t using their influence of power to stand up for an entire generation of millennials and Gen z (cringe) who have discovered that all you gotta do is hold and never sell and work together and you’ll make money instead of being greedy and creating FUD to convince others it’s okay to sell at a loss. 

At this point I’d be willing to take 2006 Justin Bieber as our representative 😂"

It was eventually decided that if no salary was paid, it would prevent impoverished people from being able to run for office.  So, acknowledging the danger of creating a position which came both with power and a paycheck, they very reluctantly gave it a salary.  And as we can see, that totally worked to ensure poor farmers and the like can get into Congress."

It would almost be like paying them in stock options, if they better the community, they too will benefit. If we pay them and the big players pay them to protect their industry and corner of the market there is no incentive for the representative to make the community better because they've already been paid and taken care of and any economic boost the community could have experience is now funneling through to the big players and trickling into the reps pockets.

2021-05-07 11:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Hey 👋 

Your suggestion relies on the assumption that anybody who gets into congress has assets that would appreciate from the betterment of their local area. 

For an everyday person, who doesn't own businesses, land, or any real assets this idea falls flat. They wouldn't magically grow the money to afford multiple trips to and from DC, and they sure as hell wouldn't just have the money laying around to rent a place in both places either. Most likely they would have to resign from an inability to support themselves. Meanwhile, the corrupt politicians who actually own assets and businesses would make enough money regardless of good policy decisions that they could run for the special elections or destroy the layperson candidate in the next election 

The fact of the matter is that it IS a job, its a full time job and its one of the most important damned jobs that there is. Yeah it sucks that right now, we aren't adequately represented, and its pretty easily shown that our interests are being underrepresented. But by implementing what you're talking about, it would only further support corrupt candidates while making it quite nearly impossible for everyday people. 

Yes, I agree that something needs to change but removing the salary would be a slap in the face of everyday people who go against all odds to win an election."
2021-05-07 09:24:07,wallstreetbets,I don’t think any position makes more than 200k a year. They make money by getting “donations” (legalized bribery) to their election/reelection campaign funds. This is how they leave office worth millions of dollars.

2021-05-07 09:33:22,wallstreetbets,Don't forget insider trading
2021-05-07 12:16:22,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget speaking fees and book deals and whatever other garbage comes from ""I cant give you money in office, that would be illegal. But once you're out come mow my lawn (that I don't have) for $1mil a year."""

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Just wanted to point this out about youtube stock entertainers. Some of you might be following ""entertainers"" on youtube who ""are not financial advisors."" It's good if this is for entertainment value, but don't use them as a real method of buying stock, even though they say ""take it with a grain of salt"" you shouldn't even take it with that. Not everyone is foolish to take their ""not financial advise"", but some people are, and become mislead into these bad positions.  I went through one of these youtube entertainers videos for the month of FEB and here is some of what i found out and why you shouldn't take them seriously:

&#x200B;

Date----- stock day start price ---------- stock day close price ----------- what the video mentions

&#x200B;

Feb 4 -   8.69  -  6.8    --AMC Stock Update: AMC Stock has been heavily attacked, illegally, by hedge funds for months. 

&#x200B;

Feb 5 -  7.3 -  6.8  - - Not a dead cat.

&#x200B;

Feb 8 - 6.9  - 6.06 - AMC 60% SHORT VOLUME RATIO LAST FRIDAY! 

&#x200B;

Feb 9 - 5.8 - 5.7 --  AMC SHORT VOLUME DATA IS BEING MANIPULATED!

&#x200B;

Feb 10 - 5.7 - 5.6 -- Be back bullish on the Monday (15th of feb).

&#x200B;

Feb 11 - 5.6 - 5.6 -- This is the bottom and will go up.

&#x200B;

Feb 12 - 5.6 - 5.5 - - Your going to start see it lifting soon.

&#x200B;

Feb 16 - 5.8 - 5.6 -- I think this stock is worth more than $25.

&#x200B;

Feb 17 - 5.9 - 5.4 -- Just a red day in the market.

&#x200B;

Feb 18 - 5.4 - 5.6 - We are going to go, waiting for this for so long, not a dead cat.

&#x200B;

Feb 19 - 5.6 - 5.7 - The setup is 100% there for a squeeze. 

&#x200B;

Feb 22 - 5.7 - 6.7 - Need to create debt to be able to go up, amc's not bad because they have debt.

&#x200B;

Feb 23 - 6.3 - 7.3 - AMC COULD BEGIN GAMMA SQUEEZE MONDAY AND HERE'S WHY!

&#x200B;

Feb 24 - 7.4 - 11.7 -  Short Float, 93% Utilization, & Moon Landing Potential!

&#x200B;

Feb 25 - 10.7 - 7.4 - This squeeze is going to last 3 days!

&#x200B;

Feb 26 - 7.8 - 8.2 - AMC CLOSE OVER $8 FRIDAY WILL DO THIS! Why You Shouldn't Panic & Gamma Squeeze Potential!

&#x200B;

I am sure if I went through more months it would be the same thing happening. This isn't the only person that does this, a lot of youtube ""not financial advisors"" that hype up shit like this. Its fun to watch, they are entertaining people out there, but don't take it as advise, watch it as a comedy. You can see this person makes up so much excuses for outlandish ""predictions"" why this stock will go up and for why it went down. Like everyone keeps saying, do you DD."
2021-05-06 23:51:02,wallstreetbets,There's that data scientist guy I can't stand  and that uncle bruce guy that sells one hour of advisory services for 400 an hour.   His channel is absolutely stupid but people.keep.donating.

2021-05-06 23:58:37,wallstreetbets,I know a YouTuber that hyped GME. Then after it dropped I asked him if he was buying that sweet $40 dip and he was like “nah I sold and lost $8k” 🤦🏾‍♂️ I’m already up 3x’s lol

2021-05-06 23:21:38,wallstreetbets,Yep - like they say -  take it with a grain of salt. Some of them are good; some not 🤷🏼‍♀️

This is why APPLE will discontinue most (if not all) products without the M1

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Swimming in green with $LESL the introduction to Pool Gang &#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b0f1ior4dlx61.jpg?width=310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e8260ad5164793f3e1550685e75b2d42decc1bb

**Introduction to the upcoming pool supercycle:** I'm sure you have all seen the post-pandemic housing boom and the effects it has had on lumber prices going through the roof. Many of these houses are being built in suburban areas where backyard pools are very popular. Having a pool is not just a one-time expense like building a house would be. Pools require constant maintenance and expensive servicing and chemicals almost like owning a pet, you're always buying something else for it. There are 5.2 million residential inground pools in the U.S. and 255,000 commercial pools. It is estimated that 60-70% of these pools use chlorine tablets. There are an estimated 200,000 new swimming pool purchases in 2020-2021 a dramatic increase. Adding pool permits has seen 32% year-on-year growth. The rapidly rising number of new pool owners combined with a major chemical plant fire in Lousiana has caused an upcoming massive chlorine shortage. Chlorine prices in some areas have already doubled. Chlorine prices are expected to spike up to 70% this summer. There is one company that is uniquely poised to benefit the most from these circumstances, that company is Leslie's Swimming Pool Supplies. Ticker $LESL

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2dhmpfk5dlx61.jpg?width=150&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd1fed97699cf9ecd630184d5164ed97e54bbec

**The Company:** Leslie's swimming pool supplies is the largest direct-to-consumer brand in the U.S. pool and spa industry. They have been in business since 1963 and have 940 physical locations and a large e-commerce platform. Leslie's serves residential pools, residential spas, professional pools, & commercial pools so they cover all the bases. The majority of Leslie's products are non-discretionary and exclusive. 80% of their sales are non-discretionary (necessary purchases)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1ovw5l6dlx61.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89de9988c7fbd0710bdfadc5e8e74f04827d1da8

**The Chlorine Situation:** You may be thinking to yourself well this sounds stupid wouldn't the manufacturer of the chlorine tablets just pass on the added costs to Leslie's.  Well, aren't we in luck turns out Leslie manufacturers their own chlorine tablets. This puts them in a great position as one of their competitors literally burned down. 45% of Leslie's sales come from chemicals. They make and sell the chlorine tablets with almost half of their business coming from chemical sales the majority of that being chlorine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/89immti7dlx61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b142a9ad32c1a8184408611a5783e1a7c7927ef

**Financials:** Leslie's just became publicly traded last fall. They have had 57 consecutive years of sales growth with a 7.1% sales CAGR since 2001. They just recorded record 2021 Q2 earnings. They had sales of $192.4 million, an increase of 52.3% from the prior-year quarter. They had a net loss of $(6.5) million compared to $(29.8) million in the prior-year quarter.  They adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million compared to $(8.1) million in the prior-year quarter, an improvement of $17.6 million. They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by $75 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, and Adjusted net income per share by $0.10. Gross profit increased 79.6% to $71.7 million from $39.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37.2% compared to 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 567 basis points. Following this news, the stock rose 10%. Just kidding lol, $LESL tanked to a low of almost 13% today murdering my calls.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/839bedg8dlx61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f24f248855da531498f1c0c1d595a495dc1b6e47

**The Bear Case:** There are two other chlorine manufacturers in the US, one is not publicly traded and the other is not a favorable investment in my opinion. Another bear idea would be to just invest in one of their competitions like $POOL who would seem undervalued compared to $LESL at a  short glance. $POOL primarily deals in the selling of construction equipment for the building of the pools and is not as favorably positioned as $LESL on the chemical and pool upkeep side. Obviously, I did not spend a lot of time on this section because I'm not an idiot who believes the collapse of the global financial sector is imminent.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Wrapping it up:** I think $LESL is a very favorable play for the upcoming summer. I think with the mass vaccinations people will want to hang out with friends by the pool more than ever and the upcoming shortage and amount of pools built is already proof of that. Another thing to keep in mind is the summer Olympics this summer could make people want to swim. That's kind of a reach but I think it will. I would play this by buying a calls a few months out. I will be readjusting my position after getting crushed on the ER selloff today.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fed warns about potential for ‘significant declines’ in asset prices as valuations climb The FED released their semi-annual Financial Stability Report today noting that investors have driven up the prices of stocks, bonds, digital assets, blank check companies and IPO's significantly (did I miss anything?)  While stopping short of calling these assets overvalued, JPow did acknowledge that as long as rates stay low, these values seem to be justified. So I guess that as long there is no need to raise rates that current valuations across almost all asset classes are ok. Hope all these inflation numbers coming out are indeed transitory, as they claim.

I believe that they are now selling those securities and have ceased buying programs - and of course, they can't tell anyone they're doing that or they crash the market to Depression levels.

I think we're in for a sustained down market as the Fed unwinds these stupid decisions."

2021-05-06 23:17:20,wallstreetbets,"The economy did go belly up —-what the FED did was rescue the markets. The economy had the worst quarter in history , and congress passed over 4 trillion in stimulus to fill a 1 trillion dollar hole. Future generations will pay for our  financing of the status quo with a much lower standard of living."
2021-05-06 23:21:00,wallstreetbets,One other fun fact —-the FED started QE again in late 2019 when the repo market went haywire. Long before Covid 19 was a thing in the US. They took it to a never before seen level in the spring of 2020 of course. The FED is now a slave to the markets.

2021-05-07 04:44:00,wallstreetbets,"> Asset prices are high, as long as interest rates are low, that is fine.

What is of course left unsaid is this is Fed-speak for ""we're going to raise rates soon, and then none of these valuations will make any sense.""

Rich people understand the language the Fed is using and will act before you understand the language the Fed is using. The rich are right now wildly selling their equities and going to cash."

2021-05-07 00:50:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes the Fed rescued the markets because unfortunately the 'real' economy depends on the markets for debt issuance. Had the market been left to it's devices there likely would have been a liquidity crisis. Which could've easily led to a systemic financial collapse. Instead, the Fed stepped in and performed it's role as lender of last resort, providing some sense of stability in the markets. 

Sources for 4 trillion stimulus and 1 trillion hole? Genuinely curious."

Updates on other users, like OP. Add absolutely nothing of value. Also they're against the spirit of the subreddit. After all this is not an investing subreddit. DFV was the exception because he had LEAPS. Most of the options OP has expire this month (from his screenshots) 

Their options are fine. But we don't need an update unless they sell for a loss/gain. In this case it looks like he's heading for a loss. But do we really need to know if he's still holding them? After all its not a loss until you sell or they expire worthless. 

Imagine if every person who was holding shares of a stock did updates. The subreddit would become a cluttered garbage mess."

I may be naïve, but does this have any correlation with the length it has taken for AMC and GME to short ~while the market movers, the hedge fund managers, as well as the brokerages - until they may have enough to cover their margin from clients as wells as profiting? maybe they’ve received their piece of cake....just or waiting to get their share in the squeeze?
Thoughts?

Here’s the article: 

May 6, 2021 07:09 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Fintech

TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, E*Trade, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Webull collected $1.02 billion in payment for order flow in the first quarter of the year.
$436 million of these payments came from equity trades, while $587 million have been paid for options trades

The top two paying venues were Citadel Securities, with $445 million paid to the top 5 online brokerages, and Global Executions Brokers with $181 million.

The first quarter of 2021 saw a substantial spike in retail trading activities, mainly caused by various short squeezes in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Entertainment Holding. Google trends show the peak in search volume for terms like GameStop, Short Squeeze, and Day Trading in the last week of January.

Especially the trading apps Robinhood and Webull saw a significant increase in app installs and new accounts. As a result, the payment for order flow income for Robinhood grew from $91 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $331 million in 2021. Webull had the most substantial percentage gain with $3 million in Q1/2020 to $46 million in Q1/2021.

The payment for order flow split by broker for the first quarter of 2021 reveals that TD Ameritrade received most payments, followed by Robinhood and E*Trade.

TD Ameritrade: $429 million
Robinhood: $331 million
E*Trade: $139 million
Charles Schwab: $78 million
Webull: $46 million"

I think way too many people have been thinking they are only a valuable company if Covid testing is in high demand. Even after a record earnings report we saw modest gains in after hours trading. This organization has excellent leadership and is trading at a huge discount. 

Valuation is also important, so investors should note that FLGT has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.74. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.84, so we might conclude that FLGT is trading at a discount comparatively to other industry players. Let’s discuss! I would love to hear some input from the WSB community on this one."

I am no expert in genetics, antibody or viral DNA but it seems they have brought process and timeliness to the market as their big added value. Contracts in hand and the future requirements to do mass population screening locks in a nice business for them. The questions are:
What are barriers to entry for Lab Corp, Quest?

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Anyone here in $PINS? Before you laugh at me just indulge me for a fuckin second. 

I’ve been following this stock for a while and have made some decent gains since hopping in earlier last year. 

It peaked at $90ish but then just recently tanked more than -30% after their latest earnings call and broader market drawdowns. 

While reading through their earnings report I felt like they had a pretty fuckin decent Q1, and looks like they haven’t really monetized fully to their potential. From my reading it looks like user growth missed by a little, which triggered bad headlines and a pullback, but user growth still grew respectably. 

Other than the user growth they outperformed all of their estimates handily.  It also highlights how they are seeing more shopping happening on platform

One thing I’ve learned is to never underestimate the collective value of Midwestern white women, whether it’s storming the Capitol or propping up the worlds biggest Live Laugh Love collection. 

That is to say, I’m long and bullish on this stock and wondering if any retards here are with me on this journey."

2021-05-07 02:10:31,wallstreetbets,Long PINS at 68.79.  Clearly my mistake was not waiting to pay 0.21 higher.  I was very late to the party but the fact that these guys have been honing their ability to predict trends reeled me in

2021-05-06 20:25:12,wallstreetbets,GME GME GME!!!
2021-05-06 23:16:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting this
2021-05-06 20:06:59,wallstreetbets,"$ASO has no business what so ever being this low. In a market where there's so much speculation and absurd valuations, ASO is quite the opposite. Guaranteed it will go up from here to reach its FMV for next earnings, I think it gets to $45 easily and $60 is more fair, anything above that would be the gravy from shorts covering or a small gamma. But with or without a short thesis ASO should touch $60 this year."
2021-05-06 20:16:01,wallstreetbets,"If it had the same p/e multiple as similar stocks, like Dick’s, then ASO would at $75. Just another retailer that the shorts attacked in 2020 and are trying to minimize their losses after realizing they fucked up. Retail sales across the board are through the roof and gun/ammo sales are not slowing down. They are going to kill their next earnings and everyone knows it."
2021-05-06 20:29:53,wallstreetbets,"Only reason why I understand the higher P/E for Dicks is they have a few more verticals than just retail sports and outdoors under their umbrella. Idk if you're from Texas (or even the south) or not where Academy exists, but its not even a close competition between them and Dicks, totally different consumers. Their customers are blue collar good ol boys that aren't looking to buy hunting/fishing equipment and yetis online to have it shipped to their house next day, that's just not us and it will be a while before that's the case. Im doubling down in the AM. We like to touch and feel. Also, I think with youth sports finally being back and this next earnings reflecting that, its going to be huge. Kids have grown a lot since they last got to play sports in the 2020 Q1 and Q2 range, they have to go buy new equipment, new clothes, down here we only go to Academy for that. Im doubling down in the morning. Gun and ammo, is just a safety net, I think everyone knows that's going to be a beat for as much as they get in they sale. The surprise will be on in store sales for sporting gear. Fuck it, i'm tripling down. They'll be one of the last retailers to shift to online."
2021-05-06 21:10:06,wallstreetbets,"I do live in the south, and when Academy gets a shipment of ammo, it's lines out the door. Funny thing is, that isn't even their biggest source of profit."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Uranium DD TL:DR - Supply and demand fundamentals require the price of uranium to go up or the lights will go out. The nature of the uranium market (security of supply) means that when price-insensitive utilities see prices rising, they get squeezed. This is not priced in, and when this sector runs it has historically provided 20x returns.

**Background:** Nuclear provides 20% of the electricity for the United States and 50% of its clean energy. Greta Thornberry probably gets steamy enough thinking about Uranium to run her own reactor. The market cap of all uranium miners is roughly $20 billion. For reference, with $20 billion you could buy all of the companies that provide fuel for over 50% of the US clean energy and 11% of electricity generated worldwide; or you could buy 1 of the following: 3% of tesla, all of Quantumscape, half of Palantir, 1/5 of Zoom or 1/3 of the market cap of the unsayable barking corn. These could all disappear tomorrow and it wouldn't have too drastic of an impact, but you cant just get rid of 11% of electricity worldwide without drastic consequences.

Nuclear isn't going anywhere anytime soon- in fact it looks like it is heating up. China and India are making investments into nuclear (China is building 11 reactors, India 7), the EU is looking to change its taxonomy to include nuclear as 'a certain group' friendly (automod blocks me if i say the word), America (under Trump) recently formed the Nuclear Fuel Working group to build up reserves of Uranium, and Biden looks set to continue the path being the first democrat in 40 years to support nuclear. Carbon neutral cant happen without nuclear - solar and wind have Capacity Factors of roughly 20-30% while nuclear has a 90% CF. It is beginning to show with many countries extending the licenses to operate of nuclear plants by 20-30 years. Sleepy's green new plan talks about ""advanced reactors"", likely Small Modular Reactors (SMR's) that could be very standardized, reducing the risk of problems. (for educational purposes: nuclear reactors don't explode, they operate with high pressure/temperature water that creates hydrogen via hydrolysis which can create a Hindenburg-like explosion. The Uranium is 3-5% enriched, enough to keep the fission process moving but not enough to create a real explosion. All of the waste ever generated via uranium would fit on a football field stacked about 10ft tall.) Nuclear is built into the infrastructure of today and currently, there is no substitute for Uranium. Talk of thorium, tokamaks, and fast breeders (only 3 out of 444 current nuclear reactors) is all well and good, but it is not where we are today (and for the next decade as building these things is no fast matter, the average build time of a reactor is 109 months). You all might be retarded but you're not dumb, I don't want to see any talk about how nuclear is bad for the environment in the comments.

**Structural supply deficit:**

We use roughly 180m lbs of uranium per year, and we mine around 130m lbs per year. For the innumerate among us, that's a 50m lb/year deficit that needs to come from somewhere. Where does this come from? After Fukushima in 2011, Japan started to shut down nuclear reactors and had lots of inventory that they needed to sell, flooding the market. We can also re enrich the tail assays of spent fuel rather than storing and disposing of it. With excess capacity on the market, the opportunity cost of underfeeding is lowered and more enrichers started to do this (enrichers have caps on the amount of enriching they can do). As mining and enriching of natural uranium increases, more enrichers will have to switch their facilities over and underfeeding will decrease. Utilities also contracted many years in advance at high prices that made sense for the miners during the previous bull cycle - these contracts are beginning to expire.

These (and more) factors caused uranium prices to plummet to the current level of $30/lb on the spot market. At these levels, it does not make sense for many mines to operate and thus the 50m lb/year deficit. Obviously, this cannot continue indefinitely or the lights will go out. At some point, the cost of uranium must go up to incentivize miners to begin mining again. The average incremental price to mine uranium is around $60/lb, so it is safe to assume that they will not begin mining again until they get contracts for around this price (depending on the mine and the Capex necessary to get it out of care and maintenance).

Uranium cannot be procured immediately and is done years in advance. During the last bull cycle many utilities signed contracts for 5+ years. These contracts are beginning to fall off , leaving a lot of uncovered demand for utilities in the future. They have not been worried about it thus far- carry traders have been buying in the spot and selling over the next year or two to these utilities who are happy not signing long-term contracts while the price has been falling. When the tide turns, you can expect fuel buyers to again begin signing long-term contracts to ensure security of supply.

Once prices start rising, the stampede of fuel buyers looking to sign long-term contracts to secure supply will begin. It is human nature, in addition to the fact that it is a fireable offense to not be able to procure Uranium for your reactor, while it is not a fireable offense to grossly overpay as long as others are doing the same. Security of supply is very important in this industry, China recently paid almost half a billion dollars for a 49% equity stake in a Kazakhistan based miner. They will still have to pay the market price for the Uranium, but they get first dibs on almost half of the Uranium mined. The utilities are highly price-insensitive - it is much more costly to have a multi-billion dollar nuclear reactor go offline than pay higher prices for Uranium (which make up about 3% of the cost to run the reactor to put it into perspective). When the first utilities begin signing these contracts, the others will quickly follow suit. The price of uranium went from $10/lb in 2003 to over $130/lb in 2008. Over the next several years as uncovered demand begins to start showing up, the utilities will realize that almost a decade of underpaying for Uranium is now going to come knocking. $60/lb is the floor price, capital markets could easily propel the price way higher.

**Catalysts:**

So when will excess inventories be drawn down? (CEO of small cap company) had the following to say about uranium major Kazatomprom's purchases from the spot market to fulfill obligations ""what is interesting about Kazatomprom's news is not that they need to buy from spot ... but rather that they have started purchasing so early."" Other Uranium miners are purchasing from the spot market as well. If miners thought there was plenty of supply, they would run down their inventories and repurchase at a later date. This is not the case and is very revealing. (Small cap company) recently purchased 2.5m lbs of uranium that required 17 different contracts with 12 counterparties - not very indicative of the oversupply we have had in prior years. *I (and all the experts I have been listening to) believe that the spot market is getting thin.* This is crucial, when fuel buyers start to see the spot market as thin is when the feedback loop begins. But no one wants to be the first mouse to eat the cheese. (CEO of Small Cap company) sums up his conversations with fuel buyers by saying ""We'd rather be the last guy in at $65 than the first guy in at $50...no one wants to be the price maker, the first guy going in at above the odds. But no one minds being the last guy because 'You're the hero, you secured the supply'"". ""We are playing a game of musical chairs, the music is gonna stop, and everyone is just going to grab a chair and pay what they have to."" Mike Alkin says (paraphrasing again) ""They don't get rewarded if they save the rate payers money, and they don't get penalized if they have to pay up as long as the peers are doing it...They just have different incentives""

The supply will propel it to $50/lb to continue production, $60/lb to undertake new exploration/production, and capital markets can take it much higher. A capital market vessel is that could also act as a catalyst is Sprott Asset Management. Sprott is entering into an agreement with Uranium Participation Corp to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust. It is expected to begin trading on American markets in the second half of 2021 (currently there is the Uranium Participation Corp which does this poorly and not on American markets). The fund will begin buying and holding physical Uranium similar to GLD holding gold, putting further pressure on supply levels. Remember how (small cap company) had to have 17 different transactions to purchase 2.5m lbs? Sprotts gold trust is 4.6b, and its silver trust is 2.4b. It will market to all of its commodities holders- even a market cap of 1/10 or 1/5 of these funds could be a serious catalyst towards causing utilities to sign long-term contracts. This happens right around the time that the uranium contracting cycle begins. When hedge funds sense blood in the water they will join the frenzy as well - there is speculation that the funds are already building their positions.

Commodities are a good place to be during times of inflation and it appears as though inflation is coming as Jpow keeps the money printer running and lets inflation heat up. This could be a good hedge against high-growth tech stocks.

**Conclusion:**

Uranium miners have begun to move upwards, indicating the sentiment shifting that the cycle is turning. I don't have a stock to sell you, there are only around 40 on the market and I chose a few to begin building my position with rather than taking the risk on one. Below is a chart with some information about different mines to help you get started. There is much more that could/should be added but for the sake of brevity I will limit it to this. It is now time to wait for the price discovery in this small opaque market to begin...stated in layman terms, **this is not priced in**

Will there be wide-spread commercially operated power plants to take over for Nuclear? No, Not for 30 years. 30 years AFTER someone (MIT/etc.) they can make it work, reliability. 

It takes years and LOTS of money to build a new power plant, and no one will tear down a perfectly good, working, nuclear reactor before the end of it's useful life. 

While they will use thorium or deuterium - uranium will be the main play, at least through 2040."

Well excuse the fuck out of me. I had no idea AMC’s turnaround was due to their fundamental, strategic, and innovative changes to their business. After a year of essentially $0 revenue in a decaying industry, halting of new film recordings, and a lack of an updated business model. Yeah Aron, you and your board certainly outdid yourself. AMC is on the up and up because AMC is an astonishing business. 

You paid someone pennies to file forms to issue new shares and cash in off the backs of the everyday degenerates that kept your business afloat. You’ll acknowledge the sub, but continue to praise yourself. 

This dude is such a Chad. Fuckhead used our money to save his business and he can’t even match the pennies WSB donated to the Ape fund, compared to what he gained, using our money. He’s all PR and no substance. He just hopes we keep liking the stock.

Being honest, if this guy remains at the helm, I don’t actually like the stock. There’s money to be made buying dips and selling on upswings, but if I’m short on AMC I’m waiting that shit out.

2021-05-07 12:57:09,wallstreetbets,"I love this. I was talking with our local AMC movie manager over the last few days and was surprised they knew nothing about Reddit and AMC. I gave them a brief explanation and included the bit about AMC selling stock to retire debt. He was surprised. But he informed me of something that wasn’t public knowledge. Around the same time AMC gave its employees raises!!! He said everyone got a raise and he wondered why because many locations were still not opened. Way to give back AMC!!! Giving more to employees, even during tough time. Giving money to charity. I am a fan. And I will continue to go to all new releases and renewed my premiere membership early.."
2021-05-07 15:38:00,wallstreetbets,So I am new to this should I be buying the calls and the stocks or just the stocks?

2021-05-06 22:14:22,wallstreetbets,Nothing compared to the millions he gave himself during the first squeeze
2021-05-06 22:43:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe the AMC CEO should focus on changes to increase the value of their company’s share price.
2021-05-07 00:24:18,wallstreetbets,The CEO is giving money back cause he feels guilty for the Apes.
2021-05-07 02:45:51,wallstreetbets,CEO $50k + AMC's charitable org $50k = $100k worth of very unsubtle hints.

2021-05-07 09:35:58,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. It's amazing how few people in this thread actually paid attention to the facts of the situation and instead blinded listen, believe and praise any rhetoric they're fed by that guy. If he actually worked for the shareholders as he claimed on the call he wouldn't have issued shares or paid himself out for doing nothing. He would've used the money to get real strategic and transform the company but he didn't. Dudes lots of talk but no walk. The parallels are uncanny."

GME is still overpriced. I was in a Gamestop a week ago looking to buy my daughter a used Mario Game for the Nintendo Switch. It was $65 there... I googled the price on Walmart and it was $40. I walked across the parking lot and bought it for $25 cheaper....."

A billion in liquidity doesn't mean much when you only reached it by issuing over 300 million new shares and you lost over half a billion dollars last quarter."
2021-05-06 20:28:21,wallstreetbets,They’re going to need it if they keep posting huge losses like this

2021-05-07 10:21:00,wallstreetbets,You think buying shopping centers is a good idea? That is about the worst thing they could do.
2021-05-07 10:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I think you mean 2019 the revenue was 5.47B. 

But, since that number really doesn't matter you should see that their income was NEGATIVE $141 million in 2019."

2021-05-07 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,Wrong it’s the most money they’ve ever had in a quarter and are fine though 2022
2021-05-06 21:01:35,wallstreetbets,"Can't expect miracles after a worldwide pandemic, things need to be done in phases. For all intents and purposes, yes, the company should have filed chapter 11 and called it a day, but retail swooped in. For better or worse, they are still afloat and have plans in place to mitigate any more losses. I'm bullish for the year, as this next quarter will be a complete one with doors open rather than a partial quarter.  Long term, it's going to take a complete buy-out, merger, or severe scaling down operations."

2021-05-07 11:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was 2019 obviously because the pandemic.

And yea income was negative, which is expected when you are growing so rapidly through expansion. They acquired starplex cinemas, carmike cinemas and Nordic cinemas and more. 

Lol scrub. Keep trying. I’m here all day AND buying dips AND holding forever until the shorts cover."
2021-05-07 04:33:58,wallstreetbets,Just like your mom ?
2021-05-07 02:47:19,wallstreetbets,"Check what they've been spending on M&A in the last two quarters, might give a little hint.

What's going forwards? Sort debt, make money, go next?

Also are we really pretending we all came here to invest rather than trade (okay many of us have changed to investing maybe now with some of these businesses but originally) - what is this; The Motley Fool or something?"
2021-05-06 23:27:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a pony in this race but it seems to me that the future of movie theaters will involve less seats and more premium services like food/alcohol. They will try and increase the per patron revenue with add on services so that it's the experience that brings them back. Personally, spending $60-80 on a date to a movie theater doesn't appeal to me but it seems like the way the industry is going. 

One point to note is that studios do make more money on a theatrical first release which could delay the outright move to streaming first for a while.

With all that said you have some great points."

2021-05-07 02:54:20,wallstreetbets,Better than Marcus theaters in the Midwest. Google Marcus dream lounger logo. Drive past that everywhere
2021-05-07 11:33:42,wallstreetbets,"AMC is in seriously deep shit though. They're losing money out the ass, and even if movie demand snapped back 100% to pre-COVID levels today there's still a chance they may not make it. 


They are deep in debt and don't have a chance of climbing out of that hole as long as they're at reduced capacity, which they likely will be for all of Q2 as well. Furthermore, they're gonna be paying more in rent and debt payments this year, because they only survived last year by negotiating with their landlords and creditors to defer a lot to this year.


Even pre-pandemic they were struggling and barely making any money in a good year. Now they have quite a bit more debt and the interest rate is less favorable every time they take on more, due to their declining health. Their debt payments alone exceed the typical operating profits (when OI actually is profitable). And on top of all that, they're now likely to face reduced attendance due to studios bypassing theaters and releasing straight to streaming platforms.


I don't see how anyone could read that earnings report and think they're in remotely good shape. They aren't. There's a very good chance they're bankrupt by the end of next year. 


Movie theaters will survive, but that doesn't mean AMC will. They're miles up shit creek without a paddle."
2021-05-07 11:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Scrub? Jeez. A tough sensitive I see.

Honest question, what do you see them doing that will turn around their failing company AND industry? It has been dropping for years and would have gone broke had they not got saved by reddit.

Theaters are not getting stronger. They are going the same way as shopping malls. Retail can at least go online and keep making money. AMC is not going into streaming. They require people to actually show up. That isn't getting stronger."
2021-05-06 22:49:05,wallstreetbets,I just really like going to the movies.. people can drink alcohol at home but they still go to the bar/club even in a pandemic... movies give you a better experience period. Disney been sitting on a lot of 🔥🔥🔥🔥 they could’ve easily released a bunch of movies on streaming services but they haven’t.... I wonder why??
2021-05-06 23:42:03,wallstreetbets,"The amc sub is bomb, $40 for two people and you 3 movies a week. Makes for easy and cheap date nights. I love it!"
2021-05-06 20:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Orrrr you're a 40 year old who is used to taking girls on dates to movie theaters.

In my day, we just Netflix'd n chilled. In 2008 my biggest TV was 42"" and today that's the smallest TV in the house. I got Netflix, Amazon, someone else's Starz, life is good w/o AMC.

From 2001-2010 I probably saw 3-5 movies per year in theaters, from 2010-2015 maybe 2-3 per year, and from 2015-2021, grand total of like 3 movies in theater over those 6yrs.

When movie theaters open back up fully, guess what I'm gonna do?!?!?!? That's right! NOT GO!"
2021-05-06 20:48:14,wallstreetbets,That’s what I thought

2021-05-07 02:29:51,wallstreetbets,But could you imagine the ratings on that Pay Per View?
2021-05-07 12:53:10,wallstreetbets,Counter point: AMC stock certificates are the new inflation hedge
2021-05-07 14:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Talking truth to power lol. By my math they will be broke around Jan/Feb 2022. Unless retail buys more of their bad debt in the form of shares. 

I think they downsize a bit, muddle along, and ultimately survive. But the stock price is likely going to hover around $1 at that point."
2021-05-07 11:40:09,wallstreetbets,"And they were not “saved” by Reddit. If you actually paid attention, Adam Aron had already raised over a billion dollars before the Reddit frenzy happend. We just made it a CERTAINTY that AMC is loved and backed by the people. 

As of March 10 AMC has 3.2 million retail investors that own OVER 4/5 of shares. 

We didn’t save them from bankruptcy. They did that themselves, I’m sure you have no knowledge of what they’ve done behind the scenes like renegotiating debts and rents due. Adam Aron literally said last night they have enough cash to last to end of 2022. I definitely see more vaccines and regular life by 2022."

4 of the top 10 highest grossing box office movies of all time were in the last 3 years but you claim it’s a “dying industry”. No, it’s a industry that’s facing change, not dying. Movie theatres will never die. They’re connected to Hollywood and movie makers (or did you think they would just bend over and give up) 

You think A-list actors and directors want their movies to go straight to Netflix? Lmfao, scrub. A-list actors even get paid commission on how well the movies do on screen, hence why Gal Gadot was paid $10 mil on the side because they released Wonder Woman during the pandemic. Why do think most blockbusters were NOT released during the pandemic but pushed further down the road till the movies open up?

And amc is actually starting their “AMC on demand” though I don’t expect a lot from it. I’m expecting more business in the future from their a-list subscriptions"

With 4 of the top 10 highest grossing (dumb figure to track with inflation and all) and they STILL DIDN'T MAKE MONEY. I do agree with your comment about movie theaters not dying because the studios need them. But, they definitely aren't growing. The more money that Netflix/Amazon/Disney put into their platform the less movies need to go to theaters.

"" You think A-list actors and directors want their movies to go straight to Netflix?"" I think there is ample evidence that this is true. How many movies have been release that are just on the streaming services? The Rock is the biggest star and he has a couple.

Gal Gadot signed a contract before she knew WW84 was going to streaming. If you think that the lawyers won't change the contracts for steaming you are dumb. The contracts for all of this stuff will change drastically based on where the film is going.

Answer this, compared to 5 years ago are there more movies going to streaming? That right there cuts down AMC's cut from the total pie. I think that only blockbusters will go to theaters and that is just a dick measuring contest between the movie studios. If you look at Disney, they added the ""premium"" part to Disney+ in order to catch pay-per-view money on their first run movies. If they start pushing their kids movies and more side projects of Marvel to that AMC and every other chain will be screwed."

Average cost at $10? That is tough. Good luck. I am sure in 5 years you might be able to make a profit and chase some other meme stock where you buy way too high and try and justify after.

Regarding Disney, have you noticed how they are releasing Black Widow? That went from a blockbuster to a partial streaming release. That is revenue AMC will never see that they would have in the past (try and keep this in your mind when you think AMC will raise revenue). How many shows has Marvel/Disney released that could have been a movie? Wandavision, Falcon, Loki, etc. That is more lost revenue.

I agree that actors and other people trying to get a cut of the pie want the big movie release because they know how to count it. But, if you think Disney isn't going to keep releasing movies on both platforms you are crazy. I would assume you have seen all the animated movies going straight to Disney instead of a theater. More lost revenue.

You always comment about not knowing anything but list 1 thing you have written that isn't a headline. Do you know their current rent requirements? Do you know their current loan payments? Do you know the interest rates or principal? Basically, do you know anything about the company?

2021-05-07 00:38:28,wallstreetbets,"https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-says-stock-market-boom-ebullient-investors-warrant-caution-2021-05-06/

decent article by Reuters today on the possible bubble worries but its much deeper. there is a host of issues.. the income of the commercial real estate holders has been inflated due to covid and the need to keep the mortgages afloat. 

So as the income has gotten inflated and these properties were bought up during covid, real estate prices rose like crazy, Im sure you noticed. So all the mortgages come in with inflated incomes but there is a selection of mortgages which yield higher premiums as they carry more risk. As maybe you know these are bundled, rated, and sold. and there are plenty of CMBS ETFs worth total of hundreds of billions, if not over a trillion, on the market. With very large institutional holdings, obviously, which have large holdings.

The FED released their [Financial Stability Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20210506.pdf) today. Basically saying valuations are high. Equities more than doubled the avg annual growth (22.5 to 9%) last year, treasury securities have tripled avg annual growth (26 to  8.3%), high yield and unrated bonds have almost quadrupled it (25 to 7.1). Not to mention the risk premiums on high yield unrated bonds are to 2008 levels. 

Here is a key paragraph from the report on the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities market: ""Other indicators continue to show strains in CRE markets. Vacancy rates continue to increase, and rent growth has declined fur-ther. Additionally, delinquency rates on com-mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which usually contain riskier loans, remain elevated. Finally, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks, on net, reported weaker demand for most CRE loans and tighter lending standards in the fourth quarter of  2020 (figure 1-14)""

So basically, Commerial Real Estate is on an obvious bubble, about to come back down, and when it does, it is going to create a whole lot of turmoil. It will be reminiscent of 2008 as the bonds fail and tumble the house of cards.. again. Fuck.

Now Im sure if I know this, much smarter people do and have started hedging a market failure. So I have been paying attention to larger market options plays and noticed 60 million in puts bought on the S&P 500 today 7/16 strike 4000, 7/30 strike 3900, 9/17 strike 3100 and 3000 (30+million spent on just 9/17). All in large bulk orders. 

I am of the thesis we are about to see a massive correction on this mess."

2021-05-07 12:41:17,wallstreetbets,"There is one problem with the ""big tumble"" theory on the SnP500 and the real estate market.  And that is the value of cash with inflation.  I think cash is going to the toilet.  That said, things that can bring in steady cash, and can raise prices along with inflation, IE big corporations, can be a safe haven from inflation.  As far as real estate, there is a lot more competency in the borrowers on the residential side.  Commerical is probably a bubble, but, it has been brewing for a long long time.  I think diversity is key.  The only thing that really worries me is the confrontation on the horizon with China.  They are going to march into Taiwan very soon, unless they have a massive change of heart which is unlikely.  There is new world order controlled by a authoritarian regime that lies and tramples human rights to this day if we let it happen, and war if we don't.  War is a wild card in all this."

Anyway, I read that Nancy’s husband bought 10k shares of Roblox... on March 10th. Their IPO. That’s a pretty big difference than buying right before a big announcement. The disclosure of that purchase came a day or two before the announcement.

Any new content is contributed back to the community, which improves the game over time at low cost to the company.

It would be like watching a game of cubes evolve into a HD FPS game, all from the communities contribution. It's F'ng genius."

Ali baba is extremely undervalued. It’s a gift at this price. But no one can really predict when it will take off. It took off once people found out that jack ma was ok and then again when the communist government hit Ali baba with a fine.

It will go up, hopefully soon. But it might require some patience."

2021-05-07 00:47:05,wallstreetbets,Leaps are going to be expensive and risky. Baba is a giant with crazy revenue and cash on hand. It’s like a really undervalued Amazon. Jmia might slide further as the 10 year bond rates go up. Those types of stocks won’t do well once yields start going up.
2021-05-07 01:14:33,wallstreetbets,I bought shares and a few $250c 1/22 leaps... BABA is the type of stock that can go to 242.50 in a day. 01/23 leaps are far enough especially if your strike price is below $265.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WEBULL to FIDELITY Transfer...PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING **PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING**

I finally transferred my GME shares in Webull into Fidelity...but I thought i'd make this post to shed some light on the ""partial transfer"" vs ""full transfer""

I've have to do both since my partial transfer never went through...

**PARTIAL TRANSFER**

\- This will require a settled cash balance of $75 in your WEBULL account prior to the transfer being completed...

\- My partial transfer request was never completed and just on hold with no updates to the status on Fidelity's transfer tracker since 04/24 until I called Fidelity to find out that Webull had rejected the transfer...couldn't get Webull on the line to ask them why...

\- However, i decided to just initiate a full transfer after my friend was able to successfully transfer his shares over (read on)

**FULL TRANSFER**

\- Followed my friend's advice who did a full transfer of his account into Fidelity and I'm glad I did this.

\- I initiated the full transfer on 04/30 and was completed yesterday (so it will take about **3-4 days** for a full transfer, much quicker than the 1-2 weeks that they give as the amount of time they allow to process). (my estimated date of completion was 05/13 but it completed yesterday 05/05 and shares were available in my Fidelity account when I checked this morning 05/06).

\- In initiating a full transfer, it seems Fidelity actually paid that $75 transfer fee because **there was a $75 cash debit balance** that was transferred into my Fidelity account **along with my GME shares**.

\- And now i just had to deposit $75 into my fidelity account (which they're much quicker about) to maintain my account balance without any negative cash debits.

\- This route was FAR EASIER than having to go about the deposit $75 into Webull, wait for it to clear and then settle, then partial transfer, and wait for the partial transfer to complete...

I think this is a GOOD OPTION for ***those who do NOT already have a $75 settled cash balance in their Webull accounts***...like me, i didn't have $75 in settled cash and to ACH deposit, wait for it to clear, and then wait for it to settle in my Webull account would take about 7-10 days...plus the time it takes to complete the partial transfer from Webull into fidelity......I suggest instead of going through that hassle, to initiate a full transfer as it will only take about 3-4 days (took my friend 3, took me 4 but this could have been due to me initiating the transfer on a Friday evening).

\- However, if you DO have a $75 settled cash balance in your Webull account, then based on previous posts, my suggestion would be to just initiate a partial transfer through Fidelity as there would be no reason for the transfer request to be held up from Webull's end. This partial transfer, based on previous posts, seems to be completing in \~2 days as opposed to the full transfer's duration of \~3-4 days.

Just wanted to shed some light on this as I know there are many apes who are reluctant to transfer their shares into a broker with the assets to back up their positions...but if you're hesitating from transferring from Webull due to the $75 transfer fee etc, then I think this post should help you in getting your GME shares over to Fidelity ASAP based on your individual situation.

Edit: Not financial advice. What do I know? 💎✊🏼"

2021-05-07 01:51:11,wallstreetbets,I think this the bottom of the semiconductor pullback. You will start to see tech rebounding. I think the bank stocks have hit their peak. AMD will hit 100 by the end of the year. they raised their guidance and crushed their earnings. TSMC is now a customer to their customer since they are going with AMDs server cpus and Sony is working on their refresh PS5 already with AMD chips.

2021-05-06 21:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm more confident in $15 than $28.50 at this point. I'll just let it rest in peace. Stone-age technology is the future."

2021-05-07 08:26:31,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood imposed trading restrictions to prevent larger margin charges. Robinhood had to borrow billions to meet those charges and borrowed more to allow trading again. All these charges are based on volatility, and IV on GME was over 400%...

The decision was internal, but if they did nothing at all, all trading, including selling, would have been restricted. Clearing firms would stop taking orders altogether if Robinhood couldn’t meet margin requirements for clearing, which could have possibly led to bankruptcy.

The entire GME squeeze put huge strain on the clearing system. That’s the whole reason it became an issue. No one feels bad for the shorts, but clearing firms are the plumbing for markets. They need to keep working for all members.

Just stop using Robinhood. Use a real broker."

I think in his later years Vlad expresses regret on his biggest mistake and explains that DFV has to go back and correct his mistake taking down the hedgefunds and saving the world in return. Thats the timeline we are living. Vlad doesn't know whats going on in this timeline but the world will be a better place that he sent his grandson back to challenge him and SHF.

2021-05-07 09:01:11,wallstreetbets,"This doesn't look like perjury to me, but it could be depending on the timeline of events.

Vlad restricted trading to prevent being margin called. The DTCC/SEC waived the deposit requirements for Robinhood, but to what degree I'm not sure. The requirement was waived for the $2.2 billion capital requirement but would it have been waived if GME hit $1000 per share? Maybe, maybe not. 

In order to prove perjury you'd have to provide a timeline of events on when the margin call was to take effect, when Robinhood restricted trading, and when the capital requirement was waived. 

Because let's say you were going to be margin called (according to the rules), you restrict trading to cap losses, and then the capital requirement was waived at end of day before a normal margin call would have taken effect. I don't think that would be perjury because there's no way you would have known the capital requirement waiver was going to take effect. You were preparing for the margin call, then the waiver came in last minute.

But if Robinhood was in contact with the DTCC, was aware of the capital requirement waiver well enough in advance to not restrict trading, but restricted trading anyway, then there's a case there potentially."

2021-05-06 21:31:30,wallstreetbets,"""As the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States established, if a defendant’s statement is literally true, even if he or she intends to mislead the questioner, the defendant cannot be convicted under the federal perjury statutes. Therefore, “a wily witness” can avoid truthfully answering a question by providing an answer that appears truthful but actually omits material and sometimes even produces a lie by negative implication.1  ""

On January 28th deposit requirement was 10 times more than on the 25th. - Technically true.

As a result, Robinhood placed trading restrictions on certain securities... in order to meet increased regulatory depository requirements.   -  This is where it gets dicey.  We know why they placed the trading restrictions, but he can easily use this as an excuse.  Just because they got a waiver doesn't mean they can't decide to meet requirements anyways and be cautious themselves.  Essentially, if you get to the point where you're trying to prove the intention, you might as well charge them with a crime and forget the perjury.

Do I think he lied?  Absolutely.  It's just hard as hell to get someone on perjury.  It's why so many people ""stretch the truth"" under Oath, the standards are so high it's hard to convict someone on it.  His responses sound like a lawyer walked him through what to say so that it's tied to true things but in the end it's misleading and it's not why they did what they did.  If they gonna get him, it'll be for the crime, not lying about it."

2021-05-07 03:01:05,wallstreetbets,"when a company IPOs shares are sometimes hard to borrow, but usually not, as it's technically 0% short of float. (I practiced on a few recent IPOs and ticker changes, market transfers, etc.) And shorting can \*definitely\* crush the company at IPO. It is actually a great time to do it, as the volatility is extraordinarily high and there will be lots of peaks to ""sell"" at. I'm also not talking about a coordinated effort, I'm theoretically saying that if a bunch of retail investors all don't like the stock, do their own DD, and decide to short it, we have a place to meet up and share stories. Like fans from the same sports team meeting up at a bar. And theoretically, if 10+ millions of people short a hundred shares on average, of a $40/share 40B company... well... that's interesting, right?"

2021-05-06 23:18:48,wallstreetbets,"Never heard of dividends and just looked up some basics on it. 

So how exactly does this work, do they put the cash into your account as funds for trading or does it go straight to the bank? And how do you find out how much dividends are before buying a stock and how often you are paid?"
2021-05-07 00:32:38,wallstreetbets,"In both UWMC and RKT. I like them both as long-term investments. We go through various cycles in interest rates, housing, refis that can take years to play out. If inflation goes up now, then interest rates will follow (sooner or later) and people taking out mortgages now will refi down the road when rates decline again."

2021-05-07 01:22:58,wallstreetbets,"You can look up the dividend on most financial sites with ticker data (i.e., [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/) shows you the dividend).  


Typically a dividend is reported as annual but paid quarterly, so in UWMC's case it pays $0.10 each quarter, or $0.40 per year. This is per share of stock that you own.

When you purchase shares (or in your account settings) you are given an option to ""reinvest dividends"" (sometimes called ""DRIP"" for ""Dividend Re-Investment Plan"") or to take your dividends as cash.  


If you choose DRIP/reinvest, then your brokerage will execute a market buy on your behalf as soon as the dividend is paid. If you choose cash, your brokerage will deposit it into whatever your customary cash/money-market position is.  


For what it's worth, UWMC's $0.40/yr dividend means that if you bought shares at the closing price of $7.19 today, you are making a ($0.40/$7.19) 5.5% return on your investment \_every year\_. Another way to think of it is your avg-price-per-share goes down $0.40/yr."
2021-05-07 10:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Margin, balls deep in margin and the dividend is paying my interest"
2021-05-07 17:03:41,wallstreetbets,Its a good stock that I'll be happy to hold long term and sell covered calls on while I wait for my dividend AND for when the market finally reflects UWMC true value

2021-05-06 22:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Rkt is primarily refis. Hyper sensitive to rate movement. 

Uwmc is purchase mortgages. If you want to buy a house, that's that no matter if rates are up or down."
2021-05-07 02:07:17,wallstreetbets,They also stated that their margin per loan shrunk and will probably continue to shrink.
2021-05-07 05:08:29,wallstreetbets,"According to the National Associations of Realtors - who have a pretty good idea how many houses are selling, since they're the ones who sell them - UWMC is not going to meet expectations as the housing sales market is on a downward trend (owing to rising rates, lack of supply, etc. -3.5% month-over-month, to give you an idea.)

If fewer houses sell, fewer mortgages sell.

Change my view."
2021-05-07 03:29:22,wallstreetbets,"As the market shifts to purch, uwmc has room to grow their margin per loan."
2021-05-07 10:44:11,wallstreetbets,Yes and already priced in

2021-05-07 03:34:09,wallstreetbets,"The problem on that side of the fence is that there is a shortage of supply on the purchase side. By the time it ramps up, there will be a surplus of inventory, but it will be because of rampant foreclosures.

At that point the margin is often baked in. Then there will be an over correction in the market, higher mid scores, lower ltv, matrices for wholesalers and lenders in general will get chopped with a machete rather than a scalpel.

It’s happened every time the bubble bursts."
2021-05-07 02:13:56,wallstreetbets,If that works for you. Cheaper than talking to a therapist about your little penis right?

2021-05-07 14:17:59,wallstreetbets,It's fucking brutal man
2021-05-07 10:42:17,wallstreetbets,"He likely has a target. My guess is Late May, early June announcement. We are about 10 months in, so no we are still far away from a redemption. He had originally said he was on track for a Q1 2021 announcement so either he is still close or that deal fell through."
2021-05-07 16:05:45,wallstreetbets,I started selling covered calls. We might be here for a while.
2021-05-07 17:11:10,wallstreetbets,Enough people are catching on to this that the premiums are drying up... F.
2021-05-07 17:11:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah rkt premiums are bad but pltr is still decent due to earnings next week.
2021-05-07 17:12:59,wallstreetbets,I think the move might just be to sell 3 months out at breakeven and stop looking at Robinhood until then.
2021-05-07 17:17:35,wallstreetbets,"I might do that myself. Just want to get to breakeven point and get out of these shit stocks. Pltr might be fine in the long run, not sure about rkt."
2021-05-07 17:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I actually am more confident in rocket. Rocket made 2.4B in EBITDA (this quarter alone) and has a 1B stock buyback in place that they haven't started yet. Imo the time for them to do it is now as the price is absolutely demolished. Although there is a lot to be excited about with Palantir, the rampant selling of shares by the CEO, coupled with the fact that there is no concrete roadmap to profitability worries me."
2021-05-07 17:30:10,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has been winning contracts left and right. Big data company and they will always have military contracts. Their platforms are state of the art and they are much further ahead in this market while others are playing catchup. CEO is selling off but to pay taxes for his gains. What worries me about PLTR is if commercial doesn't grow fast enough and all the stock they are awarding for compensation to employees. They also havent been profitable since they started. But I think they can only grow with all the contracts they keep acquiring. 

RKT is at IPO price, so it means market is ignoring 3 quarters of gains. If interest rates go up and housing market starts to cool off, they are not in a good position. I didn't know they had a billion dollar stock buyback program."
2021-05-07 17:48:06,wallstreetbets,Agreed on all counts with PLTR. I trust Bank or America Global Research and CFRA the most when it comes to price targets and their new RKT post earnings price targets with interest rate rise taken into account are 24 and 22. If either of those come to fruition we will be well rewarded for our patience.
2021-05-07 17:51:46,wallstreetbets,"I dont know about being well rewarded, i think we will be able to exit our positions with a minor scratch. I have a friend who bought PLTR at 27, I myself bought at 24. I had my sister buy the dip at 23...and it kept dipping. RKT is at 24, a friend bought at 22. I averaged down a bit but still.

I couldnt find much on the RKT buyback program and they just went IPO a few months ago so I think the dividends from last time were how they rewarded shareholders. Unfortunately I sold before the ER and took a loss, now I just have to stick tight, and hope I dont get cucked again."
2021-05-07 17:56:00,wallstreetbets,I can assure you that there is a 1B buyback in addition to the one time divvy. They mentioned on the earnings call just the other day that it was still approved. Yeah my rkt price is 20 so I suppose I'm in a different boat.
2021-05-07 18:05:07,wallstreetbets,"""Rocket previously [authorized up to a $1 billion stock buyback](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2020/11/10/quicken-loans-rocket-companies-third-quarter-profits-buyback/6239432002/), but has yet to actually repurchase any shares.""  


copy + paste from this earnings transcript

""**Doug Harter** \-- *Credit Suisse -- Analyst*

Thanks. Julie, you highlighted the strong liquidity cash position that you currently have. Can you just talk about, I guess, how you're thinking of what the level that you need to kind of -- need to hold and how you would be thinking about future potential return of capital given future cash flow?

**Julie Booth** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*

Yes. Sure can. Thanks for the question. And we do have substantial liquidity, as I mentioned in the business today.

And as we think about the level in the business, really, we're going to be looking at first and foremost, as I know I've mentioned before, investing back in the business is going to be the first place that we're going to look to deploy that capital. So whether that comes from the investments that we're making, either in brand or whether we're making that in technology or potentially acquisitions that may be of interest to us as we continue to look for those things that are additive to our business, either to our tech platform or our reach, and that is something that we'll continue to look at. And then if that is not something that we see in the near term as we look out here, we will potentially look to return some capital to shareholders, either through doing a dividend like we had done here or potentially through a share buyback. So that's kind of the way we're going to keep looking at how we manage our cash as we go forward here."""
2021-05-07 18:24:56,wallstreetbets,"Ahh good to know.
And at 20, you'll be just fine. But a lot of other people got fucked, some bought as high as 27 to 30. Hopefully nobody bought at the high of 40."

Feel sorry for you OP, hope you learn from this ."
2021-05-07 01:07:12,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I think you’ve gotten some great advice on this thread. I hope you do look into getting a better paid job — there are a lot out there. My brother doesn’t have a degree and makes $200k per year (and we grew up poor as shit, no connections or anything). You sound like a really good and kind hearted person and you should have a place to live and some savings! A new job would definitely help make that happen.  I’ll add two pieces of advice: one, read some basic investing books, bogleheads (Google it) and shit like that. Go to the library and get the actual books! Two, don’t let this experience put you off of investing in the stock market. Figure out what an IRA is and open an account at fidelity or vanguard or something like that and put $100 or whatever you can into an index fund every month.  VTI or VOO or something like that (Google it). If you do that for the next ten to forty years, you will have a fucking life changing amount of money at the end. Losing all your money on a terminal option play fucking sux, but i legit believe that real long term investing is pretty much the only way out of wage slavery in this country, for the average person. Anyway dude, hang in there and please report back when you get into a better job... we’ll be rooting for you."

2021-05-06 21:54:48,wallstreetbets,"First step, get a better job. No reason to ever accept minimum wage. That's purely from you not knowing your worth. Costco pays $16/hr. Target is $15. Sometimes you need to leave your comfort zone to make progress. 

As for the stock loss... Never buy options, always sell. Too many people buy and lose their asses because they don't realize it is just gambling."
2021-05-06 22:29:49,wallstreetbets,Don't worry about losing. You have more than 12 years to wait. Every turmoil lasted for a year or less. But the bulls lasted for a decade.

2021-05-07 03:13:21,wallstreetbets,"I get buying the future call options.. but start w owning a stock and selling a Covered call.  RKT is a pretty decent company. The problem is that in a rising interest rate enviornemnt, they expect a slow down in refinances and originations. Hence a reduction in the expected stock price due to lower EPS and FCF.
Definitely not being critical here, we've all had set backs.  Better luck tomorrow."
2021-05-07 12:18:22,wallstreetbets,I hope you enjoy the next 21 years at Wendy's as much as the first 21!

2021-05-06 20:13:25,wallstreetbets,Sell you position if it bounces up tomorrow and put it in a growth stock like TAP. It’s not sexy like the a YOLO but you’ll sleep well.

2021-05-07 00:16:47,wallstreetbets,thank you for your kind words:)  losing it doesn't impact my life very much.  It going up would have been a huge change in my life and it was worth the risk at least for a shot at it.  Hope your day was better than mine!

I still have 3k which to me is still a ton of money.  i moved into my car a few months ago to save money, I will bounce back!  Wont invest in the market for a while, if ever again.  Gambling is only smart for those who have excess and want more.  I wanted to knock down my debt so i could afford to rent and live indoors again.  I  am not smart but took the chance anyways.  I knew i was either going to lose it all or make enough to make a huge change in my life instantly.  It was worth the risk to me as I have very little to lose at this point.  Thank you for taking time to offer your opinion.  I made this public in hopes that people (especially low income workers) would see and think twice before making any risky investments."

I don't know what selling options means but I am looking it up.  i know that any purchase in the stock market is gambling with different levels of risk.  I realize now that call options with short term expirations are incredibly risky.  Thank you for taking time to share your advice with me!

2021-05-06 22:08:21,wallstreetbets,Dude the fact you’ve had 34 jobs shows you are good enough to find something above minimum wage
2021-05-07 03:27:44,wallstreetbets,"People like you terrify me.  Not because I have any judgement against you or what you do, but because when AI comes what's going to happen to you and others who make minimum wage?  I don't mean kids who flipped burgers during high school, but adults who make minimum wage for years.  What happens to people like you?  How will we make sure you're okay?

Sorry you lost so much money.  Cut your losses and sell to close your position.  Then focus on building a real skill so you're out of this lifestyle.  Hope that doesn't come off as preachy.  Again, I'm just really worried about the future when common minimum wage jobs don't exist."

2021-05-07 17:52:00,wallstreetbets,"You get an income statement from your brokerage and just report it like any other tax form. But working minimum wage means you're likely paying close to $0 in taxes.  A tax ""write off"" just reduces your taxable income. If you're making \~22k/year and use a standard deduction your taxable income is <10k. The investment loss will drop that to <$7k. The tax rate on <10k is 10% so a $3000 tax writeoff will reduce your taxes by $300.

A lot of idiots imply it's no big deal to lose money on investments because you get a write off. In the absolute best case, you would recoup 37% of your loss - and you would only recoup this much if your annual income is >500k."
2021-05-06 20:51:43,wallstreetbets,"My advice might be boring and lame for WSB standards, but if you ever want to put money in the market again choose something safe. A company like Coca Cola for example which is already over 100 years old, and will probably be around for the next 100 years. It's not as volatile as meme stonks, pays a nice dividend, and as prices will always go up over the long run it's a safe bet. 

Just don't expect to get rich overnight, but it beats losing money on RKT calls..."

2021-05-06 22:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls is an optimistic guess but still gambling. Selling calls is the opposite. By having the shares you are optimistic but you also realize some gain is better than no gain at all. You are literally giving someone the right to buy your shares at a set price. This is a covered call. The best thing I learned ten years ago is that it is easier to make money when you stop losing money. Covered calls allowed me to trade sideways, up, down, etc without having to realize losses. I could then be patient, wait until it runs, and increase my portfolio in the process. 

Of course there is more strategy to it to make big money but learning to.hedge your bets will make you money without the heartache of other options trading."

2021-05-07 02:53:37,wallstreetbets,"You seem like you're level-headed, sincerely nice, and have a good sense of humor.  I will echo some of what's been said elsewhere in this thread: use your strengths to your advantage, and, if you want, find a job that pays you for the experience you have working with people.  Good managers/leaders aren't ruthless, they are people who can inspire and influence others toward a goal.

Look how much respect you've garnered from some of the most actually ruthless people on the internet (WSB).  There's something to be said for that.  Don't sell yourself short anymore. 

Best of luck."

Also, the reopening of bars will drive up revenue and they are reinstating their dividend. It should get to $100 by end of year. This will bring its valuation in line with its market sector.

2021-05-06 22:14:25,wallstreetbets,thank you for being supportive!  i am looking now.  today was an incredibly eye opening experience for me that i will never forget.  it is making me question everything in my life.
2021-05-07 03:47:38,wallstreetbets,"when ai takes over, all that will be left for humans to do is creative work.  I have built many creative projects over the years but none have turned lucrative yet.  instead of focusing on creative projects that satisfy my ego, i have begun building projects that are designed to help people.  i invest my time into creating & producing and further my skill set in the hours i am not working my job(s).  i have not figured out a way to earn income through my projects yet (15 years, 7 different projects.)  the 2 i am working on now are both about others, not me.  I expect they will have more of a chance to become lucrative.  If not, they will help others regardless.  Adults that work minimum wage and who have no creative faculty and/or desire to turn ideas into tangible projects will be the hardest hit when AI is implemented.  I don't worry about myself.  I worry about those people.  I expect there may be some sort of UBI at that time as the only job they would be able to do is spend money in the economy.  That is not my future.  I made this gamble to get back indoors so i can create easier.  medical debt has limited what i can do temporarily.  I will be completely fine when AI comes about.  I know how to survive on very little.  A lot of people have not had to learn this skill.  they will be the ones we need to help if there is not a system in place to help them survive.  just a random thought.  i cant sleep.  thank you for your input and I agree with your sentiment!"

2021-05-06 20:03:06,wallstreetbets,its going to be ok.  i had calls too.  its just money.  easy to feel its the end of the world but its not.  its just a lesson that cost us 40-50% of our investment/savings money.  so many people have suffered so much worse than losing money in stocks.  i have food in my belly and a car to sleep in and am super grateful for both.  it will get better!  today is tough but mindset is everything.
2021-05-06 21:08:08,wallstreetbets,all options.  first time in the market!  i was hesitant to buy shares because i misunderstood the taxes if i sold before a year.  realizing now options are incredibly risky.  now i know!
2021-05-07 03:53:31,wallstreetbets,"and i did.  best lesson i have ever had in finances.   i am actually grateful for the thought patterns it is spurring.  i realize had i profited, i would think i know how the market works and would probably take more risks in a similar fashion.  this has inspired me to learn about the market in and out before i make any more investment decisions.  You are right, the chance has to be realistic.  Without knowledge i was just guessing on what was realistic.  RKT on paper looked great to me, i did not think about future interest rates affecting the company in the ER 2 days ago, but i absolutely should have.  thank you for taking time to comment.  i value your input and i am listening."

2021-05-06 21:50:01,wallstreetbets,Truckers do very well. My uncle clears well over $150k a year doing long haul.
2021-05-07 01:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Truck driving isn't all sunshine and butterflies. I drove OTR/long haul for 10 years before getting in a bad accident and almost dying.

I worked for 3 different companies during that time and my average take home was about $75,000-$85,000 a year, but I was almost never home. I took time off twice per year, usually 2 weeks in mid November to go elk hunting and 1 week for Christmas, aside from that I lived in my truck.

Truck driving can and will ruin your life if you let it. I lost touch will all of my old friends and found it impossible to keep any type of relationship going because I was never home.

There are tons of other decent jobs out there that offer decent pay and you don't have to run yourself ragged working 11-14 hours per day and keep you away from home for months at a time. Truck driving also happens to be one of the most dangerous jobs that exists.

Also, don't take to heart any dollar amount that someone says ""their uncle"" or ""their friend"" says they make. Truck drivers are some of the biggest bullshitters on the face of the planet and from my experience most of them like to exaggerate how much money they make and most also don't take into account the money they end up spend living on the road - it's not cheap.

Don't make the same mistake(s) I made. Stay away from the trucking industry. There's a reason there is a nationwide truck driver shortage. It is a shitty profession to be in and it's only getting worse."

im not sure what OTC means but i am looking it up now.  The options are worth $350 total right now.  I was planning on either selling tomorrow or riding them to $0.  I invested knowing i was either going to profit or lose it.  at the time the risk seemed worth a life changing event to escape the poverty trap.  I made the choice and will live with it.  thank you for taking time to offer me advice!  \*edited not $350, they are worth $180\*"
2021-05-07 02:56:12,wallstreetbets,"no worries!  it was worth the risk for a life change.  i honestly did not know if would go up or down.  I bet up in hopes to change my life and it did the opposite.  just a bad choice.  good lesson though!  and it was worth the risk after 20+ years of low income.  if i lost, i would still be in the same spot, if i didnt, everything would instantly change.  im glad i was confident enough to make the gamble and try my hand in the market after watching so many success stories the past year.  in the end i learned a great lesson, and instead of being called an idiot, the people in this sub gave me lots of helpful advice.  i am blown away by that.  i really thought i would only get made fun of for losing more than 10 years of work in 1 day."

To all my fellow apes that decided to buy GameStop… Guess what… You have a voting interest now inside the company! During a stockholder meeting there is the ability to vote on board members… 

Wanted to throw a few ideas out there:

1) The board obviously recommends the directors who are currently on the board.  How say we?  Is DFV not on the list of nominees?  Can he be?

2) Item 2 on the list is an advisory, non-binding vote on the executive compensation.

3) if you want to discuss routine matters, it needs to be done at least 15 days prior to the meeting. Is there anything else we want to bring up?

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Advice to new investors, from a new investor Advice to New Retards from another relatively new Retard.

I am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account. It was not nearly enough, and below are things that I in hindsight wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on.

· More often than not, when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news. That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock. The best example of this is DKNG for my portfolio. The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding. New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization. New states legalizing Sportsbooks. Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios. Fantastic YoY growth. Purchasing or expanding their media footprint. At face value, all of this news should have them trading at least 40% higher than what they were at for Jan 1. But it isn’t it is trading at about 15% higher than what it was then. As I mentioned, more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that.

· Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses. The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit/loss orders. 20% for-profit and 16% for loss. Set it and forget it. Period. Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all, take your 5% and exit. Whatever you think is best for your financial situation and portfolio. Or if you are long on the stock, don’t even look at the daily for it. If you know your entry, and you know where you want to exit. The same thing set it and forget it. Looking at the daily will only cause stress. Trust me, I fucking know. RKT is my example of that. I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of $22.8. But I should’ve taken my fucking profit when it peaked at $43 in March. Pocketed my gains, and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out. But no, I held. I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March. Guess what. It fucking didn’t. It dropped to a little over $19 per share today. I am long on RKT, as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry. BUT I should’ve taken my profits and re-entered

· I’m retarded. You’re retarded. We’re all fucking dipshits and if you think you’re not then you’re probably the biggest dipshit in here. Now that is out of the way. Don’t invest in a stock/company if you don’t understand what the fuck they are actually doing. MVIS is that example for me. Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD. But it might as well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn’t and don’t understand a god damn word of it. Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit. I don’t know. I don’t understand it. But  I invested, and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers. Entered at $22 and cut my losses at $16 per share. YTD, because of what I threw at it. It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future, but I don’t understand it and won’t be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing (probably not going to happen). Oh well, it taught me a great lesson.

· Trying to play earnings is risky, to say the least. Again, RKT is a great example of that. Honestly, their earnings report was overall very good, and they only slightly missed their projections. But because they did miss it, it has fallen around 20%. Also, even if the company beats its earnings projection, it may not increase a whole lot. If any, and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop. Look at AMD, that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG. AMD is a great long stock as well, but good luck trying to predict what the fuck it is actually going to do before, or after earnings. I mean shit, really even daily.

· Do you own god damn DD. Read every DD post on here, and take it with a grain of salt. More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched, but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio % in that. It’s like listening to a Wendy’s employee tell you that they have the best fries, and no other fries compared to theirs. Well yeah, mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are.

· Figure out your own goals with your portfolio. Whether that’s you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in. Or split your portfolio in half and do both. Up to you, but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so.

· If you are able to, put everything you can into a Roth IRA, it is exempt from capital gains tax. You can put a maximum of $6,000 in it per year. Do that before you put any money anywhere else. You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of it. But really, you shouldn’t withdraw anything out of it ever. Have an individual account with fuck around money, or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever. You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.

· ETF’s are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually. Take BETZ for example. For most investors, especially as they are starting off you may not have the expendable income to just outright purchase stocks like PENN for example. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them.

· Paper trading is an underutilized resource. It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially. Do it. Do it even if you’ve been trading for a while. It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market.

· Finally, you’re not DeepFuckingValue. He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in-depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them. Researched Board members, followed market trends, and ultimately, he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it. Everything, obviously, worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not. GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster. Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock, with as much as he did for GME. Don’t pretend you will, and don’t lie to yourself saying you will. I joined here in January, and have learned so much. But again, I’m a fucking idiot and so are you.

&#x200B;

If you have any advice, you wish you would've been told when you first started. Please add it.

&#x200B;

Edit Note:

 I originally listed TQQQ as an example in the portion of ETFs. Since this post was written as a post for beginners and it was discussed and agreed upon that TQQQ is poor example of that and not a beginner ETF, I changed it to BETZ instead and instead of citing TSLA or NVDA. I list PENN as an example."

2021-05-06 21:03:48,wallstreetbets,Ive learned to be patient and give a stock you believe in time to preform. And most of all don’t panic when they drop. Im down 30k in the past few days and trying to practice what ive learned. Lol
2021-05-06 21:22:31,wallstreetbets,"Please just open a chart before you buy the big names on here. If you see the latest trash wsb stock is up 20000% in the past month, don't buy it. Stocks are cyclical in the short-term. If it's massively overbought, the chances are very good it's gonna revert (aka crash). Don't be the degenerate that buys the top."
2021-05-06 21:32:14,wallstreetbets,Ya but he quadrupled down at 155. It's currently 160 so I'm feeling good
2021-05-06 22:37:10,wallstreetbets," we all want to get rich, sorry very rich  yesterday. 

Well put together."

2021-05-07 01:04:50,wallstreetbets,Calls on DKNG you say...
2021-05-07 01:14:45,wallstreetbets,Fucking love it
2021-05-07 01:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Well put, well said."
2021-05-07 02:39:52,wallstreetbets,"What yall have to understand is that the stock price will move not in relation to a company's earnings targets, but in relation to investors earnings predictions.

A company can completely smash thier own earnings target but if investors thought they should have done better, the price will fall. And vice versa. 

You can get earnings estimates from analyst reports and use those as a benchmark instead of the company's own earnings targets. Typically they arent accurate, but can give you a better idea of what investors expect, which is more important than being accurate."
2021-05-07 03:08:24,wallstreetbets,"I think this post is great.  Not your advice or perspective, but the fact that you see the truth — you started playing with good intentions but not understanding the whole picture.  Everyone who realizes they too can play will encounter this.  I myself am just a fool with $$ so I share some of these sentiments.  FOMO took hold and now I’m stuck waiting for time to tell.  My wife, knowing that I had (HAVE) a gambling problem called me out so now I have to HOLD on everything or GTFO and pay her $50 for the bet we took that I would win/lose playing the stocks"
2021-05-07 03:26:58,wallstreetbets,YOLO only what you can lose 100%.  That is my mantra.
2021-05-07 03:58:54,wallstreetbets,"HI everyone, Im to am a retard, for a couple years now... and i trade options.... STILL!"
2021-05-07 07:09:28,wallstreetbets,You wrote a lot of words but the only tickers I saw in there were MVIS and RKT. I have to assume you're saying to buy them with that many words so I'm in.
2021-05-07 10:31:59,wallstreetbets,What's the best investing app for new investors?
2021-05-07 11:46:19,wallstreetbets,"The general problem with this advice, is it's completely mixed in it's goals.

First establish what you are doing, is it:

1. Trading as a primary source of income
2. Speculating and looking for a home run
3. Investing

This is WSB so the only thing of interest here is 1 and 2, and mostly 2. 

No one on here should be risking blowing up a portfolio if that's all they got. Have a main portfolio, take a percentage that you are comfortable losing (10-90%) and put that into a secondary portfolio. Keep your shit separate. 

If you're trading, focus on not losing money. That's the game. Make your winners pay for your losers. Reality is most of us can't do that. The market is simply better at this than you. Most of us don't have the discipline to define a strategy, implement it ruthlessly every time, and then evaluate and refine. If you do, good for you and fuck you.

If you're speculating, realize that's what you're doing. You want as many shots as you can take on things you think will moon. Adjust your profit/loss accordingly. Have an exit strategy. You will strike out on some. Same rule as above, just less fear of losses. Just remember you can offset all your gains with losses and roll some losses forward for taxes, be big brain. 

If your investing, the fucks an exit strategy. Get strong holding bags."

2021-05-06 20:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Damn, oh how I wish this post was around when I joined in Feb... Learnt this stuff the hard way - especially taking profits and cutting losses."
2021-05-07 02:21:07,wallstreetbets,"This is literally the worst advice I’ve seen.

“Take your 5% and exit”

Excuse me? Why the hell am I going to invest in single stocks and then settle for 5% when a total market index should net me 10% a year... I’m trying to beat the market with these picks, not hover below a passive index fund"
2021-05-07 12:39:22,wallstreetbets,"For years I was a buy and hold investor. I had the 20/16 rules. Then, a thing called GameStop, AMC, and Microvision happened. I made 100 percent on MVIS in less than a week. Guess what, Idgaf anymore it's just fun. I just put all in on VIAC(om) because fuck it. If you lose money, rub some dirt on it and by more retard. Listen to the apes on WSB, they'll make you rich"
2021-05-07 02:57:12,wallstreetbets,That COIN got meh 2.  🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-05-07 05:56:12,wallstreetbets,So glad I was too broke to jump on the Coinbase train
2021-05-07 14:54:55,wallstreetbets,I bought it at 397. I have my hopes on its earnings next week
2021-05-07 14:58:52,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-05-07 01:18:28,wallstreetbets,That's my intention if I can extricate myself from my current shit position. I thought a third into stocks everyone believes in  a third into stocks I believe in and a third on speculation was a solid strategy but now I aim for a quarter in each and a quarter cash for correction.
2021-05-06 21:39:47,wallstreetbets,in the same boat with ya dude.
2021-05-07 06:47:23,wallstreetbets,"His problem was buying at the top. You’re supposed to buy at the bottom, and *sell* at the top. What an absolute goofball."
2021-05-06 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I used TQQQ as an example of if you cannot afford TSLA or NVDA. You can still invest in them through TQQQ, not it being one for beginners."
2021-05-07 09:26:25,wallstreetbets,"I did just edit the post because of this comment thread, a great point with TQQQ not being an ETF for beginners. I simply tried to list it as an example of an ETF not the generalization of it being boring or not sexy but I see where that could be confusing."
2021-05-06 22:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you guys really are retarded. If a hedge fund with people hired to follow a companies every move, access to more information than the public and able to speak with the management team can get it wrong you're 5 min DD can also be wrong. Cutting losses is the toughest yet most important part of investing. Let your winners run and cut your losses quick."
2021-05-07 09:52:39,wallstreetbets,Tried. They banned it. Probably all the f bombs and retard talk.
2021-05-07 01:22:40,wallstreetbets,it's not a coincidence either...MM know your pain tolerance and even pays for your orderflow. That's why so many people selling RIGHT before a stock rockets to the moon or buys right before a stock plummets to the Earth's core.
2021-05-06 22:43:35,wallstreetbets,First one’s free dude... :D

Or you're like me: Finally had some money to start investing, and started learning/investing in December 2020/January 2021. Despite averaging in, the market crashed and all of a sudden, everything is -20 to -40%."
2021-05-07 06:47:12,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? We were up 0.08% both yesterday and on tuesday.
2021-05-07 01:26:28,wallstreetbets,not fun catching knives...why don't you buy more when AMD starts going back up? lol
2021-05-07 13:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Real talk. As I said, that is the most confusing stock I think I have witnessed since I have started this journey."
2021-05-06 20:42:50,wallstreetbets,"Not all ETFs are that boring. If you want risky ETFs go for leveraged ones - OP mentioned TQQQ, which tracks the NASDAQ and give you 3x leverage. There are many others like SOXL for semiconductors and NAIL for homebuilders, for example."
2021-05-07 03:40:52,wallstreetbets,"I made a comment earlier, that with the millions of new users to this sub. Maybe, just maybe, we should be ok with providing slight guidance to new investors."
2021-05-07 01:23:49,wallstreetbets,less you have options that expire lnao
2021-05-07 00:19:20,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, this belongs on personal finance or r/investing but for some reason mods are allowing this"
2021-05-06 22:42:03,wallstreetbets,That’s absolutely horrible advice.
2021-05-06 21:41:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've read a fair amount and cannot truly say I understand them fully. high-risk high reward. But I'm not touching them either."
2021-05-07 02:42:36,wallstreetbets,Who hurt you
2021-05-07 15:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Good advice for rookie trading but down the road would be better to adjust.
I liken it to the advice in the Matrix.... “Always stay off the freeway.”.....til  the freeway had to be used"
2021-05-07 03:03:39,wallstreetbets,"Or the newly minted.  As an 80s survivor, I never expected Playboy to hurt me.  

As an degenerate professional, I didn’t think COIN would hurt me too ☹️"
2021-05-07 03:04:17,wallstreetbets,I’ll take the rich and leave the very for the needy 😎
2021-05-07 09:15:30,wallstreetbets,Did mention DKNG. But you do you boo boo.
2021-05-07 10:49:34,wallstreetbets,"I use WeBull and I like it a lot. I almost went with SoFi as from what I can tell they seem to be pretty user-friendly as well.. but I also hear good things about Fidelity. But I would not know, the only two apps I have ever used were Robin Hood and WeBull. Transferred my entire portfolio out of RH to WeBull."
2021-05-07 11:58:56,wallstreetbets,"All great points and if I were to try and sum up the entire post, and IMO, the most important part is to establish the goal for your account (what you listed in 1, 2, or 3) and create your strategy from there. I also did not lay out any goals in the post. I simply am just stating the the things that I have personally learned and listing my own examples of that."
2021-05-07 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,Well you can spell so that’s a start.
2021-05-07 07:51:34,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-05-07 06:49:36,wallstreetbets,You can basically not learn it any other way than the hard way tbh.
2021-05-07 02:26:40,wallstreetbets,Hey there smooth brain. Read the literal next sentence. Whatever you think is best for your portfolio or financial situation.
2021-05-06 23:07:53,wallstreetbets,"TQQQ is down 5% this week and barely over even for the month, down 5% for the total past 3 months"
2021-05-07 09:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Yup, acknowledge fully I made that mistake, and I learned from that. But I didn't bring up MVIS to list my loss for it. The example for me, is that I do not/didn't understand their company or exactly what it is they are producing."
2021-05-06 23:22:23,wallstreetbets,Triple Leveraged QQQ is aggressive
2021-05-06 22:36:01,wallstreetbets,Did you mean QQQ?
2021-05-07 07:36:03,wallstreetbets,"> ETF’s are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky

Here you're presenting it as less risky 

>...not it being one for beginners.

You wrote this whole thread for beginners."
2021-05-07 07:41:49,wallstreetbets,"not really, the best way to prevent loss is to diversify and not have all your eggs in the same basket"
2021-05-07 08:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Really?  Shit well I guess I should cash out, it’s time to retire"
2021-05-07 06:30:52,wallstreetbets,"well it was.. about 8 days ago

and now what?"
2021-05-07 08:49:44,wallstreetbets,What’s the fun in that?
2021-05-07 14:05:09,wallstreetbets,Haha... I’m just joking around.. I still plan on buying more AMD though... just waiting to close a couple other positions first
2021-05-06 21:12:48,wallstreetbets,FAS and NGRU look good too. NGRU did something like 10% a day for three days straight. But I am still working on understanding decay and rebalancing... seems similar to theta on options
2021-05-06 21:32:21,wallstreetbets,"I used TQQQ as an example of if you cannot afford TSLA or NVDA. You can still invest in them through TQQQ, not of it being a boring ETF."
2021-05-07 01:06:21,wallstreetbets,No one here is a financial advisor so I wouldn’t take any advice
2021-05-07 01:44:09,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying that we just shouldn’t give general advice to the millions of new people here, so we don’t have a majority of people just losing their asses in the market. Especially for people on fixed incomes, or who really can’t afford to lose well below what is the minimum requirements to post loss porn in this group."
2021-05-07 00:10:32,wallstreetbets,i think people see loss porn from people who blew their life savings on FDs and get scared off lmao
2021-05-06 22:41:49,wallstreetbets,"This is a fucking horrible idea. Options are pretty much the only way to ever gain the agility to change positions / outlook with a flick of the wrist. They don’t have to be used alone, they can be very skillfully used in conjunction with stock. Ignoring options is foolish.

Don’t go into options blindly, mind you, but saying “fuck options” is probably the dumbest shit you can do if you expect to be successful at trading.

Buy Options as a Strategic Investment by McMillan. EASILY the best money you can spend to learn basically everything about options."
2021-05-07 03:06:33,wallstreetbets,This is literally not an option that is best for anyone.. let me expose myself to the riskiest investing option and limit my gains to 5% while exposing myself to incredible downside risk. Ok.
2021-05-07 09:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Honestly even though that matters a lot, what matters more is timing your entry and exit points. You would have been fine if you did the reverse and bought after it consolidated instead of buying when it was ripping. Your loss really didn’t have anything to do with you not knowing what LiDAR is. It’s good though that you learned from that because confidence in your investment can mean the difference between holding strong through a downturn, and panic selling on a simple price consolidation."
2021-05-07 02:08:33,wallstreetbets,"No. It was literally just an example of an ETF, that is all."
2021-05-07 09:13:21,wallstreetbets,"I wrote verbatim: take TQQQ for example. For most investors, especially as they are staring off you won’t have $700 or to to throw at TSLA or NVDA. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already jade shares. 

I acknowledge I probably couldve use a better example, but I simply just listed that as a general example. Not as a beginner ETF, or even recommending it. Just an example of an ETF, that is all."
2021-05-07 00:10:02,wallstreetbets,"most brokers offer fractional shares so affordability isnt a concern unless youre dealing with options

and nobody should be hopping into a triple leveraged ETF without understanding what theyre getting themselves into lmao--- QQQ would be a better noob-friendly blind buy for NASDAQ/tech exposure"
2021-05-07 11:01:36,wallstreetbets,"let me repeat myself, this belongs elsewhere. The original theme of this sub is quote ""4chan found a bloomberg terminal. This place was for shitposting and gambling, celebrating wins and losses. If someone needed to read this post THEY SHOULD NOT BE HERE and should stay out until they are ready. 


Why should we care about the new people here? All of us came here knowing it is a ""wallstreetbet"". Didn't you know too?"
2021-05-07 01:46:12,wallstreetbets,I stated that I don’t fully understand them. I’m not going to put anything into options until i’ve done more research.
2021-05-07 03:17:13,wallstreetbets,"Do. Whatever. Is. Best. For. Your. Portfolio. Or. Financial. Situation. 

I didn’t literally suggest to close a position if you’ve made a 5% gain. So calm down. But if you have, and want to close it. Do it. And don’t be a judgey ass hat if that is what other people want to do."
2021-05-07 07:38:00,wallstreetbets,"Right, and it's not a good example of ""less risky"" or a good ETF for beginners."
2021-05-07 10:53:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but a triple leveraged one? Not the best choice."
2021-05-07 13:57:10,wallstreetbets,fair enough. but I wanted to talk to fellow retards who cannot count to potato and not give any advice to the dead-serious fucks who live in r/stocks or r/investing. I tried cross-posting to both of them but was flagged for fuckery.
2021-05-07 03:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Precisely this.  Don’t feel bad.  Options is a game created for rich people to bait the inexperienced who don’t have the same bankroll.  When we short something, it’s chump change.  When the rich short something, it changes."
2021-05-07 12:12:37,wallstreetbets,I agree with not blindly going in. But please do research them. They are key to any serious trading strategy.
2021-05-07 03:21:54,wallstreetbets,"The point is this is not whats best for ANYONES portfolio. Here’s an extreme example: “Set your profits for 1% and your losses at -5%. Hey if it works for you!” No, no it’s not sound advice."
2021-05-07 03:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Look, could I have phrased my critique of your advice better? Yes. But at this point I’m tired of seeing bad advice masquerading as DD or “lessons learned” from people who don’t actually sit down and think thru the ramifications of the decisions they’re advocating for"
2021-05-07 15:09:32,wallstreetbets,"They aren't fellow retards, they are people who don't belong here, especially so if they didn't know what you posted"
2021-05-07 12:12:05,wallstreetbets,"Couldn’t disagree more. Options are key to being able to adapt to changing market conditions and even LIMIT risk. They shouldn’t be ignored. It’s pricey, but Options as a Strategic Investment by McMillan is a must read if you decide to expand your horizons. There’s tons of people just begging for you to take their money selling options. Cough, WSB, cough."
2021-05-07 03:34:21,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t advocate for taking a 5% gain. I did advocate for people doing what is best for them financially and based on what their goals are for their portfolio. I also did advocate setting sell limits of 20% profit and 16% loss. That’s not applicable for all stocks, or all people. But it is logically sound. That’s obviously not something I’d just mass endorse for everyone. but that by literal definition keeps you from losing your ass on a stock and and that you at least have the option of closing your position with a 20% gain or 16% loss. If you’re a day trader, maybe that doesn’t make sense. Again, it is based on your goals or standards people set for themselves."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,It’s not funny anymore. All these stocks and options are bought at margin so I am scared That I would be enlisted in WSB loser’s hall of shame. 😭 
2021-05-06 22:04:12,wallstreetbets,Margin is fun. Had a stock that I have $100k invested in go from a 35% to a 60% maintenance requirement overnight. Of course this happened on a day where I was down $40k in the first hour. Fortunately I just sold my boat and had the cash to cover otherwise it could have been ugly. Good news is I paid off all the margin in that account due to the volatility of that stock.
2021-05-06 23:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Bruh.... that's child's play loss.  That's a ""meh"" loss..... that's the kind of loss that one would trade for an extra hour of sleep."
2021-05-07 04:03:42,wallstreetbets,2000 bucks are a life crippling debt?
2021-05-06 21:57:43,wallstreetbets,Anyone banking on SPCE deserves to lose $200k.
2021-05-06 22:05:25,wallstreetbets,Margin is poorman’s options lol
2021-05-06 20:00:41,wallstreetbets,"That means you are going at it the wrong direction, you need a mentor, usually when people think long term is the only way thats when they are lost and give up."
2021-05-07 13:34:37,wallstreetbets,Hope it turns around for you. Best of luck.
2021-05-07 07:09:05,wallstreetbets,Well he has potentiall to lose 19k more
2021-05-06 20:45:39,wallstreetbets,Why do you say its fake
2021-05-06 22:08:21,wallstreetbets,I trade over six platforms so I have to use margin to increase my leverage without transferring funds between the platforms. One day I will merge them together but for now this is my chaos.

2021-05-06 21:59:24,wallstreetbets,"I've come to learn that no matter witch way the triangle goes ,it's just a triangle.
I've seen to many of these to give a fuck.
It's OK ape, alot of us on here are retarded so welcome to the retarded triangle."
2021-05-06 22:07:22,wallstreetbets,And the January squeeze was inorganically stopped so that apex seems like it should be at a higher trajectory.
2021-05-06 22:34:37,wallstreetbets,It's gonna go parabolic thoo just you watch 😁
2021-05-06 22:40:37,wallstreetbets,Where's the part where it says $10 million?
2021-05-06 22:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Hey, that’s a nice triangle"
2021-05-06 23:45:52,wallstreetbets,Illuminati confirmed?

Then I saw the second picture and said, “ahhh, I get it now...semi circle, rectangle, triangle...retracement...buy and hold, got it.”

You should have led with the second picture."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ocean Recedes Before a Tsunami. $RKT Tsunami is Coming. HOLD I see a lot of people posting on how $RKT performance was today and generally everything is was off today so stop whining. Yes $RKT had lower gain on sale margins and lower service fee income but lower expenses and taxes offset those lower than expected gains. Lets look at RKT guidance for 2Q21 which I am quoting from Goldman Sachs Equity Research Report dated May 6, 2021. RKT expects: 1) 82.5B -87.5B of closed loan volume which is +14%-21% YoY! 2)$81.5B – 88.5B of rate lock volume, 3) Non rate sensitive volume to reach 40% of volume in 2Q 4) gain on sale margin to be within 2.65%-2.96%. RKT management notes few other positives: 1) Volume outlook remains very bullish with guidance reflecting approved application waiting on home inventory to pick up meaning lots of people have approved application and looking for right home to buy. 2) RKT relationships with existing partners have been strengthening after UWMC’s ultimatum. 3) To become the largest retail purchase originator in next 24 months. RKT is being very consistent in focusing on the long term opportunity in the business and pivoting its focus to where the opportunities in the market are, such as purchase and cash out refi and its auto and rocket home platform. Given some of the macro headwinds, in the near term, headline metrics such as revenue and market shares could be challenging to grow from recent peaks, and we would expect the stock to be under some pressure as near term expectations rebase. That said, RKT continues to make investments in its platform and across the various parts of the home ecosystem. If longer term shareholders can get comfort that the investments it is making now will drive further market share gains over multiple cycle shares could see upside over the longer-term.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[$NOK]🚀🌕NOK CURRENTLY PRESENTS A MASSIV VALUE GAP🚀🌕  Coming off a great week, I wanted to dive into the numbers of the Q1 report from Nokia. I've still got work to do in going through it, but on the surface, you really couldn't have asked for a better quarter.

Revenue beat estimates comfortably and showed that the bleeding may have stopped on revenue loss permanently. That remains to be seen, but it is promising. The forward guidance from them also is incredible. The profitability was they eye popper for investors, and that was astounding, but I'm more reassured by the revenue number. Anyway, all that to say, even though the future is incredibly bright for Nokia, I think there is a significant value gap currently present with the stock.

Let's compare Nokia to Ericsson. Now, they aren't identical companies, but you really couldn't ask for a more similar company to compare Nokia to. They are both mature, massive, Scandinavian companies that used to make phones but have now pivoted to 5G/networking companies. Here are the numbers (these may have adjusted slightly as I calculated them towards the end of the day Friday):

Market Cap - NOK - $26.6B | ERIC - $46.4B

P/E Ratio - NOK - 13.76 | ERIC - 20

Revenue Last Quarter - NOK - €5.07B (3% increase YOY from previous Q1) | ERIC - €4.9B (0% increase YOY from previous Q1)

Revenue Last Year - NOK - €21.86B (6% decrease YOY from 2019 to 2020) | ERIC - €22.87B (2% increase YOY from 2019 to 2020)

Profit margin last quarter - NOK - 10.9% (Compared to 2.4% in Q1 2020. An increase of 850 basis points) | ERIC - 10.6% (Compared to 8.7% in Q1 2020. An increase of 190 basis points)

Profit margin last year - NOK - 9.7% (An increase of 110 basis points from 2019 to 2020) | ERIC - 12.0% (An increase of 740 basis points from 2019 to 2020)

I know these are just extremely high level number comparing the two companies, but they show that the market has placed significantly different valuations on relatively identical companies. I will yield that ERIC had a stellar 2020, while Nokia had a decent one mixed with a bit of difficulty (Small caveat - The technicalities of this are a bit over my head, but Nokia did take a nearly €3B hit with a self imposed tax write-off adjustment in 2020). However, the last two quarterly reports from Nokia have been absolutely incredible, and the previous quarter numbers show that Nokia has turned the quarter. If you look at just the previous quarterly numbers, you would guess that if any company has the $46.4B valuation it would be Nokia.

Here's the fun part. If you wanted Nokia and Ericsson to have identical market caps while keeping the price of Ericsson the same, Nokia stock would have to be worth \~$8.14.

Additionally, one of the only other decent comparators for Nokia is ZTE. Their numbers are a bit harder to come by since they are a Chinese company. However, their P/E ratio from several different sources aggregate out to around 20.5, presenting a massive value gap in the price of Nokia vs. ZTE.

In the coming weeks, I will dig deeper into Nokia's Q1 numbers and give you guys my findings. One thing that excites me is the forward guidance numbers that they have reaffirmed in these earnings. I did some quick mental math on projected EPS and revenue numbers and they are astounding.

Your comment about ERIC is a good point. However, that is why I added the valuation for ZTE at the end of the post. The whole 5G telco industry is around 20-21 on PE ratio valuation. After NOK’s last earning, their current PE is less than 15. Giving it plenty of room to run just to equal out to the industry. Just today, you had Morgan Stanley come out and move NOK to overweight and ERIC to hold and said they favor NOK over ERIC currently."

We're ""inexperienced investors"" and ""unqualified people on social media"". We need an ""intermediary or financial advisor"". The SEC is ""gonna vigorously lean in against individuals... ...to assess"". # US House Financial Services Committee hearing on GameStop

&#x200B;

This is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):

&#x200B;

>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  
>  
>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\[1\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \[2\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \[3\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don’t you start.  
>  
>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  
>  
>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  
>  
>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I’ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  
>  
>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  
>  
>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \[those\] relationships.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>My time is coming done. *How are you going to solve this? Do you feel that we can so we don't have any more of this Gamestop?*  
>  
>\[Chair Gensler was directed to respond in writing to that question because the time was up for Rep. Scott’s questions.\]

And all through the chats,

The 🌈🐻 were spamming,

Like spoiled little brats.

———

Wallstreetbets was strong,

And the bulls didn’t care,

Futes are green they said,

Bad time to be a bear.

——-

So we all went to bed,

Wife’s BF tucked us in,

We closed our eyes,

And the mind began to spin.

——

At first we saw stocks,

All red on the docket,

Then everything shifted,

Now we see rockets!

——

The dreaming continued,

Just until when,

My phone went off,

Frick, I slept in!

——

I boot up the broker,

To check my FDs,

When an unfamiliar sight,

Makes me freeze...

——

My phone is green,

Up 200 percent!

I’m no longer broke,

I can pay my rent!

——

I slowly smile,

It’s just my luck,

I mutter quietly,

Ber r fuk"

2021-05-06 23:43:13,wallstreetbets,"As the market starts to revalue itself going post COVID, a good thought excersise is

Is that growth/meme stock that's down 40% a value buy rn or is that just a greedy justification? Growth stocks rise parabolically in a bull environment but can also drop parabolically in a bear one. Just because a stock drops a large percentage doesn't mean that it will bounce back to what it was back then.

The market punishes those with a fixed mindset

One thing I like to do when repricing for the sake of simplicity is to revalue my expectations by a certain percentage.

If growth stocks hit $100 ATH in bull market, but the market doesn't reward growth stocks anymore due to macro factors, then I will take x percentage and multiple that by ATH to get a new readjusted ATH high.

Say the growth stock is rewarded 30% less in this new market, which means going forward, $100 * 70% = $70. I would treat this as the new relative ATH that the stock hit and that $100 price doesn't exist anymore. Erase that from your history 

Now adjust what the price is right now as a percentage of that new ATH and see if it's still worth investing or if theres still room to drop.


Current price of stock = $60.  
Old percentage lost = $100 -> $60 = -40% @ $100 ATH  
Readjust percentage lost = $70 - $60 = -14% @ $ 70 ATH*

From this, 14% drop seems like there is still room for it to drop for a market where SPY is at ATH. Risk to reward is not on your side.  

EDIT: grammar"

If I had done what I normally do it would have finally made thousands. Instead I lost thousands. So I’m eating myself up about it. 

Yet I see folks posting screenshots where they lost 90k of a 100k portfolio. Do these people just have a million dollars in cash or something? What am I missing?"

The only problem is I've been flagged as a pattern day trader on robinhood. So before close I took all my gains and purchased 100% RKT portfolio to get an average share of $20.   

Getting flagged as a PDT means.. I can't trade for 90 days? Might as well hold one thing at this point?

It's an agent-principal problem: the person making investment decisions has more to gain from outperforming the market on good years (because of FOMO on the part of people who pay institutional fund managers) than they have to lose when if they underperform in bad years (""well, it was a bad year, what are you gonna do?"").

I wonder how much this explains Cathie's strategy? As a Laffer acolyte, she's basically discovered public choice theory: apply rational choice theory to individual behavior within institutions, and you get fund managers who are incentivized to yolo everything into memes so they look like geniuses and get good press."

2021-05-07 03:51:35,wallstreetbets,"I reported to SEC on Shopify, Inc.:
Violation description:
Shopify Inc. recognizes revenue from Shopify payments as a principal. This revenue recognition method is not in accordance with US GAAP. Revenue from Shopify payments for 2020 year was 1.5 USD billion or 50% of total revenue.
Violation of US GAAP: Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, ASU 2016-08 principal versus agent guidance:
p. 606-10-55-37: An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer  
p. 606-10-55-39: Indicators (not quoted)
Evidence:
1) According to the contract between  Stripe, Inc. and Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., section 5:
sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000119312515129273/d863202dex1011.htm
i. Underwriting and Screening. Stripe shall underwrite and screen merchant applicants for Shopify Payments in accordance with Stripe’s applicable underwriting policies and procedures as approved by WFMS. Stripe shall also perform Know Your Customer (“KYC”), OFAC, AML, and related screening activities, including conducting initial and periodic reviews of the MasterCard MATCH list and any other any other terminated or prohibited merchant lists specified by Bank in determining whether a merchant applicant shall be permitted to enroll in Shopify Payments.
As it is seen in the contract the whole responsibility for processing payments belongs to Stripe, Inc.
2) According to the annual report 40-F:
sec.report/Document/0001594805-21-000008/
Shopify Inc. will all its subsidiaries has a balance of computer equipment with net book value of 9.3 USD million.
This equipment is insufficient to process 60 USD billion payments and 1.4 million merchants in one year.
Effect:
Revenue from Shopify Inc. is overstated by at least 30% due to violation of relevant accounting standards."

This is happening all while TDOC revenues have doubled and there is a huge surge of interest in tele medicine. Although the company saw slightly less user growth than same time last year they also have high growth guidance that they continue to maintain. While TDOC is crashing shit like Seaworld, which has bleeding millions of dollars and lost half of their customers in a year is at ATH with 500% rise in 1 year.

But then you complain “tHeRes to0 MucH moNeY in ThE sySTEm” when the government fairly compensates blue collar workers so they can find other opportunities. These shareholders want workers to bust their ass to make them money. 

So you know what: I don’t care if I don’t get my chicken or my favorite restaurant closes if it means the workers are actually get paid to live the way they want to.

2021-05-07 00:21:36,wallstreetbets,"AMC on 1/1/2020 (pre-covid): 

Enterprise value: $10.8 billion

Market cap: $700 million

Net debt: $10.1 billion

NTM EPS: -$0.57 per share

As of 5/6/2021:

Enterprise value: $15.6 billion (!!)

Market cap: $4.5 billion (!!)

Net debt: $11.1 billion

NTM EPS: -$3.42 per share 

AMC has more debt right now ($11.1bn) than the value of the entire business *pre-covid* ($10.8bn). So even if covid never happened, the stock would be worthless and even the debt wouldn’t recover everything. 

Somehow the business is worth 50% more now AFTER covid? even with forward EPS down 700%!?!? Even with more movies going direct to streaming and producers cutting the exclusive theatre window? bruh.

2021-05-06 20:11:55,wallstreetbets,"#DAILY SHORT VOLUME =/= AMOUNT OF SHARES SHORTED PER DAY

>A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm
may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to
another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the
outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling
it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this
trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between
the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a
single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of
the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5
If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position
in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and
included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with
the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the
firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication
that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale. 

tl:dr most of ""daily short volume"" comes from brokers executing sell orders immediately before they actually receive shares from their clients"

For all the people that are complaining about losing money in whatever... look at some videos or sites on how to calculate the intrinsic value of a company... as opposed to what it is selling for which is based on supply and demand. Look at company balance sheets to see if they are making profits. Earnings and revenue- google the difference and memorise it. Look at company financials—- cash flow is very important!! Ok so go learn that . For the rest of us... lets throw money at something new

 NEW YORK (dpa-AFX Analyser) - Die US-Investmentbank Morgan Stanley hat Nokia von ""Equal-weight"" auf ""Overweight"" hochgestuft und das Kursziel von 3,65 auf 5,00 Euro angehoben. Verbesserungen bei dem Telekomausrüster hätten sich schneller als von ihm erwartet eingestellt, schrieb Analyst Dominik Olszewski in einer am Freitag vorliegenden Studie.

Long NAST (norwegian air shuttle warrants) for 13 NOK (\~1.56 USD)

The warrants give you a right to buy NAS for 6 NOK (0.72 USD), so their total cost is 0.72+1.56 = \~2.28 USD, but the same underlier (NAS shares) trade for 4.32 USD

2021-05-07 03:59:46,wallstreetbets,"I think interest rates have played a big role here. Interest rates are expected to keep rising, slowly. Tech stocks are typically valuable because their biggest cash flows are speculative, way out in future, as opposed to a value stock that has regular and predictable cash flows. If interest rates rise, these future cash flows are discounted to smaller present value amounts. Remember money now is worth more than money later, if the interest rate is positive. So if the present values of tech stocks’ cash flows are going down, because there’s widespread sentiment that interest rates are going up, the stock prices will suffer. In other words, today’s value of what these companies will earn in future is shrinking as rates go up."

Jeff Bezos thinks the future is in little people fine dining. Shorter forks?  Jeff Bezos did the research: THIS is the proper length for a midget fork. Forks wrapped in the Iran flag: check out these whimsical, satirical forks from the Jeff Bezos collection. Celebrity can be a curse, I believe it. But you have to embrace it to enjoy it, like Musk."

2021-05-07 05:13:19,wallstreetbets,"It went up pretty quickly as soon as guidance wasn’t lowered. But the rest of that call wasn’t exactly good. I guess we will see. 

Apparently recalls do not count towards profitability, and removing them from future revenue only hurts real growth. Theoretical growth if they still sold the treads would be higher and therefore they command a higher multiple so they can keep losing money and using stock sales to fund the business. 

And apparently international growth is bonkers, even though there is no mention of it in the quarterly press release. And I guess also an uptick in monthly churn rate and the end of a pandemic are also bullish. But look, it would be unwise to make comparisons to quarters that occurred during covid. You have to make comparisons to two years ago. If you do that then growth looks a lot bigger. So keep that in mind. It’s all about a percentage uppies here. And also, projections further out than June are just unfair. Unfair! As a management team they are very optimistic, and since they are optimistic, so am I. 

Foley needs the stock to go up to fund the opening of more retail stores to help sell the one product the company has which everybody buys online. And as the stock goes up more, he needs to be able to issue more shares to himself so he can sell them. Selling 300,000 shares for 50 million in a 3 month period just isn’t enough. 

Ja, I think it’s going down. But I’m also a dummy"

The analogy here would be options are like the great gf you love and put a ring on, and then you get home and she getting wrecked by 3 dudes. It can flip the script on you real fast."

Valuations. P/e are absurdly high and have only held hp being this high because where else can money go with rates near 0. The moment rates go up (which not only will they, but also sooner than forecasted) to prevent inflation, the market implodes, specifically tech.

It's not like in the past where people think maybe there will be a crash but who knows it could be a decade out. This will be a known crash event in the next 1-3 years and it's basically the fed playing musical chairs."

They have a buy rating at $21.

I think they fell the last few days because of market noise (like almost everything went down these last couple of days)

The US has gotten away with terrible atrocities in its past (and present) without so much as a blink from the UN, and why is that? It’s because The US holds so much power that it simply can’t be threatened by the UN, and I believe (unfortunately) that China is beginning to receive the same treatment...... so might as well make money off it right!"

2021-05-07 06:25:39,wallstreetbets,Scene from empire strikes back plays out...
2021-05-07 06:52:43,wallstreetbets,"401k protection. So I know we are expecting a market crash related and unrelated to GME. Normally to go safe, you would go for bonds. However, we know bonds are in a real scary situation right now. To protect our 401ks, not counting withdrawing, how should we move our money? With 401k you typically have a list that represent different types of funds to choose from. What's the safe play here, real estate reit funds, foreign funds? I'm imagining US stocks will be hit hard.

 I know there is always the guaranteed interest accounts GIA/GIC but those are bonds.  Also when you read the details,  it's not guaranteed if a party goes under like Lehman did.

Its been brought up to me that I can rollover my 401k from the company my job uses to another broker and treat it as a brokerage scoutnet l account. This way I don't have to choose from a list of mutual funds.  Can anyone do this? My job should be fine with it? Will I still get my company match?"
2021-05-07 07:55:44,wallstreetbets,Congrats to becoming a Multimillionaire!

There are lots of other places online to build a computer, pcs have become big already even for younger/teenage kids. How will they keep enough parts in stock at the store, what if they don't have the part I'm looking for? Would I have to have them order it for me and wait? I think it will definitely take a lot of effort to really become known for computer building/components. I imagine a lot of store overhaul that would take considerable time. 

Im excited to see how gamestop moves forward, but its going to be very tough for them competing with steam and any website where you can put together a computer with a list of any parts ya need."

With the e-commerce experience from Chewy and Amazon execs, I see the ability to transform the business quickly.  Within the next year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strategic partnership or acquisition be announced."

2021-05-06 22:32:34,wallstreetbets,Ouch. I used to live there and understand. $1250 for a 400 sq ft studio in the Tendernob. I’m sure it’s way more expensive now...

2021-05-07 09:30:37,wallstreetbets,I understand. Im a mechanic and make 100k a year after going to tech school which costs 5k. Poverty is real though and education (or lack of) is a barrier to the poor.

I honestly never took out of AMC, I added more, I lowered my average. I bought it at $16, I held it at $22. I got whiplash but it was all profit still. Now I am as close to averaging out as I can be. I don't have the $5 dollar average or even $6 it's  $9.   


I still believe I'm on the correct route or at least trailing another vehicle, maybe they get pulled over as I speed by.  I never sold any $GME either. Those pot stocks however burned."

2021-05-06 23:01:43,wallstreetbets,Fuckin a
2021-05-07 07:02:48,wallstreetbets,Didn't they also just vote not to further dilute with like half a billion shares?

I know people whose whole day would be better spent doing something like this."

2021-05-06 20:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Some people still ask how GME can be worth more than AAPL. 

I think “this one is more expensive than that one” is how quite a few people evaluate stocks."
2021-05-07 08:22:57,wallstreetbets,Learned about  that after I bought in... my learning curve is most often the bend over kind
2021-05-06 23:43:24,wallstreetbets,Your not a 🦍 why are you here. Is this Jim Cramer If you want to learn what this is all about you should watch trey’s traded on YouTube. Botton line there are more shares held by 🦍 than there should be and we are just waiting for the count
2021-05-07 02:52:03,wallstreetbets,"Serious answer...can you calculate the difference between float and share owned by 🦍?

There you go. We own more shares in the books than all shares AMC ever put out. We ourselves own some synthetic shares. But we want our shares. We want the real shares and no other 🦍 is willing to sell it."
2021-05-06 22:36:50,wallstreetbets,"I get why people were interested in AMC when it was heavily shorted and at $2, but why the hell would anyone be interested in it now? It collapsed over 50% in the year pre-COVID and was trading at around $7 pre-pandemic. COVID changed the streaming landscape and movie theaters will probably never recapture even where they were 5 years ago. What's the upside here?"
2021-05-07 05:25:01,wallstreetbets,"I tried chatting with a semi successful boomer at my company who probably makes a little more than me.

He told me he doesn't buy $50 stocks, he buys 2 dollar stocks and hopes they get to 50.

He's all over nok and AMC.

I was in the ""school is useless"" camp, until I saw how dumb everyone is IRL."
2021-05-06 20:02:47,wallstreetbets,"Well, technically you could"
2021-05-06 23:19:19,wallstreetbets,Do you live near MOPAC?
2021-05-07 00:43:32,wallstreetbets,$26 here lol. To date it's one of my biggest FOMO mistakes. I am still holding it while fully recognizing it will probably take a while to break even with CC
2021-05-07 05:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Oh BB, over 50% down on you..."
2021-05-07 16:54:53,wallstreetbets,Big fucking oof

2021-05-07 12:35:24,wallstreetbets,Then you buy the dip
2021-05-07 10:07:07,wallstreetbets,My account honestly started making money when I stopped trying to do my own research and started blindly jumping on stocks mentioned in this sub

I only discovered what they were and the fact that they expire weeks after playing with options

If the price is $100 and you think it's going to go down soon, then you could buy a $90 (stock price) put.  If the price drops to $80, then you can force the put seller to buy 100 shares @ $90, and you pocket the $10 difference."

2021-05-06 20:11:34,wallstreetbets,"GME and AMC shot up at the same time for the same reasons. Momentum is where GME took over and stayed. Unless game stop radically changes its business plan, it is more fked than AMC long term. I'd rather be $10 dollars in AMC, than $150 in GME."
2021-05-06 20:14:28,wallstreetbets,Don't you know that a bunch of smooth-brained retards can change the world? Just look at the last 4 years!

2021-05-07 07:50:21,wallstreetbets,Ahahaaa!
2021-05-06 20:16:11,wallstreetbets,AMC killed the momentum with all the share offerings. It also never had nearly as much short interest. And what you just said about GME vs AMC is backward. GameStop is actually making changes and pivoting to e-commerce. AMC was failing long before covid and they have not changed their business model at all. They diluted their way out of it for now but I’m 99.9% sure they will go bankrupt before the end of this decade. I wouldn’t touch either at these prices cuz I’m not a retard but if I was forced to do one or the other GME is clearly the better bet.
2021-05-07 18:16:27,wallstreetbets,Fortunately those are not your only two choices.

So far, I haven't heard jack about anything being done differently. In comparison, you might take a date to Gamestop, but there will always be a place in this society for a theater."
2021-05-06 20:34:57,wallstreetbets,I guess this generation is taking their dates to gamestop. Alrighty then.
2021-05-06 22:14:49,wallstreetbets,"I’ll bite, what’s $ASO?"
2021-05-06 20:34:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there will always be a place in society for a theatre. But that's not what we are trading stock on. I was in AMC stock myself back when it was under $6 and before they diluted their stock. Back then it was so low because people thought it was going out of business. I placed a bet that they wouldn't be going out of business and the short spike happened and I sold my AMC shares at $22.

If you buy AMC today that means you are saying not only do you believe they are as valuable as they were before the pandemic but even more so. And on top of that you believe the price is going up as well. Theaters may be around forever but that does not mean the company has anywhere to grow. They have already reached complete market saturation.

I am not saying Gamestop is a good buy right now but they are legitimately trying to make a major shift in their business model in the long term. There is a ton of DD about this on the sub. They have changed leadership and announced their plans. AMC however was at market saturation years ago and has been in decline since. I'm not saying they are going out of business but their stock is a horrible value right now."
2021-05-06 22:32:25,wallstreetbets,Nah some people still go to the movies but not enough to keep this company in business. They’ve been losing money for years even before the pandemic and now with all the huge variety of streaming platforms available there’s just no chance they will do enough business to turn things around.

2021-05-06 23:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Your wrong, and you don't understand. AMC theaters, is part of AMC entertainment, and/or AMCi. They own the film rights to a lot of movies, and film and produce movies. I work for them every now and then. They, have partnered up with some big names in streaming services. It isn't all about theaters, but theaters, are a part of western cultrure, and is here to stay, regardless. You obviously have not looked at the news out today about them, or are just willingly ignorant. Either way, you may convince some people that you are right, but you aren't convincing me.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why GDRX could be ready to 🚀 GoodRx is a mobile app that helps users save money on their prescriptions, and also provides telehealth services. I have personally used the service myself and have actually saved well over $100 a month with it. They have revenue growth of well over 30% and a runway to continue accelerating growth for the foreseeable future. Most people know that as vaccines rollout and the economy starts to open there is a lot of pent up demand for travel and the like but what many people don't understand is there is actually a significant backlog of undiagnosed conditions and treatments that have been put off because many people don't want to go in and see their doctor. Not to mention the fact that because so many people lost their jobs due to the pandemic many people no longer have health care plans through their employer further showing the benefit of GoodRx to help people pay for their medications that they may no longer be able to afford because they lost their employee health plans. To top it all off GoodRx has earnings next week and just over 20% short interest that could further catalyze a move higher. 

TLDR: GDRX has a great business model and a fairly high short interest with earnings next week as the catalyst to start a move higher.

Positions: long shares and looking to enter an options position as well."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KNSA Mega Dip DD Alright retardos and retardettes, this is probably going to get ignored and/or downvoted into the oblivion on the count of being a potentially good idea, but I'll try to share my flawed wisdom anyways. 

The stock has been way oversold over the last 2 months for no good reason (Other than missing the EPS by $0.08 2 days ago, but more on that later). I'm too dumb to be a financial analyst, but here's where I'm at: 

**1) Product:** They have recently got an approval for some heart condition drug that's the only one on the market approved for the treatment of the said condition. They have another drug for treatment of severe covid patients that's half-way through the trials. They just announced another successful trial for yet another drug for rheumatoid arthritis. 

**2) Cash Flow:** This is a pharma company, not a damn Wendy's drive-trough. It takes a lot of $ to fund research, run trials, etc. Once they get FDA approvals, it takes a few months for end-users/clinics to place orders for the drugs. The fact that it's being dumped on today's earnings is largely irrelevant to me. I think 3-6 months and this thing will go 🚀.

**3) Analysis:** Analyst ratings are hugely positive, at least according to Webull's data. Price targets averages are double of what it's sitting at right now. Short interest is relatively low, probably because you have to be a madman to short something with this much potential upside.

**4) Other Thoughts:** They have been posting a crapload of new positions on their careers page, which tells me they are growing, and not struggling in any way. 

\---

**TLDR:** I don't normally pay attention to this segment, but this stock has caught my eye a few months ago. It's a huge company that no one knows about that actually produces some valuable medications and has more in the pipeline. The stock is hugely oversold IMO. 

\---

**Position Disclosure:** \~700 shares at $17, slowly adding more as it dips and as I sell other stuff.

Not financial advice. I'm an ape and bought GME at $400 at one point."
2021-05-07 07:57:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck it.  I've got $5000 to burn.  I'm afraid options are not a thing for me.  But I'll buy some shares and wait for the average to come up.
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I never believed in manipulation until I saw Corsair stock (CRSR) Corsair. Man how is this thing still valued so low? For real? Let me just write some things down. 

Corsair recently had their quarterly results. 255 million dollars of profit expected for this year (Which is up significantly compared to 'gaming year' 2020). Revenue this year is expected to far exceed 2020 as well. 

2020 is seen as 'the gaming year', according to Wallstreet. When 2021 is here, vaccins are live, no one will ever game again. Stupid Wallstreet. 

Corsair currently trades at a forward p/e of 12. What the F. Dillards $DDS trades at a forward p/e of 39. What the F is going on? 

Let's talk shorting. According to Yahoo Finance (as of 14th april) the short % of float is 20 percent. I saw another comment implying that today another 280K shares were shorted at opening, with only 90K shares left to borrow. 

This is GROSSLY undervalued for real if you look at the insane growth in revenue, profit, products, (shares shorted fk u wallstreet). They also have amazing brands such as Elgato, SCUF gaming, Origin PC and some more. 

This is just my summary DD, I am willing to post more about it, but I had a long long day at work, so I am logging off. 
Just had to get mad somewhere that this is allowed.

Please comment if you have any implications or any remarks, I would for real love to know that!

Apes together strong 🥰"

The stock market cares about what you're going to earn *in the next 3 months.* If the market concludes you won't do as well, your stock price will fall.

If you guide lower on sales, or profitability, or subscriptions, for example, your stock will be hammered no matter what you did in the last quarter.

In the case of Corsair, financials showed rising inventories and accounts receivable, very high ""intangible"" assets, not-rising stockholder equity, etc. etc. Company isn't performing."

2021-05-06 21:14:11,wallstreetbets,"... That's speculation. You're speculating that the company keeps growing. And most of these 'growth' companies are reinvesting everything into growth, so who's to say it wouldn't take 39 years? It seems like the hip thing to do is to actually NEVER pay a dividend so you would actually never get back your money. Instead you have to rely on perpetual stock price inflation. Which is stupid, because the only reason stocks should have value is that you at some point get paid back through dividends."

2021-05-07 01:42:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you on a lot of companies, but for smaller to mid size companies that are reinvesting their earnings back into the business, which generates a much higher return for shareholders than just paying dividends, those are the ones to own, at the right price. Eventually, when the company gets larger, they could distribute those earnings. Ofcourse it’s speculation, but that’s why there is risk / reward. You can keep your money in cash if you want, but don’t get mad when the market on average makes 7-10% annually and you made nothing"

2021-05-06 23:02:22,wallstreetbets,"7 layer dip is one of the best party appetizers ever. Layers of fresh salsa, refried beans, guacamole, cheddar cheese, and our favorite toppings create a colorful addition to any appie spread.

We love entertaining and always serve our favorite snacks like jalapeno popper dip and pigs in a blanket. I serve this 7 layer bean dip recipe with some tortilla chips and veggies (which can also go alongside other dips like spinach dip for a great party spread).

7 Layer Dip in a casserole dish with a scoop taken out

7 Layer Dip is an easy dip that everyone loves! Layers of creamy and fresh ingredients are spread into a 9×13 pan and chilled. Crisp tortilla chips are the perfect dipper for this recipe!

7 Layer Dip
×
What’s In 7 Layer Dip?
This dip has (obviously) 7 layers to it, and creating the layers is quick and easy. The layers in 7 Layer Dip are:

Refried beans
Sour cream (mixed with cream cheese and taco seasoning)
Guacamole
Salsa (drained)
Cheese
Green onions
Olives or tomatoes

You can easily swap these out for your own favorite toppings. If you’d like to add ground beef, cook the beef until no pink remains. Add taco seasoning for flavor and cool. Add it between the beans and sour cream mixture.

Jalapenos and cilantro are also great toppers for this Mexican 7 layer dip. Get creative!

consistency so your chips don’t break as you scoop it!
Just like in Jalapeno Popper Dip, mix the cream cheese with a hand mixer too so it’s easy to scoop.
Layer the guacamole in the middle so it doesn’t discolor.
Top with shredded cheese, green onions, and olives or tomatoes. I also love adding diced jalapenos if there are spicy fans out there!
Before serving, chill the 7 layer dip for about an hour, this brings the flavors together!"

I personally won’t sell because of the 7 approved databases the military uses, only Pltr will offer real time cross analysis. This means a) captain USAF, in Florida, watching Centcom inputs request from 4 star and by the time response is received, anyone using Pltr knows that 4 star has asked for the information. Requests from key nodes become targets. Therefore Pltr must either bias results or not publish results. This type of AI is so controversial that I recommended to P4 in 09 we abandon the system altogether. Of course General Petreus had a more prescient war.

2021-05-07 07:18:22,wallstreetbets,Doubtful seeing that the growth stocks and space are down continuously for weeks now.

2021-05-06 20:33:48,wallstreetbets,One of my absolute favorites
2021-05-06 21:32:33,wallstreetbets,"Yo I started watching it again a few months back and for like an entire season every other episode was about short selling and market manipulation, I think the writers were a bit salty after the 2008 debacle.

Edit: but yeah one of the best show of all time for sure. One of the few all time greats that also managed to actually do a good job with the ending."
2021-05-06 21:32:04,wallstreetbets,same
2021-05-06 23:34:38,wallstreetbets,"The first bit was pretty cheese (the entertaining kind at least) and I thought I was gonna be really disappointed, because it’s such a cool concept and it seemed like they kind of botched it, but I’m glad I kept watching because they really ended up doing it justice. Also one of my all time faves."

2021-05-06 21:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Bought August of last year at like .24 sold most 
in Feb near peak, maybe the first time I have done it right. Still holding some of the OG stash and have bought some more around .79 recently, give it a year. Are we allowed to talk about pennies up in here now or something?"
2021-05-07 08:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Aphria.. which got bought and tuned into Tilray stocks. Also Sundial. 

Don’t get me wrong I believe in them. I think Sundial will be a low-end weed stock if legalization ever happens or they’ll be opened up to be bought out by a larger company. It just sucks seeing my losses right now."
2021-05-07 16:20:44,wallstreetbets,Like what Boomer stocks? I got about 30% in Biontech and its doing really well. But all technology are down and have been considered to be a speculated market this year.
2021-05-06 21:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Good point. Ape yes, full retard time no sir"
2021-05-06 23:01:05,wallstreetbets,"I have some of the stocks that have been performing... CAT, V, DIS, ULTA, AXP, SJM... others too. It’s just more fun with the other companies. And I’m not sure I maybe wrong, but  hopefully some of the smaller caps I mentioned above will get back to new ATHs. I mean I still think they are good companies and my investment strategy/goals allow for me to hold and continue to add to positions I have faith in. FUBO, SKLZ, PLUG, PLTR... all have potential to be around or above $50 and I don’t want to get bashed for saying $100 but I’m talking 2-4 years. Morgan Stanley had a $40 target on FSR lol, GEVO I’ve seen $18-20 from analysts, Cathie Wood loaded millions of WKHS at like $16+. I maybe a fool but I believe in these companies and others... LMND, NTDOY, ABNB there are so many more, I probably have more than 40 companies, but still if I can get up to 25-50-100 shares in all these companies just 10% gains will be huge for account growth and if some of them 2x, 3x, 4x which I do believe is a possibility looking 1-2-3 years down the road... I’ll be on my way to accounts totaling well over 6figures. Plus I keep all my day trading/options separate from share positions. I have been seriously investing about 7months now and don’t want to sound naive but truly see it as a path to financial freedom/early retirement/and general flexibility as it continues to open doors. I welcome comments and discussion. But I’m not lying I think everything I buy is a great decision or else I wouldn’t buy it... and obviously I have my losses. Happy investing to everyone seeing this. Invest early and often has got to be some of the best concise advice I can throw out there. Just do it!"
2021-05-06 20:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly, I had $12k in cash saved up ready to pay off the loans but since payments have been paused for the last year, I decided to use the money to invest"

2021-05-07 02:38:18,wallstreetbets,"   Pretty sure homeless in Vegas is not the most unlikely thing for someone who likes gambling. There's many a tale of people losing their houses in Vegas, and I'm fairly certain at least one of them is rooted in truth."
2021-05-07 03:32:50,wallstreetbets,"guess you havent met the local squeegee guy. 

they have square. and venmo just in case."
2021-05-07 07:08:50,wallstreetbets,That was pretty dense of you.
2021-05-07 00:48:04,wallstreetbets,I agree. I bought awhile back with plans to hold it long term. Honestly I don't even pay attention to it that much.
2021-05-07 13:28:39,wallstreetbets,What is pltr? And where do i buy some
2021-05-07 13:28:45,wallstreetbets,Gnerally I do a lot of swing trading but I have pretty big positions in PLTR and CHPT and plan to hold for years. It reminds me of Shopify; I bought SHOP at $90 and I am still holding. It has turned into a retirement fund at this point.
2021-05-06 22:54:26,wallstreetbets,😂🤣😂Nearly wet me pants

2021-05-06 20:30:04,wallstreetbets,The term “shines” were used as a term for African American people. As well as “boy” was too. People get all sensitive about me making a comment saying it’s racial when it’s possible true. Mostly African American had jobs shining shoes back then. So for John F Kennedy to make that comment he might of been racist for it. Which I don’t doubt that. That era was very prevalent to racism
2021-05-06 20:31:24,wallstreetbets,"The hell
Are people being offensive for? As if they knew John F Kennedy or something"
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Any major catalyst here? I thought this would have a lot of extrinsic value with theta decay. Guess this one is an L unless this shit skyrockets over the summer. 
2021-05-07 00:57:02,wallstreetbets,now this is retarded
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tech sellers are the true clowns. Your tears in Fall will be delicious. You bought stocks at overinflated prices months ago and are slowly selling them off for fat losses because you're impatient babies.

You're rotating to trendy pop news stocks that are by default going to have dissapointing earnings calls because the Dow is basically at peak.

You completely ignore chart graph positions and solely invest by what news you hear.

You dont even know what RSI is.

TLDR; tech sellers bought high and sold low. lmao"
2021-05-06 20:52:26,wallstreetbets,"When it comes to tech, I personally think this is the last YEAR to get in cheap. I have a 6+ year time horizon my portfolio and looking at the pace tech is moving, this fall to mid next year is when I expect all tech to MOON. Then everyone will say ""I wish I bought the dip"""

2021-05-06 20:52:15,wallstreetbets,"Wow. The owner/operator of that boat would die if my wife and girls were in that thing. 

I hope they’re all ok. That’s as real as it gets right there."
2021-05-06 20:46:03,wallstreetbets,Ok that's one  way to wake me up about a stock
2021-05-06 20:01:39,wallstreetbets,Are they alive after that? Holy crap
2021-05-06 20:02:40,wallstreetbets,Happened to me with a German corporation called 1&1 drillisch when I bought it after the first dip in august. Had a fun surprise in September...
2021-05-06 20:10:29,wallstreetbets,I'd be fucking scared. That shit is like $140 scared lvl.

2021-05-06 21:37:38,wallstreetbets,"Ha, this is how I feel with RIDE... I thought $10 was a bargain and bought a couple hundred shares. I bought more when it dipped a little lower and my cost basis is under $10 now. However, it still keeps going down pretty much every day and now I am down over $700 on just that one stock. LOL"
2021-05-06 21:41:26,wallstreetbets,That’s my NIO stock right there!

2021-05-06 22:04:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, all of them survived. The reason that this is on the internet is because one of them posted it to their tick tok."

2021-05-07 09:36:49,wallstreetbets,must've been a Challenger
2021-05-06 20:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Depends.

The *first* thing you’re supposed to due is roll the windows down if the car hits the water *then* unbuckle. The weight of the water outside makes opening the car doors virtually impossible if there is air still inside the car as it’s going under"
2021-05-06 22:43:12,wallstreetbets,"I go ice fishing quite a bit and one of the first things you learn going out onto the ice with your car or truck is (1) take your seatbelt off, (2) roll down the windows, and (3) unlock/crack the door *just in case*."

I grab on to some dead fuck as I'm falling and wake up when I hit the ground. When the time came to volunteer I did not goto airborne school. 15 years ago that happened and I still remember that stupid dream.

2021-05-06 23:10:22,wallstreetbets,Few other things can work (like pocket knives) but the important part is keeping it in a place where it wont fly away as you hit the water/hit whatever -> then the water.
2021-05-07 04:38:04,wallstreetbets,Did you know the metal from the head rest is designed for that too?
2021-05-07 01:27:47,wallstreetbets,Bruh you know you’re supposed to use your headrest right? Like the metal poles on the end to smash the window

2021-05-07 04:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Because you fall through them and then you’re suddenly very deep below surface. And if they are the result of an underwater explosion, they are probably also likely to roast/steam you pretty bad."

Aerated water is significantly less buoyant than normal water, so you sink. What are you sinking into? Water. Can you breathe water? No."
2021-05-07 06:20:12,wallstreetbets,Can’t swim to the surface if you’re falling through a bunch of rising air bubbles
2021-05-07 05:23:29,wallstreetbets,Because you are still underwater and can‘t breath??
2021-05-07 04:50:03,wallstreetbets,You fall into them and then once the air is gone the “hole” fills with water and you are 10m below the surface.

2021-05-06 23:08:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well I don't think any of those places would hire me lol. I did make a lot flipping Twitter when it was trading around $15-$25. I guess if you're gonna do something, just make sure you know your stuff.

Take a minute to learn and make calculated decisions so that you can have financial freedom not dependency. Good luck to everyone!"

Another Great Depression cannot happen under these circumstances. It would lead to a coup. Simple as that, The federal government would be guillotined. And they definitely know this.

Also, there’s a real chance the bond crisis won’t be as bad as it could be, simple reason, the entire world is rooting for us and has a stake in us winning. Japan buys our craps bonds bc it knows. Taiwan and most of the pacific and even Europe would not let us fall flat like that, but we do have to get our act together. That’s what this really is. We are ramping up and actually starting to seriously economic war with China.

Simply put there’s a greater chance we move towards a controlled economy and communism than there is for a Great Depression. Just my opinion tho."

2021-05-06 20:32:13,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity, vanguard, or schwab"
2021-05-06 22:00:03,wallstreetbets,Fidelity. Moved from Robinhood and it was seemless
2021-05-06 21:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Partial transfer of only GME shares to Fidelity. Took just over 24 hours (for me) for transfer to complete on Fidelity's side to see the shares in your account. 2-3 more days for the shares to change from margin to cash. This happened automatically for me, but I've read that it didn't happen for some apes so it's worth a call to check. If you are opening a new Fidelity account, do not apply for margin. There will be a $75 charge (debit) for the transfer. You don't have to pay this immediately, but I think after a month it starts accruing interest.  

Good luck... it's STILL not too late, but time is running out.

Not financial advice."

Just because they modified some of their requirements doesn’t mean they got rid of them altogether, which is also what they say if you bothered to read the full statement. Robinhood and other brokerages met those requirements, that was never in question. What Robinhood and other brokerages said was that they needed to stop more buy orders in order to  be prevent being in breach of these requirements. Doing so would be illegal. If they didn’t put those practices in place, even with the modified DTCC requirements they would have easily overextend their liquidity. That’s why they needed to raise $3 billion before they could relax these restrictions."

Are we not strong? Are we not stronger together? Are we not the reckoning of abuses in an  one sided market? Did we not bring Citadel to an apology? Should we not continue to strike fear in the hearts of hedge funds, shorts, abusers? Or should we let our foot off their necks?

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH. A short-term, short interest play. I've talked about $WISH, wish.com 's parent company contextlogic before. Aka its the market place where your wife's boyfriend has to buy her jewelry because you are losing money on RKT and GME. I was researching about the sure fire way I'd devised months earlier to lose money that I'd called ""WISH calls"", which I wish I didn't have. I stumbled upon a couple o three interesting things:

1st Contextlogic's 500m shares outstaning number vs. it's current 60m float

Now I have no idea hoy many shares are gonna be sold at lock up expiry, but the fact that **only 10% of the shares are the float is, at the very least, extremely worrying.**

2nd is that **at the current float** the **short interest currently sits at around 40%.** But this number is decieving, since if you considered all shares as float, short interest would be 5%, which you shouldn't, because.... 

3rd **lock up expiry is 06/14/2021**

Now, there's 2 scenarios, in my opinion of what will happen:

1st (the one I'm sadly invested in). Wish reports on may 12th a blowout quarter. With some traction, this will propel WISH to ATH's, thanks to the combination really high short interest, small float (around 10% of float trades every day). Imo I believe they will smash this quarter.

&#x200B;

2nd (not financial advice) Wish stock behaves like your wife, (either passive agresively or going down on her bf whenever) until lock up expiration. On that day it craters to mid single digits. at that point I'm simply going all in calls on WISH.

Now I think that this stock has potential. it's an American international e commerce platform trading super cheap for crying out loud. The apes at loop capital have a $40 price target on it. $22 on evercore. This is a good play.

2021-05-07 02:03:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah but all things considered this one seems pretty safe for the time being.  Ishbia was really big on paying the dividend and they have plenty of cash and cash flow.  Not seeing any red flags on that front right now

2021-05-06 21:31:30,wallstreetbets,">At best they’re clueless, in reality they know exactly what they’re doing and they’re complicit in screwing us all. They serve themselves, their lobbyists, and their campaigns. 

In order to get elected, you need money. Ergo, you serve those who give you money. 

There really isn't much more to it than that. It's a systemic failure. 

If you get rid of campaign fundraising, you are now at the mercy of the established political party (and the wealth behind them). 

So either way there is no justice in the system."
2021-05-07 02:02:10,wallstreetbets,The marketplace and fee structure will be much different a year from now. Luckily tech will push it into the hands of the retail trader faster than government can regulate around it. Just gotta be quick.

2021-05-07 16:51:00,wallstreetbets,The establishment would never allow lowering settlement time.  It would defeat the whole purpose of their PDT law.

2021-05-06 21:46:55,wallstreetbets,"I think HE thinks it’s going to be big like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc.

No one cares if you sell any of them.  I think his position is a 3-10 year hold.

I think when you post/tweet something about a stock that pushes it in the direction your portfolio desires, and there is obvious movement in that stock, it can be construed as manipulation.  That is why I would stay silent, as soon as my words start to have a noticeable effect on the price.

What I don’t get is how these news sources and stock picker people, aren’t seen as manipulators.  It blows my mind.  I guess it’s all part of the game now so whatever.  

If I went from a few hundred thousand to 26M in a year, I would probably be pretty apprehensive as well.  I would want you all to know that I’m pulling for you, but I’m not going to risk being a manipulator in any sense.  That said, I think what he has said and posted so far is consistent, harmless, and I honestly believe he is not trying to get anyone on his bandwagon.

It's quite fascinating, really! At some point I've learned which lines I don't need to draw, because they're extremely unlikely. I'm now* at a point where I draw less than a dozen lines and the price keeps chugging along in that range for a while.

Any good news causes the stock to take a massive shit. 

Yes, you heard it here. Any news that would otherwise cause a stocks value to rise actually makes it take a huge dump. 

Tilray: acquired Aphira, prospects to be the worlds number one weed supplier look great. Stock drops 4 bucks and stays there.

MVIS: currently the only company with a working (and best in industry) Lidar and has prosect to either get massive contracts or even be bought out by Microsoft. Plummets like 15 fuckin bucks and hasn't gone anywhere since. 

GME: Hired top E-Commerce figures and booted their old dusty ass Board. Poised to be an industry leader in online sales and paid off their debt. Shit dropped from like 250-275 to 150-180 and has struggled to get anywhere since. 

But what's that you say? Bad news should make the stock rise then?

Fuck you for even thinking it.

Tonix pharma: rejected trials, failed formulas. Shit was once 4 grand a piece and now it's struggling to hit 1.20.

Apple and others suffering from Chip shortages, fell from 140s to 111. 

So whatever you're invested in, if you are expecting to hear ANY news about it coming up, wether earnings, announcements on product trials or if the CEO was caught at the boarder with drugs, prepare for a kick in the balls.

Exception: Alibaba ... Massive law suit, CEO disappears for weeks, suspected killed by China's Gov for calling them out, shit skyrockets ... 

None of this is advice for anything, least of all investment or financial."

MVIS: got high on FSD pipe dreaks and unicorns. Barely enough revenue to qualify as an OTC penny stock. $0.25  PT

TLRY: decent company and prolly the bedt Canadian weed play. But the acquiring company always has it's price go down. Buy it if you're bullish."

This is because failure of John Chen (CEO) to produce any revenue. We had many news PR for last 7 years but they all failed to produce any growth in revenue.

As long as interest rates are low as fuck who cares but at some point I imagine the debts will be refinanced and that may bite the government in the ass. So I’m wondering if there’s some resources on seeing like what percent of and when government debt is refinanced to see if trying to make some plays on times of major refinancing could be possible.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIAC massively undervalued right now and has had an amazing earnings report VIAC (ViacomCBS) is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping."

2021-05-07 00:00:47,wallstreetbets,"I agree that is undervalued

However, it seems the market won't value this company more than it is.

Look at their [2018-Q4 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/d50946cf-2bb8-441f-a8ad-a8e118ff44cf): Revenues: 7B, EPS: 1.43. Share price back then: $43.72

Look at their [2021-Q1 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/78a9d2e0-5f09-4f6f-b890-45b139769eff): Revenues: 7.4B, EPS: 1.42. Share price now: $38.15

So they had the same results in 2018 than on 2021 (after a whole pandemic where it should have boomed) and the share price is just $5 dollars of difference.

The market is showing the same love for this company now than in 2018: not much.

Why is this company more worth now than in 2018? The competition from Netflix and other online platforms can't be ignored.

Look at the PEG ratio fo this company.. is negative. This means the earnings of this company are not growing but shrinking (EPS growth is negative) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC/key-statistics?p=VIAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC/key-statistics?p=VIAC)"

2021-05-07 00:07:53,wallstreetbets,"Not really. There are lot of stocks undervalued. Check for example [$PFSI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFSI/financials?p=PFSI) (just found it with a stock screener looking for low p/e stocks).

* revenue = 4B

I’m guessing the latter since they’ll probably want to make an example of the types of “bad actors taking advantage of influential platforms” as the great Gary Gensler once said….

This is because they are based on a 32-bit architecture and therefore 4,294,967,295 is the highest number that can be stored. Stock prices are displayed to four decimal places in the USA. Nasdaq plans to complete an update by the middle of the month to fix the problem.

2021-05-07 06:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes however, quantum computing & quantum (QFS) are capable of trillions of frames per second- they are already being used and or tested; it’s on deck- 

The Kraken— is q c s -The Spaceforce uses q c s  and I’m sure many others that I don’t know anything about.

I am just wondering what the ’official’ catalyst to roll this out will be because nothing, I mean nothing, will be able to get thru this system- no more laundering, secret shell accounts or dirty money. Every single dollar we transact will be accounted for in real time. quantum can interchangeable use 0 and 1 so either can be its value or change to the other depending upon the sequence. Will be difficult if not impossible to hack (w/out being instantly spotted)

So- just be prepared. Central banking will be different if not gone all together Due to  GME. Lol. (Not really a joke but...)

Remember, there are no problems, only solutions (and why not create a problem so that you can roll out your solution?) 

basically...we live in the matrix."
2021-05-07 06:52:04,wallstreetbets,"qbit computing is only faster for very pecific workloads. It won't be faster in ""normal"" workloads. It is faster if you have to make a lot of similiar computes, Like hash breaking as it can be paralellised. It is not faster on sequential workloads. 

If anything, qbit math and things are so over the top and difficult to understand, if somebody realises they can do something not in the up and up, there'll be like <100 people in the world who could understand, but probably don't give enough of a shit regarding the financial sector to notice."

2021-05-07 05:44:38,wallstreetbets,"It's a good question, but you have to put it in perspective. If he had doubled from $100k to $200 and then crashed, people would ask, ""you doubled your money, why didn't you get out?"" in which case he would have missed the ride from $200k to $1M. So, I think the more important lesson is to layer out along the way on a volatile high-risk trade like this. I.e. pocket some gains at various price or time intervals, ideally that you've laid out ahead of time. It definitely limits your max upside, but it lets you lock in some gains along the way."

2021-05-06 23:11:09,wallstreetbets,I had 100 shares and the rest options. Actually exercised my options on that Friday (1/29) as it was my only way to be in the game. Remember that all but a few exchanges killed the ability to buy contracts or shares. I sincerely thought that $400-$500 a share was the floor. I was wrong. Sold the next Wednesday after the share price dropped to like 85. Never thought I'd be so sad to make 300k+ in my life.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASTS a global mobile broadband solution First of all, I am young and full of cum, I started gambling in 2020 before the pandemic and have been looking for high potential long-term plays ([peaked at $1 million](https://ibb.co/hm27s7f), after starting with 1k). u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT is a big inspiration (show us the loss porn dude).

Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.

*Why should you care?*

The recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).

The company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.

*Alright… 100x if everything goes well, right?*

Yes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).

**Desirability**

*Targeted Segment*

Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST’s satellites like 5G towers in space.
Of the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.

To put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.

*Customer Relationships & Channels*

All the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.

*Value Proposition*

Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.
Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.

**Feasibility**

*Key Partners*

In the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.
They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).

Regarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.

*Key Activities*

AST will design and integrate the satellites. The company’s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.

Of course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.

Future agreements won’t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.

*Key Resources*

Talent, technology, and funding.

Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.

As mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST’s technology and has concluded that it works.

For further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company’s plan for global coverage.

**Viability**

*Revenue Streams*

Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.

*Cost Structure*

Because the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.

Now let's talk about an important topic: Risk.

**Risk**

*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*

* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.

* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.

* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.

*Commercial risks*

* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.

* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.

From a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.

**The long-term play**

Shares, shares, shares.

**The short-term play**

The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.
Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers’ agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.

TL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years

2021-05-07 01:14:45,wallstreetbets,"Also in Europe. Every big provider once hung cupper cables to every home for phone connectivity but that did not last forever as it had a big cap ex / bandwidth but stil small coverage of the earths surface and thus users.

You can conclude from comparing this metric:

(Cap ex * bandwidth)/ coverage that towers will still be competitive for some time in urban areas.

70% of the land mass is currently out of 4g/5g tower coverage. A lot of people lives in these areas. It would be an enormous cost per customer to try and reach these less densly populated or underdeveloped regions with towers.

Paris London yes sure towers and repeaters will still do the trick. AST has never targeted this market. It is why they say there market is 1% of the 2021 1T TAM telco market growing at CAGR 40%

2021-05-07 05:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Coming from a tech guy, this is not technically possible, at least the not in the way its advertised. A mobile phone cannot emit sufficient EM to a satellite 700km above, on the other side a satellite may not be able to differentiate 1000 cell signals from that far on a 10km area. there are some limitations they are not exposing upfront, that should be of concern."
2021-05-06 20:15:52,wallstreetbets,"\>  but don't have EE degrees to run the numbers

Ok, then how about I use my PhD in EE to tell you why you don't know what you're talking about.

The ASTS satellites are huge phased arrays capable of listening to thousands of spatially distributed cellular regions concurrently without interference. That means that each satellite can in theory support the full data capacity of a terrestrial cell tower in each cellular region, concurrently alongside all other regions. The satellites act as a very fancy repeater. All of the Tx and Rx data streams are pre/post processed on the ground in server farms. (This is where Rakuten's virtualized network comes in.) Considering the constraints of Shannon's Theorem, this means that their backhaul link must be massive because it must transmit the channel data of thousands of cellular regions all superimposed together into a giant aggregated data clusterfuck.

In short, the ASTS system will be able to support decent but not incredible 4G and 5G speeds for a large number of users before throttling needs to occur. I do not expect they'll be able to offer QoS as good as a terrestrial cell tower network due to the huge path losses, multipath effects, diversity issues, etc. But I think they'll have quite ""decent"" service. ASTS is not looking to replace terrestrial cell networks, they are looking to augment them with a service that fills in the gaps, for those times when you're out of gas on a dirt road in Western Sahara and really need to stream some 4K midget porn right now."
2021-05-06 20:38:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not doubting their ability to re-use frequencies and create a bunch of service cells (again, I worked on satellites like Jupiter 2 that do exactly this). In fact I presume they can, and avoid any number of engineering issues like pointing accuracy, thermal deformation of the array, etc. I don't have enough knowledge to assess whether they can make any given number of cells (thousands?) with any given phased array antenna. That's what you real nerds are for (I say this jokingly with respect and love). But like I say, I presume an infinite number of people could access the service, if need be. 

But I DO know how big channelizers would need to be to make something like that work, and that even laser comms doesn't have infinite bandwidth.

I'd be very surprised if their sats could sustain 250 Gbps, and if 1 million people are using a sat at once, that's...between 2G and 3G.  Not terrible, but not something I think many people will pay for. And I think this will be an option people have to actively choose."
2021-05-07 00:52:26,wallstreetbets,"It should be considered that 90 sats are for global coverage.

MIMO (connection to multiple satellites) will be at 168 and AST has plans as stated in investor presentation to launch well over 300 sats.

Data rate can be further scaled with demand in this way.

Side note is that for example ESA / phased array inside a cellular phone can be done in the millimeter band. And in the decade to come improvments to phones and their antennas, the frequencies used etc can become enhanced and adapted  in its ability to connect to sats just as it has been enhanced in the decade behind us in its ability to connect to towers. 

There is a first mover advantage to the 5Bn users of cellular phones. Once ahead of others tech and capacity can grow and adjust together."
2021-05-07 03:42:23,wallstreetbets,"No you don't require them, but when someone says a statement that they're up 100,000% in a year without backing it up with any legitimate positions apart from one screenshot that shows they have 1mil in an account, how can I believe anything they say afterwards is legit?

And it's not like this hasn't been tried before, with companies in this space repeatedly failing or pulling in 0 profit, even for those that have been active for 20/30 years. 1T TAM is ridiculous - It's just like if I set up a banana stand on my front porch and claim there's an 8T TAM in the food market.

What this guy posted reads like a scam, their terribly designed website reads like a scam (faqs and that's it? For which they can't even say anything about it?), so I'm guessing it's a scam"
2021-05-07 07:09:44,wallstreetbets,"OP also laid out the risks very well. If this doesn't work it goes to zero. If it does work there is a 100x upside. Most ASTS investors are driven into bullishness by the partners - particularly Rakuten and Vodafone. Why don't you short it and we can check back in year to see who was wrong? Either I lose 100% or you lose 100%+

Also a 1t TAM matters when you combine barriers to entry and exclusive partnerships. This is a problem most people face at some point during the year and if AST can solve it, by wholesale method and sharing revenue with your mobile carrier (carrier markets the service) suddenly 1t doesn't look so out of whack."

 Sales volumes averaged 80,540 Boe/d (43% liquids) in the first quarter of 2021, well ahead of the Company’s first half 2021 production guidance of 74,000 Boe/d to 76,000 Boe/d (43% liquids) due to significant outperformance at Karr as well as higher than expected field reliability corporately. 

 • Sales volumes at Karr averaged 33,230 Boe/d (55% liquids) in the quarter compared to 26,914 Boe/d (56% liquids) in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

▪ This increase was driven by strong performance from the six well 3-10 pad that was brought onstream in February and the five well 5-16 West pad that was brought onstream in the fourth quarter of 2020, as well as workovers on the 16-4 pad that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

▪ Paramount achieved an important milestone at Karr, with first quarter exit sales volumes exceeding targeted plateau production of 40,000 Boe/d for the first time and March sales volumes averaging 39,938 Boe/d (53% liquids). Paramount estimates that 12 to 16 new wells per year will be required to maintain plateau production. 

▪ At plateau production of 40,000 Boe/d, annual asset level free cash flow at Karr would be $260 million to $290 million. (2) 

• Sales volumes at Wapiti averaged 14,107 Boe/d (62% liquids) in the quarter compared to 10,764 Boe/d (64% liquids) in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 31% increase in sales volumes was primarily due to new well production from the 5-3 West pad that was brought onstream partway through the fourth quarter. 

• First quarter capital spending totaled $59.3 million, which was focused on drilling and completion activities at Karr and Wapiti. 

**Description/Catalyst**

Paramount Resources is one of the oldest publicly-traded oil and gas companies with over 2 million net acres of land in Canada. The stock is trading at multi-year lows, and I believe has an expected return of between 200% and 300% in the next year. The most important catalyst should happen very soon: growth in Q2/19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta. Given the age of the company (IPO in 1978), legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields, and requires much less capital to sustain. With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti, Paramount’s production should increase after a year of declining. To oversimplify: oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected. With Paramount’s stock near 20-year lows, and production about to start growing after a year of declining, the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of \~$20/share. I believe downside is limited (outside of macro oil price shocks), given how low expectations are. 

**Business Description:**

Paramount has production from three regions, but for simplicity’s sake, only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case. The three regions are: Grand Prairie (where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside), Kaybob Region (will likely decline 15-20% per year) and Central Alberta (will likely decline 10-15% per year). The most important region is Grand Prairie, which is currently 1/3rd of production, and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions. Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months, making them amongst the top oil wells in North America. Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results. The Wapiti region, which is right next door to Karr, just had their first wells turn online in April/May when Keyera’s gas processing facility came online. The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti. 

**History and Why the Stock is Mispriced**

Today’s investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years. In 2017, Paramount bought Apache’s assets in Canada. The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta; however, production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid-2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region. This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth. Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd. However, actual production came in at 86kboepd. Paramount’s stock fell, as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced.

The bear thesis on POU is simple: production went from 95kboepd in Q4/17 to 85kboepd in Q4/18 despite $600m of capex and management’s initial promise of 100kboped of production. Bears don’t believe management’s new 2019 guidance for growth to 85-90kboepd in Q4/19 with only $350m of capex. These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20-year lows today. 

The bridge from 95kbodp in Q4/17 to 85kboepd Q4/18 is as follows:

* 5kboepd less from an asset sale (Resthaven land)
* \~5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land (exploration region that didn’t work – guidance should have been set more conservatively).
* \~5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues. 

Expectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low. I believe Paramount’s production will exit at nearly 100mboepd (guidance is for 85-90). My simple math is as follows:

Karr:

* Q4/18 production was \~27kboepd. This has been their best asset recently, and production was kept flat in 2018 (exit to exit) because of midstream constraints. The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H/18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd. 

Wapiti:

* The company had zero production here in Q4/18, but began turning online wells in May/April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online. The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year, and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd. If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year. These wells start off at much higher rates initially, and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately. I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing \~20kboepd

Kaybob region:

* This is a mature old field with a \~20% decline rate. The company is drilling a few new wells here, and I think production will decline 5% from Q4/18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4/19

Central Alberta:

* This is another mature old and gas field with a \~15% decline rate. I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4/18 to 17kboepd in Q4/19. 

Summary Q4/19 estimate: Karr at 30, Wapiti at 20, Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 = 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85-90. 

I believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team, which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set, did not want to repeat the old team’s mistakes from last year. 

**Why will Wapiti results be good?**

Paramount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter, and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August. Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region, which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year. Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount’s Wapiti region. Below is a map to show proximity:

Paramount’s Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of \~15 months and IRRs of 45% at $55 oil. Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount’s Wapiti estimates:

* Paramount’s Karr region: directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here. Average returns are 64% with 18-month payouts. 
* NuVista’s Gold Creek acreage: directly west of Wapiti with 40% IRRs. Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve.
* Pipestone Energy’s acreage: directly north of Wapiti with 60% IRRs.

All IRRs referenced above assume a $55 WTI oil price. 

Potential asset sales: Given the age of the company, Paramount has plenty of assets (both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure) that they could sell. Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr. Karr is currently Paramount’s best land (64% IRRs referenced above) and inventory life is substantial. Below is my math on Karr’s potential infrastructure value.

Valuation

Upside: If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd, estimated they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020. At $55 oil (WTI) and $5 condensate differentials, EBITDA would be \~$600m. (My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability). Subtracting debt of $800m, and assuming 5x EBITDA, equity value is over $2.2bn and $17/share.  

Downside: If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of $350m (most sell side is bearish/neutral on the stock) and apply a low 4x multiple, after subtracting $800m of debt the valuation target becomes $4.60/share. Downside is therefore \~30%. I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason (infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past). 

Risks:

* Abandonment liability: Paramount has a \~$800m abandonment liability, which it pays out \~$30m per year. Recently in Alberta, the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt. As such, some investors are concerned that Paramount’s large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company’s liquidity. However, Paramount’s revolver does not mature until November of 2022. The company has drawn $800m on their $1.5bn revolver, and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim. I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020, and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022. 
* Guidance in 2019 is reduced – bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018, and the company’s track record of executing against guidance isn’t good. If, for whatever reason, Paramount reduces 2019 guidance (because Wapiti wells are below type curve, or infrastructure issues creep up again), I think downside to the stock is 30%. Please see my valuation section above. 
* Oil/gas prices – this risk is common to any oil and gas company. One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer. 

In the interest of full disclosure of potential conflicts, I work for a company that currently has a long position in Paramount Resources.  The opinions presented here are my own and are based on my research alone, and are not necessarily those of my employer.  There is no guarantee that the price targets I’ve modeled will be reached, and the share price could actually decrease depending on trading dynamics, company announcements, market conditions and other unknown factors.

Market does the math."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to cope with RKT losses. Many of you myself included woke up this morning with worthless calls, or a lot of RKT shares down almost 18 percent. 

Rather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around

1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. 
2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.
3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to ""neutralish"" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.

\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul. This is your chance to restart using everything you've learned about the stock market to make better decisions. Also.. think about it this way. You paid for those calls or those shares for the OPPORTUNITY but not the GUARANTEE that the shares would go up. Those calls weren’t worthless, you made a calculated bet with the hope/expectation of gain. You can’t be too hard on yourself for at least trying to win."
2021-05-06 22:00:22,wallstreetbets,"I am screwed at 25 per share 5,000 shares an epic loss , not worst than buying Fubo at $41 and still holding at $17 
RKT will be a $45 $50 stock just will take some time ."
2021-05-06 23:26:24,wallstreetbets,"I am holding and here is why
   Look at 3rd quarter 2020 and 4th qtr analyst reports when price target was 25 , all the EPS and projections for q1 and q2 well above.
 Reduced margin % on loans being given as reason in recent report. With houses going much above asking price , margins will go down as agent offering better commission rates, as net net they get more amount per loan. Housing market is still insane. None of house in my city staying in market over 6 days. 
They still have approved buyback sitting and wont allow stock price to go below IPO.
89 cents EPS for qtr for 19$ stock is good deal out there. 

Financial institutions, including Arch portfolio was bought at price above 21.

Mortgage rates still going down.

I am not counting its other business and tech aspect. Definately a hold."

2021-05-06 22:23:44,wallstreetbets,I'm balls deep on MVIS. So I know a thing or two about not knowing shit
2021-05-07 14:19:20,wallstreetbets,"Ok let me try to have a reasonable discussion on this sub for once.

**Let us start by assuming what you said is true, which I think it is**. Let's say that margins go back to historical averages of about say 2-2.5%. What you would need to do to go back to 2020 levels of revenue for RKT is to produce twice the volume as margins are halved, which considering the drop off in refi, does not seem likely. So far, things look bearish and hence the sell-off. So I get that. But now lets consider the following:

\- Growth in market share to offset some of the drop off

\- Growth in adjacent verticals

\- X-selling products to the same customer base which has a 91% retention rate.

\- for all we know interest rates could go down again. Trying to predict rates is a fool´s errand

\- surge in inventory/supply over the next coming years + forbearance ending = price stability = more bids = more origination volume

The thing that makes me bullish on this stock is not how much cash they generated in 2020 or can generate in Q2 of 2021, but rather, it is the amount of cash they can generate 5 years from now as they on-board more and more customers and x-sell more and more products. Sure, the margin on each product sold will be less than what it is now, but the growth in market share and secondary verticals should be more than sufficient to offset that.

But, let's assume that the market share growth isn't sufficient and RKT will never go back to 2020 levels. Let's assume that in 2024 they manage to generate **only** 2B in profits from all of their revenue streams combined. At 2B shares (D + A class), that is $1 EPS x 20 multiple = 20 dollar per share. That is the WORST case scenario that I can think of. I personally do believe that they can generate way way way more than $1 of EPS in 2024.

You can be bearish in the short term. That thesis makes a whole lot of sense to me. But I cant for the life of me understand how you can be bearish on the largest player in an industry that is expanding and capturing market share every single quarter.

If this was a tech stock losing money every quarter to gain market share, we´d all be throwing money at it hand over fist. But somehow because it just so happens that lending isn't sexy, we suddenly throw growth potential out the window? Also, who knows, acquisitions, deals, and a strong balance sheet could potentially propel them for even stronger growth.

The one and only question you need to answer when it comes to investing in RKT is: **Do you think that the lending market will decline, stagnate or grow a few years out from now?** There is virtually no indication as far as I can tell that the lending market as a whole will decline. In fact, if anything, more and more people go into debt every day in order to purchase a home, car, etc. RKT can serve all of those verticals as their CEO said multiple times over the ER calls.

What do you make of this assessment?"
2021-05-07 15:21:39,wallstreetbets,"This is a great analysis, and in no way am I bearish on RKT....I have tons of it, it's the largest stock investment in my portfolio.  I am just being realistic about when/how it's going to go back up.  Guys in this sub seem to think it's just going to rocket back up to 40 at any time, and that's not realistic, barring an unforeseen catalyst.  It will rise back up over time.  I live in Cleveland, where Dan Gilbert is something of a hero (or clown).  He owns the Cavs, and I drive by Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse everyday.   One of my good friends is a senior banker at Quicken, and he thinks they are going to grow exponentially OVER THE NEXT 3-5 YEARS.   Shit, DG said himself when it spiked in March that he thought RKT was undervalued at 40.   I believe in the management team moreso than RKT or the housing market at large.  Plus, there's a proposal being talked about by Biden to start giving first time homebuyers a 15k tax credit PLUS 25k downpayment assistance."

2021-05-06 21:46:48,wallstreetbets,"Well I'm in the industry and have been for 17 plus years so yeah.... I know what the fuck I'm talking about. We're originating purchases like crazy because people are moving all over and the people are downsizing to people that are upsizing. People are moving because jobs, environment, schools, out of large cities for more space,, graduating with ridiculous salaries and getting downpayment assistance from local grants that still allow them to purchase with a low down-payment as long as they stay for a set period, etc. Rates are still incredibly low and still at near 50 year low..Oh let's not forget about construction loans which are open ended for a set period to allow a knockdown and rebuild before going into a fixed term so.... enough DD for you on a very very lite scale?"
2021-05-07 18:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah I was trying to be nice, but yeah it was re-fucking-tarded. at least sell half"
2021-05-06 21:59:36,wallstreetbets,"The housing shortage is real, you'd have to be blind not to have seen any of the articles on it. The only reason mortgages are hot right now is due to the lower interest rates, which have a tendency of just disappearing one day. There's plenty of articles on the topic here's one already :

https://www.businessinsider.com/us-housing-shortage-nearly-4-million-homes-fannie-mac-data-2021-4"
2021-05-06 22:09:17,wallstreetbets,I didn't say it wasn't but last I checked there people don't only buy brand new homes and people will still move. Yes profits and revenues will go down short term as you're fucking insane if you think these revenues will continue for long periods of time even without a housing shortage. Everyone and their mothers refinanced so those are fucked but purchases will always be on the table. People were moving in '08 even! The shock to all mortgage companies stock price was horseshit and illogical on many fronts. This too shall pass even if it takes time to adjust after the refinances stop (which has been happening for months now)
2021-05-07 13:57:21,wallstreetbets,Just because people are buying and selling like crazy doesn't mean there is enough inventory -- especially with investment funds snapping up homes like crazy trying to turn us into a nation of renters.

2021-05-07 11:16:38,wallstreetbets,5k is a $1 move. With the dtcc rules coming in soon it’s risky to sell cc’s that low. I do understand the sentiment and on most stocks I sell cc’s weekly against my shares. Just not this one right now. If it were 400% IV I’d probably do it on some.

2021-05-07 03:12:30,wallstreetbets,My favorite part was any time someone mentioned realtime settlement of trades and the DTCC guy started pissing himself and hoping people didn't realize that it's the only sensible option and that it would completely eliminate the need for people like DTCC to sit in the middle scalping profits and covering the shady moves of hedge funds.  I can't believe not a single person asked them about Failure to Delivers and why they have not taken action to margin call the short sellers who have been failing to deliver millions of shares a day.

2021-05-06 22:14:20,wallstreetbets,"I agree on the buy it now, it might print, but not at the whack price it’s at. Especially since the big boys are about to eat it’s lunch, (yes, they slow, and stoopid, but they have paid-for infrastructure, and experience) ford announces an all electric F-150 with quick charge (20min or so? ) and a 500+ range? and it’s all over for these cats. Which is a very real possibility.

The pre-orders were billed to investors as done deals, which wasn’t true, and you know the thing about the boy that cried wolf and all, hard to believe anything else they say now...

I did look in to it more, I see betas rolling off the line,  but I can hardly find any photos/info on the drivetrain, they could well be nothing more than oversized fisher price toys underneath? And if that’s not the case, why so cagey about it?

I also watched the hilariously slow and cautious Baja run, on a specially built unit, they ain’t printing 60000 of those in September that much is for sure. Still smells like more PR bark outta these guys than real product bite."
2021-05-06 22:19:47,wallstreetbets,"You never know. Most companies fail within their first few years. Like I said, it is a gamble just like buying calls or puts. If it plays out then it will be a huge payday. If it doesn't, you move on to the next one but with weekly expirations and normally solid premiums, I will easily be at a zero cost basis by years end. Sometimes the risk isn't as risky as it seems if you play it right."

2021-05-06 22:36:20,wallstreetbets,Now that the big boys are getting into the game we are going to see acquisitions happen before we see any company go anywhere. You just have to pick the right company to get there. I like ride as an acquisition target by GM. Let them blow cash developing the product... If it works... Buy it out. GM isn't a major insider by accident.

I have 700 shares, been averaging down for months, now sitting at $8.36 a share.  

Stonk has a nice dividend.

I've also been selling covered calls for extra income.

It's a gamble, but there is an opportunity for tendies if they crush earnings again, and after the Rocket caused sell off of UWMC, an earnings miss is already priced in.  I would think even a miss would trade flat, but a hit...that could work."
2021-05-06 20:04:01,wallstreetbets,"How do you lock out RKT from getting loans without tightening earnings.   Money litterally falling from the sky with 130bn a month fed brr...

RKT miss was minor... housing bump in rates doesn't matter, it's velocity that matters - refinance biz is slow now, but just pivot to loans....then again low inventory meant low volume there.  I don't think with how low this inventory is mortgages are stopping at all."
2021-05-07 16:18:39,wallstreetbets,"In addition to earnings after close on Monday, we also have the (probable) catalyst of the Russell Reconstitution next month that would add UWMC to the Russell indices, which made the preliminary IPO inclusion earlier this year but it got snubbed on the technicality of it being brought to market via SPAC merger.

With the Russell inclusion we would see some buy-in from institutions that track funds to the index, and with the dividend yield being higher than ever (since we just hit an all-time low ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)), it's an excellent value play.

Holding shares, June $8Cs and Jan $7Cs, let's fucking do this (please)."
2021-05-06 20:42:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm staying out of the mortgage arena. Big money is gonna be upset that the market is cooling. New home building is still extremely slow and prices are going up with commodities. A large quantity of the used home market has already been tapped IMO, and a lot of the easy money has been made. With the first sign of the cooling off in the market we saw RKT get slaughtered by institutional money.

I will say I'd rather be in UWMC than RKT, but really I think the commodities play is better right now. But legit I could be retarded"

“Oh, you have kids?”

“......no....Not anymore...”"
2021-05-06 23:09:48,wallstreetbets," It at all. You see some of us that were here before the Jan spike, believed big time in this. It was lead by people who seemed to really want to support the little guy. All they did really was use us as a tool. Here’s how, up to the pint of the squeeze it had become a tight group. The mods (leaders of this) had us believing in it all! Because it was doing exactly as they said. Why not believe them when all is going to their call? So when this first spike started everyone was holding because we believed these people. We had full trust because it was downright beautiful and right there in front of us... not knowing we were suckered into being a shield and the support for them to selll while telling all to hold! We continued to believe they stabbed a whole community in the back. They are shit for this. You could see these folks still telling people to hold as they were out at 350$ they knew there wasn’t much more while it was crashing they still posted hold... few days later they are rubbing the big gains in our face. 

Biggest play on so many people that actually believed they cared to help us get $ for our families. They are the worst type of people. They are worse then hedges, Robinhood all of them, because we all were left wondering what the fuck. 

The days after they were gone. Been that way since. That is why the guy former broker didn’t get into trouble. He gave them the Reddit room"

Watch them crash the market on purpose soon"
2021-05-07 00:22:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s under 2 hours and it’s first and foremost an action comedy not a thematically heavy art piece movie but it has heavy subtext about politicians etc using the media as a form of manipulation and propaganda to keep the lower classes in check using aliens as a metaphor for the upper class or politicians or whatever. Even the scenes where the average class people have been specifically manipulated into working against one another to keep the people divided, which is an extremely common tool of governments.

Which is of course a message more relevant than ever with social media now a days. 

It has really kinda striking imagery at certain points like the homeless Nada sitting in an alley watching advertising on someone’s tv through their window or the police destroying the homeless camp.

It’s already more interesting thematically than the majority of action movies especially in the 80s, excluding Verhoeven films and some others of course."

2021-05-07 10:29:34,wallstreetbets,"> We haven't set dates for it happening, GME jwill pop when it pops.

Right. No dates set so you can just be bagholding in 5 years and still not be “wrong.” Very cultlike."

Imagine thinking setting a reminder (something that requires a date) is in any way similar to setting a date for a stock to make a move.  If this is the way you think, you should plan on working WELL past standard retirement age."

I didn't lost quite as much as you net but I've certainly had some pretty crazy volatile runs where I've gone peak to trough for almost 7 figures and Schwab never sent me anything.

2021-05-07 01:08:37,wallstreetbets,"Actually, Robinhood is piece of shit.

1 contract is 100 shares. If the stock is even 1 cent off, your options can cost an additional $1+ per contract.

Schwab options contract fee is $0.65. It just means that if he was Robinhood, he would have lost far more in commissions. (And yes, Schwab does PFOF too but its execution speed is far superior and takes less profit from PFOF than Robinhood from PFOF)

In volatile stocks like GME, Robinhood can literally rob you like $0.40 a share cause of the slow execution. $0.40 a share on a contract is like $40+ lost to save that $0.65 in fees.

I know when I was looking at Robinhood's graph and Fidelity's Level 2 data, I noticed when GME was $162.32 today, I saw trades happening at $161.99. If you were at Robinhood, you might have gotten the market price of $162.32 when in better brokerages, you could have gotten at $161.99. That lost money adds up quite quick once you are buying lots of shares/contracts.

Example today: [https://i.ibb.co/7zfyH0V/how-does-this-work.png](https://i.ibb.co/7zfyH0V/how-does-this-work.png)

I was able to buy to cover my shorts at $162.00 when market price was $162.32 for a while. If this were Robinhood, then you might never had the opportunity to buy/cover at $162 when that graph claimed $162.32 (market price). I seen some huge spreads on volatile stocks (GME) in which sometimes, there could be $2+ difference a share on Level 2 data. You don't know how much Robinhood is robbing people from PFOF and all in these volatile meme stocks. Market price != best offer."

2021-05-07 01:00:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean to be fair, $800k with 10% return every year would be more than most people will see in their lifetimes.

Year 1: $880k

Year 2: $968k

Year 3: $1064.8

Year 4..10:  $1171.28,  $1288.408, $1417.2488,  $1558.97368, $1886.35815, $2074.99397, $2282.49336

By year 10 with 10% return (I know, I know.. P/E and all but still) is over $2.2 million. By 10th year, your investments average $207+k a year.

It's clearly more than you will ever make in your lifetime if you invest that $800k from day 1 (in average yearly basis). In 45 years, that number would be over $64 million with the compounding."

I would venture that practically all “lost” money from the early February highs, but you have a major reason for optimism here. If you must take on risks, I highly suggest you go in on a 3x Dow or s&p, as they at least won’t expire worthless on you (barring a catastrophic event of unimaginable magnitude, of course)."
2021-05-06 21:00:21,wallstreetbets,Ha! BofA/Merrill/edge is highly restrictive of penny stocks because back in the day they were sued by a retail trader who lost it all on p&ds. She claimed she didn't know and they should have stopped her. It was a self-directed brokerage account.
2021-05-07 09:28:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes that the whole point. 

Once you sign it, you are saying “I understand what I did and what I am doing” and you pretty much foreclose any opportunity to sue for lack of suitability on losses you sustained. (OP already signed similar documents when he applied for options trading authority, so this document - coming after huge losses - is designed to protect the firm from any “sour grapes” suitability claims). 

True - you aren’t “contracting” on anything. But you are “waiving” your ability to make certain claims potentially available to you. And anytime you sign waivers, you probably should know what you are waiving. 

Are you familiar with suitability claims in broker dealer settings?

As someone who defended hundreds of suitability claims in both private arbitration at JAMS and in various federal and state courts for the big brokers dealers, I’ll stand on my suggestion that any retail customer who fancies themselves as “sophisticated” really understand what they are signing and engaging in.

There are multiple avenues to attack a broker-dealer for retail losses sustained and some can be successful.

In my experience, truly sophisticated investors (the institutional ones) build their huge wealth by playing “heads I win, tails you lose”. Retail schmucks take it on the chin and walk away since they have never had counsel guide them through their legal options.

It’s just one way the wealthy are different from regular folks. They can afford counsel and they know their rights. And they pursue them vigorously. That’s all I’m trying to say.

To each his own though, and I’m not trying to give legal advice or say what OP should or shouldn’t do. I’m just offering some inside baseball on how these things work and why these letters get sent out."

2021-05-07 01:28:36,wallstreetbets,You are just the person I need to ask a question. I had close to a 100k in a non invested 401k during crash. After crash and the cares act was enacted they were required to allow me to cash out my 401k. I had suffered a severe heart condition in January 2020 and could not work. The company holding my money that is a broker that starts with an f and ends with a y told me to screw off I could not have my own money. I wrote email to Steve manuchin and anybody in whitehouse regulatory position I could. I missed months of the best investing a person could ask for from March to September. I finally was given the money in the fall of 2020 and was able to double it then but missed life changing opportunities earlier because they chose to break the law and hold my money. The representatives on the phone refused to give last names or company I.d.  Basically all I have is the 1st name of people that told me I my money was not going to be given to me for investing 😏 do I have a case for damages?  Thanks for any advice

2021-05-07 09:58:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying suitability isn't a thing. I'm saying that in this specific situation OP already, as you pointed out, satisfied suitability reqs to even trade options on the platform, which he had to apply and be approved to do. The document at hand is a CYA/customer retention effort to reiterate stuff OP had already represented before making those trades, and represented that he understood. The CYA aspect is for *future* trades now that he's lost his shirt on the *prior* trades.  Does OP need a lawyer to actually understand the words in the doc? Probably not. So what would a lawyer, charging a few hundred dollars to read this and talk about it with OP, going to say to him? Are you suggesting OP has an above 0% chance of a successful broker dealer suit against Schwab for losing money on options? This isn't some alternative asset manager suckering in retail with free cruises.


Let's do a thought experiment: what might a lawyer like you say to someone like OP bringing you this letter? I'm guessing exactly what I just said -- sign it or don't trade options with Schwab. Those are the only two options. It will take you longer to invoice him for the legal work than tell him the result of your analysis.

2021-05-07 07:11:00,wallstreetbets,"So, full disclosure, I have represented most of the large registered broker-dealers in the past on many matters.

So I can’t give you legal advice or really many details. 

So I will respond the way Penn and Teller do at the end of “Fool Us”:

I think we both know you need to consult a lawyer and ask these questions. And I think I know the name of the firm you had money at. And maybe you can ask that lawyer about why or how your funds were frozen? (I’m unclear what “non-invested” means, and how “holding your money” meant you couldn’t invest 401k funds that were already held at F———y).

If this was a rollover 401k, even without the CARES act, anyone can withdraw their rollover 401k at any time. It isn’t an illiquid account. It just requires you to pay a 10% penalty and federal taxes on the withdrawal account. I think CARES act let folks skip the penalties. The CARES didn’t do anything to grant permissions to withdraw funds from rollovers. That was always there. 

If this relates to a 401k at your current employer, that’s a bit beyond my knowledge Im afraid. They are different from rollovers in certain regards. I’m not all that familiar with restrictions on 401k’s custodied for current employers and all the regulations on those and how the CARES act affected whether you could cash it out. 

Typically you are pretty limited in 401k plans that relate to current employment as I think the plan administrator (your employer) dictates where the funds are custodied and what investments are available.

My rollover 401k is also at a firm called F——-y, and I have level two options trading capabilities and can do all sorts of trades in that account, so my guess is you had issues with trying to cash out a 401k from your current employer that is custodied at F———y?

Anyways, I’m sorry you couldn’t withdraw the funds, but my non-legal advice is to talk to a lawyer and in the future make sure to document (via letter requests) any account actions that you want your broker/custodian to take and which they seem to be dragging your feet on.

And my quick google of the CARES act also raises another question. First the relevant synopsis:

“The CARES Act, signed into law last March by then-President Donald Trump, allowed individuals to withdraw up to $100,000 from their retirement account without paying the usual 10% tax penalty if they were under age 59½ — as long as the justification for the distribution was Covid-related. Those reasons could include things like you or your spouse being diagnosed with Covid, getting laid off from your job or working fewer hours.”

So if you missed out on this once in a generation investment opportunity in March 2020:

1) why couldn’t you have directed the $100k in 401k funds you wanted to invest into some S&P index fund or tech fund in March 2020 within the 401k plan?

2) are you suggesting that pretty much the day the CARES act was signed in March 2020, you were calling F———-y, saying “I’ve had a Covid emergency and need funds for (hospital, layoff, etc)”, and yet simultaneously are now saying “I actually didn’t need this money for bills, I just wanted to put it in Robinhood and go long GME!!”

Because I think the use of your funds that you claim you wanted to do (invest in a depressed stock market and double that money) clashes with the use restrictions that the CARES act allows.

Sorry I can’t be more helpful, but if you feel there is merit to your claims, please see a lawyer who specializes in Covid relief claim cases."
2021-05-07 11:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes these are all valid point. And the size of amount in controversy - as you point out - really negates any benefit of getting a lawyer. After all, why pay $3,000 for advice that will only safe you $500.

I guess that’s why the clients bringing suitability cases I saw were worth more like $5m+ and sometimes had losses in the low to mid 7-figure range. 

I always found it comical that folks worth $300m would say with a straight face “I didn’t know these investments were risky” or “I have a very low risk tolerance” or “I didn’t want anything aggressive”. 

They didn’t win these cases often, and I didn’t feel like an asshole repping the Wall St side in these cases, since I viewed them all as big boys who took a risk and it didn’t pan out..

I guess I was just trying to make smaller retail Reddit investors aware that there are larger things going on that surround these types of letters so they can better understand the ecosystem."

Contracts

Shares

A contract is 100 shares.

When you buy a call to open option, you are purchasing the right to buy that stock at the strike price, regardless of how high it actually goes.

So let's say you put in a 3400 call to open on $amzn for 6/18 for 5 contracts

Now let's say you really luck out, and amazon explodes by june 18, and they hit 3800

This gives you the option to buy those 5 contracts, or 500 shares, of amzn, valued at 3800, for 3400.

you sell to close those options and net the difference times how many shares.

or the other way, the stock plummets and goes below 3400. and your wife's boyfriend fucks you and your wife because you yeeted $36840 on calls that expired worthless below the strike."
2021-05-06 20:02:10,wallstreetbets,"If you owned 1000 shares of Amazon and it moved $20 you would gain $20,000. He had options with (educated guess) a delta of around .40-.45 which is basically like holding 400- 450 shares."

It does not work. My whole trade lasted less than 5 minutes so no point of talking about 5 or 15 minutes chart. 

What will be the upper and lower bounds of that indicator that tells you when the stock is overbought or oversold? The usual 70% and 30% almost never work to identify the reversal. If you look at todays 1 min chart for AMZN, you will notice that the trend reversed several times below 70% and above 30%. It even started downtrend at 56% and uptrend at 39%. In that time frame AMZN only fluctuated by $10 with minimum change in the premium. It does not work most of the time."
2021-05-07 11:16:04,wallstreetbets,you can get some good premium on ITM puts. it's a bonus if you really like the underlying and don't mind owning it. I like to write puts on an asset I already own. if I'm assigned it can be used to average down plus I gain premium.

Ibkr seems great, apart from their platforms that are a bid unmodernized and slow. Being under 25 I also just pay 3$ a month instead of the 10$ you pay. (Which is more than reasonable)

I bought 37 shares @ $38 and sold when they purchases were restricted.  Used that capital to buy back in when it got under $50.  I killed myself by not buying calls prior to second run up.  Logic does not apply to GME, nor does common sense, so ive been buying calls and rolling them 30+ days out because of FOMO.  Im more conservative on every other stock plays then i am here.

2021-05-06 22:31:46,wallstreetbets,"I think there’s a solid bear case against VIAC right now which is that the market doesn’t know if there are still large blocks of shares that are going to be unloaded related to the Archegos liquidation. It’s possible that some banks are still holding shares and waiting for the price to recover a little, then they’ll pull the rug out. Personally I think most of the damage has been done, but you never know. So I think if I had expirations prior to Jan 2022 I’d maybe hold a little longer but consider selling if things don’t improve in the next few weeks. 

However it seems most institutions have price targets in the $60+ range by end of year, so if your leaps will print at that price by Jan 2022 you’ll probably be ok. You might be better off averaging down instead of selling off if you plan to hold the rest of the year, that way you don’t miss a run up. It’s been difficult to time the market when it’s this irrational.

At the end of the day the earnings numbers were better than I expected, and I think the market will catch up after some time once the fear wears off a little. I have no idea how long that will take, and I don’t think anyone else does either, but I’m going to hold my leaps for now. I did sell my shares the other day because I wanted the cash for some other plays, and earnings have been fucking up stocks even with good numbers the last few weeks. Just be aware that if the price does run up there could be another block sale, driving the price down, so if you’re worried about it then maybe wait until it runs a little then unload when you’re closer to breaking even. It might drop more over the next few weeks but I think by end of year it should recover.

What are your strikes/expirations?

I guess I should say this is not financial advice, and I’m not a professional."

2021-05-07 19:04:29,wallstreetbets,">I’m down nearly 50% on my leaps bought 2 weeks ago when the stock is down roughly 8%. That is not at all the same. 

Yes, LEAPS are still options, which are leveraged, so they have a larger %change than the underlying for some move in price. You need to factor in delta and changes in implied volatility.

>Further, contracts and shares are two different things. I could literally expire out of the money and have nothing. They are not at all the same.  

Wow, options and shares aren't the exact same thing? Mind blown... 

Also you can roll your LEAPS out. If you let a LEAPS expire OTM you don't understand options and shouldn't trade them anyways.

>Leaps have a function but they are not similar to shares in anyway

Okay, but they are similar. You get exposure to 100 shares while paying a fraction of the price. Like a more volatile version of a share."
2021-05-07 19:07:32,wallstreetbets,Everything you said above just strengthen the point that leaps and shares are not the same at all.

2021-05-07 10:38:15,wallstreetbets,"i wouldn't hold my breath. they just printed 10 trillion dollars and are promising to print another 4, at the least. what's going to happen is that there will be a shitload of money floating around and everyone's going to become millionaires, except a gallon of milk is going to cost $30 thousand dollars. people will get fucked out of their homes en masse, but it's not going to crash the market, corporations have cash money for days to buy everything up.

we're going to have a reverse recession. the government is going to keep printing money and telling everyone they've never had it so good, income is rising, inflation is racist, etc. but your real buying power is going to be diluted massively, probably 100:1. anyone with money is going to realize it's better spent on goods before the prices rise. so store shelves will be empty within a year.

anyone living paycheck to paycheck is going to end up on government assistance, and this is by design. in addition, there will be camps. literal labor camps.

but a crash, nope. stock market will make new all time highs every other day. and you will be told you've never had it so good, your elected leaders are the reason, and if you question that, there will be a re-education program, aka the labor camps.

do the remind me thing for 1 year."

people who are hold money like that will get spooked. it will be the wsb yolo crowd that buys a house from the PLTR stock they made money on somehow"
2021-05-06 20:09:39,wallstreetbets,"My scenario included a stable job. There are still jobs out there that are safe regardless of the economy taking a dive. People with money will be spooked? Why and how? If the money isn’t tied to any investments, keeping it in a savings account was a smart move. And if you’re good enough with money to get that far, why wouldn’t you see an economic dive as a buying opportunity? After all, in this scenario you have enough money to be able to pay for a down payment. Does housing get more expensive during recessions or something? My economic instincts say no."
2021-05-06 23:37:11,wallstreetbets,I highly recommend setting up a couple of free paper money accounts with them in ToS - I created one that started with $2500 (my real life start over amount) and then another with $25k to simulate an account that can day trade. It has been highly valuable to practice strategies and figure out how things work without real money on the line.

2021-05-07 03:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps, more accurately: broad, sweeping statements are not a good thing. Seat belts protect people from themselves, and, unless you favor death over life, this statement purports to prove your point, but has no actual worth, unless, again, death is something that you, or anyone listening to you, favors. 
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it's important for any person to be able to make their own decisions, and having that taken away, is not a good thing.
I would add that perhaps protecting people from themselves is not the worst thing, so long as you have their permission."

2021-05-07 01:57:01,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. I think the skepticism is well founded. Just because this guy talks the talk, doesn't mean he walks the walk. It remains to be seen whether or not these issues are properly addressed and rules enforced."
2021-05-07 03:08:22,wallstreetbets,"And, I would take it a step further to say, any law that is passed without permission from the constituents, is probably doomed to fail, ultimately, over time. It's not the protection that's bad, it's the deception. Any person that values being alive and continuing to stay that way would not scoff at being protected, whether from themselves or an outside force, unless it somehow imposed on their freedom. I mean, rationally speaking..... I suppose an irrational person could think or feel however they wanted about literally anything."
2021-05-07 06:05:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, seatbelt should be optional if you’re an adult and able to make your own decisions, if you want to risk the death you should be allowed to risk the death."
2021-05-06 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,"Some people are adult enough to turn off their phone or use ‘grown up’ brokerages. Other people have a neurons in their brain that are stimulated outside of their control, and an addictive release of dopamine and serotonin that compels them to trade more when they see confetti when they were sold a trading platform that is named after someone that took from the rich and gave to the poor but actually doesn’t do that at all. Instead they sell your data to the rich so that they can funnel money out of your pocket into their own. The opposite of Robin Hood."
2021-05-06 22:17:37,wallstreetbets,"I dunno man. I use TDA and ToS and there is literally no fanfare. The only indication I did anything bad or good is a green number or a red one and a chime telling me my trade went through. RH throws confetti at you and has you compete for high scores like it’s a mobile casino game. They game you into trading more. It’s literally casino psychology. The difference between this and an actual casino is that when your in an actual casino it isn’t disguised as anything. You understand the social contract you signed by walking into one, in that you are aware that you are being encouraged to gamble and that the house is trying to take your money. Your broker should have your best interests in mind. And for example with a bank that offers you trading, they want you to make money because the more money you have the more money they can lend out, so your goals and their goals are essentially in alignment. RH doesn’t use your money for anything, they make their money through getting you to trade, whether you win or lose, thus having only their own interests in mind, like a casino. But they don’t make you aware of that social contract like a casino does. That’s the problem."
2021-05-06 21:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Lol me? I use ToS on desktop, like an adult."
2021-05-06 22:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood doesn’t have you compete for high scores have you ever even used it? I literally said I didn’t like the fanfare, I think it’s pretty lame, but there is zero sort of points, scoring, leaderboards or bonuses. I’d love for you to point it out to me."
2021-05-06 23:40:33,wallstreetbets,"I don't use RH, no. Im just going off of things they've said. I don't want you to think I'm talking about you specifically, we're just having a conversation about it generally so please don't take this personally. But the app is set up to draw in gamblers. Im talking dopamine response, which is not anything anyone has control over. They're gaming your brain chemistry to get you to stay in the casino. Like fine, take out the leaderboards. I don't know about that. But they literally have you scratch a lotto ticket. And going off things they've said like:

**“In the past, we used the same confetti design to celebrate firsts with customers,” Robinhood said in a blog post Wednesday. “Now, we’re introducing new, dynamic visual experiences that cheer on customers through the milestones in their financial journeys.”**

I guess they removed the confetti at the end of march after much scrutiny, as it was the most obvious thing, for more subtle tactics. They say it like they're just being cute, but in reality these are very same disingenuous tactics they're using to keep you gambling. IMO, there shouldn't be any 'dynamic visual experiences' involved in trading at all. The shit should be clinical in design so you can make decisions with a clear head.

Here's an article about it on FastCo [https://www.fastcompany.com/90619112/robinhood-gamification-dark-side](https://www.fastcompany.com/90619112/robinhood-gamification-dark-side)

2021-05-07 02:02:38,wallstreetbets,">The Fed put is still in place. So, the only way the market can crash is if there's another COVID-like shock. The fear of the Fed being forced to tighten is BS as I explained above.

In the past months, Fake News said there were several occasions during the 10, 5-year auction nobody were bidding hence the sudden increase of rates. I really hope it was because bidders anticipated the rates were moderately increasing so they waited it to stabilise and the demand came back. If Fed didn't come in and buy those bonds, the rates could have been gone higher. I am pretty sure Fed will stay put on rate increase for a period of time, but the timing of stopping 120B purchase/m will likely be imminent. 

I sense the market is testing its limit right now on how high rate it can stay with and it is still not happy with the current multiples with 10-year at 1.5%."

2021-05-06 23:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Ya my idea is that GM will see some panic selling when the figures of production issues actually hit the market. I mean go look at Chevy dealer websites very few to none of them have 3 months of inventory. My biggest red flag is a store I worked with 5 years ago that carried on average 1000 units on lot. They are currently at 86.

The used market is going to boom this year and companies like Carvana may be an upside play but I just don't like the company.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Just depends on what you think the stock is going to do, but yeah, I've sold contracts 12 months out that have lost over 1/2 their value in 1 month. So I buy them back on  the reddest day I can, wait for a nice big green day to sell more."

2021-05-06 20:11:15,wallstreetbets,Libertarianism and socialism are both political philosophies. I am having a difficult time visioning a society that is libertarian and socialist. Your example involves anarchism.
2021-05-07 05:34:49,wallstreetbets,"> The free market creates equal opportunity and does not discriminate

The free market may not, but humans do. If you're in any identifiable way different from the mainstream, you're going to suffer - see the fate of women, black people, Italians, Irish, Chinese, Muslims, etc. in American history.

And ultimately that's besides the point, because all this equal opportunity, natural laws talk is just being coy about what you believe in, which sounds a lot like social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest, right? But what about the rest? And how do you prevent the smartest, luckiest guy (your Bezos, Musk types) from completely destroying your free market with their resources?

Libertarianism as an ideology chooses to pretend that these questions don't matter and don't need answers, whereas the reality is that you either outright say that your ideology is immoral and you don't care, or you end up inventing government all over again."
2021-05-07 04:30:56,wallstreetbets,"They are different kinds of political philosophy as I said before, Socialism is an economic policy where as libertarianism is a legal policy. It is fully possible to have a government that answers to the people and respects there rights well also allowing for a social safety net, we would just need to reform our election laws to make sure that politicians are actually accountable to the people instead of big business. The main takeaway from libertarianism is noninterference with the everyday lives of it's citizens, this would include matters such as ending the war on drugs(Which more left wingers are open too), withdrawing from foreign conflicts and ending the patriot act. Libertarianism in itself was originally a left-wing ideology anyways.  

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#:\~:text=Libertarians%20seek%20to%20maximize%20autonomy,existing%20economic%20and%20political%20systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#:~:text=Libertarians%20seek%20to%20maximize%20autonomy,existing%20economic%20and%20political%20systems)."
2021-05-07 07:01:53,wallstreetbets,"And I will agree. Like I mentioned, I love libertarianism as a theory. Is the current state of America able to ever make the transition? Probably not, for reasons you mention.

But again, in regards to you saying libertarians pretend these questions do not need answers, it is the opposite, and they are answered. Personal responsibility is emphasized but that is not social Darwinism, or at least I dont think so? That is doing what we are supposed to do here on Earth. 

Also, something to consider. Unjust laws cause widespread racism and discrimination. Plessy v Ferguson. Chinese exclusion act. etc. Lots of scary stuff has been put into law. Thomas Sowell's Applied Economics argues that a private business is the best in a free market when they do not discriminate. Obviously this is super simple and dumbed down but, any business that does not discriminate has a clear advantage over others. I think anyone would agree with this."
2021-05-07 07:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Do you like not being right? 

>You are the product.

>Customers are not benefitting from their order flow being sold to HFTs.

Selling order flow means customers are the product..."
2021-05-07 08:42:32,wallstreetbets,"Except clearly that also didn't happen - segregated businesses were the norm for over a century. Segregation will happen if: a) there is an identifiable monied mainstream that is significantly prejudiced against a poorer minority, and b) there isn't an infinite supply of the product.

Think of ""exclusive"" country clubs for an example.

> That is doing what we are supposed to do here on Earth. 

This is a completely subjective judgement and can be applied to anything. 

Huffing paint behind a Wendy's dumpster? That is doing what we are supposed to do here on Earth. Helping the homeless? Ditto. Eating 78 hotdogs in a single sitting? You get the idea."
2021-05-07 09:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but I like to argue more than just to be right.

It's a foible."
2021-05-07 10:33:00,wallstreetbets,No point in arguing if we agree fam. Cheers
2021-05-07 00:22:35,wallstreetbets,What would this do to the stock price?
2021-05-07 09:05:24,wallstreetbets,"The move from this news has already happened, ASO hit a new ATH yesterday on a big jump in volume.  News also came out that KKR priced the secondary offering at $32, so we may see support at $32 instead of $30 going forward?"

2021-05-06 20:48:02,wallstreetbets,Gamestop released a statement mid-april about the upcoming proxy information and voting and in it they listed an up to date count of the shares held by the top ten institutional shareholders. Those shares added up plus the known insider holdings left only about 26 million shares for retail to buy (this didn't even include institutional holding outside of the top ten so it's likely far less than 26 million available but it's a good conservative number to go with).
2021-05-06 21:24:38,wallstreetbets,"*""Gamestop released a statement mid-april about the upcoming proxy information and voting and in it they listed an up to date count of the shares held by the top ten institutional shareholders. ""* 

They listed the shares held by the top 10 institutions from their **latest 13F filings**, which was in January. New ones are due this month and have been trickling in. Aside from that, even IF there was only 26mil shares to trade, **the apes would have to 26mil votes + the amount of shares loaned out**, before any naked shorts are taken into account.

I've been long on GME since November. I'm still here. I'm just saying that your facts as you understand them are wrong. Institutions can buy and sell as they please, ETF and Mutual funds rebalance periodically. No one knows  who owns what on a given date."

2021-05-06 20:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Mining is a small portion (10-20% IIRC) of AMD GPU sales, but even if mining gone out for good, they'll still sell everything they can make for at least a year, just like Nvidia. Demand is so far ahead of supply it'll be year(s) before they can saturate the market."
2021-05-06 23:34:28,wallstreetbets,"This is not a strong argument.

Amd processors are overtaking intel for their superior price/performance ratios, IN ADDITION to the GPUs taking market share from Nvidia for the same reason.

Plus, amd shook out intel for the contract on Apple hardware going forward. No more intel based macs, Macbooks, Mac minis or Mac pros.

Furthermore, when this growth happens, this quickly (3 years or less), people begin to speculate that the growth will continue, especially so in this case... Because there is no reason any of the above points I mentioned should not co tinue into the foreseeable future.

When intel and Nvidia reigned supreme, amd was always there... It took literally 15+ years for amd to top them in product quality/value (depending on how you wanna look at it). Now it's amd's turn to run away with both markets.

Imo."
2021-05-06 20:32:55,wallstreetbets,I think it's a lot more than 20% but don't have actual stats to back that up. Just based on my personal experience. I hope the price takes off or dives. I only lose if it trades flat for the next few months. :)
