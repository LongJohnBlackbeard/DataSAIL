2021-04-06 19:56:45,wallstreetbets,"since this is your first DD post, I'll go easy on you, but here is some advice...

* Don't call it a ""deep value"" play. You know putting those two words together has a different meaning here.

* Don't do the whole ""hey dummies, you can't read"" schtick. That's dumb. 

* If you are posting the ""good stuff"" as you call it, close the circle and also tell us the ""bad stuff"" or potential risks with this play. 

* Finally, no one cares about the past plays you claim to have made. 

Otherwise, thanks for posting. I'm going to research this company, as others should do, before possibly opening a position."

2021-04-06 18:40:11,wallstreetbets,As if MSO’s will not be able to buy wholesale to bring down their prices. They will also have a head start on licensing and compliance... adding multiples to the line is more important than focusing on Dry-leaf.. R&D budgets and development in place to capitalize on derivatives.. drinks and edibles.. MSOs will survive and prosper. Curaleaf is on track to turn a profit this year.

2021-04-06 18:59:37,wallstreetbets,"Good points except for the 100% chance of purchasing a Trulieve product in a Trulieve store. They have Binske, Sunshine Cannabis, Bellamy Bros to name a few and a bunch of other licensed items. 

Curaleaf carries Select products.

There will always be room for more brands in these outlets and they will adapt or be overrun. But, going rec legal doesn’t instantly mean that there will be a rush of well built sustainable companies or that the newer to market companies will take over all of the market space and the long time market share owners will just sit there and watch it happen.

Do you really think that a company who could get instant exposure inside these existing outlets will not make any deals and just hope that people flock to them? Do you think that those of us who have medical cards will ditch our long term dispos for unknowns overnight? We will see how it all plays out, but, I don’t think any of the existing mega corps will just disappear upon legalization."

 Cannabis will be grown outdoors in those areas for pennies a gram. The only survivors in the US will be craft and local organic grown. 

US politicians screwed the pooch on the legalization part for US citizens to truly ever have had a chance at the green rush."
2021-04-06 18:47:44,wallstreetbets,">""as if MSO's will not be able to buy wholesale to bring down their prices."" 

Sure, anyone can buy shitty weed, I guess. Gonna be tough to slap a underwhelming logo like Curaleaf's on a bag and sell shitty weed though. They ain't no ""Cookies."" 

>""Head start on licensing and compliance""

*LP's laugh in GMP*

>""Drinks and edibles""

Drinks? like the #14 craft beer in the US that's been tied to marijuana culture for decades and also hosts their own 4/20 festival? That would be Sweetwater, and you can get your sweet ass they are ready for ""derivatives."" 

>""Curaleaf is on track to turn a profit""

Look man, if they weren't already stacking profits while operating in almost exclusively vertically integrated markets, then I've got bad news for you about the open and legal market. Especially when they really don't have much branding to speak of outside of those vertically integrated markets I mentioned. ""Cookies"" has brand loyalty. Curaleaf has a bunch of people with stockholm syndrome."
2021-04-06 19:49:13,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the family 

The one in the article pronounced it like “Coke”. Others like Ed Koch (the former mayor of nyc) pronounce is like “Kach”, with the “ch” making the same sound as in “catch”."

2021-04-06 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. There's no reason to be. 

We don't need Biden to sign an EO. We need Schumer to introduce something and have it voted for and passed, then put on Biden's desk. Preferably with 60 votes in favor. 

I'd like to see marijuana legalization yesterday as well, but we gotta have it done right. Biden signing ridiculous EO's is not the way."

Aphria has already said they plan to use SW to introduce their own brands like Broken Coast, Solei, and Riff. So, you lose. Lol next. 

Also, they can sell SW wherever they want while waiting to add that one special ingredient. While MSOs like Curaleaf burn cash to expand State to State. 

Add some insight to your life. It would help."

2021-04-06 19:01:32,wallstreetbets,"The Canadian operators are not turning a profit, they are one of the reasons the market lags.. the only time the market gets momentum is when the discussion is focused on what is happening with US operators. It’s not about buying shitty weed.. but you mentioned cost of production here. Once interstate commerce is available these companies will easily scale and become much more efficient. You can’t penalize them for operating within the confines of the law to expand and grab market share. Not all cannabis is equal.. that’s no different than the differences in alcohol.. you can buy jim beam but u can also buy Macallan 12.. sometimes what’s being sold at a store depends primarily on what is available.. but having the license to sell will allow you to sell everything that becomes available thus giving you an advantage and the opportunity to capture market share and create a loyal customer base. curaleaf stores will benefit from the experience just like Starbucks doesn’t have the best coffee but the experience around ordering and picking up a cup of Joe has created a loyalty that is unparalleled"

Biden talks directly about cannabis on his website **before** he was president. 

However, **zero** mentions after. You just don't go from mandatory minimums to legalization. Dinosaurs (of any party) have no place in our government, and I believe the next 4-8 years we will see big changes."

2021-04-06 17:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Spitballing some bear cases:  


* GME's squeeze gets squoze which causes all the funds short to margin call and liquidate their holdings. 
* Cascade of Archegos Capital Management-style blowups.
* Fed raises rates which in turn reduces corporate borrowing to fund share buybacks."
2021-04-06 19:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Bear thesis: The Fed isn't printing money, they're performing security swaps (it's a 0 sum transaction). In fact, the bond market is being massively shorted and the Fed is trying to pop the bubble with their QE. When the bubble pops, the repo markets will get locked up, due to illiquidity, so investors will be selling off gold, then stonks.

How do I know? Gold has been tanking a shit all this year, repo markets have seen negative overnight rates (super illiquid) and more hedge funds are going to get massively deleveraged. Will it be this year? Likely, considering the new regulations the DTCC and NSCC are putting in place to stop naked shorting.

Will SPY hit 500? Maybe, this market is still pretty hopped up on leverage and hopium."
2021-04-06 18:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Any chance we can give SPY some $METH? If this is what SPY looks like on $COKE, I would be intrigued by what it could do on $METH."

Yeah you might suck up a tapioca ball straight into your air passage and spend the next 2 minutes in hell... but damn, that tea is amazing. You go back in. And when you do get that bubble when you are ready for it, well thats a different story."

2021-04-06 19:56:43,wallstreetbets,I agree with you that we are seeing inflation in the stock market. But I also think GME will put an end to this.
2021-04-06 19:07:09,wallstreetbets,Fuck this bubble market. I keep selling SPX call spreads and barely get out with profits most times cos this market is fake and 🌈

Not sure what the best play is in that case."
2021-04-06 17:49:04,wallstreetbets,A completely valid concern. Counterpoint ;  Why would other countries voluntarily become less competitive so the US can gain a competitive advantage? I doubt other countries would follow suit with a global tax rate.
2021-04-06 18:49:31,wallstreetbets,Also dont forget that the corporate tax rate was higher than 27% prior to 2017 tax cuts and the market boomed during Obama's tenure.
2021-04-06 19:05:39,wallstreetbets,you know they'll try to force that tax hike bill to be retroactive aka counting in the year 2021.
2021-04-06 19:02:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree that the 100 point jumps are not meaningful to compare, I was more just using that as a way to get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the thesis.

I'm not looking for anything regarding a catalyst, as this play just revolves around simple economics. Asset inflation has already started to, and is gonna continue to go fucking bananas. Not to mention, all the printed money has to go somewhere. *Everything* is set to go up this year, and this is by far the easiest, safest way to capitalize on it all while making a fat bag in the process."

2021-04-06 17:56:58,wallstreetbets,The EU has been pushing for this for years. EU + U.S. would make 90% of civilised world. And you will not move your assets to China or Russia just to save 10% of your taxes

2021-04-06 17:34:08,wallstreetbets,Ironically it dropped an hour before they published that.
2021-04-06 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,If you didn’t this morning probably not a good move.
2021-04-06 18:59:40,wallstreetbets,Just a thing; what it portends depends on your strategy. I feel good about a squeeze with the imbalance in options and criminally high SI.

2021-04-06 18:11:08,wallstreetbets,"My guess is there will be consolidation for the next 2-4 days around the 30.50-32 range, IV will deflate, and then see it hit 35-37 before 4/16. I could be completely wrong, but after today and the momentum halt, I can see this actually being a great play for options plays to get back in at a decent price as IV shot up significantly."
2021-04-06 17:59:54,wallstreetbets,Same lol. AH already up a bit. So should be good.

2021-04-06 18:15:56,wallstreetbets,"What’s bizarre to me is half the volume took it to a new ATH and then a loss, then half the volume was pinned at $31 in a very engineered way. How does that happen when it’s trading at twice its usual volume?"
2021-04-06 18:03:06,wallstreetbets,I’ve been burned one too many times by options... but I yolo’d on a gut feeling 😅
2021-04-06 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,"My guess is shorting/put volume also increased during that time. I’ll have to take a look at the options volume. I noticed that yesterday too, massive put volume throughout the day."
2021-04-06 18:04:23,wallstreetbets,"I bet on this doing my own DD. All my gut feeling gambles minus GME have been meh at the best, but all my DD plays have printed and printed well."

2021-04-06 18:08:30,wallstreetbets,And don’t rely on others’ bullish DD. Play devil’s advocate and try to pick it apart. I learned that the hard way on RIDE. Luckily that was just shares and only lost like $80 lol.

2021-04-06 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,"The sec has done a surprising amount of work for retail, they just work pretty slow at improving the way of things.. and they lag a bit behind financial trends. 

Just last month, the SEC fined several individuals at AT&T for tipping off wallstreet analysts about AT&T’s revenues.. 

For people who want to participate in proxy voting (eg you own GME shares and want to be an active shareholder) the Sec cleaned up the proxy guidelines so that your average shareholder can understand how to go about submitting proxy proposals, as well as what other rights they have as a shareholder.

Still much more work is to be done. I’d imagine it’s a lot of trouble trying to balance so many competing interests.. but it seems like as of late retail has become more competitive

Edit: changed “ape” to “your average shareholder”, because apes can’t read, as far as we know."

2021-04-06 17:00:50,wallstreetbets,"PS: Sole-source means that instead of following standart procedure and allowing different companies to submit their offers, the government agency decided that Palantir is the only company that can fulfill their requirments. ( this happens often with Palantir).

It looks like Palantir have time to answer the government's request till April 10 and probably by that time we should know the contract's worth.

I am by no means an expert when it comes to U.S Government contract awards, so feel free to correct me.

Palantir just trecently won a contract with the National Nuclear Security Administration and it looks like they won another one in the same sphere, but this time with the Air Force Nuclear Weapon Center. Americans, how many  government agencies do you have ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) ?"

For example- the US Air Force has agencies that handle stuff outside the normal war fighting scope

I know the US DoD on the first link just divided into the major service branches but there are also many agencies directly under the DoD Umbrella as civilian agencies.

2021-04-06 18:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the type of contract, but normally even with a sole source contract the government is required to post  for a period of time in case there is a company that can also do the work and wants to submit a bid or challenge. That said the government has perfected how to get the company they want. It’s all in stating the requirements in such a way only one company qualifies. Contracting will push back to loosen the requirements to make it more competitive but it’s not up to them. It’s up to who is writing the requirements"

I still don't know how to do TA. Well I DO observe patterns but I just go by RH chart. TA as in drawing them lines on trading view and shit. Basically I do the lazy version of what people do.

What I usually observe is typical intraday patterns and I kinda record them into a playbook journal. 

Like for example
Trading Day April 6:
TSLA opened and immediately dipped to $682 at 9:50 am est, followed by a rip to $691 at 10:10 am est

2021-04-06 16:44:43,wallstreetbets,"What essentially is the point of rolling an option I've been asking this question for years.

You're basically closing and simultaneously opening a position further out of the money at a further out strike generally but either way you're still going to pay a premium for that IV having skyrocketed.

I mean what's the difference between just closing the call and buying one"
2021-04-06 16:48:40,wallstreetbets,What you gonna do with all that money
2021-04-06 17:01:24,wallstreetbets,I'm a complete noob but why would he have made money on the 420 call if gme didn't hit that price? I'm assuming other variables and the fact that it shot up that day?

2021-04-06 17:11:01,wallstreetbets,I think that guy is still DFV to be honest.
2021-04-06 17:34:38,wallstreetbets,What would you yolo on?
2021-04-06 17:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Keeps the show going. 

Ideally, if the option is rolled at the right time, the buyer can kill 2 birds with 1 stone: pocket profits plus continue to ride GME on the way up with a lower entry cost. Of course, it’s a gamble but this is wsb & the way.

Edit: The rolled OTM options should yield a massive return as the buyer is able to purchase much more contracts.

Edit: You can also roll options into shares when they become ITM aka exercising"
2021-04-06 17:34:13,wallstreetbets,"I actually didn’t “roll” these, just used that term. Sold and bought the $420s a few days later I think. Tbh I’m also not sure what rolling actually is. Should prob look into it though"
2021-04-06 17:00:45,wallstreetbets,"Don’t think there’s any difference, besides maybe tax implications? idk I’m an idiot"
2021-04-06 19:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Ever play roulette?

Rolling an option is keeping some left to continue betting. Say you put 100 on red, and win, now you have 200. You leave 100 on red and take 100 home. that's equivalent to rolling.

Rolling into farther OTM options is more like putting $50 into a 1/3 or 1/4th quadrant. you pocket 150 but put the remaining 50 in a risky play.

finally, the amount doesn't really imply anything for the term 'rolling'. you can roll into even riskier shit, like just taking the entire 200 and putting it all on green 00. (that's how the super lucky people on wsb make their gains. keep rolling with the entire winnings)"
2021-04-06 17:02:01,wallstreetbets,what happens during the time when you've closed a position and before you open the next position?
2021-04-06 17:00:52,wallstreetbets,Theta decay

2021-04-06 17:36:51,wallstreetbets,"The stock continued to rise after I bought the options, suggesting that it could potentially reach $420, making the option worth more, even though it may never get there. The chance of it going ITM increased, so value increased. I almost never hold options till expiry"
2021-04-06 17:27:32,wallstreetbets,Same question.
2021-04-06 17:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Had GameStop shares at $70 during the initial run up, sold around $230. Sat on the sidelines for a while. Stock dropped to 40. Saw DFV doubled down. That was the signal for me to buy. Didn’t expect anything to happen really, got very lucky."
2021-04-06 16:52:12,wallstreetbets,Or lost it
2021-04-06 17:05:07,wallstreetbets,If you want 90k you could always take 2.6mm and inverse what this guy did.

2021-04-06 17:21:58,wallstreetbets,Thinkorswim
2021-04-06 17:01:30,wallstreetbets,It’s options. You either sell for a profit or hold until it’s worthless

2021-04-06 18:16:01,wallstreetbets,"I still remember the day the market truly violated my asshole. Was like last March or April. 

I had my entire Yolo portfolio in FD spy puts. Like, a lot of fucking money. $40k or so.


Futures opened and immediately fell off a cliff. Absolute insanity. This was well after the COVID drop, and during the recovery, so it wasn't expected. It was nuts. 

At the time, a limit down was -5%.

The indexes just kept dropping and dropping, and around 2am, we were actually about to limit down. I had already accepted that I was rich, as these were OTM FD puts, and if we opened at -5%, that $40k was gonna become like $500k, at least. Maybe more like a mil. I was sitting there looking at cars and houses and shit on the internet. 

So we're about to limit down, I'm sitting there watching and losing my shit. And just as it's about to limit down, the indexes bounced off of like -4.92%

And they fucking went green by open.

They fucking went green and I lost like $20k.

I know ""green by open"" is a meme, but it was legitimately the craziest thing I've ever seen, it made absolutely no sense, there was no catalyst for what happened. And, I learned that day that the market will always find new and innovative ways to rip your heart out and fuck you deep in the grunthole.

I'll legit never forget that day. It sucked a whole bag of dicks. You guys remember that shit?"

Clearly for whatever reason it’s shown the ability when there’s momentum behind it to skyrocket, with catalysts like the merger, Chuck Schumer pushing the federal legalization “with or without Biden” and other senators stating the same, the SAFE act with banking institutions why are most price targets still in the 20-30 range?

1. Enter their login credentials, including authentication codes **or** 
2. Download fake files—like a tax Form 1099—that may contain malware 

There tends to be an increase in these types of emails around tax season, so we ask that you be extra careful about how you access your Robinhood account. **How you can keep your account safe:**

1. **Only download the Robinhood app** from Google Play or the Apple App Store.
2. **Navigate directly to the app or Robinhood.‌com** to access your account and download your tax forms.

If you’re concerned about your account’s security, you can: 

* Manually remove any devices you don’t recognize from your mobile app: **Account** \> **Settings** \> **Your Devices**
* Reset your password to a strong and unique password that you’ll only use for your Robinhood account 
* Enable Two Factor Authentication on your account: **Account** \> **Settings** \> **Two-Factor Authentication**

2021-04-06 16:23:35,wallstreetbets,"Theta will eat your option position no matter what, taking off about 3 or 4% per day. That's just how it works; even buying super far leaps like December calls would result in your profits getting eaten by the theta demon.

That said, I'm feeling pretty confident about today. $31 price floor was crazy strong while trading was at above average volume. I think the worst case scenario is that ASO barely rejects $35 and trades sideways in the $32-$35 range which, while not great, is hardly bad.

Remember that your option doesn't need to be ITM to be profitable: if your risk management is giving you a bad feeling, there's no shame in selling the contracts above your cost basis. No one went broke taking profits."

People have been calling the tops on the market every single day since the dawn of time.

2021-04-06 19:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Na, you're not right tbh. Coding I think is actually one of the best at correctly assessing an employees skills. Like how do determine if someones a good manager or not if that's their thing? You can look at their past teams or whatever but there are so many moving variables. With coding, you either know how to do it or you don't. And you definitely don't need a cs degree I know plenty of people who have said they give extra consideration to self-taught applications because that requires an extra level of dedication and time management. At the end of the day though good coders are in demand and you will be hired if you are good enough at it."

2021-04-06 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,"I thought the key driver of gamma squeeze is high open interest on call options —> market makers holding the other side of the trade have to hedge by buying shares —> price goes up —> mms have to buy more shares, etc. Sure, traders who are short naked calls could contribute to the squeeze but I don’t think it’s the main factor.

[edit] to expand on this idea, since gamma squeeze essentially increases demand of a limited supply of shares, the # of shares outstanding becomes important. Insider ownership of rkt is huge, the public float is ~100 million but shares outstanding is actually 2B! That’s why the volume is so high (avg 15 million). I’m not sure about the details about how / when insider shares can become public float but the general idea is that higher shares outstanding makes a stock harder to squeeze, all else equal. ASO on the other hand has a 30 million public float and only 90m total shares outstanding! So, the threshold for gamma squeeze is lower and hence the chances are higher for a massive squeeze. Open interest on ASO options have exploded over the past week. Additionally the exchange listed new 45 strike calls today. The 30+% short interest is just additional fuel."
2021-04-06 15:57:35,wallstreetbets,"If you showed ASO to any investor without mentioning the SI or the potential for a squeeze of any kind, it's still a very attractive investment.  

Not sure why this stock has so much SI if its fundamentals are as strong as they are."
2021-04-06 16:22:10,wallstreetbets,So its time to buy rkt again?
2021-04-06 15:35:06,wallstreetbets,U guys need to load rkt before earnings I’m telling you. Anywhere from may 5 to 27th.
2021-04-06 15:39:26,wallstreetbets,So if you're already in for option exp. 4/16 you should take the loss and sell because by tomorrow IV or whatever as drops?

They only have to buy shares if they are selling naked calls. OP’s theory is that most of RKT’s open interest was naked which lead to a gamma squeeze (i.e. they were buying shares to cover their calls). 

Now the situation with ASO is slightly different so OP is asking the question “what if all the open interest on ASO calls aren’t naked like RKT but already covered?” 

In other words, if the calls were already covered when they were sold, they wouldn’t need to buy any shares."

2021-04-06 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,"I get what you’re saying. My understanding is Market makers hedge based on delta and hence will never be 100% covered unless the option goes deep in the money. So, as the stock goes up, call delta goes up and mms have to buy more shares."
2021-04-06 17:20:56,wallstreetbets,They literally just paid off 50% of their debt in Q4. I swear people just comment around here without doing even a little bit of DD.

2021-04-06 18:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Market makers hedge based on some combination of delta / gamma (since low delta with high gamma should theoretically result in more shares hedged vs low delta with low gamma). MM won’t just sit on 100 shares per called sold, delta hedging requires constantly monitoring the underlying / option greeks and making changes as they change. If they sit on 100 shares at all points I don’t think MM would achieve the delta neutrality they are seeking, so its a good bet that increased share prices resulting in higher delta and gamma and thus more shares bought to remain delta neutral (assuming most MM delta hedge thru shares)"

total assets going from $4.33B to $4.38, total liabilities going from $3.34B to $3.27B

I didn't dig deeper but seems that while they paid off some of their debt, their overall equity didn't really increase"
2021-04-06 18:18:24,wallstreetbets,"They paid down the loan facility but there is a DTL of $139 (new in 2020) and AP is up $363. The increase in AP makes the debt payoff a bit of a wash and, admittedly, I see no reason for why it’s higher (inventory is down). If I had to guess, they likely wanted to show more cash at yearend and not draw on the line.

I’m interested to see how the BS shakes out in Q1. I do believe that the pay down of the debt will provide bigger returns in the long run. The debt will cost them interest while AP doesn’t."

I have seen stupid amounts of information that points to a fatass squeeze happening, but I’ve only seen people say “oh the squeeze isn’t gonna happen” and then give no reason why. 

It also seems like a lot of people who say it won’t squeeze have accounts that were made around 60 days ago, which is when wsb exploded with new users, so it seems like people saying it won’t squeeze are just normal people who know nothing about the stock market bought in the hype, and just have given up hope so now they just spread FUD."

Both these company's have an illuminatingly bright future 2023/2024 and beyond. Regarding BB,  Chen has explicitly stated in the recent earnings report conference call, that the subject net proceeds from the patent sale and licensing will be re-invested in future company R&D. Fuck Yes!!

Literally 60-65% of my paychecks are going to these investments. I would go all-in, but I got to pay rent for my GF and her boyfriend. When I get my YE bonus, I will be doing a max contribution within my Roth IRA, split 50/50 between BB and PLTR."

2021-04-06 17:02:18,wallstreetbets,"I dislike patents, it limits software/hardware development in unusual ways.

Looked into the FB/BB lawsuit:  
The patents included “Previewing a new event on a small screen device (US patent number 8,209,634); “Handheld electronic device and associated method providing time data in a messaging environment” (8,301,713); “System and method for switching between an instant messaging conversation and a game in progress” (8,677,250); and “System and method for silencing notifications for a message threat” (9,349,120).

All those things are quite normal nowadays.

So yeah, if they get rid of their patents to a company that isn't being rude with them (or hell, sell them to a foundation and let them retract the patents), thats a great bullish sign, because the entire industry improves. Frees up spending money on lawyers, great for margins."

I admittedly haven’t researched this much to answer those questions but I’m just basing it off one of the first things you said. If the 250 million yearly revenue is based off all those patents or a large portion of them and we don’t know what patents they’re even selling, this could potentially shatter expectations in a negative way when they report a number no where close to where people are speculating—I worry people are getting their hopes too high when they talk billions, but I would love to he proven wrong."

2021-04-06 15:04:01,wallstreetbets,Fingers crossed my friend 🤞🏾 it took much longer than expected to structure my notes so hopefully could help/inform fellow WSBers out here

2021-04-06 19:29:34,wallstreetbets,"TCL is out of the BB phone game, now it's up to [OnwardMobility](https://www.onwardmobility.com/) to release some good BB phones. Hopefully by YE 2021 or early 2022 we see some models released in the USA and Canada. 

I am no longer a fan of the keyboard phones, though I understand the appeal. Personally, I would be happy upgrade to a newer version of an [Evolve X](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/npkAAOSwRbddYoJQ/s-l600.jpg) styled device."
2021-04-06 16:31:17,wallstreetbets,I see people posting crazy gains and always say man why can’t I catch an early seat on the rocket.   I think (and hope) BB will be the one.
2021-04-06 16:16:29,wallstreetbets,amen
2021-04-06 17:13:45,wallstreetbets,You welcome sir.
2021-04-06 17:03:18,wallstreetbets,Exactly this.
2021-04-06 16:00:18,wallstreetbets,That's not a Wendy's menu?
2021-04-06 19:44:33,wallstreetbets,That’s interesting thank you. Don’t hesitate to elaborate if you spot something.
2021-04-06 18:41:03,wallstreetbets,I can see FB buying this shit and suing the fuck out of smaller businesses to establish their monopoly even further.
2021-04-06 19:16:36,wallstreetbets,"    All those things are quite normal nowadays.

Who the fuck do you think developed the FIRST REAL SMART PHONE?

BB's patent portfolio is JUCY and MASSIVE."
2021-04-06 15:05:50,wallstreetbets,"I did DCF only on the patents portfolio to estimate the price of the sale. And thank you for sharing your research, will look into it."
2021-04-06 16:30:29,wallstreetbets,What do you think will happen to the share price once the sale is “revealed”?
2021-04-06 19:55:57,wallstreetbets,They will soon announce a top executive joining them from a legacy OEM (so that’s more related to QNX and IVY).
2021-04-06 17:21:06,wallstreetbets,"Unable to answer this as future cash flows from QNX and IVY are too unknown. 

Plus they are boosting their marketing and story telling.

Plus if/when the transaction is confirmed the price action has the potential to be wild."
2021-04-06 16:56:05,wallstreetbets,They are only selling IP not relevant to their current products I.e. mobile stuff that’s not netw. like the patent linked today
2021-04-06 16:36:17,wallstreetbets,But did you read in full? Because I’ve addressed this point in the OP.
2021-04-06 19:23:02,wallstreetbets,"Sir you work at a Wendy's. 
They already sold a bunch of patents this isn't some new thing.  They've been redesigning for a long time."
2021-04-06 16:36:26,wallstreetbets,How does this sound bad in the long run? They’re selling patents for a business they are no longer really apart of and they’ll be paid handsomely for it and that’s unlocked capital to improve and grow their new business ventures.
2021-04-06 15:53:29,wallstreetbets,You know that as soon as you sell it is gonna rocket up
2021-04-06 16:13:36,wallstreetbets,Respectfully disagree but this will be a long term play imho
2021-04-06 16:25:37,wallstreetbets,Please sell so this shit can finally moon

2021-04-06 17:40:34,wallstreetbets,Sold that many at $21
2021-04-06 19:25:12,wallstreetbets,A fractional BB share?
2021-04-06 17:38:21,wallstreetbets,"Marketing?  Are you joking lol.  BB's marketing team is absolute trash, there's a reason why their socials have terrible engagement when compared to their amount of followers.  FFS, when they had the webinar with AWS no one even talked about it or cared to ask about what went down.  

I have leaps on BB but this shit won't be printing anytime soon"
2021-04-06 19:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Fortunately, both BB and PLTR aren’t investing in shitty Mortgage Backed Securities and Collateralized Debt Obligations. 

But I understand your sentiment. I’m 30, so I will be able to financially recover if these investments backfire. No kids, not married and zero debt. I’ve assessed the pros and cons and reflected on my personal risk tolerance. Point being, I am more than comfortable to continue increasing my positions in both."
2021-04-06 19:47:29,wallstreetbets,"In the short term I think it’s a great sale. This admin has already proven to not care about patent trolls or the abused California tech circuit. Until that changes, this is a sellers market."
2021-04-06 19:32:16,wallstreetbets,"Except IIRC, BB reserves the right to use those patents as part of the sale.

So theoretically, any of those ""commonplace"" features, if Facebook goes on a lawsuit spree, become a feature of BB, FB, and anyone who pays FB the money they want"
2021-04-06 15:18:23,wallstreetbets,"But there could be a problem with that because if the rest of the business is destroying shareholder value then the estimated price will be lower than what you got.  


Anyway I'm just thinking a loud, good DD. Thanks"
2021-04-06 16:31:01,wallstreetbets,Odds of approving vs stalling will be revealed.
2021-04-06 16:54:47,wallstreetbets,"The part where you said they could potentially only be selling 75% of that side business? Is there any claims to that number? It just sounds like complete speculation and wishful thinking.

Again, I would love for it to be true, but at this point it seems like speculation, unless I’m missing something."
2021-04-06 19:33:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for making my point for me. They peaked in 2011 and their revenue has gone down by **95%** since then. 

This is the cadaveric spasms of a company that doesn't know they're already dead."
2021-04-06 16:47:40,wallstreetbets,"economicly I'm very against selling mrr for 7 months, I usually look ahead and unless you have something to invest in that is going to the moon, keeping your mrr is better because it feeding your dream slowly for 7 months and keeping that mrr is better."
2021-04-06 18:02:37,wallstreetbets,How many Maple Pesos would that be?
2021-04-06 17:14:08,wallstreetbets,Laughs back in federal protectionism laws.
2021-04-06 19:12:21,wallstreetbets,Okay?
2021-04-06 17:43:36,wallstreetbets,"hence >>> “we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing” 

*work in progress*"
2021-04-06 15:21:02,wallstreetbets,"Could you please elaborate?

If it impairs shareholder value then the seller should ask for an higher price?"
2021-04-06 17:01:11,wallstreetbets,"CEO said “it’s a major portion of our portfolio”

then I tweaked numbers to give you a range. Other analysts have said $1bn as well (RBC Capital for instance). 

That’s the name of the game: trying to get as close as possible to the future numbers."
2021-04-06 19:17:39,wallstreetbets,Alright?
2021-04-06 15:23:32,wallstreetbets,"You have estimated the cash flows for only a portion of their business right? I.e the patents part.

So what happens if the other portion of the business is really bad. It will reduce future cash flows because their WACC will be higher than their ROIC.

It's like cherry picking the best parts of a business to estimate it, however we should estimate the entire business as a whole when doing a DCF because as shareholders we are buying the entire business"
2021-04-06 17:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok, I guess I missed the “major portion of our portfolio” part for whatever reason. This would be wonderful if it goes through for around a billion. Let’s hope it does 😬😬"
2021-04-06 19:19:42,wallstreetbets,Fine?
2021-04-06 16:06:56,wallstreetbets,"I will have to disagree at this point. First I didn't really estimate the future cash flows, I took the numbers that CEO has just confirmed for that precise activity (Licensing Revenue) - we could argue as it's forward-looking even his numbers are just forecasts.

That said you can do a DCF on absolutely anything as long as you have future cash flows and a discount rate. You can even DCF a small business project to see whether it's profitable to pursue within a bigger company.

Again the point was to estimate the present value of that portfolio and not the entire company. Besides doing a DCF on the whole company would be at best speculative because at this point you have no idea how much cash IVY would generate in 2023 and beyond."
2021-04-06 16:02:36,wallstreetbets,Yes but it's a good idea to be able to split out the core and non core functions of the business yes we should.dcf the whole business but this shows this is great value for shareholders
2021-04-06 16:34:50,wallstreetbets,"So basically BB’s business model is like my portfolio and will break even, got it."

Their net income was up 16.18% to 2.1 billion.   It'll show up mathematically, but they'll just use it as justification to fuck their other producers.   Given that they are one of only like 4 large packing companies, and the courts have refused to view them as a risk of monopoly, Tyson is going nowhere but up."

2021-04-06 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes exactly, they were flooded with those ambulance chaser press releases that come out every time a stock goes down lol but it was suuuuper aggressive. 

The claims in the short report were all random anonymous statements from ex employees with no actual numbers or data just saying they had to do high pressure sales and didn’t get return customers etc yet their 4Q sales smashed. They did give guidance that Q1 would be weak this year with chip shortage and because many of the contracts will deliver in Q3 and 4, and with a marketing background I consider that smart undersell overdeliver on their end which will benefit their investors, but some people didn’t like that they wanted flash and glitz. No loss of contracts or customers though. UBS stadium under construction now where they will be putting 1000 charging stations. Curbtender contract to convert garbage truck fleets. Good things to come with them"
2021-04-06 16:25:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I know. I want a screener that produces ideas to follow-up on. Merrill has one to get a list of everything that did an X% move in the last month, would love to have a tool that wasn't as janky as theirs"
2021-04-06 17:05:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.

This is the DD I referenced above: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9zf3x/ev_industry_a_spac_fueled_fraud_filled_bubble/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share ..

.. it does not mention XL, and I was probably remembering a different company.

I do recall watching a YouTube video around the same time of some company who's CEO came out multiple times stating that they had ""pre sold"" vehicles or ""had orders"" and then it turned out it was all lies. Maybe I'm thinking Nikola .. idk :/ I feel like it was a lesser known name though.

EDIT: I think it was $RIDE, now that I Google Steve Burns .. looks familiar."
2021-04-06 17:03:18,wallstreetbets,"There was actually a really good DD a month or two ago here on XL that must have taken a lot of effort lol, I’m too lazy to do that but yeah I have been following them a bit and one of my fave EV plays."
2021-04-06 16:30:27,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean by ""ideas to follow up on""? A screener will return stocks according to the criteria that you give it. The stocks that is provides ARE the ideas to follow up on, if that makes sense. Or am I not understanding you?"
2021-04-06 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Ahh ok I hadn’t seen this one. It’s definitely good to come in skeptical on any start-ups but every SPAC merger is different. The main thing that caught my attention with XL at first was the age of the company prior to merger and existing production and contracts. I am weary of companies that only produce drawings of ideas lol. 

But not being profitable yet and how much is mass produced etc requires deeper dive into each company. For XL they are almost at break even and probably profitable in 2 years at this rate which is fantastic. I am also keeping an eye on Canoo (GOEV) but yes not proven quite yet so I’m not in yet.

But in general the cries of post SPAC companies being scams just because they started as spacs is as extreme as dumping money into unproven premerger spacs, two sides of the same coin. But also I don’t know anything. XL to moon etc etc"
2021-04-06 18:29:02,wallstreetbets,"I think we're misunderstanding each other. I want a screener that can get me like, ""these stocks have had a huge drop in the last couple of weeks,"" without needing to manually check the charts. From there I'd of course want to do more research"
2021-04-06 18:39:13,wallstreetbets,"Most stock screeners should be able to be configured for something to that effect. 

Set % move and timeframe, and I usually like to filter out a price range (I can't justify buying stocks that are like $4000 each, but probably don't want anything that's 0.0001), I also usually filter volume or $ volume (don't want anything that trades like 100 shares a day, not liquid enough, but something that trades 200Bn shares a day probably has too many shares to move easily between price levels). 

The tradingview stock screener is pretty good."
2021-04-06 18:41:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh, ok, I get it now. Can I ask why you don't just look at a chart? It takes the same amount of time to open a chart as it does a screener, and a chart has all the ups and downs of the price action for however long a period that you want to look at. I can think of a few ways in which this would be better than just running a screener.

Anyway, you might have these already (I don't have any that screen for ""stocks that have had a huge drop in the last couple of weeks""), but here are a couple that I use:

https://finviz.com/ (really interesting front page with a lot of different signals)

https://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/SC.scan (scans of various technical indicators)"

2021-04-06 17:29:36,wallstreetbets,"EU deal - likely w more favorable terms once they receive UK approval - is still another major catalyst on the horizon. There’s no way the EU fuckheads can remain so pompous once nvax is approved given the shitstorm their countries are in. 

SAEs for AZN & almost certainly J&J (both adenovirals) means they will not be factors in the future booster market. 

Nvax will sell every dose they make in 2021 & will very likely be the annual booster leader post 2021. The market has not adequately priced that in

2021-04-06 15:20:06,wallstreetbets,That tells you all you need to know about what Mr Market really thinks of this company despite the continued hammering down of the price. Options are tricky with this company because they stay tight lipped and often miss timing and targets. The crossover initiations is probably the best indicator of timing any of us longs have been granted since they got in the covid game. I would say 2-4 weeks before UK approval which is the biggest catalyst on deck that will send it.

But again...sample size of 1 relative to the actual phase 3 trial of n=30k. Data from that is much more important than the one person I know =)

Was mostly just commenting for fun, (and because it's secretly a little gratifying they got it after rubbing it in all of our friends' faces about being vaccinated months ago and then taking trips to Tulum every weekend), don't make an investment decision off that. Much more to NVAX than the C19 vax anyhow."

You should only sell at a loss if you think GME will never go back up. I say never, because since they aren't going out of business you have the option of holding a longer time and waiting for it to rise up with time. With the changes, it seems GME has room for natural growth. 

Just look up what ""wash sales"" are. Basically, if you sell at a loss but then buy back in it has tax implications. Are you done with GME forever? Do you think it will never rise to that level? 

Make your own decisions based on your own risk tolerance. I for myself and not financial advice wouldn't make that loss permanent unless you were sure GME is done, and that you are done with GME, because the tax implications from that loss changes if you buy back in."

2021-04-06 16:55:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m 99% sure I’ve read that you can postpone / avoid short term capital gains by reinvesting your profits into the market and/or similar investements. Then just hold those investments for a year in a bunch of stable ETFs and/or stocks that pay out solid dividends. 
Get enough tendies and you can invest in a way so that you avoid the short term capital gains tax and also get paid out in dividends worth thousands while you let that year long (366 days) count down happen to qualify for long term capital gains.

TLDR:
MAKE TENDIES WHILE YOU SAVE AND KEEP TENDIES.

The biggest capital gains loophole is provided after you die, the ""step-up"" provision allows your heirs to avoid paying capital gains tax that you would be liable for had you sold the stock while you were alive, stepping up the cost basis to your date of death (or shortly thereafter). The step up provision does not avoid liability for any estate or inheritance tax that may be owed however, for example if you live in new york and you inherit $40,000,000 from your fourth cousin, your going to owe a cargoship load of estate and inheritance taxes which are no laughing matter for so called ""laughing heirs""."

2021-04-06 17:25:31,wallstreetbets,"Wash sales are the bane of the neophyte day traders, there have been instances of noobs racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of capital gains liability on actualized net gains of nominal amounts due to wash sales. Its even possible to have a net annual loss, but still owe massive amounts of tax liability due to wash sales.   
TLDR, if your planning on trading more often than your sleepy retired grandpa, learn the wash sale rule and don't let Uncle Sam ""wash"" your net worth into bankruptcy."

2021-04-06 18:40:01,wallstreetbets,"It's so you don't ""re-buy"" the shares right before selling them. If you fully close the position and don't buy for 30 days the losses get realized.

For example, you buy 10 shares at $100. The shares fall to $50 each. You buy 10 shares at $50 each, then sell 10 shares at $50 each. In that scenario your losses aren't realized when you sell the 10 shares, there is a wash sale so the cost basis carries forward to the 10 shares you kept.

This subreddit seems to have just found out about wash sales and is freaking out. You don't actually lose the taxable loss, it just moves forward to the new shares. The big oof is if you push losses from December into January and then they move to a different tax year."

2021-04-06 15:07:21,wallstreetbets,"These Canadian companies are up a lot since the U.S. election with little fundamental change in their business outlook. The next ER for apha is pretty safe, though. No way they're going to rock the boat with inventory impairments or goodwill write downs, so there' isn't much chance of anything disastrous that could come out. Even if there is baggage, Tilray knows about it and accepts it because they know Aphria brings way more to the combination than Tilray does. 

Aphria's biggest question mark is inventory. They bloated up to $320mC from just $70m in like one year. Those increase go directly into the bottom line through cgs. That stopped in the October ending quarter, though, which gave the stock a good fundamental catalyst to augment the U.S. opening meme. Nevertheless, as a company you have to either commit to FIFOing your way through the stockpile or writing off the aging inventory. Remember that Aphria's last audit was qualified--based on the auditor not being willing to sign off on goodwill and inventory. And that was after they down listed from NYSE to Nasdaq just a couple months before they had to post audited fins (imho to get an easier audit). 

I still think Aphria is FIFOing through and hopes to actually sell that $320m, but when you have more than a year in inventory, you'll be putting some old, dry, dusty stuff out there and risk alienating your customers. 

It's also possible that I'm totally wrong and they'll come totally clean to avoid bringing baggage to the merger. I just don't think so. 

P.S. Whenever you read someone's DD post and it's about nothing but gross revenue, step back and slowly walk away."

Pretty much all legal supply is dry dusty stuff, but it's at least tested and can be rehydrated easily.

2021-04-06 18:34:04,wallstreetbets,No the only thing you’d lose if they don’t hit your break even price is your initial $250. Your max loss is always the price of the options and mad return is technically infinite. They would need to hit $20.60 a share by 4/16 in order for you to make money at expiration.
2021-04-06 19:10:11,wallstreetbets,Max loss for buying options is what you spend
2021-04-06 18:52:45,wallstreetbets,"Not even close. 

Max loss is $250. You can’t lose more than what you pay up front. Break even price is strike + price per contract, so $21 + $0.50 = $21.50. 

If the price is under $21.50 and you let them expire, you lose $250. If you sell before expiration, you can shrink this loss. 

If the price is at or above $21.50 at expiration you can buy the stock for $21 per share. You don’t want to do this. You want to sell the contract before it expires. The difference between the current price and your strike price is built into the sell price so you will never make more money by exercising. 

If the price is above $21.50 before expiration, you can sell the contracts for a profit. The amount of profit depends on the price when you sell it plus some other stuff.

I have no idea where you got $10,000 from but you’re not going to make $10,000 from those calls unless something crazy happens. If you do this, make sure you scale out and take your profits. If the price goes above 25 or so, it’s not likely to stay there for long.

Edit: TOS says the price would have to hit $41 in the next 10 days for you to make $10,000. The price was $32 at its meme peak when no one could buy GME."

The cultural differences, population, along with wealth play a huge role in what is plausible when thinking about where this market will flourish . 90% of the 2019 and 2020 legal cannabis sales were in the US which is yet to be even half legalized. Other parts of the world 1) don't consume like we do in the US. 2) have the disposal income to spend on it. I mean the possibility of it becoming legal in Mexico doesn't mean much because it's citizens can't afford to buy it for much money. How much could you sell a  joint for in Mexico?? 10 to 20 pesos from what I read or 1 US dollar. Unless it was to a US tourist not much. 3) Have the population anywhere near the size of the US. Europe might come around and do well. Though that is many countries with individual governments far behind the US in progress to legalize. Other than that most Asian countries are very against legalization. Some have the death penalty for selling large quantities and years jail time for small offenses. The Middle East has a similar veiw. South America is similar to a Mexico situation where I don't imagine you could sell it for much. Africa?  Does anyone honesty think African countries will have big legal cannabis markets?? Basically the US (currently largest) , Europe (though that is many countries that have yet to legalize some will some won't) , Australia and Canada (small populations)."

Fucking idiot, there is more than the US in the World."

There will end up being many companies in the us like beer companies right .
I would want my company in as many countries as possible to take advantage of any early partnerships wouldn’t you ?"
2021-04-06 18:16:13,wallstreetbets,If I wrong correct me but emmac has a TWO acre grow capacity not sure how much land is allocated for more grow . Tilray has 88 acres not sure if they can expand .
2021-04-06 18:28:32,wallstreetbets,"congrats, pretty much $17.50 average or something. I think you will do well. I would check with your broker tho as you are gonna have some fractional shares unless you are gonna get an even 100."
2021-04-06 19:50:50,wallstreetbets," Sure, ""buy the dips"" is understandable.  
At what what point is ""average down"" just overexposure?  
Right now if the merger closed, you get 30-some cents per share... if you're trying to make up for $11 per share, you're talking buying thirty-some shares to ""break even"" PER SHARE.   
Without any guarantee that last-minute shenanigans don't go down.  
Pretty big gamble."
2021-04-06 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,"APHA and Tilray will continue to conduct business separate, just under the same umbrella. They compliment what the other doesn’t offer. Also, stockholders of APHA will receive 0.87 (check that, it may be 0.81) shares of Tilray once the merger happens to compensate. And that was taken directly from the SEC filings on the merger (that I remember. I can pull it up if I wasn’t so lazy.)"

2021-04-06 16:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Dude, if you read my response you would see I agree with there being a good opportunity in Europe. As far as Tilray,  they do not sell in the US market my dude. So to say they will be the leader in a market they don't currently sell in is a bit too speculative for most."
2021-04-06 17:09:01,wallstreetbets,By what metric? How can they lead a market (US) that they don't sell in?
2021-04-06 16:34:09,wallstreetbets,"That's fine Dude. Remain ignorant,  remain investing wrong. Good luck my dude."
2021-04-06 19:46:16,wallstreetbets,"The point I made was that the market will mainly be in the US and yes Europe eventually. The rest of the world will not come close to the sales out of either of those spaces. Currently, the US is far and away the leader. Europe eventually I think will be big. That said Europe is made up of a bunch of countries. Some will legalize,  others will not. Regardless,  Europe is far behind the US. Markets like Canada are so small in comparison. It's nice to sell where you can currently but 37 million people (Canada) can only buy so much. Plus Canada is a almost fully mature market with little growth ahead. The US is just getting started. There are 4 American MSO'S that are doing the same or more revenue than the largest 2 Canadian companies. Look up that 90% figure. 90% of the TAM is here where I am in the US and less than half of the states sell. To be a leader in the world market you have to sell here. Until Tilray does, I don't see how anyone can make an argument that they are a better buy than a large US MSO like CURLF."
2021-04-06 19:52:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure of the acreage but I know EMMAC is Europe's largest vertically integrated independent cannabis company. Also , EMMAC is only part of CURLF. Apples to apples you wouldn't compare all of Tilray to just some of CURLF being EMMAC. You would compare all of Tilray to all of CURLF which I bet is similar if not more than the 88 acres you quoted Tilray to be."

2021-04-06 15:53:57,wallstreetbets,Im long RKT but i think a gamma squeeze won't happen. The naked call sellers already had to cover during the gamma squeeze on mar 2nd. Now they are selling covered calls and lending out shares to lower their cost basis. I dont think there are many naked call sellers left and thus a gamma squeeze is unlikely
2021-04-06 17:56:56,wallstreetbets,Depending how long it stays like that it may not directly lose money but could be an opportunity cost.
2021-04-06 15:41:24,wallstreetbets,Just sell some deep ITM CC on UWMC. No worries

2021-04-06 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,"RKT is a thetagang all-star and has been for almost a year.  You could set your watch to it every week being between high 19's and low 22's.  Run the wheel all day long and just make easy money.  It didn't get screwy until WSB jumped on it and made it start doing weird things.  Now it's just getting back to where it was and where we are all comfortable wheeling it, and here we go again."
2021-04-06 16:59:50,wallstreetbets,"You are probably right. Impossible to know, but I suspect overall there is less appetite for naked positions now. Another possibility is people with bullish positions are closing them quicker on a squeeze so they can get out on the top rather then being on the losing side. Probably a bit of both which makes these type of events quicker and harder to play."

2021-04-06 19:00:45,wallstreetbets,Truth
2021-04-06 17:28:50,wallstreetbets,so theta was caught bagholding at those high prices that they were forced to buy at and now selling covered calls and lending out shares to collect pennies on the dollar.... which is exactly my point

2021-04-06 15:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Hello children gather around the campfire ~

It all started last year in February of 2020 right when the pandemic was really starting to batter the U.S.

I was playing some 5/5/15 PLO at my buddies game, when my friend who we all just call “milk man” began to open his stupid mouth about how “this and that” is going to send the price of sweet cream butter skyrocketing because of some bullshit about how grocery stores will be understocked and Martha will need a fuck ton of sweet cream butter to feed the family while everyone’s stuck at home. We all call him milk man because he’s literally a cow milker, has a big farm, and always wears this hat with a cow on it.

I use derogatory language when regarding milk man now, but then, his stack was tall and mine was short. I was tilted and also drunk when something in me clicked and said “this is it. butter futures is the yolo that will make me rich.” I was working a great job in finance at the time and had some capital to work with.

I listened to milk man go on and on about butter for the rest of the night. The next morning, Monday. I yolo’d into CME cash-settled butter futures expiring March 15th, 2020. Naive me at the time thought COVID would be over with within a couple of months.

Then it all went to fucking shit.

So supposedly I didn’t yolo into sweet cream butter futures but I just flat out yolod into butter futures. I honestly didn’t even know what the fuck I was doing but I just figured all butter was going up crazy so it didn’t matter. Well I was dead wrong.

These fucking worthless dairy farmers couldn’t keep up with the demand so they began to either put palm oil into the butter or the fed the cows too much palm oil to the point that it got into the butter. I’m still not sure what they did, but it doesn’t matter. Half of god damn Canada was complaining that their butter is rock solid at room temperature. How the fuck do you expect them to spread it on toast? It was a disaster. Butter tanked. I was ruined.

Fast forward a year later and looking back it’s all not so bad. I have a really steady job now and the pay is pretty good. The only downside is every time I’m milking cows on milk mans farm he says the same dumb joke every time.

“Make sure that’s sweet cream milk and not regular milk!”

Fucking dick. Sweet cream futures thrived. Up nearly 20% since February 2020."
2021-04-06 12:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Hahah same, cash settled butter futures are actually a thing though I looked it up"
2021-04-06 14:28:24,wallstreetbets,"No, this actually happened. I was going to write a DD on this, I think this guy picked up on my comment.

#Buttergate actually happened lol

Edit: this *is* the motherfucker. Good Job, OP. Doing the work of men over here. 👍"
2021-04-06 13:21:01,wallstreetbets,city folk just don't get it
2021-04-06 18:06:56,wallstreetbets,That's how I expected/wanted the story to end. I'm not sure if butter or gourds are better.
2021-04-06 14:22:36,wallstreetbets,Syracuse made the sweet 16 as an 11 seed if you need any more DD on orange futures.
2021-04-06 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,I can't believe it's not futures
2021-04-06 14:10:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah I could have ended the “my financial ruin” story there.
2021-04-06 13:21:46,wallstreetbets,"are there donut futures?   yum, donuts."

2021-04-06 14:51:51,wallstreetbets,Same shit happened with ABCL. How the fuck is this legal.
2021-04-06 14:02:25,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about opening a position but i think It Will dip again and It Will be worse than now.
2021-04-06 12:52:44,wallstreetbets,"Short volume = # of shares shorted in a given period. 8 million shares shorted yesterday


They could have closed by now, but it doesn’t look like it"
2021-04-06 12:59:25,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight is 20/20, but this stock has no business being where it was pre-FDA. FDA proved their tech is legit and the TAM for their tech is huge. Stock was way high prior to the short and way high off of less news"
2021-04-06 15:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't it be? they are literally just selling shares they borrowed 

They think the price is too high, if they are wrong they lose money. 

The ability to short is necessary otherwise people wouldn't be able to hedge and price discovery would be hindered"
2021-04-06 15:38:21,wallstreetbets,Remember to do the opposite from what you think 😂

2021-04-06 13:00:52,wallstreetbets,"The thing they got approved by the FDA was easy to get approved, the full product has not yet been approved, and at least according to muddy waters, it’s ability to serve it’s intended function is questionable.  They got LK right, and most of their plays have been right in the past.  It’s possible they’re wrong, but only time will tell."
2021-04-06 16:51:27,wallstreetbets,"I think the concern isn't shorting in general.  The concern is over a single entity being able to move the market.  

Price discovery can still be had without a single (or very small number) entity being able to set prices be moving huge volumes.

I agree that shorting is needed, but I disagree that a single fund/small number of funds working in concert should be able to wag the dog."
2021-04-06 15:40:54,wallstreetbets,"I got the feeling my man, Bought GSX Yesterday and sold today. Watchout for E-BON tomorrow! Didn't find other plays for now...  I Will wait for a dip near $40 for NNOX"
2021-04-06 14:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Could I ask you what you’re affinity for Muddy Waters is? Maybe I have a certain cognitive dissonance because of my bullishness for Nanox, but to me they appear to be using their influences to profit off their own shorts. They called this a complete scam and said no FDA approval and now that it is approved they continue to tweet about insider sales, which is common after a large pop and some of them were pre planned. Muddy Waters has been caught out delivering blatantly false  short reports multiple times. Maybe you have different experiences with Carson Block but he seems like a very shady character to me"
2021-04-06 13:20:20,wallstreetbets,Who gives an f what that idiot who soils the name of an all time great says
2021-04-06 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,If some good news come out there could be a short squeeze. Gotta risk it to get the biscuit 😅
2021-04-06 14:46:21,wallstreetbets,"I got caught holding the bag on LK, which was in fact a scam company, so given I’ve only encountered their correct plays I am a bit biased, and I believe they do good DD. But again, that is merely my belief, if you’ve done your own research and believe them to be wrong, or read their reports and found holes in them, then maybe I’m wrong for thinking they’re correct.  Just do be careful you don’t get caught holding the bag if you believe their research to be correct."
2021-04-06 14:51:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I am just a random user, I’m wrong a decent amount of the time so take my words for what they are, but do make sure you do your own research, and try to stay unbiased while you do.  MACD is above the signal line so it may trend upwards, though it appears to possibly be falling.  Good luck."

2021-04-06 15:19:53,wallstreetbets,"I have a question. I haven't invested in stocks before, but why buying gme now would harm the hedge funds? If you're buying a stock, someone is selling it to you. What stops the
Hedge funds from buying them back to reduce their interests? It has been a long time since the gme/wsb thing started, and the hedge funds could've easily made profit in other stocks and pay back their loans/interests for the shorted stocks, or but then back right? How us holding out buying them stocks today make these guys bleed? Am I missing something?"

2021-04-06 17:10:10,wallstreetbets,$88k is still moon territory depending on your initial investment. Like if you bought in back when GME was 10 or less? Yeah that's moon landing imo.

2021-04-06 17:28:32,wallstreetbets,Hype
2021-04-06 17:34:44,wallstreetbets,"Because GME is not affected by the market per-se but when he posts another YOLO update, i am betting the shares will jump again from hype alone"
2021-04-06 16:49:03,wallstreetbets,"In all likelihood he will exercise all or most of those calls. Forcing the seller to sell him 50,000 shares. So basically he's going to buy 50,000 shares on or before 4/16"
2021-04-06 16:53:38,wallstreetbets,"I think he means tripple his original 
Amount of stocks, including the double down and the exercising

DFV's definitely going to exercise those calls, but there's no signs he will triple what he currently has"
2021-04-06 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,He might as well because as we know he likes the stock long term. He’s made a very very very handsome profit and exercising his calls would cost him some $600k I believe. Chump change on the gains he’s had.
2021-04-06 17:41:03,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-04-06 17:25:59,wallstreetbets,Does he have to act on the 16th or can he hold those contracts into the future? I know we all expect him to exercise them but I imagine that if it isn’t necessary he will hold for a possibly better price

2021-04-06 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,He would lose money up until it was $214.13.
2021-04-06 16:09:16,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-06 17:38:26,wallstreetbets,He would actually lose $1705 if it doesn’t close over $200/share by 4/16. $1413 is the current value and it’s down $292 since he bought it.
2021-04-06 18:44:36,wallstreetbets,WHAT I LEARNED IN BOATING SCHOOL IS
2021-04-06 17:43:30,wallstreetbets,16 shares!!

2021-04-06 17:48:52,wallstreetbets,Negative
2021-04-06 15:59:27,wallstreetbets,I see your Swartz is as big as mine
2021-04-06 18:46:53,wallstreetbets,What day is it?
2021-04-06 18:12:54,wallstreetbets,"The 16th is when they expire.

He needs to sell them or exercise them before close of market 4/16 or they become entirely worthless and he loses millions of dollars."
2021-04-06 17:33:28,wallstreetbets,"They aren't exactly saying they will sell 3.5 million shares.
What they're actually saying is they want to raise 1 billion, but will not sell more than 3.5 million shares to do so.
Basically saying they reserve the right to sell any amount of shares to equal 1 billion $.
If I were them I'd wait for the share price to reach 1 million then sell 1000 shares. Boom.
Squeeze is gonna Squoze, just keep holding apes and make Daddy Cohen proud."
2021-04-06 18:15:36,wallstreetbets,"It wouldn’t matter to much either way.

50k shares can be eaten up in less than 5 minutes at current volumes and we’ve already seen several block buys larger than that in the past few weeks."
2021-04-06 18:54:16,wallstreetbets,"Dfv exercising his options and buying the additional shares will have no effect on the market price anyways. He's buying at a contracted price, from obligated sellers. 

Maybe a few of the writers still need to buy shares at the market to cover, but I'm sure by now the vast majority are prepared for the 16th."
2021-04-06 19:37:23,wallstreetbets,4/16....
2021-04-06 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Figured it out thank you fellow apes. For those here that may want to know it just means that you are now just responsible for buying the 100 shares ( assuming is just 1 put you sold ) remember your out of pocket responsibility is just the strike price x 100 shares minus the upfront premium you got from the person who purchased your put. 

This sounds like a great way to fling 🦍 shit at the shorts. But what do I know I’m just a smooth brained crayon eating ape. This isn’t financial advice!!"
2021-04-06 15:31:03,wallstreetbets,Ape angry. Ape need banana.
2021-04-06 14:41:24,wallstreetbets,Googling right now thanks for the help Ape so much for being in this together.
2021-04-06 16:37:46,wallstreetbets,Very helpful response
2021-04-06 16:37:19,wallstreetbets,"This right here. The option play means the stock price needs to go to (strike price + premium) in order to be profitable.

In a wildly volatile stock like GME, those premiums are baked in (IV). If the stock hits $205 for example, you would want to sell that call for premium profit instead of exercising it.

Just need to flip the profit on it before it gets om nom nom'd to death by r/thetagang lol."
2021-04-06 16:09:48,wallstreetbets,Thank god I don’t do options thanks for saving my life
2021-04-06 19:01:43,wallstreetbets,1+6

2021-04-06 19:51:11,wallstreetbets,He could roll them over
2021-04-06 17:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Still more than DFV's additional 50k shares. 
Why dont they just wait for shares to equal 10 billion then sell 1/10th of a share? Boom. 1 Billy raised."
2021-04-06 18:43:50,wallstreetbets,True but I was thinking of it more like an inspiration for other people to buy like last time he bought 50k more shares @ 40
2021-04-06 18:09:22,wallstreetbets,"If you get assigned on either covered calls or cash-secured puts then odds are good that the buyer has profited and you have lost money. On the other hand - with the high volatility and premiums on GME options, cash-secured puts are a reasonable way to make money on premium until assignment at which point you've just purchased more GME at a lower cost basis unless it tanked past your break even."
2021-04-06 14:45:01,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-06 17:40:41,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be $217.05 since he’s down $2.92?

2021-04-06 17:42:44,wallstreetbets,"Oh that wasn't me that put the specific $$ it would need, but whatever he's up/down right now doesn't matter. What he paid when he BOUGHT it matters.
If you buy the option right now, then yeah your break even price would be different from OP's."
2021-04-06 15:46:05,wallstreetbets,Whatever space is left over after the rest of us.
2021-04-06 17:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Correct, since the premiums lose value the closer they get to expiration. What he paid = current value + change value."
2021-04-06 17:50:46,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-04-06 12:35:35,wallstreetbets,"Me before reading this: ""representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks as a measure to protect their constituents from potential corruption.""

Me after reading Sheldon Whitehouses' track record: ""representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks for their own safety."""
2021-04-06 14:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Honestly. You need to track their husbands or wives or family.

Often you focus so much on the politican that you don't realize their husband or wife has as many connections and was able to leverage said influence for obscene amount of wealth.

Clinton's were the first that came to mind. Went in poor, came out not just rich, but wealthy and influential as fuck.

Edit: outside the obvious presidential families. A really fascinating one with easily available information is the Browns, Newsom's, Pelosi and Getty's. Straight up the basis for their own book/tv series; marriages, successions and businesss."

2021-04-06 14:19:16,wallstreetbets,Personally I don’t think anyone who is an elected member of the federal government should be allowed to freely trade on their own. They should only be allowed to invest in ETFs or have financial managers while in office.

2021-04-06 16:20:06,wallstreetbets,"This is so wrong. No president goes in poor and comes out rich. 
Clintons came out of the presidency wracked with debt, which you can see since their filings are public. 

Then they instantly made money the way ever former president makes money couple 10’s of mills on a book deal and the rest in speaking engagements."

2021-04-06 13:47:55,wallstreetbets,Politicians (not politics) have power to directly influence the stock market. Using their moves as market indicators is a potentially smart play that has nothing to do with political opinions.
2021-04-06 14:06:47,wallstreetbets,Ban the new guy
2021-04-06 15:36:52,wallstreetbets,I thought it was no politics unless it affects markets in some way shape or form
2021-04-06 13:02:22,wallstreetbets,It literally legally has to be public information dude. What the fuck are you talking about?

2021-04-06 16:45:28,wallstreetbets,Because isn't the law useless if they can just give inside information to thier SO? You could even lose some money on the public account just to make it look like nothing untoward is happening. Pretty sure for anyone other than senators if your spouse must report thier trades then you do as well for that very reason

2021-04-06 15:13:55,wallstreetbets,They shouldn’t be able to leverage and trade short term. It stinks of corruption and insider trading. has nothing to do with the free market and everything to do with them profiting off of trading opportunities that the public has no idea exist.. like pelosi buying Tesla calls before Biden announced a massive EV initiative and then subsequently selling them making a few million. You can’t tell me that’s because of good DD or investment acumen.
2021-04-06 15:47:24,wallstreetbets,I think the entire point is that they have so much access to information that’s not public and the free markets aren’t free. ie The congressional briefings on what was to come with COVID in late 2020/early 2021 and there were reports some of them profited greatly from that info.
2021-04-06 17:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Fuck their rights. And fuck you for making this point. What bullshit, these are the people that shit all over our rights"

2021-04-06 16:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Maybe there should be more visibility and regulation than total closure.

I mean, they’re just going to tell their 3rd far cousin’s friend’s aunt’s mom friend to place the puts to make the money then ask them to back door donate a % back to them through campaign charity. There’s no stopping them other than electing less shittier people."

I would imagine which sectors may be affected by the new ‘infra’ package are good policy observance, dissecting it to see where and what % of the money flows into each sector could be a smart play and how to capitalize off it.

But a no politics ex. might be let’s make $gme a political movement and let’s all run for office because we’re on a righteous path and you should vote this party or that party etc etc."

Stocks are the value of company. Accurate reflection. Not any time related metrics regarding procedural steps/tools. No no no.

Tax returns a good indicator. Reflective/represented of all of the money made, vested interest of the political entities and timing of buying/selling of securities based on private information privy to public officials.

Thanks for telling how by the book and honest the government is! And what good metrics by which to judge then by.

I'm so grateful.

Yes they were in debt during his presidency.
If you are talking about the hundreds of millions they earned after the Presidency you can see how every dollar was earned through Hillary’s still public returns from her failed run in 2016. They both together make about 20-25 million a year through book royalties and speaking engagements."
2021-04-06 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,I believe HR1 is trying to change that.
2021-04-06 17:55:28,wallstreetbets,"My point definitely wasn't you should YOLO your 401k (but you definitely can because no taxes).

My point was if you were looking to be able to invest in whatever you want, you're better off rolling into a rollover 401k each time you switch jobs (and consolidating).

But the idea was most 401ks have plan limitations that people are familiar with and we should give congress similar regulation.

This is not financial or life advice."
2021-04-06 19:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Lol, typical lawyer speak.

Hey, let's define the wealth and money using taxes. And then argue on an internet forum using only that metric as an indicator. While we ignore their political influence, funding, foundations and every other form of wealth that they have.

Who would have thought I would have attracted a Hilary-isn't-a-corrupt billionaire fucking fly on WSB of all places."

# The service and Product.

&#x200B;

[General information on how SDC does business.](https://preview.redd.it/q3hif166rkr61.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b93787de857cb99c9bd688b61b65e5526a217ca)

SDC is a telehealth dental company that provides clear aligners for 1/3 the cost of $Align and mom and pop orthodontists. SDC has developed a vertical integration system where the customer has the ability to work with them in a couple of different ways.

&#x200B;

1.) Work solely through SDC where they scan their teeth at home or in one of their dental offices where the scan is sent back to the production facility for their aligners. The aligners are molded and shipped directly to the consumer thus cutting out the middleman and overhead.

2.) Work with an in-network orthodontist and have the orthodontist submit the information to SDC and the same process is completed at a fraction of the cost.

The consumer then has regular checkups as they begin adjusting their teeth with an easy in-person meeting or call over the phone.

# Partnerships and contracts.

1.) SDC has developed partnerships with major insurance companies from blue shield to MetLife thus helping customers have little to no cost.

2.) They have also developed a payment plan to help customers who do not have dental insurance to afford the payments.

3.) SDC has developed partnerships with major network orthodontists and dentists across the United States and other countries. Dentists get paid for their time and a referral fee for having SDC recommended.

4.) Agreements with CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Sam's club to present their ancillary teeth whitening product line that is normally given as a bonus to those who pay for the teeth straightening kit. This promotes brand awareness because they are on every shelf in America as well as a small amount of revenue.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals

SDC IPO'd just before covid and suffered as many other companies did during that time. Since then they have been growing QOQ, paying off high-interest debt by securing 0% convertible notes, bringing on power marketing players to the board of directors, and soon will be increasing their gross margins by \~10%.

&#x200B;

1.) QOQ growth.

[During a pandemic, a discretionary income product and service was able to create QOQ growth.](https://preview.redd.it/hc639k7uskr61.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc848aa4163d3b0aae464f732452ae4e12b7fac)

As seen above SDC was affected in q2 over 2020 significantly, but was able to survive and bounce back. Now it is only a matter of time before SDC is a name in every home.

2.) Debt Paydown.

&#x200B;

[Elimination of high-interest debt with 0&#37; interest capped calls.](https://preview.redd.it/vcqjsp9gtkr61.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a578d5ffe592d4830fa43ad3336212f5ddab02)

As seen above SDC has recently been able to enter a large cash position with this convertible debt offering. This debt payoff provides a few benefits. No interest is eating away at their profits, it protects current shares holders from dilution under the lower cap of $18, and it puts SDC in a great cash position to further their expansion into international markets.

&#x200B;

3.) Marketing and New board members.

Ted Ward has recently been brought on for his expertise in marketing. You may know him from developing Geico's marketing. [https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/](https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/)

Also as seen below, SDC has been growing significantly QOQ with a reducing Marketing budget. They are seeing a healthy referral-derived customer base. This is only expected to increase as SDC further expands its operations.

[Less Marketing with Growth](https://preview.redd.it/hcmf03sgukr61.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dcf5aa04e9d80470257c6d1d7ab57f01b147cd)

4.) International Expansion.

&#x200B;

[SDC has its sights focused outside of the U.S. where teeth straightening is unaffordable for most other middle-income workers. ](https://preview.redd.it/99wiosr1vkr61.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=73d76ef4c9627794b2551ee8c676f5201e58ce79)

SDC has been setting up small brick-and-mortar and pop-up locations in countries around the world. (Most recently Mexico city).

&#x200B;

# Technicals and Mechanics

&#x200B;

[1-year chart SDC](https://preview.redd.it/bzkeq05kvkr61.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6c684bf21d768232e144758cbf46cf784f45147)

&#x200B;

SDC at the current moment has been on a downward trend since February where it reached around $16. It has been consolidating since where it has met heavy support at $10. It set for an upward trend soon however the shorts have been having their way for quite some time. Essentially ""training or choo chooing"" this company.

1.) 30% short interest. That's all.

# Counter arguments. Weakness and Threats.

1.) Rivalry amongst existing competitors. SDC is up against every orthodontist in the U.S. that wants the process of getting braces or a clear aligner from $align to stay the same. This is affecting their pockets and unless SDC is able to continue building trust with orthodontists to use their product, sadly SDC will lose market share.

2.) Bargaining power of suppliers. Nonexistent because smile direct owns and operates the creation of the straighteners.

3.) Bargaining power of buyers. Yes, consumers have many different options when it comes to finding a way to straighten their teeth. However, find a company that provides the same service at the same cost as SDC. You simply cannot.

4.) The threat of substitutes. Yes, people could choose to decide, ""Hey I don't want straight teeth. It is what is on the inside that counts. He/she will choose me for my personality.""

5.) The threat of New Entrants. Non-existent. SDC holds a patent on their process. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html)

I am long and hard. I do agree that I am not sure when this company will spike, but I am not looking to have this jump next week. Just wanted to share what I have seen over the past six months or so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some demand for a TLDR.

\-Large Cash positions with convertible debt at 0% interest that will only be converted above the $18 share price

\- Patent on their process. Not even Align can do what SDC is doing and ALign is in the 4-500 price range

\- New Company that has 30% short interest that has been growing quarter after quarter even with covid

\- The guy who created ""So easy a caveman can do it"" is now running their show. Ted has control over their marketing. Big players are involved now."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested! By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. 
 
&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. 
 
&nbsp;
  
Ok, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. 
 
&nbsp;
 
**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: 
 
1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. 
  
2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  
 
&nbsp;

 
Retailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. 
   
&nbsp;

Let's look at the short interest over time for ASO: 
 
&nbsp;

|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|
|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|
|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|
|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|
|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|

&nbsp;

We can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. 
 
&nbsp;

Most shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. 

&nbsp;

Some may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, 
&nbsp;


>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.
&nbsp;


So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. 

&nbsp;
 
**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**

&nbsp;
 
[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  
 
&nbsp;

Did someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: 
 
&nbsp;

|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|
--:|:--|:--|
|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|
|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|
|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|
|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|
|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|

&nbsp;
 
Price at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. 
 
&nbsp;

Let's see that in a table: 

|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||
:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||
|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||
|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||
|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||
|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||
|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||

&nbsp;
 
Now, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. 

&nbsp;

 
|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|
--:|--:|--:|--:|
|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|
|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|
|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|
|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|
 
&nbsp;
 
I'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. 
  
&nbsp;

**Indicators** 
 
I don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) ""crossing over"" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). 

&nbsp;
 
**Conclusion** 
&nbsp;

For me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store.

Thanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.


&nbsp;

Positions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.
 
&nbsp;

Edit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps ""gapping up"", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.

 
&nbsp;

Edit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now."
2021-04-06 10:40:48,wallstreetbets,Big dip happening right now. Bought in at 26

2021-04-06 11:01:23,wallstreetbets,I like the DD and I’ve been looking at ASO for a bit so I scooped some ASO416c30 along with some shares
2021-04-06 11:11:05,wallstreetbets,Yep looking very undervalued with a crazy high percentage of shorts. Things are going to take off here and the apes will have it!

2021-04-06 10:34:26,wallstreetbets,"I was in ASO for a little bit back before earnings, but jumped off of it for VSTO when I decided to consolidate my account into fewer stocks and missed the pop. FWIW I’m still more bullish on VSTO’s fundamentals than ASO when it comes to the long term, but short term, ASO looks crazy undervalued even at its current price.

I don’t think that every play has to be a short squeeze, but I definitely should have paid more attention to the SI. Clear sign of artificially discounted price when it’s on a company like Academy that’s doing good business."
2021-04-06 13:41:07,wallstreetbets,"I tried to post DD on this 3 weeks ago and it got auto filtered. Even reached out to mods to fix it.

2021-04-06 13:07:43,wallstreetbets,"I genuinely like Academy. I shop there often. I can get high quality versions there (vs. Walmart) of just about everything I need when we go out on camping trips, park trips, etc. I bought my tents, chairs, bike shorts, weights, boots, golf balls, camping fuel, boat stuff, fishing supplies, ammo - all from Academy. It’s a one-stop shop for outdoor / active stuff. 

You don’t go to the beach without a stop at academy.

Plus - they are always clean, well stocked, and well organized. That goes far.

310 shares and 5 4/16 $30 calls. Buying the dip. 
I’m aiming for a 1000 share position."
2021-04-06 10:35:30,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD. Glad some of this is making it through the gestapo auto filters. Position 50x 5/21 $35 calls. It def feels like rkt (also rode that rocket)🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-06 12:28:24,wallstreetbets,"ASO was well above 70 RSI across all timeframes so today’s dip was not unexpected. The short time frame charts (<1h) have gone back under 70 while the 4h and 1d charts are sitting right at 70.

Tough to say what will happen once things cool off. I’m confident it will stay above $30 but I’m not sure if we will continue moving up or simply bounce between $30-$35 between now and the next earnings release."
2021-04-06 10:28:26,wallstreetbets,This was the confirmation bias I needed to maintain my position. Thank you.

2021-04-06 13:58:40,wallstreetbets,"I'll just keep saying the same thing in these threads until someone addresses it:

They source most of their stuff from China.  Shorts are betting on a trade war between the Biden admin and China.  That seems like a perfectly reasonable short thesis.

They have a lot of debt, and the hit to equity holders will be severe if we do Trade War 2: Electric Boogaloo

They don't have a mature omnichannel strategy, their online presence remains small.  Which means most of the long thesis is built around the economy re-opening, not necessarily long-term health of the company.

There are peers in their sector with less debt, better multiples, and similar short interest."

A LOT of companies source shit from China. I’m pretty sure nearly half of Apple’s suppliers are Chinese. As for a trade war, I’m not sure if you’ve been living under a rock but that’s been going on for a while now. Trump created the China tarriff’s and now the big question people have is whether Biden will drop them.

> They have a lot of debt

They just paid off 50% of their outstanding debt in Q4.

> They don’t have a mature omnichannel strategy.

I’m not really sure what to say here. The ommnichannel strategy is literally one of the biggest focuses for management right now and it has been a key driver to their success during COVID.

All things considered, idk wtf you’re talking about."
2021-04-06 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,"My personal take is that 5/21 is pointless. Either the conditions for it to spike are present and it does so in short order (i.e. 4/16) or they are not and any such spike, if it will happen, happens after next earnings (so 7/16 options).

2021-04-06 19:40:41,wallstreetbets,"Bought 450 at 33 aswell, but my avg us at 27.9 now, up from 24.7"
2021-04-06 13:55:22,wallstreetbets,"afaik its only on subscription services, S3 had it updated at an estimate of 45% at closing yesterday"
2021-04-06 15:51:00,wallstreetbets,Finviz lists it as 15%. This whole DD is sus.
2021-04-06 17:44:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree that being able to touch and feel the products is important, but I think an omni-channel approach is something that complements that.  If all you have is the brick and mortar store, then when you go in, what you see is what you've got.  But with online and physical catalogs that let you browse their full range of offerings, you can find products they offer that might not have been in stock for you to see if you had just dropped in randomly.  And an online storefront lets you know what is in stock in what stores, so if there's something in particular you are interested in seeing in person, you don't waste a trip down to one of their stores to get a feel for the product only to find out it's not in stock.  And after you've visited and done your groping of their product lineup, you don't have to make a decision right then and there, you can go home, think it over, make comparisons with other products, and order something for pickup the next day.

This isn't the sort of thing you can create overnight-- it takes web development, robust inventory management, and a level of marketing knowhow that takes time to build.  But I think the companies that pull it off will be gaining market share as time goes on-- they'll be able to support leaner supply chains, target and retain customers better, collect data and use it to predict trends better.

With that said, if ASO's lackluster omni-channel effort were the only thing I was worried about, I'd still be fine with the stock.  Because the companies that are taking that approach are more expensive.  Dick's (DKS) is a good example, it's doing well with this stuff.  But it's got a forward-PE ratio of 15.  ASO has a forward-PE ratio of 10.  If I bought Dicks, I'd be paying 50% more per dollar of earnings.  Dick's would *have* to gain market share to justify that price.

But it's not just their weakness online, it's the debt and the downside risk of a trade war.  Dick's has a debt-equity ratio of 0.18.  ASO has a ratio of 1.45.  Not only do I think Dick's product line is better insulated against tariffs (though how much is debatable), it's balance sheet is good enough that it would survive a trade war.  I don't think ASO would survive a trade war, not as leveraged as they are.

And if I didn't care about omni-channel, I still wouldn't go with ASO.  Big Five Sporting Goods (BGFV) has basically ignored online completely, which is great if I don't care about online because it means they trade at a PE of 6.6 and have basically zero debt on their books."

2021-04-06 15:59:11,wallstreetbets,"It has nothing to do with GME. The last 5 top that topped WSB in 2 days have all been P&Ds, they all had a set of common themes as well with Citadel AND they reached the top of the sub almost overnight AND they all were near the height of the run ($RKT was at $30 when it made it to the top of WSB overnight, the following day started its slow decline to $21. They did it again two weeks ago and this time it didn't move $0.30. Retail hype alone isn't moving the stock). Discovery B didn't even make it to the top until after the 100% run up, so it's not like the thumb is on the pulse or anything.

2021-04-06 16:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Instead of looking at a company and seeing if citadel owns it, checks Citadel’s holdings. You know what you’ll find? 

Citadel Advisors: Their last reported 13F filing for Q4 2020 included **$384,599,856,000** in managed 13F securities and a top 10 holdings concentration of 30.5%. 

That’s right. **$384 billion dollars** on the long side.

Citadel is one of the largest multi manager market neutral hedge funds in the world. They run 5-10x leverage on their equity books. They own every single stock you will ever consider owning. So I’m serious. You don’t want to own what Citadel owns? Close up shop today ."
2021-04-06 17:06:54,wallstreetbets,"I would not attribute Citadel nor any one fund or person with how trading patterns have evolved. What do you think happens when a squeeze causes ""smart"" players to lose billions as what happened with GME? It results in overall the market changing. Further, what about people who did not cash out at the top of GME, their behavior also changed. Now when you get some sort of intense price action you likely have shorts covering faster and people taking gains quicker. Bottom line the behavior of numerous participants constantly change in order to try to make money. Saying Citadel is responsible for everything you don't like in the market seriously sounds ridiculous.

Also as another pointed out, Citadel has holdings in just about everything through its various funds. Reading into this is just silly."
2021-04-06 13:48:08,wallstreetbets,"Because they did last quarter as well. That seems like it would be more of a bullish case than post-pandemic sales, yet we heard nothing:

2021-04-06 12:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much only applies if the options are just plain priced wrong, which seems extremely rare.  Even things like dividends (which a shareholder gets but an option owner does not) should already be priced in."

One very important thing I will add though is that you have to be approved for options trading. You won't get approved unless you lie and claim experience. Not knowing this, I missed out on the GME swings a month ago :(

So I'm not your guy. Just going on basic knowledge here. Robinhood will approve you instantly- again, you have to lie- but things like this shouldn't be closed to us.

More calls being ""sold"" as Compared to ""puts"" indicates extreme bearishness as ""smart money"" sells options while mostly ""novice investors"" buy options.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Billy Hwang Gang Bang and Why I Am Still Balls Deep In $VIACA In a [previous post from last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhp1fe/spongebob_vs_hwang_gang_and_the_banks/), I outlined why I thought $VIACA would moon like $DISCB. I bought the calls, envisioned the massive money I was going to make, and was promptly kicked in the dick. I am ride or die so you can bet your ass I am still in the trade.

The premise was that the big banks that were holding the Billy Hwang’s Archegos’ bag, most notably Credit Suisse and Nomura, were about done with selling. As it turns out, the risk management department at Credit Suisse is more retarded than I thought, and Monday’s trading was still filled with lots more selling.

**What changed**

In the afterhours last night, Credit Suisse showed just how shit their risk management department is by revealing that they only managed to sell 3m of its 37m $VIACA/$VIAC shares over the course of a week. Credit Suisse is running/ran a sale process in the afterhours tonight to [get out of their remaining 34m shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/credit-suisse-said-to-offer-viacomcbs-vipshop-farfetch-blocks). I speculate Credit Suisse’s large, unmoved block of shares was an open secret around the Street and inspired traders to keep pressing shorts until Credit Suisse visibly raised the white flag. Well, we know Credit Suisse has now folded.

With the Credit Suisse selling out of the way, I am guessing that there will be a lot of short covering and rebuys coming in the next week or so to conclude the trade on the short side. My preferred way to play Viacom is with $VIACA for the same reason $DISCB was the way to play Discovery. I believe $VIACA is now primed for takeoff and will probably buy more tomorrow because I am a degenerate.

**TL;DR**

VIACA 4/16 $50c, $60c, $65c, and $70c

Most options expire worthless and these probably will too."
2021-04-06 12:32:09,wallstreetbets,I’ve been in for a couple of weeks with 150 contracts at $30p 4/16. I don’t think this story is over. May the bigger retard win 😎
2021-04-06 09:57:30,wallstreetbets,Spongebob thanks you! 🧽🚀

VIAC (fuck VIACA) 5/21 $50C  


Edit: but seriously why would you be using VIACA on options. The liquidity is so low and the BID/ASK spreads are fucking huge."
2021-04-06 13:27:42,wallstreetbets,i'm in. what's your PT if this goes off?
2021-04-06 09:57:56,wallstreetbets,"Viac will turn around but not by mid april. Give it a couple months, will be back to 50-55$ so still some decent tendies to be made here."
2021-04-06 13:37:42,wallstreetbets,I bought 5 $55 and 10 $60 4/16 calls so we can both win or lose together.
2021-04-06 14:16:18,wallstreetbets,Bought $viaca instead of viac. Same reason why discb was mooning instead of disca. Godspeed friend !
2021-04-06 09:56:05,wallstreetbets,"This dd  makes no sense. If you know and understand that there is still a fire sell going on worth millions of shares, why on earth are you hung calls? Calls that are 20-30% OTM at that"
2021-04-06 11:40:11,wallstreetbets,"I feel like this might be a poor play. 1) There are still a ridiculous amount of people still in VIAC that are trying to figure out/dump shares and can't, similar to CS. 2) We still don't know how many more folks were affected by Archegos, as everyday there's a new bank that's not waiting for regulators... cause well JPM and MS both we're like fuck it, cashing out. And these smaller banks are slow moving to the same thing, but will be too late. I see VIAC dropping down to single digits before it rolls back based on the fact that its still a solid company."

2021-04-06 14:33:30,wallstreetbets,"These calls are not enough time for a boomer stock like VIAC. Boomers move in quarterly earnings cycles, so need at least may calls. I got 20 June $50 calls.

2021-04-06 11:50:03,wallstreetbets,"In, but 6/18 44C for VIAC.

I think it'll take some more time to climb back up."
2021-04-06 13:55:53,wallstreetbets,Stay away from Viaca and trade Viac. Very low volume on Viaca.. You want high volume so the spread on options is very small..
2021-04-06 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,"I’m also bullish but completely disagree with your strategy. Some questions:

1. Why VIACA? Far less volume 


2 Why 4/16? And please don’t say because they are so cheap. Need to give them some breathing room. 


Disclaimer - I’m in 5/21 VIAC calls $55 and $60"
2021-04-06 11:07:38,wallstreetbets,I got into a bull put spread at 44/40 for 4/16. Could be dumb if there is another huge block trade but I’m betting it’s found it’s floor. I wouldn’t want to own $60 calls though for the same time period.
2021-04-06 11:12:04,wallstreetbets,whats up with people choosing VIACA over VIAC... should you go with higher liquidity underlying?
2021-04-06 12:13:52,wallstreetbets,"whats the dif. in each of these, have not paid attention to the dual share structure."
2021-04-06 12:55:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding many $VIAC ATM calls out to June, selling short dated calls for premium with price target of 60-70.

2021-04-06 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,I like the float dynamics of $VIACA more than $VIAC but to each his own. I picked off most of my position with limit orders. Good luck.
2021-04-06 13:35:18,wallstreetbets,Probably around $80/$90. I have no basis for those targets other than closing the chart gap so it's somewhat arbitrary.
2021-04-06 10:08:51,wallstreetbets,We shall see.
2021-04-06 14:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to us, we will need it."
2021-04-06 13:53:31,wallstreetbets,I am glad I am not the only one having a hard time trying to understand the logic here.
2021-04-06 10:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Because the fire sale is known, and the event has passed. The pile on short trade should be over at this point, and I think the tight float of $VIACA is the best way to play a rebound trade, much like $DISCB."
2021-04-06 12:00:29,wallstreetbets,"If you sum up the known counterparties of Archegos (outlined in my previous post), the amount of volume traded over the past week and a half should have allowed anyone with shares to get out. That proved false for CS, who was still in it for reasons I don't understand, so there is risk of more to come certainly. CS was one of, if not the largest VIAC holder so I'd have to guess they are the elephant in the room. I think CS' afterhours block sale cleared them out, but that may be rumor."
2021-04-06 15:15:11,wallstreetbets,"I think that under the last presidency, several bank incentives including the ppp loans which flooded banks with cash, allowed them to make moves and bets. Now however, under the new administration, all those covid losses will show on their balance sheets and you can expect a giant toilet economy by the end of the year. They have to show those losses sometime, somehow, so there will come a time in which they can't pretend anymore and it will be in this administration. There will be bailouts for the casino banks. It's coming. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. Just thoughts from an ape"
2021-04-06 12:03:03,wallstreetbets,Best money is found money.
2021-04-06 14:36:45,wallstreetbets,"Normally a longer horizon makes sense. In this case, I think there is a trade immediately. Look at DISCB as an example. Two similar companies with voting class shares under pressure from Archegos with similar holders. It went parabolic once selling pressure was lifted. I don't want to pay for extra time if I don't have to, paying a lot of time premium for a high vol name is burning money...or maybe you're right and it moons after my expiry. Tis a risk"
2021-04-06 13:32:41,wallstreetbets,It could be. I would take some time to examine the VIACA float and holder dynamics. Many similarities to DISCB.
2021-04-06 12:02:53,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-06 14:30:03,wallstreetbets,"If you read and understand the setup, and your primary hangup are underlying volume and spreads on weekly, deep otm call options, then some of this is whooshing over you. Look at the VIACA float dynamic and the DISCB parallel trade setup.

I have a list of risks and concerns about this trade, and the underlying volume and spreads aren't in that list."
2021-04-06 10:25:03,wallstreetbets,"$VIACA > $VIAC for the same reason $DISCB > $DISCA. Look at the holders of the voting class $VIACA and the float dynamics. And I want to own enough voting class shares to get Spongebob elected Chairman of the Board.

I chose April 16 because I didn't want to pay for extra time premium in a high vol ticker. I thought if this trade works, it will be shortly after the clearing event on the Credit Suisse/bank side much like $DISCB. Maybe that's too aggressive, maybe not. We shall see if it's really stupid or smart soon.

Edit: I am not downvoting you, I think you asked fair questions."
2021-04-06 12:02:36,wallstreetbets,Look at the float dynamic of $DISCB vs $DISCA and that should answer your question.
2021-04-06 12:24:38,wallstreetbets,"$VIACA is basically the same as $VIAC, but has super voting rights (10 to 1 I think). Those shares are (mostly) tightly held by insiders and banks. I want those."

2021-04-06 13:58:01,wallstreetbets,"I am making a bet the short trade is over, and $VIACA will revert quickly. We know the banks got caught holding the bag, and if WSB/Reddit let me I could post more pictures and graphs to illustrate that point. Based on the volume, most should be out by now, and last night's news that CS was block selling the rest I believe is the last shoe to drop. With the immense selling out of the way, I think the best way to play the rebound trade is $VIACA."
2021-04-06 14:48:07,wallstreetbets,I’m glad to know everyone isn’t a zombie here 😭. Cause I thought I was the only one saying wtf this guys post
2021-04-06 10:08:36,wallstreetbets,Not in a week tho. This would make more sense in may maybe. But next Friday? I think your playing with fire
2021-04-06 11:44:01,wallstreetbets,"It has not passed man. Every day there's a new bank trying to unload. And CS still trying to get rid of 34M shares. That's a huge supply for currently low demand. They were only successful in a $2B block trade, still $1.5B (34M shares \* $45 -current price) pending."
2021-04-06 18:55:27,wallstreetbets,I think his argument is if it moons at all you'll still make a nice profit and the longer dated options give you more time to be wrong before they decay.
2021-04-06 12:17:17,wallstreetbets,If it’s gonna climb back then his calls are gonna print 5x more with the delta and theta he has....
2021-04-06 11:13:11,wallstreetbets,I mean you know you're taking the risk. There was a ton of people that thought deepfuckingvalue was retarded as well for his GME play. Lets see if it works out for ya mate. Good luck

2021-04-06 12:14:32,wallstreetbets,"it's been more than a week...this was over $100 and all analyst PT's are 60, 70 80's   


You're about as close to the bottom as you will get, if not reached this morning."
2021-04-06 10:13:01,wallstreetbets,"It's a weekly expiring option, no shit I am playing with fire. At no point did I say this was a low risk trade.

I want the $DISCB style rally after its selling was done. I saw that happen there, and I think it can happen here in $VIACA."
2021-04-06 11:55:15,wallstreetbets,"Rumor has it the block moved in the AH last night, hence the update post."
2021-04-06 12:09:04,wallstreetbets,It appears the block is finished or very nearly finished.
2021-04-06 17:47:15,wallstreetbets,Following up here. The block seems to have cleared and about 25% of the company's equity traded today alone. Can we agree anyone who wanted to get out had the ability to do so by now?
2021-04-06 19:21:40,wallstreetbets,"For sure. There is definitely an argument to be made for the longer dates. When I was doing the math on expected payout and timing from a hypothetical moonshot to $80/$90, the prices I got on the 60s-70s weeklies made me think the risk was worth it. The way I see it, since we have a case study example in DISCB, that if the VIACA trade is going to work, it will be quickly after the selling pressure lifts. That makes me think I want the highest bang per dollar.

I think the math on my lots works out to about 37:1 payout for a $90 target, or about 2.5%. Given the DISCB madness, and general squeeziness and insanity I see elsewhere in the market, I think 2.5% is too low. Maybe like a 5%-10% is how I would have priced it if I was writing the contracts. So I bought the weeklies. If the DISCB trade didn't moon I wouldn't have been here."
2021-04-06 14:09:30,wallstreetbets,dude are you the chessplayer on lichess? :)
2021-04-06 16:50:33,wallstreetbets,Over 20% of the entire company's stock was traded today. How many massively high volume days do we need?
2021-04-06 14:26:40,wallstreetbets,"Based on what I read last night reported from BB, the block was eventually filled. That is now known and the overhang should be finished. I don't care if they struggled to fill the block - it's hard to piecemeal that size out because if parties don't believe the block will fill then they aren't incentivized to put orders in. The event has passed."
2021-04-06 13:30:10,wallstreetbets,"That's what I think too. It seems to have found a floor and with the selling pressure eased, any shorts still sticking around either VIAC or VIACA (arbitrageurs) may be in for sadness. That trade, which was fantastic, now seems over with.

The shot clock on my degenerate options bet is real, so I need that shit to get sorted out quickly."
2021-04-06 10:26:25,wallstreetbets,Same I bought shares because this will eventually self right but options next week is too early I think
2021-04-06 18:02:27,wallstreetbets,I doubt it. There are ALWAYS bagholders. Especially for stuff like this. Why is CS doing this a week after MS and JPM? There are likely others.
2021-04-06 17:06:40,wallstreetbets,Beep beep
2021-04-06 17:45:23,wallstreetbets,Exactly. The volume has been there for about a week now.
2021-04-06 10:28:21,wallstreetbets,"I almost bought the ones expiring last Thursday so this is my ""less risky"" play. I hate overpaying for time premium."
2021-04-06 18:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you are completely missing the point. Yes of course someone on the other end of a sell is a buy, and maybe it does or maybe it doesn't work out for the new buyer. The point is that the parties WHO WERE FORCED SELLERS have been shown plenty of counter parties willing to shoulder the risk. What do you think happens when the forced sellers go away? And when the shorts see the forced seller is gone?

Again, go read my original post about the Archegos counter parties. Sum up all of their exposure and compare it to the cumulative volume from the past week.

What you are implicitly arguing is that there is an endless stream of forced sellers, which is false unless this is the lead domino in a rolling series of BKs. If you believe that, great, go buy SPY 50p and call it a day. If you want to be more practical, look at who already exited, and then take your most aggressive assumption at who is left and what % of their total position is specifically Archegos."
2021-04-06 11:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you pay the \*most\* relative time premium for shortly dated options (<30 days). Most of the cost decay happens at the tail end of the option's life. If you're comfortably sure it will rebound, you can just buy an option \~3-4 months out, and sell that time premium back to the market when you're done with the trade. The way you set it up you're just asking to get assblasted by theta decay, after already paying a lot for vega, no?"
2021-04-06 16:53:27,wallstreetbets,You really should consider buying options within no more than a month of expiration. Weeklies are high risk gambling
2021-04-06 18:26:37,wallstreetbets,"I’ll take a look. But that’s a terrible argument. “If I sell there will be buyers”. Some MM are forced buyers/sellers because that’s they’re role. Anyhow, my position is that in the short term, we’ll see more dips."
2021-04-06 11:29:50,wallstreetbets,"In a relative sense, yes you are right. I was most concerned in the absolute sense for this trade. I do not want to pay for high IVOL options for longer than I need to.

It's a very risky play, and normally I would never touch weekly options for all the reasons you cite. This setup is a little different, in my opinion. I don't want to be in this trade for long."
2021-04-06 17:04:05,wallstreetbets,"Options in general is high risk, sophisticated sounded gambling. I agree, though, weeklies are a special breed of crazy. I normally never touch them, but the setup demanded I explore it. I don't want to be in this trade for long."
2021-04-06 18:33:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand what role a market maker serves, nor the role the banks were playing if that's your reply. It seems we've reached an end, so good luck to you."

Hoping for a stock that is $40 above its prime pre covid to jump to $100 above its prime as covid restrictions loosen up is an odd gamble. It’s not like it’s trading at 80 and your strike is at 120 expecting a pop as they reopen.


I’m really curious to know what made you think 120k in 280 strike calls was a good idea. Buying shares with that would have for sure netted you better profits lol"

If the reopening really goes that well, the institutional guys will go even into cheaper and more targeted plays like Cedar Fair, Seaworld or Six Flags that are 1% of Disney's size. Disney is already arguably priced for perfection or overvalued (based on your perspective).

I'm not saying $PLTR is a bad buy but this doesn't say anything of substance about why they should be the ""next big thing"". There's tons of big data tools out there, Splunk for example, which has quite a hold on gov right now. Quoting PLTR's ""About Us"" marketing page isn't really helpful. 

Now, if you believe PLTR will be the next Splunk and increase tenfold in value (which is totally in the realm of possibility; data is never going out of style) then it's the steal of a lifetime right now. But there should be more substance to supporting PLTR than quoting marketing hype and emoji's."

2021-04-06 15:31:18,wallstreetbets,"Translating the content of the press release into something less... jargony:

- **Chained model simulations**: Foundry takes the data generated by a company and allows said company to run simulations rooted in real data instead of wild-ass-guesses. Foundry also allows a company to duplicate this entire process and run simulations that allows a company to discover potential issues so that they can prepare a response plan *before* the problem actually arises. 
- **Unmatched range of analytical computations**: Foundry makes it possible for analysts to look at both immediately available (aka, ""hot"") data and the long-term storage (aka, ""cold"") data so that they can all be used simultaneously to build models for both simulation and analysis. 
- **Dynamic orchestration without tradeoffs**: Foundry ""warms up"" data so that you don't need to waste resources changing from the deep (i.e. ""cold"") storage to immediately available (i.e. ""hot""). Machine-generated data can be highly compressed, which makes it easier to transfer for analysis, which decreases the cost for analysis in the long term.

Those are reinforced in these two points:

- **Foundry’s Quality Archetype**: Customers can see problems and identify their causes quickly, and then build the necessary solutions through simulations based on real world data. This makes it possible for them to avoid making the wrong decision while pursuing the right course of action.
- **Foundry’s Supply Chain Archetype**: Customers can identify potential weak points in the supply chain before those weak points become broken links, and view different potential scenarios by monitoring key performance indicators (lol key KPI) so that the appropriate response can be taken."

Data processing for IoT is not PLTR's unique or competitive value proposition, and anyone in IT is going to assume that from the tiny snippet. Apollo, Gotham and Foundry have a lot more USPs  than working with IoT data. 

What PLTR does is better explained above posts and also the term 'Augmenting Human Intelligence' has a strong link to PLTR's aspirations in developing Decision-Support Systems with humans and AI, as well as resolving a lot of the challenges to organizations in the Data V's (Volume, veracity etc.). 

I'm long on PLTR because I work in the industry and am studying Analytics & AI for my Masters, so $100+ p/share in a couple of years is very realistic. In the short-term this stock is not predictable.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

2021-04-06 09:08:19,wallstreetbets,"Fellow apes as a reminder:

I am seeing a bunch of questions about why would the hedgies keep doing this if no one is selling and this is just digging them deeper.

Well the answer is they are already so fuk their only possible escape is shorting it enough that retail (apes) actually paper hand and they can begin to cover the shorts.

Or option 2, they dig the hole so deep it literally crashes the fucking market when they are forced to cover. This way they can file chapter 11 and hope big dad gov bails them out WITH OUR FUCKING TAX Dollars.

All you have to do is hold. Buy more if you can and hold. and hold and hold and hold.

And one day, today, tomorrow, next year, whatever. we will reach the straw that breaks their greedy fucking backs. They get margin called, they run out of capital to cover the short interest, Gamestop starts a buy back, the SEC gets off their lazy asses.

Something will trigger the cover. And when it does all of those shorts will need to be bought back.

All of those naked shorts manufactured out of thin air will need to find an actual share. So each share has been shorted what 10 times a hundred times. we dont know. Each one needs to find an actual share.

Guess who holds all the actual shares. You.

You hold their financial lives in your broker account. And only you get to decide what its worth to you.

I say you hold that little sucker for every time these greedy bastards tanked the market and took millions from our 401ks. I say you make them remember 2008 when the gambled with our homes and left us homeless only to be bailed out with our own fucking money.

I say this is the peoples bailout. I say we take em to the cleaners.

I say I am sick of watching these greedy men with more money they could spend in a lifetime , gorge themselves while the masses struggle to make ends meet.

I say its a dawning of a new day. The age of Aquarius.

Its time for the Apes to inherit the earth.

Then...

*After a long period floating in the $40 range.... not too dissimilar from the $180 range we’re in now 💎🤲💎🤲

Even signalling their continued presence in opening and closing of the market, and only waking up if correction is needed. We will close close to where we opened the entire week. Im telling you. 

If you think ""big green"" is good and red is bad.... please understand that its not that simple. A big 40% spike in the green can actually delay the squeeze for us lol...you cant look at it as simple as ""we need it go up""

So many of you idiots are setting yourselves up for dissapointment and ""getting tired"" paperhanding because you're cheering the wrong things OR dont see good things happening because theyre different from what you expect.

HOLD! Even if it takes a year from now.
Yes. Im serious, that's the mentality You should have.

Just think it’s interesting that it feels like we haven’t yet hit FOMO mode in the public yet where the normies start piling their money back in.

2021-04-06 12:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but since January, the only 2 days that have had volume this low (under 8mil) have been Jan 12 and Feb 23, both preceding a major run up in price. 

Both were the culmination of a long sideways slide down and consolidation of RSI, with people getting Theta burned like no tomorrow thanks to IV for near ITM options going from 600%+ to under 200% (hello there second half of March!). 

All of those factors seem to be aligning here, with a lot of near ITM calls holding more and more open interest with dropping IV. MACD is also near breaking out above the signal line, which has only happened before the two big run-ups to $483 and $348. 

It seems like the next few days or next week are really about to break out one way or another just based off of the immense consolidation across the board, all it needs is one major catalyst to push the volume into action.

I don't really know too much but trying to learn at least one or two things, so if anyone has any input on this please add to it!

Edit: I'm not trying to set a date or whatever, obviously I don't know shit and things change, fast. 

The best thing we can do is get informed and look for these things to start happening which will signal that the launch is primed. This is something everyone should be doing and peer reviewing."

if we keep holding and buying we all win, right now is very evident that someone we don't know if it's Shitadel, SEC or any other parties driving the price to go sideways, the way I look at it is, we will be going sideways because they are trying as much as possible to absorb the massive bomb that's about to come, so days like this you should feel proud that we held we won and they still are doing the same shitty tactics that are driving them to the brink of a massive financial breakdown, and it's all because they wanted it that way, and now we are the CAPTAINS NOW, we've had enough, our parents, our grandparents, our children who we see in debt because of these assholes, we are doing this for us and for them, for being taken advantage by criminals.

Double top at the peak followed by a few percentage lower peaks on each swing, brief consolidation around 80% peak value and then more waves down. 

I'm setting a trailing % stop loss on the second rebound, I'm happy with taking my ticket for 80% on the way down."

""GME: 

* Opening orders on short individual options are not allowed with the exception of cash-secured puts or covered calls, which **must be placed through a broker**.
* If you currently own stock in one of these securities and wish to sell a covered call, y**ou must do so with a broker**. Please be aware that wait times to speak with a broker may be longer than normal due to current market conditions.
* If you have no position and wish to simultaneously buy stock and sell calls against it, you may enter it as a covered stock (buy/write) order online.
* We may also implement additional requirements on opening trades on options that expire 4/9."

There’s no amount of FUD that can shake me at this point. I don’t feel humiliation anymore, but I can smell it thru the screen with these FUD simps who roll thru and try to rock the boat.



The FUD ppl must really think they’re effective or something, which is sad.  It’s also sad that they’re monitoring the situation and feel compelled to chime in.

FUD doesn’t work any more. FUDdies don’t surf."

""In 1998, when hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was blowing up, their biggest swap counterparties gathered to discuss an orderly liquidation. LTCM was our biggest counterparty, but then LTCM was *everybody’s* biggest counterparty. Their abundance of PhDs and egos had created a colossus that generated tens of millions of dollars a month in profits for the banks trading with them.

I was running interest rate derivatives for Chase Manhattan (later merged into JPMorgan). I received a phone call late one night from a colleague informing me that LTCM was collapsing due to many highly leveraged bets going awry simultaneously. The following morning, our head of credit summarized the exposures we and the other big counterparties had to LTCM. As with Archegos, an orderly liquidation of positions looked to be the best option. But the economic incentives were similar to a cartel – each member was incentivized to secretly cheat.

The LTCM bank group was apparently sworn to secrecy. The information I had been provided made me an insider – it was obvious what trades should be done to generate immediate profits (“pay fixed in ten year swap spreads”) but I respected the rules and waited. Goldman didn’t. I saw them trading on the information they possessed about LTCM’s portfolio.""

I’m going to continue to hold because I like the stock.

I like the stock so much, that when the annual shareholder meeting is announced publicly in a week or so, I’m going to call my broker to tell them I’d like my shares recalled so that I can register to take part in the shareholder meeting of the stock I like in June.

You know who calls Melvin after many apes request their shares be recalled in a few weeks? Our good friend Marge

there's 1 million shares available at the moment. People telling you to buy this 2 dollar dip when they could short this back to 120 when we actually get volume like they did last time. so these $5-10 dip fluctuations are meaningless to me. I now know the MM and HF have ammunition to really short the price down at some point and I am waiting for that. until then I will hold the shares I have and wait for a better dip than anything in the 165-190 to buy more"

But has anyone noticed something about them? They haven't borrowed new shares from IB all day.. I don't know what it means but I have a hunch  it's not good for the shorts. Either they are running out of money and can't afford to hold large amounts in stockpile. Or they are trying to clean up thier game to pass the new rules. I dunno it could also just be a coincidence and they will borrow some right after I post. I am a stupid ape after all.

What they don't understand is that old school views only hold up when they (big money and big media) are in control because they get to write the rules.   


They don't write the rules for GME. GME is run by the people, for the people. It does not bend to the will and manipulations of big money and media."

Yes, everyones aware that it ""doesn't mean shit"" - even though the numbers do represent actual borrowing activity, so it means SOMETHING.

What I'd love for someone to answer, is how a million shares can reappear as able to be borrowed, without having been covered on the open market (ie, no repurchasing of shares)

Could these be IBKR ""reserves"" they are just now allowing to be borrowed? For some sort of last ditch effort?"

2021-04-06 07:50:58,wallstreetbets,"Morning good people, GME is setting up for a potential rally this week. RSI is seeing levels as low as when the stock was trading at $40 before the rally up to $350. IV is also at levels that hadn’t been seen since the first run up all the way back in January. MACD is also on the verge of crossing over into bullish momentum. Calculating GameStop’s recent SEC filing, they expect to sell all 3.5m shares at an average of $285 per share. The fact that this was filed with the SEC, shows that the SEC is in agreement of the stock being valued at this price! (Correct me if I’m wrong)"

2021-04-06 09:50:11,wallstreetbets,"In case you didn't know...  
Bull or Bullish  
Being long, or buying, is a bullish action for a trader to take. Put simply, being a bull or having a bullish attitude stems from a belief that an asset will rise in value. To say ""he's bullish on gold,"" for example, means that he believes the price of gold will rise.  
Being a bull can represent an opinion or action. Someone who's bullish may go long on the assets they're bullish on. Alternately, they may just have an opinion that the price will rise, but have decided against making any trades based on that opinion. Bullish stances can be extremely specific opinions about a single stock, or they can be broad opinions about the overall market.  
The term ""bull"" or ""bullish"" comes from the bull, who strikes upward with his horns, thus pushing prices higher.  
A bull market is when an investment's price is rising—called an uptrend—typically over a sustained period, such as months or years.  
Bullish, bull, and long are used interchangeably. For example, instead of saying ""I am long on that stock,"" a trader may say, ""I am bullish on that stock."" Both statements indicate this person believes prices will rise."

The next couple of days/weeks/months?, will mostly be sideways - by GME standards - until that happens. Then when the rules are activated. **MOON**

2021-04-06 12:33:13,wallstreetbets,If you look on the 3 month 15 minute interval chart and zoom out you can see some very bullish pendants (triangles) forming. This is good for those wanting to squeeze GME. Add that to the heightened short interest yesterday this is going in our favour. The chart suggest a few more days of sideways trading before an upward trajectory can be made trading between 200 and 212. Anyway I just made all of that up. Go and more more GME so the chart can do something.
2021-04-06 12:35:13,wallstreetbets,I actually fell in love with 180s a long time ago so this is pretty cool also...I love sideways action so that’s nice also...like pretty much any way they go about this is really great... so ya thanks HF!!

If you do decide to join the party I highly recommend not using robinhood and opening an account with a real broker ( I am in the process of switching to TD myself).

WSB answer: yes drain your life savings into a broker account and buy as much as you can get your ape hands on because this rocket is launching soon!"

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Walmart Setup Hi guys,

This is my first post here, so if there are some aspects not to your liking, please let me know.

I am a pattern trader, and today I noticed a double bottom forming and other entry signals on Walmart (WMT) :

Here is an overview of the situation and the move I will be making on it when I get confirmation:

**The catalysts :**

* Double bottom pattern
* 50 day moving average (MA) breakout.

Now, when there is more than one signal forming on a single stock, the probability of the trade going your way is much higher than when there is just one signal.

**The play**

Today I will wait for confirmation of the breakout (the stock trades higher than yesterday's close) and I will enter using the following **setup:**

**Entry price :** 140$ (breakout confirmation)

**Stop loss :** 137.5$ ( half way through yesterday's bar - breakout failure - setup not valid anymore)

**Risk :** 2.5$/sh

**Target :** 147.5$ ( the next resistance level, also the target level of the double bottom)

**Profit :** 7.5$/sh

**Risk/reward :** 3:1

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Screenshot**

**TLDR:**

**Enter:** 140$

**Set Stop loss :** 137.5$

**Set limit sell:** 147.5$

&#x200B;

**Edit :** some are complaining that the short interest data is wrong. I edited it out , but it's ok, this setup is not dependent on a squeeze happening for it to succeed.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer : this is not a financial advice, just technical analysis.**"

Thanks for post!"
2021-04-06 07:28:37,wallstreetbets,"All you want to do with WMT is get in at the right price and hold it.

You just have to wait for some news where it drops below 130,140"
2021-04-06 08:55:36,wallstreetbets,"I like this, im gonna play it on the break and run off 140, its an easy play because of that fat gap fill at 147, nice call out, I was watching this yesterday for a day trade"
2021-04-06 07:09:08,wallstreetbets,What fucking idiot would short Walmart
2021-04-06 06:57:44,wallstreetbets,I like this analysis a lot. I think I will participate. Pattern trading rubs me the right way.
2021-04-06 12:37:18,wallstreetbets,"So... Did you buy in at $140, OP?"

2021-04-06 09:00:57,wallstreetbets,I prefer Target 🎯
2021-04-06 07:35:34,wallstreetbets,You're looking at Walmart for a short squeeze from the 1.5% short float of the 2.5 billion shares?  Did I read that right?  Do you think Walmart is going to gap up?  This is so dumb.  Please go examine AAPL for the possible short squeeze.
2021-04-06 07:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Did this dude really include “short interest” in a WMT analysis?
Fucking hell. Stop using that shitty site FinViz. The float is **1.3 BILLION SHARES** 
Short % is 1%"
2021-04-06 12:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Do you see that E in February?

That was their earnings date.

They missed estimated earnings.

This is why they tanked.

Their stocks will absolutely recover over the next quarter, but there's not much of a ""play"" to be had here, just holding stocks in an old whale of a company."
2021-04-06 08:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Down .40-.60 from yesterday’s extended highs, almost $1 from reg hours highs. Idk, might be heading back to support one more time. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the source but I did hear that Walmart is lagging compared to other retailers at the moment.

2021-04-06 15:17:24,wallstreetbets,Good DD.  The second they posted the Amazon fight plan I bought.  Down 13% still but great long term hold.
2021-04-06 15:34:22,wallstreetbets,"I YOLO'd on walmart last week. If I only picked an expiriy 1 week later I'd be doing well.

2021-04-06 07:32:15,wallstreetbets,A short float of 58 MM is about 1.5% of total float.  Dude is looking for a short squeeze on Walmart with less than 2% of 2.5 billion shares?  This shit is do stupid my head hurts.

2021-04-06 07:51:41,wallstreetbets,"hi, this setup is not dependent on whether a squeeze happens or not.

there are 3 patterns happening simultaneously , that makes the probability of the trade going in your direction very high."

2021-04-06 14:31:16,wallstreetbets,I was already in with a cost basis of $143-ish. Tempted to average down but it's not much averaging at the current price. The time to average down would have been when it dropped to $130.
2021-04-06 13:43:02,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely true. They've crushed any smaller local competition with their groceries. I live in one of these areas. If you want fresh produce it's your only option.

2021-04-06 19:56:33,wallstreetbets,How long do you plan on holding that? Genuinely curious because I sold my July call for 50% profit when wmt hit 140. Definitely got legs till 150 (and you have enough time to get there) but are you holding past that? Do you have a pt?

2021-04-06 08:21:40,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-04-06 08:22:29,wallstreetbets,"yeah, those are new"
2021-04-06 11:25:21,wallstreetbets,whats ur position my man
2021-04-06 09:49:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah RKT doubled in a pretty short timespan, but just gotta be ready to take profit as ASO gets above $50"
2021-04-06 11:16:35,wallstreetbets,What about now?
2021-04-06 09:17:14,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀
2021-04-06 16:17:47,wallstreetbets,You're way late on this.
2021-04-06 08:19:01,wallstreetbets,"The price is per share and a contract covers 100 shares so you math is right though I’d reorder it. 
(1.75 * 100) * 300."
2021-04-06 08:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I believe he paid $52,500 for contracts."
2021-04-06 08:19:24,wallstreetbets,"(1.75x100) gives you the cost per contract, then multiply by the number of contracts, so basically x\*100 where x is the cost per share for the contract, then multiply by the number of contracts"
2021-04-06 14:46:31,wallstreetbets,"It’s easier to just take the Equity (106k) minus total return (54k) and voila, he paid 106-54=52k for 300 contracts"
2021-04-06 08:33:39,wallstreetbets,You must not have a position in them...
2021-04-06 09:27:56,wallstreetbets,Greed is good.  That's what I heard anyhow.
2021-04-06 17:39:58,wallstreetbets,"It’s not 30 shares.....

The figure is at the top left.... 300 options contracts at $1.75.

That $1.75 is x 100 as each contract is worth 100 shares.  So each contract cost him $175.00 at the $30.00 strike price.

$175 x 300 contracts = $52,500 which is how much he paid out in total for these.

Because ASO is now trading around the strike price + the wild IV (Implied Volatility) the contract is now worth $3.55

$3.55 x 100 shares = $35,500

$35,500 x 300 contracts = the $106,500 equity that you see on the top right.

So, he’s up around 100% profit at the moment"
2021-04-06 09:21:45,wallstreetbets,Here have mine to replace that one
2021-04-06 09:51:52,wallstreetbets,"yeah, I think the short interest volume in this could make it act slightly differently but it needs to get up some more before it would trigger a margin call. Idk...$40 might do it, most shorts would have gotten in under $25"
2021-04-06 11:20:46,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking 34-36. Hedge funds are trying extra hard today. It’s soooo cute!
2021-04-06 09:42:12,wallstreetbets,"I couldn’t possibly accept such a kind gesture. Please, here, take it back"
2021-04-06 14:45:08,wallstreetbets,I can’t even tell if you guys are serious anymore. You make it sound like Hedge Funds are omnipotent and are the sole reason anything moves in the market
2021-04-06 11:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Still think it's going there?

Cuz IDK mang"

2021-04-06 15:58:42,wallstreetbets,They're 100% serious. When a stock goes down its market manipulation. When it goes up they've defeated the evil hedgies despite all the cheating.
2021-04-06 15:53:56,wallstreetbets,"When it’s shorted to this extent, yeah, they’re the only thing keeping it down"
2021-04-06 11:58:33,wallstreetbets,Just look at the candles 180D and a year out. Combine that with today’s volume and average volume and it’s a VERY bullish stock
2021-04-06 12:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Even if it’s not today, it’s gonna. I’m thinking when it hits 40 bears cry and cover which shoots it to 55 or 60"
2021-04-06 10:34:07,wallstreetbets,Found an extra one
2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ROO vs $DASH - Fading work-at-home plays - Pair trade? It seems to me like Deliveroo's IPO had a bad timing, getting caught in the middle of a rotation away from the work-at-home play and towards the economic-recovery play. Similarly, US comp Doordash lost 40% between mid February to mid March. Comparing the two:

**Doordash** (**$DASH**)

* 2020 revenue: $2.9 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%
* Market cap: $42 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.5x

**Deliveroo** (**$ROO**)

* 2020 revenue: £1.2 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%
* Market cap: £5.6 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.7x

So Doordash is trading at 3x the multiple that Deliveroo is trading at, with 4x the growth rate. Also, Doordash is the dominant player in a much larger market. Looks like a pair-trade.

**Thoughts?**

Fyi, losing 30% on its first day of trading, Deliveroo's IPO was the worst first-day performance for any company that IPO-ed with a valuation >£1 billion in London on record."
2021-04-06 06:12:22,wallstreetbets,Should’ve been called “Delivereeeeee” then it would’ve mooned like gme
2021-04-06 06:54:40,wallstreetbets,Deliveroo management is so stupid to list in London. What the fuck were they thinking?
2021-04-06 14:52:15,wallstreetbets,14.5x P/S for a fucking low margin delivery company that loses tons of money 😂🤣😂 I’m literally never covering my short on this pig
2021-04-06 06:16:04,wallstreetbets,My proprietary valuation method has both companies valued at the same number. A pair-trade if I ever saw one!

robinhood has the “option sellout process” which literally robs you on expiration day if you’re not careful."

2021-04-06 15:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Meh, it's not a *huge* thing. He's expecting a bearish move. Sure, he'll have to give back a large chunk of the premium, but it's not really all that different than going short, since a call that deep ITM will have a delta approaching 1. Imagine if SPY *did* crash to ~300. All that premium he got for selling deep ITM would be his to keep. Same risk profile on the upside too. 

I've done similar things with puts on things I had a strong belief would go up."

They're OK, and I love *some* of the data they display but the UI is too dense and I don't use 90% of it. What I do want to use is buried under a bunch of nonsense, and their support for ""custom"" options strategies is laughable."

2021-04-06 13:35:02,wallstreetbets,"After spending 2 weeks doing a DD on PLTR.

In it's purest form PLTR is very well made **data aggregation** platform. Forget all the AI bullshit, those people have no idea wtf are they talking about. Because those AI modules are build on top of the core platform kind of similar to plugin or extension.

Now I do believe that PLTR is the new Boeing. If you think for a second the current warfare is mostly digital and information. A good analyst/hacker with a laptop is more powerful than any battleship these days (those are just for shows). In the next 5 years, PLTR will be too important to fail for the US government just like BA before. It's very obvious lmao and I think Cathie sees it too."

📷📷

I'm not a huge fan of VIAC, but without a doubt they are a very profitable company. Their current market cap is equivalent to their revenue. Their forward P/E is less than 10. By all common valuation metrics, they are very cheap. The ONLY REASON the stock price is so low is because of absolutely massive liquidations. That is it. We may never see a stock have this much stock liquidated in decades.

VIAC is incredibly cheap. Hop on board while it's still cheap. Easily could go back to 100 in the next month.

Flat growth likely due to people going outside and covid deceleration. However, nice 26% growth in total workouts for dec 30 2021 three months end. Will also see baller growth for Mar 30 2021 three months end due to New Years resolutions and stuff like that. 

However, market is forward looking. I think guidance for Jun 30 three months end is going to be WEAK due to decreasing covid, people going outside, etc.. of course subs and all that are important, but engagement in the form of workouts completed is more important, imo. If engagement falls, which I think it will, then it’ll lead to lower subs. Guess we will see.

I except this one will continue to go up until then. Their stage 2 results showed a zero reoccurrence of breast cancer. Looks like it’s the real deal.

The VIX will swell alongside SPY, but will keep teasing us for the next 1-2 days. Only when everyone buys in at the top will the rug be pulled. I’ve seen this happen so many times over the last year.

TLDR: Buy very short term calls and sell tomorrow or Thursday. Expect a rug pull by the end of the week."

\-not a phone company anymore.. its an infrastructure company

\-recent deals in Austria, Brazil, Japan

\-Option chain constraining the price, gamma squeeze potential if rockets over the call walls at 5-7.

Last week was a complete dumpster fire for CS, and the revelation yesterday *that they haven't even unloaded all their Archegos-related shares* should have been gasoline for the blaze. A complete ship of fools led by a clown. But their stock continued to rise today after gains last Thursday. What the absolute fuck."
2021-04-06 17:10:20,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same thing. I'm amazed at how resilient the price has been. But then again that their 2.14B float and nobody owning more than 0.25% of it are probably helping them for now. Maybe one or two more reports of them doing more block sells and it will begin dipping.

2021-04-06 07:52:51,wallstreetbets,So you're saying if you have very bad short positions on other stocks and get a margin call you don't need to sell your other assets/longs to cover your losses for the bad short positions?

Margin calls already exist, and have already existed, these auto force sells. These have existed and will  continue to exist.

The ruling is regarding the DTCC flatly going to the hedge fund and going ""fuck you, sell"".

In the case of longs (long term belief in a company and funding) I imagine they'll be quite happy to leave them where they are.

In the case of companies shorting upstart newbies into the ground, I imagine they'll take a different approach.

But it's all speculation."

2021-04-06 08:30:04,wallstreetbets,"But with the new DTCC rules they can right? I'm speaking like Citadel and DTCC are working very closely together to collect shares and force other HFs to sell.

Also have in mind that Citadel is one of the biggest. So if they talk to their bank which they are using and say - Hey I see one of your client has bad short positions that is risking to collapse the whole bank (where Citadel has their money). In order to prevent this from happening we would like you to margin call that hedge fund or we take our money somewhere else. What do you think the bank will do the next day after that call?"

2021-04-06 09:01:48,wallstreetbets,They can’t force liquidate people who aren’t involved to cover someone else’s bill. It doesn’t matter how closet Citadel and DTCC are they can’t just close positions of other funds/investors to cover someone else.
2021-04-06 18:30:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly 💯

2021-04-06 09:36:31,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying they forcing others to sell other positions to cover someone elses positions. But to be forcing someone to sell (margin call) you can only guess who's first in line to buy the shares that is being liquidated.
2021-04-06 18:33:28,wallstreetbets,"I miss them days, would be nice, just so people can talk about something other than GME for a while."
2021-04-06 09:48:19,wallstreetbets,"That would be the bank doing that not citadel. 
  
Bruh what I don't think you understand is that if these types of conversations that you're describing were to happen, and there was proof they had happened, that Citadel would be *butt fucked*. 
  
The government, all of the regulators, everyone worth their salt would burn Citadel alive. It's impossible.
  
It's a lot more likely that the heads of Citadel and the heads of the DTCC are much more interested in fucking over each other than working together. Not to even MENTION:
 

What the fucking fuck does it matter if Citadel goes insolvent over GME? The DTCC is insured up to 70 TRILLION. Even Citadel isn't worth that much. Even APPLE is only valued at like 2 Trillion. So you gotta ask yourself does the DTCC give a shit about Citadel? No.
  
Edit: Also I just looked it up, Citadel is only worth 38 billion. If they went insolvent tomorrow it would bankrupt like 10-30 rich people and we'd all go on with our day."

2021-04-06 09:49:12,wallstreetbets,"A bank holds provisions against losses they expect to happen e.g. credit losses from loans. Anything unexpected, by definition, can’t be provided for. In which case it will go through p/l and directly reduce capital resources."
2021-04-06 11:44:30,wallstreetbets,"It's because thats what everyone got at the end of 2008. Nothing. No information, no retribution. We all just went ""that's it?"" As our homes went up in flames and the people who caused it continued life in their mansions"
2021-04-06 16:24:01,wallstreetbets,"The movie was in 2011.  They didn't have to show it.  We all saw it first hand.  The big short kind of showed what was about to happen, but the reality is that none of these people will ever come face to face with the consequences.  The bottom tier sales people on the phone got multimillion dollar golden parachutes.  These people are so disconnected from the actual pain caused by the housing collapse that the pain is at most theoretical, a thought experiment.  Which was partly the point of the movie."
2021-04-06 11:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, thanks for telling me how banks work, I've only been working in them for 25 years, including in accounting. A provision in the P&L is a literal journal entry. By definition a debit to the P&L requires a credit to the balance sheet. A 'charge' is exactly that - a debit to the P&L. It's a provision because it absolutely will not yet have been fully crystalized and will be sitting spread across multiple CCP & broker exposures on Operational books, & some won't have been unwound yet."
2021-04-06 12:38:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s not entirely accurate.

The Dodd Frank act was passed as a result, naked short selling was made illegal for all but market makers.

Capital holding requirements skyrocketed and these places have to pass simulated crashes to make sure they have enough capital on hand to survive.

Changes to how credit checks for loans on mortgages were made. 

You can argue it wasn’t enough, or wasn’t the right legislation. But changes were made."
2021-04-06 11:49:28,wallstreetbets,"> As our homes went up in flames and the people who caused it continued life in their mansions

Yes but the movie didn't show that.  At all."
2021-04-06 11:14:28,wallstreetbets,But they have exited the positions and losses have been realised hence capital impact not provision.
2021-04-06 12:03:20,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but most people didn't see that. They may have lost their home and life left in shambles, but it wasn't theatrical. It was mundane, it was getting a letter in the mail. And that's what this movie portrayed, a mundane reality of the horrors that ruined millions of people's lives."
2021-04-06 12:06:42,wallstreetbets,"You _think_ they have exited the positions. Even if, which I doubt, the entirety of their positions were long-only TRS there is no way of knowing if they have yet fully unwound the underlying (this can take weeks, if they're smart) or what global CCP and broker exposures that entailed. We may well be hearing about at least a portion of mark-to-market value, which will be hedged, but likely not perfectly (if they're smart).  

They will have a # that they think will likely be the loss and it will likely take weeks if not months to fully unwind that in the market and get Ops and Finance jubs to book it all off of market, broker and nostro exposures. So you book 4 yards to the P&L vs. BS special loss account, and then book delta from expected amounts back off BS and into the P&L if needed. 

Ultimately it all goes vs. cash at banks / brokers (i.e. capital), but the 'charge' is that initial hit.

Edit: we once had a client go under & spent three weeks working the unwind to get best fills. And that client was probably 1/5000th the size of this whale."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on $WKHS Aii to be clear this is neither a bull nor bear case for WKHS, it's just regular DD. Also I'm not putting emojis in this shit. 
 
**What does WKHS do?**
  
They make last mile delivery vans C-650 and C-1000 (these numbers denote storage capacity, not mileage or battery capacity). They have been making them for more than half a decade, whence they started by converting diesel vans into plug in hybrids. Their actual EV offering only began around 2018-2019. This is also the time they started showing off their drone delivery tech (which is not the point of this post, but it is why they are in ARKX). This is one of the only major EV companies that actually shipped (albeit very few) product.
  
**Fundamentals**
  
I don't know too much about what everyone looks for in fundamentals, and I'm absolutely garbage at reddit formatting but here's what I know. Since the financing that occurred from end of last year, they have a huge cash position and own the 250k sqft factory in OH. Their cash positions is hundreds of millions of dollars, so they are in a position to continue developing their production. This financing came from the 10% stake in Lordstown Motors, which recently put out two beta trucks and operates in the GM factory in Lordstown, OH. 
  
They came to fame when they were in the running for the USPS truck which obvs they didn't get and went to OSK, a decision which has a tonne of scrutiny on it (but probably won't change for at least another 6 months until DeJoy is ousted). 
  
They currently have a MKT cap of under 1.7B, despite having a backlog of 8000 trucks (easily 400mil worth of product). In comparison, ARRIVAL (which hasn't released anything yet) has a market cap of 9.5B, and NKLA (which has neither a factory nor a product) has a dwindling MKT cap of 5B. 
  
The stock itself follows $RIDE closely, and I'm mad bullish on $RIDE, so I expect to it at the very least take off when $RIDE takes off. Also, they have a 50% institutional holding, showing pretty solid support.
  
**Good Stuff**
  
So there is some good stuff about this company. 

1) They have shipped products - we know it's not vaporware. 
  
2) They own 10% of Lordstown Motors, which has a crazy high potential despite the hindenburg report. 
  
3) They are partnered with Hitachi to help them develop and finance the scaling of the manufacturing line. They are getting proper experience to help them build this line up. 
  
4) They developed this truck with UPS - they worked to get everything that UPS needs in a truck. 
  
5) They have a pretty high short %ge. Not enough to cause a squeeze IMO, but y'all like hearing that. 
  
6) The 10% owner of Lordstown still has some 5.5million/6million shares, and the CEO has 75% of their shares (down from around 490k to 350k). 
  
7) they are working on a holistic solution with their truck, including the drone (they've started the FAA certification to fly it)
  
**Bad Stuff** 
  
There are also reasons to be bearish on this company. 

1) They will eventually have a lot of competition. Most are 2-3 years out from making anything, but that competition will be Ford e-Transit and Mercedes Sprinters 
  
2) They are making 3 cars per day right now. They want to triple that by end of Q2. That's still 10 cars per day. that's not a lot. 
  
3) their drone solution needs some WORK. It's designed to be integrated with the truck but they haven't shown anything useful. I honestly see no reason this company should be in ARKX tbh. 
  
4) Although the CEO retained 75% of his shares, he still sold around 25%. Don't blame him, he'd been working there for at least 5 years, but it's still not nice to see. 
  
**My Opinion**
  
Based on the fact that they have a lot of strategic partnerships (namely Hitachi) and they own 10% of Lordstown motors, and how undervalued they are compared to competitors (especially those who haven't shipped anything yet) I expect them to climb up to about the $20 mark until about Q3, at which point the increased Q4 production rate should allow them to start really going past EPS rates. 
  
TLDR: WKHS is 1/5 the value of Arrival and is the only company currently shipping vans. Proceed with caution.  Maybe 2022 calls or Oct calls.

Positions: 80 shares @ $15.90"
2021-04-06 02:46:09,wallstreetbets,Hitachi like the floor buffer vibrator?
2021-04-06 03:22:57,wallstreetbets,Here’s some DD I did a couple months back. This was pre Oshkosh fuckery but a lot of it still remains. The USPS is increasingly being called on to halt and/or reverse the USPS decision. WKHS still has a chance but with or without it this company can achieve great things IF they ramp up production. That is the only thing suppressing the SP at the moment IMO. Anyways I’ve been 1000+ shares in since January 2019. [my WKHS DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letekr/makes_wsb_great_again_with_some_wkhs_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

2021-04-06 14:43:24,wallstreetbets,I remember looking at the stock when it was trading at $1 but never bought any because of not wanting an EV penny stock. Guh
2021-04-06 07:42:33,wallstreetbets,you might consider adding Traton (VW-MAN) to the possible competitors. They are investing hard in the field too.
2021-04-06 02:52:41,wallstreetbets,Yep but they do more than that. They actually are like the 90's GE of Japan.
2021-04-06 03:39:29,wallstreetbets,Are you still holding? What’s your PT? I don’t think we get USPS contract but I think if we prove capacity WKHS definitely gets orders just rolling in.
2021-04-06 01:39:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's definitely a mixed bag. I think it's undervalued when compared to the current overinflated market. Is it undervalued if we were to compare it to the market of 3 years ago? No.
2021-04-06 02:32:00,wallstreetbets,I’d buy Workhorse before I touch Microvast if that says anything

2021-04-06 11:32:15,wallstreetbets,LOL I should say hopeful. Don’t have any positions in them.
2021-04-06 03:36:08,wallstreetbets,The price definitely looks good right now. I’d lower my cost basis if I had the cash for it. Right now it’s split between this and Lordstown - esp after the short report
2021-04-06 09:06:51,wallstreetbets,They have a product.
2021-04-06 14:59:23,wallstreetbets,Honestly you were right to. The market is hyper inflated right now and I point out the WKHS is overvalued compared to the market of 3 years ago. But to today’s market it’s undervalued.
2021-04-06 03:42:01,wallstreetbets,Still have 1000 shares sitting. I’ve been in since $1.75 so I don’t mind the wait. Their drone tech is what I’m really interested at this point but the USPS contract is very well still within sights. You have congressmen who have mentioned WKHS by name pushing for the contract to get walked back.
2021-04-06 05:03:45,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ man you didn’t sell ANY at $40?
2021-04-06 03:44:50,wallstreetbets,"True. I’m just not gonna hope for it because everything I hope for gets ruined lol so Imma pretend it’s not even there. Because it won’t be for at least 6 months.

March madness handle and revenue numbers should be out soon, and the books killed March Madness.  Every single person I know that bets got killed, Gonzaga losing tonight to wipe out tons of futures and parlays was a cherry on top.

2021-04-06 09:20:59,wallstreetbets,"I was dicking around by selling $PENN calls on a weekly basis- really easy to do, it would ""crash"" to $29, rise to $35 during the week, then ""Crash"" and repeat. 

&#x200B;

I like to dream about what would've happened if I actually held onto those $32c instead of toss them around like Wendy's coupons."
2021-04-06 16:57:58,wallstreetbets,"anytime penn dips below $100, you buy."
2021-04-06 10:04:33,wallstreetbets,What’s your next play
2021-04-06 00:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention the overs club bet tonight that went UNDER.   I like the promos they have, as a shareholder of course.  Those jackets probably don’t cost much to make, and it’s free advertisement if the overs club does hit.  Also PENN will own 100% of barstool within 2-3 years and I think barstools revenue is very underestimated.  Their presence is huge and if they can lock down these younger customers with minimal ad spend they will be fine."
2021-04-06 01:52:43,wallstreetbets,How do you guys feel about DKNG? PENN is supposed to be included in S&P. That should theoretically pushes the price up but it has been going down since the announcement
2021-04-06 05:47:45,wallstreetbets,what app do you use to buy/sell shares?
2021-04-06 01:38:18,wallstreetbets,"I like PENN, only I like your mom and aunt RSI better..."

2021-04-06 11:43:59,wallstreetbets,I don't even know why it's so high or worth so much? Compared to what it was when it crashed it was only $30 at the highest level for the most part. #Salty
2021-04-06 16:14:37,wallstreetbets,"Sold my 2k share lot (99.11) at 104.72 today, bought the sex tape dip at 101.46 and sold an hour later at 103.90

Whenever this stock hits 100 it’s a great swing play!"
2021-04-06 00:13:43,wallstreetbets,FUD.   30% on PENN in three months..... GME +900% in three months.   💎🙌🦧
2021-04-06 04:23:23,wallstreetbets,Bought for 9 and sold by accident at 27. Tried to set a stop loss at the end of the day but typed in the wrong price. Sold right away then skyrocketed the next day so I didn't jump back in. Maybe my worst fuck up yet...

2021-04-06 10:58:10,wallstreetbets,Did the exact same shit I was planning on holding till $50 but sold some calls and lost them at 33 and got lazy and didn’t buy them back and they soon took off 🙃
2021-04-06 18:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, it’s been free money so far.  Everything works until it doesn’t, though."
2021-04-06 18:36:34,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure yet.  All my plays were made in March and April of last year.  I’ll probably be trimming when I can, I do like XOM moving forward as a safe dividend play.  I think CNK has more room to run.  Also deep in six, ccl, kss, spg but they already ran up a bunch."
2021-04-06 03:37:34,wallstreetbets,Haven't been in tune with Portnoy's ownership stake. I know he gave up some to $PENN... but I just can't see him giving up controlling power and it working out for barstool. It won't be as motivated if he were to stay.

2021-04-06 00:09:31,wallstreetbets,"We were originally told Archegos lost 10 billion that day, but it turned out to be closer to 100 Billion, could this be a much much larger loss as well?"
2021-04-06 00:50:33,wallstreetbets,What I’m really upset about before this became public about Viacom and others I looked on this unusual options website and all these were more than 50% puts when Viacom was in its 80-90’s then news comes out and it drops like crazy stupid me for not making a move on it

2021-04-06 00:18:26,wallstreetbets,"yup mine too. I'm genuinely surprised that it's maintained the levels that it has and hasn't dropped below 10. Also the AH today was odd, there's some buyers out there with strong convictions on the stock going up. It went from regular close down to 10.41 with the news, then finished at 10.73. In any case I expect at least 5 billion in losses announced tomorrow from Archegos alone, and around 2.5 from Greensill. Then there's the lawsuits being primed from hijinks the week before last, and the threat of major shareholders like the Emirate of Qatar to sell their shares."

I peak around and notice the guy is tall, well groomed, and in his late 50s or early 60s. He is frazzled and trying to get things together but doesn’t seem to know how to quickly manage the register and take orders. 

Then I hear him say “I don’t know how to do any of this. I had a great job for twenty years and now I’m here.” I remember him looking kind of pathetic and exhausted but I needed the coffee and got my order in.

2021-04-05 23:14:17,wallstreetbets,"One rule about long calls is just cut at -50% loss. After that it takes a miracle to get your money back and averaging down is just throwing money away at that point. Also since calls have unlimited upside, you are paying for unlimited gains but they will not be unlimited so consider selling a higher strike call simultaneously with your call buying to an even more degenerate gambler that buys way way OTM. That way at least you reduce your risk and cap your gains which sucks but it lets you know when to exit at max gain."
2021-04-06 02:33:58,wallstreetbets,Yes don’t bet against a bull market until you see an actual pullback

2021-04-06 11:47:17,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I've looked into BlackBerry out of curiosity when I saw them named on here in February and I bought a couple shares 

I know very little about the stock market but technology is my field, and Blackberry transitioned from primarily making phones to enterprise cybersecurity software as well as designing software integrated into cars to make them more secure, and I've read a little about them working on self-driving car's software systems. 

I don't see them popping off in the immediate future, but long term it definitely wouldn't surprise me if they do really well. Especially when self-driving cars start to become more reliable and more common, which we're honestly not that far away from.

Like I said I know very little about the market so this isn't financial advice, etc etc but this is just my guessing as a tech nerd lol"

BB is not poised for any breakout long term. QNX competes against Linux and is never gonna dominate that field. Their mobile security software has tons of competition as well, and also faces slow feature creep from Google/Apple.

I was actually a little surprised when I looked into them, but it makes a ton of sense how they've kept afloat all these years despite their phones not being particularly relevant since smartphones became the norm

Cybersecurity is absolutely not going away anytime soon and from what I've heard and seen from people I know who are looking into jobs in the field, that industry is in really high demand right now"

2021-04-06 15:55:04,wallstreetbets,"AGL is a monolithic poor relation to QNX in speed, security & function also has nothing to counter IVY. AGL is a weak hedge by the auto industry to keep BlackBerry in line over licensing costs. They chuck in a couple of mm each to keep it running as an open platform..but they use QNX, yes Ford does too, Ford just run Android in a container as infotainment.

Google has no RTOS, it has Android auto - infotainment layer which QNX can and does run in a hypervisor container.

BlackBerry is unparalleled IOT & security. Cylance AI is actually on-chip built into the kernel.

Also enterprise security products are 1st tier, they just need to sell outside of government and hugeco environments, they have only just begun that side...easily worth more than the current SP alone, competitors in that space have valuations multiples of BlackBerry, double digit growth to follow within a year.

Your Kung fu is weak"
2021-04-06 04:07:05,wallstreetbets,"Because they’re going grow revenues as more and more EVs use their software? I mean, even as more vehicles come with infotainments standard, that grows their revenues. Their revenues were stable in a year where car manufacturing took its biggest hit."

2021-04-05 21:59:07,wallstreetbets,"It’s a long term play. I sincerely believe this is a disruptor in the mortgage industry. This can 10x eventually. I wouldn’t be surprised 2-3x this year. I’ve had two coworkers recently refinance and they would never use another lender again.

Customer service is a big part of their success"
2021-04-06 12:00:20,wallstreetbets,"As a mortgage broker I can confirm rates are rising

Still low historically but the days of under 3% on 30 years are largely gone at most lenders (quicken especially, as their rates are generally pretty bad to begin with)

The question is how Quicken handles that shift. They still service a massive portfolio and have some of the best portfolio retention rates in the industry. Their marketing snags them a massive market share despite their reputation as a crappy overpriced online lender. So they’ll likely do better than other online or refi heavy lenders (I expect several of those to go under or even get absorbed by Quicken or one of the other big names).

And that’s coming from me, a mortgage broker who hates Quicken with a passion yet still has positions betting that this stock still has some life in it. I disagree that it’s a long term play though, I plan to dump it immediately once it hits a certain point."

Rocket actually looks like it is trading a higher multiple vs it’s competitors, so comparing to its competitors isn’t a strong argument because it would appear overvalued. $19-25 sounds like a reasonable share price considering it had a crazy outlier of a profitable year because of the pandemic. Mortgage rates are also going to continue to rise..."

Bud Light Borrowers watch the super bowl and go with what they see advertised.

They do little tricks like let you waive impounds for property taxes, at 5% down. So the Bud Light Borrower thinks that Quicken's ""total bottom line closing costs and interest rate"" are less than the other, objectively a shit ton better, offer.

A bet on RKT is a bet on the brains of Americans being smooth.

I own RKT. I am also a mortgage broker (100k /r/realestate reddit karma, top 20% in my profession) on the UWM side of the UWMC-RKT war.

I also own UWMC.

I do not own Bank of America or Wells Fargo. While they are still around, it's not zero sum between RKT and UWMC. UWMC takes wrinkle-brains from BofA/WF, RKT takes smooth-brains from same."

Those two things can coexist. I can simultaneously think a company is undervalued and also disagree with people that think they’re some sort of “game changer” mortgage company because like I said, in my opinion they aren’t. Doesn’t mean I can’t make money off where I think their stock will go in the meantime."

At this point, I kinda want to put on my /tinfoil and suggest that other MMs/hedgies are trying to unwind other major short positions by burying them with GME posts. I have a feel GME has become a shroedinger's extreme - it's either going to break the market by bankrupting several market makers whose short-selling ends up with them not being able to *pay* for shares that their traders technically own, or this *is* the squeeze and while we're going to bankrupt some hedge funds in the end it'll still be most of retail that ends up bag holding."

The wording for it in the tax code is vague something like ""effectively similar"". Shares though yes, when you sell for a loss and buy back within 30 days the new purchase gets added with the first one as your new cost basis and the sale is disallowed to be claimed as a gain.

2021-04-06 06:39:03,wallstreetbets,Bought RKT at $41 AMA
2021-04-05 23:17:20,wallstreetbets,Wait what? You know you can’t just compare stock prices right? What are their relative P/E ratios and sales and revenue growth? I think ASO could still be attractive on those measures but you can’t just say “DKS is at $80 therefore ASO should be $50”
2021-04-06 00:07:32,wallstreetbets,"I kind of agree with this (although sold my options today for a small gain). The thing is, earnings is out so if the price was going to adjust to reflect that then it should already be factored in (mostly). As to squeezes, after being in the RKT debacle (made and lost money so quick) I suspect that overall people are taking less exposure on short positions and covering quicker meaning that squeezes are harder to make money off of. Naturally this is due to the fallout from GME and some others where shorts (including a well respected, well not respected on wsb, investor like Gabe Plotkin) lost crazy amounts on a crazy situation.

I think it can go up still (if you have confidence in revenues and profits going forward then the company is insanely undervalued... note, I am not saying they will necessarily have those revenues and profits), just I have much less confidence in these squeezes happening then before."
2021-04-05 23:26:31,wallstreetbets,So is it too late to get in?

2021-04-05 23:22:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there’s definitively more to it than just this, I’m talking about it from the angle of if this does squeeze due to short interest + high ITM/ATM call OI, what could be a reasonable peak. Read a few reports comparing their fundamentals that would put ASO PT at 32-50 so took the higher end of that. This assumes then that Dicks is reasonably valued by the market"
2021-04-06 00:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think the company is undervalued even as a long term hold. I'm playing it for the squeeze potential (hence the short dated calls). I agree that investors will being taking less dangerous short positions on stocks due to recent events, but in ASO's case, they are already in a dangerous position (short 40% of a decently small float), while ASO has hit ATH in the last two sessions and has upwards pressure due to high # of OI on 4/16 calls + the earnings (though like you said this may be priced in at this point) + bullish sentiment leading to increasing volume"
2021-04-05 23:29:51,wallstreetbets,"My thesis is that this will squeeze in the next 2 weeks (read DD I / others posted for more deets) so following that I would say no it’s not too late, but reasonably I could also see this being the top.

2021-04-06 01:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. It is a gamble on the 4/16 calls (I actually did not think it was much a gamble leading up to earnings as I was 99% certain they would exceed revenue estimates, but once the info is known, well different story...). Assuming there are enough with uncovered short positions here, I believe this can go $40+ easily. I may still jump back in so will be paying attention. Good luck!"

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"XLNX Arbitrage Merger with AMD on April 7th XLNX is merging with AMD. When the merger is complete, every XLNX share will be turned into 1.7234 AMD shares.

The window for regulators to object the merger has passed. The last major hurdle for the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th.

Currently XLNX is trading at $130 while AMD is trading at $81. With the merger XLNX is 1.7234 * 81 = $139.6 versus $130 (current stock price). There's an arbitrage opportunity, and on April 7th the biggest threat to that arbitrage is very very likely going to be removed.

https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing

So what do you, an ape, do with this information? Well you buy XLNX calls expiring April 9th of course. It's mostly algos trading options at the moment, but it looks like right now you can buy calls at $132 strike price for $2 a pop, and $126 calls for $5 a pop, which are completely reasonably prices compared to their equivalent AMD options. But unlike AMD calls, you wouldn't need AMD to go up for this YOLO to pay out. If the valuation gap closes after the yes vote on April 7th, and AMD stays the same price, you make 350% and 160% returns respectively. And obviously , if AMD goes up a few percent over this week, you make even more.

Full disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor. I lost 17k in a GME option play right when Vlad decided to stop trading on RH.

...but I still went all in on this play. 137c on 4/9


edit:
AMD has to drop to 75.43 (130/1.7234) to break even. If it's lower, then it's a loss."
2021-04-05 20:43:08,wallstreetbets,"April 7th approval is basically assumed... positive price action from April 7th is minimal to zero 

On the extremely small chance that the merger is declined the negative price action on XLNX would be extreme. 

There is no real arbitrage opportunity, they will slowly start to trade more in line with eachother as a merger date gets closer and risk of no merger decreases... AMD can move down, XLNX can move up to achieve the ""correct"" price ratios. People can look at the APHA/TLRY merger if they want a current example of two companies doing the same thing right now. 

There is limited to zero upside, the eventual merger is already assumed and mostly priced in, in the unlikely event of a rejection the downside would be massive and instantly make your XLNX calls worthless. April 7th date is irrelevant to your short term weeklies, you will lose a ton of theta and might even lose some to IV decrease after the approval."
2021-04-05 20:33:54,wallstreetbets,Can engine explain to an ape what happens to options during this type of merger?    To the 12x. XLNX calls get converted to 12x AMD ?   I'm so smooth brained.
2021-04-05 23:04:56,wallstreetbets,The merger wont finish until later this year no? Just voting on the 7th or did i miss something?
2021-04-06 09:42:56,wallstreetbets,"With this already announced back in October and that's what the big bump was on Oct 9th, I feel like this merger is already priced into the stock. AMD probably will have some long term growth and long gains but not sure there will be a bump."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GOEV - Bullish theory - USPS Truck Contract Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.


Once I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)

If the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.

**E.V. low speed efficiencies**

Electric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. 

[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.
 

With a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.

307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.

Total Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh

Referring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction to be around 1.5x (9.760 / 1.5 -> 6.467 kWh) this puts the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. 

Now I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. 

Canoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.

For viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc

**Modularity**

A general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.
The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.


**Replacing other LLV**

The deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.


[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy. 


Looks like the short squeeze is back on if you trust ortex data see /u/brotherluminous for more information.

2021-04-06 03:26:22,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying that contract will be voided because someone made an inside trade and THEN it’ll get redistributed to Canoo?

Sadly not the case. The SEC would just go after the individuals who committed insider trading. Why did you think otherwise out of curiosity? Pretty sure there isn’t but would love to learn if there’s some esoteric SEC rule I’m unaware of.

If there isn’t one, you should REALLY do more research before making trades. On the legal front there’s an objective answer and if your argument is predicated on that answer you should...you know...figure that answer out first before putting your hard-earned savings on the line. (And trying to convince others to do the same.)"
2021-04-06 04:14:33,wallstreetbets,"LOL as a Canoo holder, this is NOT the bull case for Canoo. The bull case is their tech gets bought out by another company, or they start making their vehicles and show that the money they make on 2nd/3rd owners with a PROPER revenue streams puts them ahead of the pack. Either way I hope they survive just because I love that truck lol"
2021-04-06 03:26:37,wallstreetbets,Buddy the other EV in the running is WKHS. This has absolutely ZERO chance of getting this fleet contract. Maybe another one but they don’t build a truck designed for the USPS at the moment. I wish you tendies but this isn’t it for Canoo.

2021-04-05 20:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Unless they have different a e.v. they are gonna make for it I do not think they are good fit for being a mail truck.

How much does mail weight?

The current LLV is rated at 1000 pounds but its also small so is 5000 lbs necessary for mail?

The range (100) is lower from what canoo is offering (130-230) but as my post states there are mad gains at low speeds. So they could be secretly good at the 10-30 mph range, but since this is the best number they could come up with I don't think so. For me this is a big detractor because currently there are not many charging locations and it would not be beneficial to go back to home base every 100 miles when you can carry 5000lbs and over 1000 cubic feet. Yeah for fedex and other larger package mailer I could see their being a market for workhorse's E.V. but for usps no. If they can produce a farther range vehicle then yes why not take the benefits of more weight and distance.

Yes they look like deliver trucks but how easily and cheaply can they be repaired? These are suppose to last for decades of use. Canoo design philosophy is supposed to be base around not just the first hand owner implying repair-ability."
2021-04-05 23:05:10,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point. 

240v, your big laundry machine wall sockets, cost up to $[5000](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/how-much-does-a-tesla-home-charger-cost/) from 1700 depending on how much work needs to be done to get a tesla charger installed.

Now I don't see mail trucks at my post office I imagine they go back to a warehouse somewhere which is probably where they would charge.

Money here would be from the government not the post office, they recieved public funding last summer due to them almost going bankrupt. I imagine it would be included in the bill to give the USPS a new fleet."

2021-04-06 00:28:11,wallstreetbets,"The answer to your question is simply that there is no single reason, not even anecdotal, for Canoo to be involved in this contract. Buy or sell the stock, but not based on this speculation."
2021-04-05 21:19:36,wallstreetbets,"For me it seems to fit the roll of the current LLV but then I just browse reddit and don't have to go through the 100s of applications that were put in.

There will probably be a better fit than Canoo, Oshkosh and Workhorse if they go back to the drawing board on this. But there is one thing I will bet on and it that these will try to be a full E.V. fleet."

2021-04-06 08:18:46,wallstreetbets,"It was because the trucks were convertible.
You could convert them from ICE to electric.

So basically the USPS could buy a shitload including ICE versions that would have better range for places that don’t have the infrastructure for electric charge, and when things changed with better infrastructure they could swap from ICE engines to electric motors.

Wasn’t a bad deal, I could actually see why workhorse lost."

I was very bullish on canoo outsourcing their production, doing partnerships, and selling their skateboard tech to other companies.

but Aquila came on the call and said they're focusing on only producing their cars and trucks in their ""micro factories"". he isn't even clear on whether Ulrich is even the CEO; and awkwardly fumbled questions regarding Hyundai at the end of the call. id pass especially since all of canoo is basically everyone from faraday future (check out who works there... lots of faraday future execs)"

2021-04-05 22:19:21,wallstreetbets,"I know what I'm gonna put in. But if your gonna buy in when it's doing 5 to 20% down a day why buy in at 8.xx a share when you can wait can go down a dollar a share and then get an over an extra 10% in shares. If I fuck up its still below what it was before the squeeze which is still a deal in my opinion. And I gotta watch out for real whales who will fight the shorts with this squeeze.

Would my word carry more weight if I bought $1 million dollars worth of shares?
Getting behind a whale blind is just as stupid buying just from this. Balances can be photoshopped, I can literally type what ever I want in the positions that people so dearly ask for.

Like would it have made my argument any more convincing, probably not. There are 100s of DoD contractors out there who seem to grab these up like flys. Anyone one who is investing should think of that. I think Canoo stands a chance because of their supposed business model around second hand use, which has been the largest cost to USPS mail truck fleet.

If you don't like it play your democracy down-vote and find another company you can like."
2021-04-05 22:45:27,wallstreetbets,"No, but putting some of your theory you are giving me now in the DD would have be nice. IMO that makes it sound like a play people may be able to get behind. But not at $8 like you say. 

But, there isn’t a single thing about dollars in your DD. No price targets, no possible buy-in points, no possible %up or %down movement over the next X amount of time. 

Just a bunch of numbers about EVs and a dose of hopium that the feds will drop Oshkosh and pick up Canoo.  

They still have GM/Ford/WKHS/Tesla to compete with even if the fed contract gets pulled from Oshkosh. 

Just giving some feedback about the DD. As you said you can make up screenshots and shit, but hearing about even your future play and some price targets would be nice. 

Thanks for the replying with the expanded notes."
2021-04-06 00:07:24,wallstreetbets,"Honestly thanks for giving solid feed back.

Regarding price targets:

I know nothing about how stocks work during short squeezes, it will be a learning experience for me. Buy the dip, just don't buy in before it drops. Check your stock-o-scope and see if it lines up with your 432hz vibrating crystal stones.

For long term pricing I would want to say what they opened at roughly around 9 to 10 dollars till more news about production capabilities come out. There is no reason right now it should go up, results first then price increases. Yeah earnings were shit, what am I gonna do about it? Not complain.


USPS Deal: 

Yeah I think I should have been more clear about the implications of the USPS deal. I was aware when writing it would be a hard one to get because they are gonna go up against some power houses."

2021-04-06 14:02:04,wallstreetbets,It will go up I predict within the month with a high pop and then drop down and gradually raise up above the first pop. Also I wish you the best of luck.
2021-04-06 14:07:56,wallstreetbets,"I would  not buy options smoothbrain just shares.

If you would have read anything you would know that the price is going to stay at max pain point till eow and you are super f’d

Also most option premiums go into hedge pockets"
2021-04-06 14:14:33,wallstreetbets,You’ll have 100% loss

2021-04-06 16:00:45,wallstreetbets,Think or swim. Go!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-04-06 17:06:11,wallstreetbets,"In my mind the stock is worth 10 mil a share so I think you are doing great! 

   Did that help?"
2021-04-05 20:42:01,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay/what are your breakevens?
2021-04-05 21:20:52,wallstreetbets,Im happy you lost money because its said daily not to buy calls
2021-04-05 22:06:05,wallstreetbets,"Stop buying calls! Get you some shares, silly! 🙃"
2021-04-05 22:19:31,wallstreetbets,Stop buying options on GME. You will lose money
2021-04-06 09:06:23,wallstreetbets,It’s guys like you who help keep the market afloat. Keep doing the lords work.
2021-04-05 20:18:20,wallstreetbets,Bro why dont you just buy shares?
2021-04-05 20:23:21,wallstreetbets,You got this homie.
2021-04-05 20:33:37,wallstreetbets,Just buy the damn stock.  You will lose everything otherwise.
2021-04-05 21:12:15,wallstreetbets,You’re better off buying stocks out right. The options are just giving away money to the Writers.
2021-04-05 21:29:45,wallstreetbets,They will expire worthless
2021-04-05 21:43:27,wallstreetbets,"You idiot.  Calls are so expensive they arent even worth it if you did win.

GME needs to trade sideways for a month before they are going to be worth consideration again."
2021-04-05 21:56:22,wallstreetbets,Praying for you. Might be off by a week though...
2021-04-05 21:57:36,wallstreetbets,"No guarantees, only 🚀🚀"
2021-04-05 22:00:56,wallstreetbets,"imo.  this money should be invested in buy banana and hold banana .

But Hey , we're  free after all  my fellow Ape 

not a financial advise"
2021-04-05 22:09:11,wallstreetbets,Sell as soon as you're ITM. There's a chance it will hit those numbers for a very short period of time
2021-04-05 22:48:15,wallstreetbets,Buy GME shares not calls. GME is not normal.
2021-04-05 23:45:39,wallstreetbets,"Idk, they fucked with AMC last week while GME rose up. I think it’s GME turn to end in the red for the week while AMC goes up... just my opinion and not financial advice"
2021-04-06 02:47:45,wallstreetbets,Good luck and fuck you. Shares not options
2021-04-06 04:13:06,wallstreetbets,WHY ARE YOU BUYING OPTIONS YOU TURD
2021-04-06 04:26:46,wallstreetbets,Omg omg u ape
2021-04-06 09:35:14,wallstreetbets,Stop buying options and buy shares
2021-04-06 10:27:37,wallstreetbets,Fuck this options shit with gme at this point. Fucken pricks
2021-04-06 16:55:14,wallstreetbets,I dont know what this means 😂🤣🤣
2021-04-05 22:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Idea is that IV will go up to 140,000 bru 🙏🍗"
2021-04-05 20:45:38,wallstreetbets,"The short wall for Friday is at $250 according to DD I've seen. No reason to think $200 calls won't pay. 

It's the $800 calls that are feeding the HFs, these $200 Calls help us and have to be properly hedged. 

You are in the right track but that is not accurate what you said and you may do yourself a solid by reading the DD you refer to yourself.

My issue with OP is he did this on Robinhood.. we all gotta get out of Robinhood, at least if you are trading options. All options accounts on RH are margin accounts."
2021-04-05 20:59:10,wallstreetbets,what sub am I in?
2021-04-06 17:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Also Max Pain this week is in the 180-190 range, he's gonna be barely out of the money."
2021-04-05 21:05:54,wallstreetbets,The whole GME saga has taught me to be a member of theta gang and sell options to people willing to pay absurd premiums
2021-04-05 20:07:11,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-04-05 21:21:04,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-06 01:05:23,wallstreetbets,Sell puts.
2021-04-05 20:17:29,wallstreetbets,WSB is about lottos baby. Not safe betting on shares lol
2021-04-06 10:11:43,wallstreetbets,So buying calls is a bad idea because the premium is high due to volatility. In this case wouldn't people be better off selling cash secured puts ATM? I guess the only downfall would be needing to have the cash to buy the shares if selling puts
2021-04-06 05:14:11,wallstreetbets,Source? Don't believe that for a second
2021-04-05 21:51:59,wallstreetbets,Best comment here

2021-04-06 10:46:59,wallstreetbets,"This is my DD as well, the premiums are too high for the hedgies NOT to step on the share price to keep the stock price flat and collect."
2021-04-05 21:01:14,wallstreetbets,"There's two ways these could print:

2021-04-06 07:50:22,wallstreetbets,The share recall will likely be announced on 4/11 or 4/12.  I don’t expect it to go anywhere until the announcement.
2021-04-06 07:00:35,wallstreetbets,Buying common stock isn’t betting. Check the sub name retard
2021-04-05 20:05:49,wallstreetbets,🙏🙏🙏

2021-04-05 20:05:37,wallstreetbets,Bru the top was like $350
2021-04-05 21:00:25,wallstreetbets,Will do bru 🙏. Gonna exercise though - in it until the end
2021-04-05 20:39:04,wallstreetbets,In a good way haha??
2021-04-06 17:18:33,wallstreetbets,Lol this guy doesn’t have that long
2021-04-05 20:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Bought these mid-day today for roughly $20k, currently worth $17K"
2021-04-05 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,🪴🚿☺️
2021-04-05 20:26:31,wallstreetbets,After all the comments here I might switch into pure shares tomorrow or Wednesday but I want a big yolo shot
2021-04-05 20:25:04,wallstreetbets,❤️ thank you good sir
2021-04-05 20:39:34,wallstreetbets,I know man I would but I’m retarded
2021-04-06 17:20:02,wallstreetbets,Seeing you GME stans slowly moving away from being all happy go lucky as the cognitive dissonance increases has been a real joy to watch
2021-04-06 02:08:52,wallstreetbets,Uhm while the past weeks IV steadily been trending down? Do you know something I don’t? Either way Godspeed retard!
2021-04-06 12:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Even here where everyone is retarded(Specially after all the smooth brains that joined after GME), people where warned over and over to stay away from high IV options"
2021-04-05 21:24:01,wallstreetbets,Ok. And I am in middle of switching now to fidelity
2021-04-05 22:54:23,wallstreetbets,bought 420 calls for July
2021-04-05 22:18:59,wallstreetbets,Nah son.  At least 10 of those weekly 800s were sold by me.  Guess where that premium goes? More GME
2021-04-05 21:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Buying stock helps the squeeze. Options ""may"" help"
2021-04-05 21:55:02,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow is moon day! 🚀
2021-04-05 21:35:37,wallstreetbets,the only way a call is a good idea is if you intend to exercise it. Selling the call does literally nothing. Buying calls hurts the squeeze.
2021-04-05 22:01:46,wallstreetbets,they are margin accounts if you buy options?  how if margin is turned off?
2021-04-06 11:54:44,wallstreetbets,Everything done on RH is margin...
2021-04-05 21:44:47,wallstreetbets,Margin accounts are better than cash accounts for all practical purposes though
2021-04-06 07:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Max pain is 190 this week so far.  If they're floating around that, probably won't go over 200.  We'll see, though."
2021-04-05 21:00:34,wallstreetbets,Just keep extending them and its all good
2021-04-05 20:28:19,wallstreetbets,You don’t need leverage when a single share can go to 100k+
2021-04-06 12:38:52,wallstreetbets,Have you tried the dopamine high that comes with profits ?
2021-04-05 20:49:29,wallstreetbets,You are financing the hedgies bro. You are financing fraud.....
2021-04-05 20:35:58,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-05 22:34:36,wallstreetbets,"It seems like free money, right up until it isn't. Give it a shot. You feel pretty dumb when you sell that covered call for a big premium and it sky rockets on you for way more. Then you hope that the price stays up until exercise, otherwise it have dropped all the way back down by the time expiry comes around."
2021-04-06 02:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Thats what I've been doing. Sold dozens of  CSPs. Sold more yesterday and was up 900 a contract damn near instantly.

Thetagang for life"
2021-04-06 10:43:44,wallstreetbets,"I started doing this, don't know why i didn't earlier. its such easy money."
2021-04-05 20:21:14,wallstreetbets,My 380 shares is a bet.  Those options are a nice bottle of 30 year Macallan for the Call seller.
2021-04-05 21:00:26,wallstreetbets,"you're incredibly right, you might catch some downvotes from newbie fuck wads"
2021-04-06 07:38:39,wallstreetbets,"The fuck, since when is WSB about shares anyway"
2021-04-05 22:15:30,wallstreetbets,I love you too. I hope they print bro.
2021-04-05 22:22:35,wallstreetbets,Happy to be here. Lost the chance at 250k twice and rode them into the ground. Have 4K left. Fucked for taxes. Halp. GME pls squeeze this week lmao
2021-04-06 15:28:09,wallstreetbets,I know rip. They popped off twice before. But not this time :(
2021-04-06 17:58:06,wallstreetbets,What makes you think they’re going to do a share recall?
2021-04-05 22:23:43,wallstreetbets,Roll them to 4/23. GME’s going to close this week at 180 190.
2021-04-05 23:49:57,wallstreetbets,WHY WOULD YOU EXERCISE WHEN YOU CAN JUST BUY?!??!
2021-04-05 22:14:56,wallstreetbets,"No no, I mean it should say **yoloing** instead of **investing** in the center below the total value.

You got this bro, I'm rooting for you and think they'll all end ITM 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-06 08:44:32,wallstreetbets,youre gonna exercise all of those?  thats like well over 400k capital required
2021-04-05 20:41:16,wallstreetbets,Haha yes in a good way! Hoping I’m right but next 2 days we could see gme sitting at $350
2021-04-05 20:50:22,wallstreetbets,Oof. Theta will hurt. Sell higher strike calls turn them into spreads.
2021-04-05 20:27:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah but its really risky due to reasons other have wrote in here. Its really better just to go with shares.
2021-04-06 06:31:48,wallstreetbets,Truly retarded
2021-04-05 22:36:06,wallstreetbets,I just switched my options to Fidelity as well.
2021-04-06 02:40:01,wallstreetbets,"Make sure that you call them and change your type from Margin to cash. It happened to me. It showed margin while I never did it that way, called and they told me that transfer are put on margin, but it can be change by them to say cash. Takes 5 minutes."
2021-04-06 03:40:48,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-05 23:02:04,wallstreetbets,That's prob just fine lol
2021-04-05 22:19:54,wallstreetbets,Why on Earth do you think that
2021-04-05 22:23:34,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely misinformation. Sorry but you don't know what you're talking about. What you are referring to is OTM calls. OTM calls are not all calls..
2021-04-05 22:18:12,wallstreetbets,"That's not correct. There are 2 ways the squeeze will happen. 1) Shares are recalled by the owners. If you're paying attention, you'd know that well over 100% of the shares have been purchased. Let that sink in. Which is why #2 here is so crucial. 2) Perfect storm of an insane amount of Calls being exercised. Like on the order of 100,000 calls ending ITM at closing bell on a Friday, which are exercised. That's the key. 

No matter what everyone says, the shorts, mainly hedgies,  probably HAVE existed their positions. But now they've moved on to derivative shorts. They're still betting on the company to fail, but they've shorted ETFs instead, and synthetic shorts. 

Just because a stock has a larger than normal amount of the shares sold short, it absolutely does NOT mean it will experience a short squeeze. That's what people who downloaded Robinhood yesterday think. Almost all stocks have shares sold short. But not all stocks have a short squeeze. Again, let that sink in."
2021-04-05 22:19:30,wallstreetbets,"You can't on RH. ALL option enabled accounts are margin accounts. Every one. They won't make a change if you email them. 

You may be ok on RH if you don't have options and you actually do have a cash account but I can tell that OP here does not."
2021-04-05 22:20:41,wallstreetbets,Not if your broker gets margin called and sells your shares out from under you and/or restricts trading..
2021-04-06 16:36:14,wallstreetbets,Max pain doesn't mean shit until Friday at open.
2021-04-05 20:58:56,wallstreetbets,remindme! 5 days
2021-04-06 05:22:45,wallstreetbets,Need someone to do a Seabiscuit meme for this YOLO to print.
2021-04-06 12:32:32,wallstreetbets,Forgive my ignorance.... How do you know when to cash out of the  195 call?  When the price hits 195?
2021-04-05 20:08:14,wallstreetbets,Yup. I’ve been selling anywhere from 7-13 CCs on my shares every week since January and guys like this make it easy to pull in ~$5k+ a week (current weekly average is 2.98%).
2021-04-06 11:38:55,wallstreetbets,"This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/wallstreetbuystocksandhold"
2021-04-05 21:03:03,wallstreetbets,Yewwww heard that
2021-04-06 00:23:02,wallstreetbets,"No share will ever reach 100k per, never happens. The SEC halts trading first and reprice it.

Step back into reality, it’s just never happening.  And stop misleading people, it will cost them money in the long run."
2021-04-05 23:53:52,wallstreetbets,This sub has taught me NEVER to sell options if I don't have the shares or the cash. I don't even believe that spreads are completely safe anymore.
2021-04-06 01:09:22,wallstreetbets,As someone that was buying $200 cost slightly OTM weeklies when GME was $40-50 I thank them for their service and gainz. It's about time for me to get back on the $200 weeklies train - $240-250 strike
2021-04-06 04:52:09,wallstreetbets,Pretty much this. Every time gme blows up 100% in a day it’s usually followed by another huge 80%+ the following morning and the options price goes up like 30x it’s absurd
2021-04-06 07:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Eh, everyone looks like a genius when the market or a stock keeps going up.  Same with CSP's it's free money until one day the underlying tanks hard and the premiums ended up not covering your loss.

The only time CSP's are good is when you want to buy the stock anyway but it's overpriced.  It's like a better way to set a limit buy."
2021-04-05 20:23:26,wallstreetbets,"You can hold shares forever. Not saying it isn't a bet, but it isn't a lotto. I do however appreciate the scotch reference sipping on some macallan right now."
2021-04-06 08:31:58,wallstreetbets,"For this stock, the DD even back in november was explicitly about shares because there were no target dates and options would be entirely speculative, instead of speculative with someone else's logic that you borrowed"
2021-04-06 01:05:58,wallstreetbets,Taxes delayed until May now.
2021-04-06 10:46:09,wallstreetbets,how are you fucked for taxes if you rode 250k down to 4k in the same year?
2021-04-06 16:06:49,wallstreetbets,I made the same mistake last month brother  around 3/19. Options are ape krptonite
2021-04-05 20:43:50,wallstreetbets,That would be game changing. Is there a catalyst you’re aware of this week?
2021-04-06 00:06:56,wallstreetbets,I switched to Fidelity as well.
2021-04-06 17:18:09,wallstreetbets,You can switch options? Does it take the same 3 days?
2021-04-06 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of people transferring from RH to Fidelity (and others?) aren't aware.
2021-04-06 14:59:53,wallstreetbets,"I use fidelity but only just getting into options now. Isn’t the data for fidelity on a 15minute delay? I would think that makes options trading not easy. 
I’m a chimp on fidelity but maybe One day I can become an ape."
2021-04-05 23:12:20,wallstreetbets,Did you see they're an astronaut
2021-04-05 22:28:08,wallstreetbets,It's not people exercising calls that will cause it. It's the market makers buying shares to cover the calls as they get close to being in the money that will do it.
2021-04-06 00:27:30,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget about the price rising high enough the broker margin calls the HF.  They fight like hell every time we approach $380, there is a margin trigger somewhere near that number."
2021-04-05 22:33:55,wallstreetbets,No it's not. You can turn off margin and still trade options.
2021-04-05 22:21:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't have margin enabled, you need RH gold for that. But I can trade options. Your mileage may vary."
2021-04-05 22:23:40,wallstreetbets,"so maybe its different for me, when i opened an account last year with them, my first deposit bounced, restricting my instant deposit feature, and turned margin off, my account is still this way as I have no use for instant deposit or margin, but just for learning purposes i experiment with very cheap options.  are you saying even tho it says my margin is off and ID restricted, i am still a margin account for having call options?"
2021-04-05 22:26:44,wallstreetbets,You’re only going to get margin called if you leverage to the tits and buy shares on margin. Trading was restricted for everyone using cash or margin. Do you even know what margin is?
2021-04-06 13:10:55,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. You may have to do simple calculations to determine when it’s worth it to cash out. This is because of premiums. I just assumed, but I think 195 is his break-even point. So he’d want to cash out if it goes above that. Here’s an example:

Let’s say X’s stock is currently $10, and you think in the next 30 days, it’s gonna come out with a cure for cancer and it’ll print like the federal reserve working overtime on pure Colombian coke. But IV is absolutely insanely high and premiums will cost you out the ass. Let’s say premium is $3.50, and strike price is $15. Then breakout point is $18.50. Anything below that would be a loss in money because of the crazy high IV that made the option not worth it. But if the price goes way above 15, the options contract will increase along with the stock price, so it may be worth it to wait a while. Bottom line, you need to factor in the premium to determine break-even point, and then determine who much the options contract is worth when prices increase. This will be crucial in determining what’s the best bang for your bucks, because options have more factors than just buying shares. That’s why it made no sense to buy GME call options a while ago because IV (implied volatility) was so high that premiums were gonna destroy you even if you neared your breakout point....it’s just way too much of an uphill battle if that makes sense"
2021-04-05 20:30:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m dumb as fuck and much like other idiots on here, would lose massive amounts if I tried options. But, how are you caking up on, what I’m guessing stands for, Covered Calls? Don’t want to attempt but if money is that easy why aren’t more people doing it? Also... wtf is a covered call? Willing to google but you guys make things easy for my dumbass to understand and google doesn’t always."
2021-04-05 20:29:35,wallstreetbets,"You better stop
Countdown sequence is engaged"
2021-04-06 11:29:15,wallstreetbets,Like damn once I was able to understand basic options trading I realized I could make a klilling on the ThetaGang by writing covered calls. But my ass as nowhere near enough GME to do this lol. I think I will try my hand on some sub $5 stocks and see if I'm a true retard
2021-04-05 21:31:33,wallstreetbets,"I've been looking into selling CCs as my first foray into options because they feel the safest from what I've seen. How does the theta and IV factor in from the writing/selling side though, if you don't mind me asking?"
2021-04-06 16:33:04,wallstreetbets,Then what happened to Bethshire Hathaway at 400k a share
2021-04-06 09:06:30,wallstreetbets,frick
2021-04-06 01:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Did you see the spreads on GME and AMC when RH halted trading? Was insane, there was no market maker arbitraging options. It was as close to ""free money"" as you could get as people were being stopped lossed at market sells on highly valuable options."
2021-04-06 02:13:59,wallstreetbets,You shouldn’t sell naked calls if you don’t have the assets to cover when push comes to shove. In retard language: Don’t borrow. I repeat don’t borrow. Borrowing is the reason why we’re in an epic clusterfuck in the first place.
2021-04-06 10:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Spreads are definitely not safe. Exercise risk is real. IMO, keep it simple and don't get cute."
2021-04-06 08:30:20,wallstreetbets,How did this sub teach you naked options arent safe when most people aren't even able to trade naked options
2021-04-06 10:22:10,wallstreetbets,"IV is finally getting back to where it might make sense to buy. I wouldn't sell CC at this level. 

And yeah, I left money on the table, but honestly, looking back at everything I'm still happy to have written those contracts. The premiums were insane. If someone else wants to gamble like that, I'll happily take the other side. Occasionally I'll lose."
2021-04-06 15:37:07,wallstreetbets,"I've been **gambling** (it is a pure gambling) on gme weeklies for months now. Still up decent gold ducats. Even in bad weeks there was almost allways a time where you could close your position at a somewhat acceptable loss.

Right now these options are basically free (for gme standards)."
2021-04-06 07:55:19,wallstreetbets,"I never said I was a genius. It is a pretty retarded play

But I've made more than enough to eat hundreds of shares if it becomes worthless.

Made over 200k so far"
2021-04-06 09:32:25,wallstreetbets,"thing is, these ridiculous GME premiums have already netted me double what I put in. It's literally free money, and I've only been exercised once."
2021-04-05 20:32:12,wallstreetbets,Respect.
2021-04-06 01:09:24,wallstreetbets,Well I mean for this year. Already filed last years and owed but not much. Scared for this year lol
2021-04-06 10:55:51,wallstreetbets,Well I sold them towards the bottom twice and got 50k. Chucked that all back into options and lost it. So have to pay cap gains on that 50k+ since now it’s a wash sale
2021-04-06 04:03:37,wallstreetbets,He's humoring you.
2021-04-06 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,Been seeing people say this shit every week for the last forever
2021-04-06 00:51:46,wallstreetbets,I switched to Fidelity as well.
2021-04-06 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I had options and shares in RH. I transferred everything over to Fidelity. I highly recommend just calling Fidelity, like a lot of others did.. guy on the phone was 5 stars. He covered everything and made sure I knew what i was doing. He joked he had it down to a science because of how many others have done this.

Only took a couple days and everything is in Fidelity and usable now, including my calls.

The only thing that didn't transfer was partial shares. The partials will be left behind at RH and sold the morning after the transfer at open. Then it'll take 5 days for the money to clear. Not sure what happens if youve a balance in your account, I didn't have a balance in my account (hence the partial share). 

I highly recommend calling Fidelity right now"
2021-04-06 00:16:45,wallstreetbets,They made me turn off options trading to disable margin
2021-04-05 23:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Not on robinhood.

You Keep saying I'm wrong. Can you show me that I'm wrong?  Have you actually looked into this. 

I had to call Robinhood to get clarification from them and it lead me to transfer everything to Fidelity last week. 

Please show me something showing me how to have an options account on RH with all margin turned off"
2021-04-05 22:24:43,wallstreetbets,There default account type is margin. If you have instant deposit on you have a margin account.
2021-04-05 22:34:34,wallstreetbets,"You don't need gold for margin. Gold gives you like unlimited margin access.  The regular level two options accounts have up to $1000 instant credit available and will front you your money when you make trades.

Another way to tell is if when you make a trade, are the funds available right away? If so.. You're on a margin account. Gotta wait a couple days for funds to clear before you can reinvest or have your funds clear? That's probably a cash account then."
2021-04-05 22:31:17,wallstreetbets,"You're wrong. Email them if you don't believe me. If options are enabled you're on margin, not cash. The only way to turn off margin is to go to options trading and turn it all off at once. There are numerous posts about this."
2021-04-05 22:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Are you aware that in January RH got margin called themselves and that that's why they restricted trading?

Yeah a margin account is like a credit card and a cash account is like a checking account.. It's pretty basic stuff."
2021-04-06 13:17:23,wallstreetbets,It sorta does. I just have a lot to learn. There's more to it than I realized.
2021-04-05 20:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Covered call means you own the shares and lock them in your account and don't touch them until the option you write expires. You need 100 shares to write an option since the contract size is 100 shares each. Lots of people ARE doing it, but it's people who can afford hundreds of shares, and they're likely not talking about it a whole lot because by writing a call on GME you are technically ""short"" on the stock, even if you're really playing it long, you're capping your max gains when the stock fucking moons and someone else will end up being assigned your shares when they buy them at the strike price from the option. Most options contracts aren't written by retail investors, but instead by market makers."
2021-04-05 23:54:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, /u/th3t1nm4n nailed the explanation with the exception that I’m only short the option, not technically the shares.

It’s “easy” because I have currently have 1151 shares averaged up to a cost of $55 a share, letting me sell 11 covered calls every week.  You can sell covered calls naked but that’s really really dumb, especially on GME.

It’s also risky since I limit my gain potential for the squeezes, so typically during weeks that are actually point to it, I typically only sell super OTM calls, if any at all."
2021-04-06 02:11:12,wallstreetbets,A covered call means you possess the actual 100 shares covering the call you are selling. That’s write (gang gang) you can also sell calls.
2021-04-06 11:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Do a PMCC (poor man’s covered call), my friend!"
2021-04-06 00:01:51,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure what you mean exactly but theta is “time decay”, which is how the price decays based on time until expiration. Checkout /r/thetagang they have a ton of good resources!"
2021-04-06 10:05:28,wallstreetbets,"In the Black-Sholes equation, theta and IV are two independent variables."
2021-04-06 18:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Berkshire Hathaway  is actually worth that price.. 

RH tapped out on the clearinghouse deposit around 350$ a share, because stocks with extreme volatility require a higher deposit. 

So what they're going to have 3x the deposit to get to 1k all for GME? 

When that's in the billions? That seem likely? You really think Vlad and crew are going to put up 10 billion as a deposit so you guys can sell out GME at 1k+ LOL? Really ?

Nevermind the 10k or 1mil a share folks here tout."
2021-04-06 02:20:09,wallstreetbets,NO FUQING SH1T! lol
2021-04-06 02:08:44,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate on this a bit? I’m retarded
2021-04-06 10:44:51,wallstreetbets,i try to sell naked calls but my broker won't let me. lolol
2021-04-06 08:02:30,wallstreetbets,You made 200k selling dozens of CSPs 🤔?
2021-04-06 08:06:35,wallstreetbets,You must have millions or at least 1 mil in your portfolio by now?  Mind if I see a screencap of your positions?
2021-04-06 11:06:08,wallstreetbets,but the wash sale would assume a higher cost basis on whatever you bought (and now sold) so your taxes would zero out. I was under the assumption that wash sale rules were just a problem if you still owned the underlying.
2021-04-06 01:07:44,wallstreetbets,"I switched to allstate, are you in good hands?"
2021-04-06 03:06:41,wallstreetbets,"I didn't switch to Fidelity, because I was already with them from the start."
2021-04-06 02:03:52,wallstreetbets,"Me too, today."
2021-04-06 18:14:09,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-05 22:40:10,wallstreetbets,You can turn off margin. It's in the settings. When you open an account they even ask you if you'd like to turn on margin. I hate RH but let's not spread fake b's trying to scare people.
2021-04-05 22:49:03,wallstreetbets,"Seems to operate on the ""good faith"" principle that fidelity also uses for daily trades. No holding period. But definitely does not have margin enabled. Can only trade up to my cash balance. There is an option to apply for margin IF you upgrade to gold."
2021-04-05 22:41:22,wallstreetbets,Wrong! You can trade options and not be a margin account. How do I know? Because I still have GME shares with them and can do options trading even though I turned margin off.
2021-04-05 22:37:39,wallstreetbets,"I guess I will have too cuz i’m staring at my RH gold account that says “margin off”.  and Ive seen all the posts about it,  this isnt news, its just that what youre saying, doesn’t line up with anything thats been clarified previously.  I’m not wrong about whats literally in front of my face my visions 20/20, youd think if you were 100% right, id be looking at “Margin On” 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-06 00:08:01,wallstreetbets,"They didn’t get margin called, they were asked for larger deposits to continue trading one volatile stock.
Because of T+2, they had a fuck ton of money on the table. That has nothing to do with margin.

A margin account lets you leverage equity you already own, nothing more.

A margin account is desirable because there are certain positions you can’t take with out it enabled"
2021-04-05 23:39:08,wallstreetbets,"By writing a call you’re short the option, not the underlying. All else is correct here though."
2021-04-05 21:20:26,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be me tho. I sold a dumbass $60 CC before the peak and lost out on basically all my sell limits I had established weeks before.  Had a waited 2-3 effing weeks I woulda 30-40k maybe.. instead cashed a measly 6k on the CC like a paper hand snitch. 


But, now got sitting on 105 contemplating the weekly CC but afraid I’ll get burnt again hahah"
2021-04-05 22:34:33,wallstreetbets,This
2021-04-06 11:33:23,wallstreetbets,"O hell no does this involve margin hahahaha. Was working on a group project yesterday and one of my groupmates took us down a TNA crayon rabbit hole where he was explaining how he managed his leverage, and it sounded reasonable.  


So ok what do you mean by PMCC haha"
2021-04-06 11:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I got the basic mechanics where you BUY to OPEN an ITM call like 365DTE, and then you SELL to OPEN an OTM call.   


As long as the ITM call expiry is well past the OTM call I would be selling right? I guess the contract for a yearly would generally be less than the cost of 100 shares of an underlying. I have not looked at that but I will when I check the options chains later. Thank you MdBarney"
2021-04-05 20:02:39,wallstreetbets,Theta sounds pretty hot. Ngl.
2021-04-06 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,they are directly related though is what I was trying to convey. just something that can be easily understood
2021-04-06 18:29:04,wallstreetbets,Bruh have you read the dd there’s trillions in insurance
2021-04-06 02:23:35,wallstreetbets,"For example, AMC $5 calls were trading for $3 when the stock price was $11. $11 minus $3 premium minus $5 cost of stonk = $3 profit per 100 shares INSTANTLY. It also happened to GME during halts and the RH shit."
2021-04-06 08:09:41,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Doing the 150's...even when it dropped to 50 I was selling the 150s. Was getting over 10k a contract. Even the ones I sold yesterday were worth over 4k apiece.

Works until it doesn't, right?"
2021-04-06 11:07:26,wallstreetbets,I see I’ll have to read again. I know it adds to my cost basis but thought that’s the harsh part is if you lose money then buy back in you can’t take that off your gains and you’re screwed lol
2021-04-06 01:58:53,wallstreetbets,You might as well switch to Subway
2021-04-06 16:42:30,wallstreetbets,Why did I read that in that guys voice from the commercial
2021-04-06 18:23:02,wallstreetbets,"No prob. Good luck. 

Remember that if you're scared the squeeze happens while the transfer is happening: squeeze will prob take at least a week for us to climb to insanity with all the halts, and the transfer will force your Diamond hands so you don't panic sell early."
2021-04-05 22:43:37,wallstreetbets,Instant deposit is a form of margin. I just recently went through everything to switch to a cash account with them.
2021-04-05 23:04:05,wallstreetbets,"It's still a margin account.

Don't take my word for it though.. Like I said.. Email them.. it's you're money.. but I'm trying to help people since I went through all of this about 6 days ago and back then I thought just like you did.

All those people telling you to get the heck off Robinhood are trying to help you.. But in the end.. You can only help yourself."
2021-04-05 23:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Email them and share with us your screenshots.. How do I know you're wrong? I went through this all this last week. 

Robinhood has changed a lot of stuff the last month or two. Only way to turn off margin is to turn off options.

There are like 100 posts about this I can't believe so many people are arguing with me about this.

You're all in denial because you don't want to take the time to switch brokers (lazy) and also you're in denial about what facts you think you know. 

To turn off margin you have to go to:
Investing > options settings > trade on expiration must be turned off."
2021-04-05 22:43:00,wallstreetbets,Dude you're ok. You can trade options and have margin off. Those folks don't know anything. As long as you have margin turned off you're ok. You can trade options.
2021-04-05 23:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Investing> options settings> turn off trade on expiration date

That's how you turn all margin off."
2021-04-06 07:27:23,wallstreetbets,Check your facts. RH was margin called and that's why they froze everything. It's gonna happen again and they are gonna tamper with their users accounts again
2021-04-05 22:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Same.   If I had 1000 shares I'll probably do half in CC but with a measly 150 shares .. its risky.   As history has shown, GME can 4-5x or lose 50% in 1 day.

Even today.   I held off from buying in at $160 thinking it would get attacked down to the $120 levels again so I was ready to load up more there .. imagine my shock to see it bounce back to 200 in less than an hour.

Way to volatile for my smooth brain to try any shenanigan.   I just HOLDDDDD."

2021-04-06 11:09:57,wallstreetbets,"nah the re-buy you did of the shares will be at a higher cost basis. You get screwed when you have wash sales towards the end of a year then the cost basis of the shares you own go through the roof but you hold them through year. You see all of the profits on your taxes but none of the 'sales' at that point because you have a huge cost basis on what you are holding going into the new year. Huge gains in first year, huge losses in second year which totally fucks you."

I have margin on my real account so I know that that is... If I have $100 cash in the account I can invest up to $200 but I pay fidelity 2.5% interest on the balance over $100.

2021-04-05 22:48:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah no worries. When I opened my Robin Hood I made sure margin was turned off.
2021-04-06 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,"No. That's what Vlad told us at time. He lied. RH was hit with a margin call.

They were hit with that margin call at 3am the day that they halted trading. This wasn't admitted until Vlad had to get in front of Congress in February.

2021-04-06 16:53:30,wallstreetbets,"You one again don't know what the hell you're talking about, any no where in that article is margin call mentioned.

This has to do with clearing house deposits, and t+2 settlement. 

The received a letter and call from the NSCC :

From the standpoint of the NSCC, the soaring price of stocks like GameStop created fears the clearinghouse could be left in the lurch if prices suddenly cratered. Specifically, brokerages like Robinhood might not have the capital to cover a potential collapse in prices between when shares were purchased on Wednesday and when they cleared two days later. In the same way a brokerage can ask an individual investor to pony up more cash to cover a margin call, the NSCC wanted Robinhood to plunk down more money to avert risk.

In the course of a weekend [conversation](https://www.mrhack.io/blog/elon-musk-vlad-tenev-robinhood-ceo-full-transcript/) with Musk on the app Clubhouse, Tenev stated that Robinhood ultimately coughed up $1.4 billion in cash rather than the $3 billion the NSCC had requested. While this suggests Robinhood had somehow whittled down the demand, the reality is somewhat different.

According to the source close to the NSCC, the lower amount came about because of Robinhood’s decision to limit trading in GameStop and other “meme shares.” By limiting trading, Robinhood would have fewer of the volatile stocks on its balance sheet while also allowing earlier trades to settle, reducing the company’s overall risk exposure. While Robinhood did speak with executives at NSCC, the conversation entailed confirming that limiting the stock sales would count toward reducing its $3 billion collateral demand—but did not result in the amount being reduced.

Stop pretending you know what you're talking about, RH is a Finra regulated broker dealer.   
Nothing about this was a ""margin"" call lol it was about having capital for the t+2 settlement. 

Margin calls include force liquidation of the assets, why weren't ALL RH customers liquidated if their BROKER was margin called ? Got an answer there? Because that's how that would work."
2021-04-06 08:25:46,wallstreetbets,It wouldnt make sense if I sold a deep itm csp and it immediately got assigned...those options wouldn't have a reason to exist.

If you sell a CSP, that gives the holder of the put the option to exercise, i.e. sell 100 shares when the stock is below the strike.

If you sell at a strike of $150, and GME is $50 then they can exercise and make you buy at $150 while they can buy at $50 but sell it to you."

I can buy a call or a put right now, and immediately exercise it. Doesn't matter what the expiration is, doesn't matter whether it's ITM or OTM, or by how much.

The part that both of you morons are missing is that if you buy and immediately exercise, you lose money overall. The premium is never enough to offset the difference because of theta (and other reasons). *That* is why it never happens. But guess what, if I buy a deep ITM call, 45 DTE, and the underlying goes up 10%, I can exercise tomorrow, sell my 100 new shares and make an overall profit.

And fuck yourself with your ""I'm not really here to teach options trading"" bullshit."

This is about to squeeze unbelievably, it’s highly undervalued. Revenue is still increasing and will continue as COVID reopening leads to higher sports equip & clothing sales in addition to the gun sales. A reason shorts were attracted was the company had over 1B in debt at IPO, but they have paid 40% of it off now. CEO used to be with Foot Locker and doubled their stock.

Their margins are historically pretty low, so they carry lots of debt. 100 year old company that decided last October was the time to go public. Wonder why? It's so they could put their two best quarters ever (by 150%) on the 10q, the stock would go up, and the insiders/execs could cash a bunch out of the business to ""dumb"" public markets instead of shark private equity if they hadn't gone public.

They are using the $200,000,000 from the IPO to pay down debt and update stores. They're not using it to a bunch of new stores. They have too much debt and their margins are too low to go on a big growth spurt.

They typically net $120,000,000 a year on 260 stores, be careful. This $305,000,000 year is a covid anomaly. 

Another thing to watch out for. They've got 222,000,000 rounds in the chamber in the form of shares they are authorized to issue if they so please. Don't be surprised if they go full AMC. This company carries $3.5 billion in liabilities against only $4.5 billion in assets. Again, that's rough when your margins are only ~5%."
2021-04-06 03:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Couple things:

Can’t compare market cap to revenue — one is an equity metric and the other is a capital-structure neutral metric. (For companies with significant debt this becomes a bigger issue.)

Run rating Q2 revenue only works if there’s no seasonality and/out an outsized quarter for exogenous reasons.

Biggest thing: Revenue divided by shares is not equal to share price. Market cap divided by shares is the only way to get there. You can determine what you think market cap should be by doing an intrinsic valuation (DCF) or a relative valuation (using a median multiple of comps or precedent transactions to build to enterprise value and then backing out net debt to get to equity value. Then dividing by shares to get to price per share.) Right now your math has no basis in reality. It’s of roughly the credibility of saying, “They sell 200k kayaks divided by selling 2.5k fishing rods = $80 fair value)”

Stock could definitely be attractive but you’re running the wrong math. Happy to provide some resources if you want to brush up, but don’t think you should be guiding people towards spending their money until you do.

If you ran those analyses the answer could very well be that ASO is undervalued...just gotta do the right work to confirm that. I generally don’t like shitting on people who are trying to learn like some people on here but I do get frustrated when folks pump stuff with factually incorrect information trying to get others to spend their/their family’s hard-earned savings.

That is not cool man/lady.

Edit: Funny enough I’ve been long ASO since IPO but probably selling soon after these outsized earnings that I view as atypical. Market typically punishes companies that don’t live up to prior earnings both YoY and sequentially. May wait a few weeks to see if it pops with all the Reddit interest and sell some covered calls in the mean time to soak up the IV on the options."

2021-04-06 10:27:37,wallstreetbets,"What is this? You don’t divide revenue by shares to get a per share price...
A few more questions:
1) What’s your justification for Q2 revenue being a run-rate figure? Is this a non-seasonal business with strong recurring revenue trends?
2) Why is it undervalued? What multiples are you comparing it to?"
2021-04-06 10:52:08,wallstreetbets,Exciting numbers indeed. Do you have a price target and expiration date in mind? Would love to take you up on this.

2021-04-06 06:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Your comment leads me to think you don’t know much about NCL. They converted some of their debt to shares recently. They’ve also said that all crew and passengers would be vaccinated before resuming cruising so they must have access to vaccines. And lastly, NCL has some of the newest ships of all cruise lines which is why they didn’t mothball any compared to other lines."
2021-04-06 16:54:04,wallstreetbets,That’s a ridiculous comment based on zero DD. They’ve been spending 200mm a quarter on ship crews and maintenance. That’s what half the debt was for - they other half was to support SG&A. They’ve already refinanced the debt secured by specific ships. Bookings are sky high and they won’t have an empty room. The only question for me is does it even matter how the CDC responds. Let’s say the ships sail from business friendly Texas or Florida waters. Is the CDC gonna contract with the coast guard to stop them...I’m well north of 2x on my calls bought mid last year and holding.

Now I'd be interested in seeing you consistently average a 3-10 percent daily return on your investments using a true method and making good decisions.  Risk, ehh I don't mind it but luck. Well I don't find that impressive at all. Keep us updated on if you're able to consistently keep this up. I'm sure we'd all be more interested in that."

2021-04-06 01:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Guys, if you're gonna make fat spy plays like this, *trade fucking $SPX or at least $XSP*.

On a play like this it's like a $5,000 tax difference.

2021-04-06 01:47:42,wallstreetbets,If you're using options you should trade SPX instead of SPY. SPX is sec 1256 contract and taxed 60% at long term capital gains. Would've literally saved you several thousands in tax.
2021-04-06 02:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Jesus Christ. That's legit my dream. I want to be able just to buy 100 shares and ride covered calls until I can afford another 100 and just let it keep compounding so I can retire early.

I am scared for 9 million young investors who will see this and yolo themselves"
2021-04-05 23:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain the math on this for me? 

How was this 26k if all the contracts were so cheap?

Value says 87k and total return says 80k so wouldn’t it have been 7k-87k? 

But even then how was the buy in that high with such small contract prices?

2021-04-06 02:35:21,wallstreetbets,What am I even looking at :o
2021-04-06 02:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong

If using Total Return number
99,603 - 80,412 = 19,291 
(Cost) 19291 ÷ 385 ÷ 100 = 0.50 
So he paid (Or could have lost) 
 $19,291 Or $0.50 per share 
For the contract 

If using the Today Value 
99,603 - 73,129 = 26,473 
26,473 ÷ 385 ÷ 100 = 0.69 
So he paid $26,473 Or $0.69 per share 

Do you know which it is? 

P.S. Congrats and a heart felt, Fuck U"

2021-04-05 20:24:42,wallstreetbets,why is it bad holding over the weekend?
2021-04-06 15:17:28,wallstreetbets,SPX/SPY options get wrecked by theta over 3 day weekends; like 2.5 days of theta burn on the most recent one

2021-04-05 23:21:47,wallstreetbets,"It costed me $530 to never again buy puts on Spy, because it typically stays flat for a short while and then gradually goes up. Rarely does it drop hard. I brought a put position three weeks out at the bullish peak and still got fucked. A day before the contract expired, it went down hard, i could have walked away with $120 profit, instead i lost out 90% of that money, to $530 at the expiration day.


Dont short Spy. You will get fucked hard."

2021-04-06 03:29:28,wallstreetbets,That’s still better than most
2021-04-05 20:27:07,wallstreetbets,"From what I've gathered in this thread:

OP got dumb lucky buying 400 call contracts on Thursday before the 3 day weekend betting the price of $SPY would exceed 410$ by April 5th (4/5). He bought 404$ calls, 407$ calls, and 410$ calls. He bought most of his calls (395 of them) at the 404$ strike price. 

This morning, after the long weekend, $SPY gapped up on good economic news (likely the march job reports) putting 395 of OPs 4/5 404c (404$ calls expiring 4/5) ITM (in the money). OP didn't time his sale of the calls. They expired on 4/5 (today) and then OP sold them before EoD. 

It's simply a bet"
2021-04-05 20:15:06,wallstreetbets,"He went all in when he thought it would go up and sold when it actually went up. He could've lost absolutely everything. This is pure retardation and luck. I do not recommend doing the same as he did.

Keep in mind he only posted this win. He could've had multiple losses of similar magnitude before this ""big hit""that he did not post."
2021-04-05 20:41:59,wallstreetbets,Betting on SPY to go from 400 to 404 is a whole hell of a lot different than betting on it to go from 406 to 455.

That said.. with a YOLO, you're still really likely to lose what you put in right away. So there's that."

In this case you can either end up with 400k -

The contracts are taxed 60% long term and 40% short term cap gain irrespective of the holding period.  For the most part these options are ~10x spy although their extrinsic value changes a bit different since they are European style (no early ~~execution~~ Edit: exercising). Instead of being exercised they are cash settled at expiry (so the expiration Friday option will stop trading Thursday, and will have a settlement price based on Friday morning spx when all components traded at least one, the cash settlement then starts Friday after close... settlement is all cash as this is tied to spx index not spy etf)."

2021-04-06 04:01:25,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think this retard sees them as how many calls he bought, he just bought 14k worth of calls. Now since the restart that he is, he bought them FDs that were dirt cheap and hence the number of calls. 

To be clear, still amaze balls this one."
2021-04-06 03:54:07,wallstreetbets,No disrespect but it shouldn’t be our responsibility to disclose the risk in every insane move people make on this sub. I partially agree with you because the financial literacy in most subs is abysmal. Idk if I’m overly cynical but I think the people that blow up their accounts are the same folks that hurt themselves playing with fireworks.
2021-04-05 20:42:08,wallstreetbets,Dude shut up on commenting the same thing on every thread. There are entire subs for GME go there.
2021-04-05 21:48:50,wallstreetbets,GME has lied to us 😔
2021-04-06 02:39:24,wallstreetbets,"Stop with this shit, sorry GME was a lie and there will never be a short squeeze at all, but seriously stfu, it’s so boring now"

2021-04-05 21:56:33,wallstreetbets,Stupid comment of the day right here.
2021-04-06 08:47:42,wallstreetbets,"0DTE options. That was the point.

There is a way to “YOLO” while still being smart about your position size. That’s lost on this crowd. Oh well, please keep donating your cash kids. I’ll gladly take it."

2021-04-06 01:42:45,wallstreetbets,The VW squeeze. Porsche told everyone it owned the float on Sunday. Everyone panicked on Monday.

2021-04-06 05:39:27,wallstreetbets,I feel sad that you still remember a market trade so vividly from 30 years ago.

2021-04-05 21:15:55,wallstreetbets,He bought them for .02. I don't think Theta could effect it that much.
2021-04-05 20:45:19,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure theta is priced in from Friday to Monday
2021-04-06 01:38:23,wallstreetbets,"No it doesn’t. Theta decay only happens on days the market is open and greeks are calculated based on market days to expiry, not calendar days. That said, short term weeklies still definitely a risk because anything in the world can happen."
2021-04-06 19:37:03,wallstreetbets,How can you tell if SPY will move up or down intraday? Technical analysis?
2021-04-05 22:37:50,wallstreetbets,You have no idea how many times I tell my self I will never do this shit again and then before you know it nah it’s gonna double when the volume pick up and end up in the red

2021-04-06 00:53:42,wallstreetbets,i hate the gamestop rally for that exact reason it pisses me off that all i can hear about is “gamestop short squeeze gamma squeeze to the moon see you guys at 1k!!!1!1!!11!”
2021-04-06 02:18:02,wallstreetbets,If I have to hear about G*E one more fucking time I'm gonna crack
2021-04-06 00:50:19,wallstreetbets,Well... tbh... a monke on ketamine is more predictable than a monke on crack medically speaking. Ketamine has a pretty stable dose-response curve. Crack is unpredictable.
2021-04-06 00:41:10,wallstreetbets,Coke Monkey is more predictable for sure.  He just does the same thing over and over.  Ketamine Monkey could go a variety of ways.
2021-04-06 03:40:38,wallstreetbets,I understand the words but they sound like gibberish strung together like that
2021-04-06 04:49:40,wallstreetbets,For fucks sake I don’t own a single share but I can tell you ONLY PLAY WITH HOUSE MONEY!!! It’s that simple. Man I wish I had a ounce more privilege I’d have purchased my own space station orbiting the moon.
2021-04-06 05:31:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah but then it's no longer subsequently called a yolo and you're just mitigating risk/reward. Then we're no better off than r/investing
2021-04-06 19:35:47,wallstreetbets,“Investment” lmao
2021-04-06 07:58:18,wallstreetbets,In other words if I start with a $1 yolo all I need to do is be lucky 20x in a row to become a billionaire. I like those odds

2021-04-05 23:07:44,wallstreetbets,"The downside is if SPY goes down it goes down 3x as much.

2021-04-06 11:46:14,wallstreetbets,that would be around 25% capital gains tax
2021-04-05 21:50:47,wallstreetbets,You can't sell those $spx options anytime before expiry tho? That's a huge risk/problem.
2021-04-06 00:08:17,wallstreetbets,"what do you mean by ""cover"" it was calls he didn't sell (write) them. Max he could lose = value of those options. (ie amount invested)"
2021-04-06 04:21:43,wallstreetbets,Better than being in debt and having negative money.
2021-04-05 20:48:01,wallstreetbets,"If an option contract is in the money you can usually find a buyer. The profit (value vs price paid) from an options contract is highly dependent on implied volatility and open interest. Basically the ""likely hood of it being sold once it's ITM."" Granted this is a crude interpretation, its why people can lose money even when an option contract is ITM or they can't find anyone to sell it to.

In most ITM cases there is a high chance you will find a buyer for your contract. Who would buy a contract expiring today? Someone who shorted the stock and needs to find shares for less than 406$ ASAP. Why buy 100 shares at 406 when you can buy and exercise 1 contract for 100 shares at 404$?

I'm pretty new to options as well but this is my understanding"
2021-04-06 00:44:34,wallstreetbets,"He doesn't even need to find someone to buy the calls if they are ITM, he can just exercise them at the strike price (even before expiration), then immediately sell for market price (which is higher) thus profiting."

2021-04-05 20:52:51,wallstreetbets,"I get the point. My normal investment strategy is relatively boring, since I chose to favor a high chance at being able to do normal things in my life over a quick shot at being wealthy while I'm young (which is the decision almost everyone makes). I've also walked out of a casino with my money doubled after a single bet -- since if the odds are truly against you, minimizing the number of times you do it is the way to maximize your odds of beating the odds (whereas if you place that bet over and over again, it trends to 0). So I get that too.

I was mostly replying to the ""If you treat it as a casino, sooner or later, the odds will get you."" bit. Sure, you can manage risk. But if you don't, you'd best make it quick. I assure you I do get it, but I'm not such an ass with flippantly attacking people online (.. which you've more or less done to three separate people here. It's not me, it's you)."

2021-04-06 06:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Right I get that, but I meant over a couple months SPY moves up. It pretty much always has, even if there’s a crash or bear market it recovers. So the 3x loss doesn’t matter if you don’t sell and just wait. 

Some other comment pointed out something called leverage decay which seems to be the real pitfall. If the price of SPY is stagnant then leveraged ETFs still lose money, so basically SPY can’t just trend upward it needs to move up with a rate that compensated for the decay."

everyone here thinks they can spot a deal or opportunity, otherwise you wouldn't take the bet.

the risk side for the average earner to make gains like this is ridiculously high.

if your average person makes between 80-100k pre tax, their take home after taxes and commitments, they likely have 30k left to save.

the betting 30k on a monthly contract, are potentially writing off an entire year of savings in a month."

He now catches them both and puts them in his basket. You cry

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Options are for Apes too (just not GME) # What Motivates an Ape

I started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. 

I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.

I've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. 

For this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization\_of\_all\_open\_option\_contracts\_on\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme/)

# Comparing MSFT to GME

My presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).

**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. 

If you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** 

**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**

[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https://preview.redd.it/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)

The main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. 

For sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  

**No one is buying GME Options!!**

If you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). 

&#x200B;

[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https://preview.redd.it/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)

Notice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. 

**Implied volatility and why/how thetagang makes money**

Implied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. 

What is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. 

This phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. 

Thetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. 

Implied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f

Notice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.

# Conclusion

GME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.

Use the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).

***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***

Positions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both. Too stubborn to stop now.

44 mm CALL options outstanding combined at $30, $35, and $40 with 4/16 exp. 12 mm shares shorted outright. Avg daily volume of around 2 mm. Today it traded a bit over 6 mm shares. Where will the shorts and the Market Makers of the CALLs find shares to buy if their CALLs are not covered or only partially covered? Short squeeze potential. Gamma squeeze potential with a goofy ratio of shares that will need to be acquired CS avg daily volume. Could be fun. And ASO has good financials. This is not a flyer or high risk bet like GME was. If it doesn’t squeeze, you still have a solid investment at $40

This Friday the government will decide what their plans are for the DAPL pipeline. 

Energy Transfer ($ET, the owner of DAPL) says they have near certainty that they will not be forced to shutdown. 

But one of their partners disclosed in their last SEC filing that they were 80-90% certain the pipeline will be shutdown, at least temporarily. 

The pipeline was shut down last year in the first week of July, instantly sending the stock price down a dollar. But the court order was stayed until the appeal, halting the decline. 

Originally I was certain it would be shutdown (im still leaning that way) but rather than go straight puts, ive gone with a strangle. 4/16 and 5/21 options are both reasonable. Ive placed a few different combinations of strangles. Could go with 4/16 9c & 7p and/or 5/21 9c & 6p.

I’ve posted before making a case for the ultimate boomer stock; Mr. AT&T (T) most of you fuckers would rather throw your money at some shitty SPAC or a high flyer which is grounded and still have a stupidly high IV.  

Many of you forget AT&T owns Warner Studios, The WC, DC Comics, CNN & all their fucking content which is now found at HBO-MAX.  As per Godzilla & Kong up to know the most successful release in movies & on via streaming.  

Oh T also owns a “small” cell phone, data & internet service. They are also an infrastructure play as they will help role broadband across the country and also acquired a shit ton of C Band for the 5G rollout.  Yes they have a ton of debt but unlike any of the SPACS these fuckers actually make money and pay a huge dividend.  The Calls are cheap, the IV is low and and the best part IT ABOUT TO FINALLY BREAK OUT!   It hasn’t touched $31 since Dec and if it’s a good day it might just do it tomorrow.  Huge resistance at $31 but if it crosses the next stop is $33+.  The $31 CALLS (04-16) are $11 volume of 24K contracts.  Or the weeklies for $7 load up if it moves against you they are so cheap you can buy more and average out.   

These are the type of stocks that are working right now and after the movie it has momentum.  Best idea you’ll hear this week.  I know I’ll get some hate if so fuck of and keep losing your money with FUBO."

I don’t want you to invest in this company tomorrow. I want you to do your research (this company CANNOT be summed up in one post - too much going on) and add it to your watchlist. I expect (much like the author of the second link in this comment) that despite PyroGenesis’s incredible earnings report (seriously - I’ve read hundreds if not thousands... this is the best I’ve ever seen YOY/forward looking), there may be a period of consolidation on the stock price. 

This is something for the watchlist/HW on a company that may even add the slightest of wrinkles to even the smoothest brained apes.

Below are links for $PYR’s recent earnings report as well as the aforementioned Gator Trading technical analysis:

1. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-announces-2020-results-revenues-023600676.html

2. https://www.gator-traders.com/post/pyr-disruptive-technically-sound-and-low-priced

BTW: This company up-listed to the NASDAQ from OTC a few weeks ago. Before this uplist, this was one of the four OTC holdings Cathie Wood and ARK hold (ARK PRNT ETF, and only Canadian OTC). It is also (to my knowledge) the only foreign company with a US Navy contract ($11.5mm, and any future ships are mandated to be built with specs to accommodate PYR’s plasma waste management system). They own 120 patents (this is called a giant fucking moat) and are the primary leaders in all things plasma (as in the 4th state of matter).

Fuck said more than I planned to but I’m jacked to the tits. Go research PYR, and good luck doing it in any reasonable amount of time - there’s a lot there."

2021-04-05 21:02:52,wallstreetbets,"I tried posting this late at night March 31st and never got any attention hopefully we can discuss this here.

“Was Today the End of a Downtrend for $BB?

TLDR; $BB bounced off of a (personally) suspicious price today and it can possibly only go up from here 🚀

Keep in mind that I, like you, am not here to give financial advice but I'll sure as hell share my findings and give my opinion.

Looking at the monthly chart, I think it looks like $BB is in a good spot to try and reach back to where it opened in March. Looking back at December we can see that it opened at $8.36

Today was the last day of the month, and the lowest share price for both March and today is $8.36. Decent bounce today too, never really went that low again. Like I said, $8.36 is also where December opened at!

Now I have no idea what this means... lol. But I believe it's the bounce us $BB holders are looking for. What do you think?

Let's look at some article Motley Fool posted today.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/31/why-blackberry-stock-plunged-today/

Basically, it just says they've been plummeting because of deferred sales. ""...negotiations led BlackBerry to delay sales activities that could have resulted in higher licensing revenue during the quarter.""

Keyword: delay. They're still going to go on baby! I believe next quarter should be very good because of this and come on.. we all know that when Motley Fool publishes bad news for a company it's actually good news. Very possible that it's only up from here for $BB.

One thing I'd like to discuss is why the media decides to mention $GME and $AMC when making articles about $BB. What's the meta play there?”

Hopefully I’m not too dumb"

2021-04-06 03:40:02,wallstreetbets,"I’ve worked in an office, a factory, multiple restaurants/bars, landscaping, a movie theater, phone survey rep, and about a half dozen jobs in my long-term career. The factory was, by far, the worst. Office work can be boring, but I still had energy/time to go workout or have a few drinks with friends, etc. Serving was actually fun, one of my favorites. Landscaping was great too, lots of time in the sun. But working in a factory.... I’d get home and my neck/back would be in excruciating pain. Far worse pain than landscaping or serving. Standing in one place bent over working on a short table was murder. I’d wake up at 3:30am to be at work by 4. Almost impossible to have any sort of a normal social life. And the boredom. My god the boredom. We weren’t allowed to listen to an iPod or anything. The senior people got radios, but no headphones so you were just at the musician whim of whoever you were working with. I swear by the end I’d be so bored I’d disassociate with my body for half the day. All for like, $11 an hour and no benefits. I lasted 4 months before I quit."

2021-04-06 02:56:00,wallstreetbets,I need AAPL to hit $140 so I can break even on my long calls I picked up at the beginning of March.  Best way to learn about options is to lose money on them I guess.

Know when to sell."
2021-04-06 03:10:08,wallstreetbets,"I think the biggest lesson for me is position sizing. Often times when you make a good trade, it goes against you for a few days at the beginning.

2021-04-06 00:19:11,wallstreetbets,I think it certainly is a motion for other banks to reassess risk for some clients. Hard to tell it that will have any noticeable effect on markets. I’d guess probably not

2021-04-05 22:16:08,wallstreetbets,The extrinsic value (amount of time left on the contract + implied volatility) is lower as each day surpasses because you’re closer to expiration! It has nothing to do with the market closing just the passage of time! It can still go back up! Good luck :)

2021-04-05 22:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Well I mean you’re gonna get some measurable theta decay if it’s only two weeks out, but I towards the end of the day sometimes you’ll get an influx of buying or selling in anticipation of what will happen the next day (in my experience at least). So if it was significantly more of a drop than theta would give I would think red day for ASO tomorrow"

On top of that it is also a bit political.  Generally people pay more attention to the president so if you label him as bad it can damage the President's whole party."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against America Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

Disclosure: RIDE stock will triple by September. 🚀🚀🚀 Do what you will with this information.

I hadn’t posted on reddit until recently when [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report.

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down.

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.
2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

I’m from Ohio, and about 2 years ago now, I saw [over 1500 people in our small community lose their jobs when GM closed their state-of-the-art facility](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gut-wrenching-day-ohio-gm-assembly-plant-prepares-close-n980136). Words couldn’t accurately portray the amount of hurt and pain that hit Ohio as a result of this.

But a couple of months later, I heard about LMC. I heard GM was going to invest in LMC in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). I then had a couple of friends get hired there who told me they were getting a jump start in the EV industry with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). Keep in mind, this was 2019, so large-scale production of EV’s was a relatively new concept.

Nonetheless, this was exactly what our community needed – some hope and excitement. American-made electric vehicles in small-town Ohio – helping create a more sustainable future and adding thousands of jobs in our country. Plus, this was a massive opportunity, as the [global light duty vehicle market is now valued at \~ $600B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market).

Fast forward 2 years, and [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all).

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report.

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). This is huge for LMC to have their battery supplier as a next-door neighbor.

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV. 🚀 🚀 🚀

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders**

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period.

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

u/DrReginaldWexley owns and operates his own small fleet of vehicles. I found [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/md063x/the_transition_is_real_its_happening_now_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I thought was useful to learn more from a customer’s perspective.

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did?

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Proof of Concept for LMC’s Endurance truck**

LMC is showing their level of confidence in their vehicle by enrolling in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17. Get your popcorn ready, this **major catalyst is now less than 2 weeks away** and will be publicly televised. 🚀 🚀 🚀

LMC is also in the [final due diligence phase for the ATVM loan](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which could be announced any day now. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means there has been substantial digging into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Brief Technical Overview**

From a technical perspective, the chart shows that this same downward movement has happened multiple times in the past 6 months, and each time, the stock has (quickly) rebounded back to $30. For folks who trade stocks based on indicators, the [recent Beta release](https://www.truckinginfo.com/10140497/lordstown-unveils-two-betas-of-endurance-pickup) could be the catalyst we needed to begin an upward trend back towards $30 and beyond. 🚀 🚀 🚀

&#x200B;

**Position:**

1500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and a few October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall 🚀🚀🚀

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story. It’s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000’s of jobs to our country. My advice to Hindenburg: Never bet against America.

I RIDE with Lordstown. #WorkForIt #MadeInAmerica

2021-04-06 02:21:19,wallstreetbets,"I agree with a lot of points on Lordstown.  Workhorse did most of the R&D work for the pick up . . . then decided they wanted to focus on the delivery vehicles they are producing and the drone addition.  So Lordstown went in with a huge lead over being a ""start up"".

So then you look at the competition.

First you have Tesla and the Cyber Truck -- only people I know who want one of those are what I call ""yuppies"" that just want one to drive around on paved roads and try to look good (I say try because there is no looking good in one of those things).  You won't have anyone who regularly needs to haul anything of substance in the bed of the truck.

Next you have Rivan and their pick up.  More like Lordstown in a traditional pick up.  But  judge just ruled that Tesla can continue the lawsuit against them and a few former Tesla employee's for trade secrets that were given to Rivan by the Former Tesla Employee's.  Ends two ways -- A) Rivian has to pay Tesla a large sum of money or royalties on every vehicle sold (more likely). B) Rivan has to scratch everything they acquired illegally and start a complete redesign (less likely).

Then you have Canoo -- I don't even know what to call that ""pick up"".  Ugliest one of the bunch.  It's geared to again those that want to ""look good"" driving one.

The Legacy auto makers are a few years out -- gives Lordstown a chance to get the foot in the door and keep it there.

I personally like the hub motor design.  Again like others have said.  Gets rid of the motor, drive train and transmission (If you google Tesla, they HAVE a transmission).   The skateboard platform lends itself well to different tops (pick up, van, suv, delivery truck), and the extra storage room.

Don't own near as many stocks as a bunch of you, but I plan on holding for a while."

An EDU (Electric Drive Unit) consisting of a reducer, electric motor and inverter costs 800-1000$, where the motor and inverter take ~40% each. The wheel hub drive option makes the vehicle have planetary reducers (smaller by a great ratio) or no reducers, but now 4 motors and 4 inverters are needed (bottlenecks are much bigger than before). Plus 0.5mm rotor radial displacement can break your drivetrain, if they find a good suspension solution for that i would be very interested in it!

I became suspicious of this right before the short report when one of the DDs attacked short-sellers ""un-American"". Should have shorted then, certainly shorting now. Not to say there isn't a bullish case for LMC because you can certainly construct one, but you'll notice that none of these DDs actually provide an facts, figures, or anything of substance, and also claim Hindenburg is ""slandering"" the company for reporting easily verified statements (such as the claims about orders). At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if these DDs were being written by employees of the company itself."

I’m not saying he wasn’t wrong at all, but I think there’s a difference between supporting your company and being a little overly enthusiastic and an actual pump and dump fraud scheme. If you take into account that they’ve been meeting deadlines, entered Beta, bought a huge plant from GM, and entered the Baja race (which to me is risky) I can’t logically assume that this was just a pump and dump. Why go through all the hassle? To say burns exaggerated can be argued, but to go so far as calling it fraud or a pump and dump is just like some Qanon conspiracy theory shit. It’s a little much"

\*\*\*HOWEVER,\*\*\*

in this case, Lourdstown seems to have done a far better job of identifying the base customer for this project, even better than Tesla did in the beginning. This will be a good fleet vehicle, where total mileage is limited, but total usage is not. 

My first thought is the Airport Environment. 

Multiple daily trips across the airport for all kinds of reasons, (Cargo, bags, management, maintenance, etc.) but at most, a mile or two at a time. Look out the window at the hub the next time you travel. Look at all of those trucks and vans scurrying around.

Then City Utilities, local .gov, ports, farms, construction sites, (Hotel to site, wander around the site a bit, then back to the hotel), site security, etc. 

It will not be an Amazon delivery vehicle, cross country commuter, or even ""Dad's Truck"", you aren't going to be plowing snow with it. 

 It will, however, make for a good industrial utility vehicle. Hopefully, the case can be made for cost vs. gasoline or diesel engines. I like the deal with Tesla, they don't have to spend a billion dollars developing their own power source, and replacements will be readily available.

Please note that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of an unknown moron on the internet, but it is worth a few bucks to me for a longer term bet at these prices."

Elaphe claims to have solved these problems, of course we have no way of knowing that yet, but... They have a ton of cool videos, YouTube search for Elaphe. One thing they do is the tank turn, which is of course useless in real life, but shows a willingness to have fun and think outside the box. Some people say the in-wheel hub motor could take over the market.  The Endurance has only 4 moving parts whereas my Silverado has over 2,000 moving parts."

2021-04-05 20:08:58,wallstreetbets,What is the advantage for having the motors in the wheels? You're essentially exposing the motors to unnecessary vibrations that could be mitigated w/ suspension.  Your post makes sense.  OP's post also makes some sense.  I am confusion.

How can people jump in on crazy risks with companies that have dying businesses, but shit on a company that is the literal future? Because ev is the future. It may not be ride, but for 12$ it’s def worth a shot! And there’s tons of good signs that they’re gonna start running.

Eh, not so sure.  When looking at the L1500 it says *added* weight of the motor 34.8kg (~75lbs).  To me it reads that this is on top of the weight of the disc brake, caliper, and hub bearing mentioned.  Which makes more sense that the ~150hp electric motor would weigh closer to 75lbs than... 13lbs.

~~The other thing I notice is the top speed is 1480RPM.  If you take a standard tire diameter of 33"", that's a max speed of 46.25mph.    Which makes no sense.  I've emailed Lordstown about that and I'll update if/when they respond.~~  *I is mo-ron*

No, not just like Teslas Cybertruck, because you have to pay 100 Dollars for pre ordering, so even if its a miniscule amount, Tesla still gets 100 for every preorder, while Lordstown PAID with their ownn money to have any orders... 

So in contrast they would have 10 Million for their pre oders, but they actually gone the opposite and LOST money on the preorders..."

2021-04-06 14:20:37,wallstreetbets,"I think GM gave them $25M in cash (in addition to plant assets... what I don't know about plant assets is what GM's viable alternatives were, so really hard to value that from GM's perspective), so in terms of GM's ownership and the relationship it is likely not that relevant. I believe GM invested a much larger amount in Nikola by comparison. Also why not look at how much Ford has invested in Rivian, which I recall is substantially more.

The investment by GM is likely important to RIDE, but it really does not tell you much. Definitely tells you nothing if the underlying technology (i.e. the in wheel motors) will work well and be able to be mass produced affordably."
2021-04-06 00:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the respectable comments. Some others feel a need to just bash me, with nothing constructive, for disagreeing with the positivity about the company, so appreciate this."
2021-04-06 10:54:25,wallstreetbets,"Certainly, I ignored Hindy nearly entirely.  HOWEVER I will start with Hindy (as they did the initial actual heavy lifting).  Here is my evidence for the court of public opinion.

1. His company is the loosest definition of a company in existence, he's an individual DBA as a company (this comes from Hindy, but you can see the filed paperwork).  Not a company, not a company doing DBA.  An individual DBA as a company.
2. I'm guessing this may have been the interview you saw: [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWxZzQsk6U&ab\_channel=JackSpencerInvesting**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWxZzQsk6U&ab_channel=JackSpencerInvesting)Notice how he dodges the # of employees questions?  You can see the pause and deflection.   Additionally, with what they're claiming their business model is, there's virtually no way anyone could 'solo' it, and there's no mention of who is actually DOING all of the 'additional lease work', to make it white glove for the people they're selling to.
3. Linkedin (meh, but still it is something). When you're in that space, you're going to have SOME employees on linkedin...not none.
4. Go through [archive.org](https://archive.org) snapshots of their page.  Virtually everyone else that was 'associated' with them (employed?) maintains zero reference to the company.5.Virtually ZERO web presence of any other e-squared employee.  Weird, right?  If you do the math, you're literally saying he has access to BILLIONS of dollars of funding for companies, but there's not even a marketing/sales/admin/etc person associated with them.   I mean ffs the company phone number is to Tim's phone (With a pass-through, but it's not to a large company mailbox)
5. They're also claiming they're working with municipalities,etc, but again give no indication of exactly who (because they're aware that a FOI request will show there are no contracts with them).
6. Gut (that's formed by everything above, as just a bunch of other weird small things) like...their website dances around who they work with.  They try to make themselves sound massive, but they stay away from ANY actual specifics that could incriminate or could be refuted.  Virtually no online presence through any of the company scrapers that would indicate other employees (again, loose but something).  The interview frankly probably sealed my gut.  Watch it critically, he is talking in loose generalities about the purpose of a company such as his, not specific instances of what they're doing (which is VERY odd if your connections are that deep).  He is claiming that he is a facilitator for \*well\* over one billion dollars in revenue, but there's literally nothing to support that.

Frankly my concern is just how much lordstown tied themselves to esquared given how shady esquared is.  I'm not saying lordstown is like that....but people keep on using esquared as a defense and that's a REALLY poor idea."

2021-04-05 21:17:23,wallstreetbets,You literally need none of those things (except small axles) in almost every EV anyway. If we use Tesla as an example the electric motor is directly connected to the axles. This is why they have a motor in the front and the rear in AWD models. This has nothing to do with hub motors. The advantage hub motors have is their ability to operate independently from one another and are also easier to freely spin when not under power/load (i.e. while being towed).

1. First Beta out by end of March (check done)
2. One Beta per day for 57 working days.
3. Send 17 Betas up against the wall.
4. Attend San Felipe 250 in April
5. Start Production in September
6. Sell 2,000 vehicles in 2021
7. Ramp up production to one vehicle/6 min.
8. Sell 60,000 vehicles in 2022
9. Develop the Van for production in 2022 on the same skateboard platform.

Perhaps you can buy in this time next year."
2021-04-06 09:54:33,wallstreetbets,It’s not an investigation. It’s an inquiry. The preorders aren’t fake. Shorts just like to spin their words into something they weren’t even saying.

And even if you watch the short videos that are out there, the 1-2sec segment where its offroad it looks bumpy as hell, leaving comfort aside, but even IF they put out this car, its gonna take some serious engineering to have it not run into issues in the long run.

Also leaving aside, that no long time tests nor crash test have been made and they still eye september for production... And with Covid and global shortages and shipping problems, i dont think we will see a car from the production line this year"

2021-04-06 00:33:29,wallstreetbets,I've made money with puts on BB
2021-04-06 01:02:27,wallstreetbets,"Should’ve bought amc calls 
BB is a dead stock"
2021-04-06 01:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, ALL four of these are bad."
2021-04-06 12:38:39,wallstreetbets,This makes me feel less bad about my 5K shares @ $18. Thank you!
2021-04-05 21:03:47,wallstreetbets,Lol $16c isn’t much more for same expiration
2021-04-06 00:03:27,wallstreetbets,Right tho. Down 1.5k feels like nothing looking at this.
2021-04-05 21:41:01,wallstreetbets,I have got in at 8.42 for a whopping 17 shares. First time investing. Really no reason for me to be posting anything... hmm...oh well. GL&GG
2021-04-06 06:53:07,wallstreetbets,For some people 100k is like throw away money. I’m not one of those people :( so I’d also go for the covered call strategy
2021-04-06 01:02:53,wallstreetbets,Or at least a mix of shares and options. The stock isnt going to move if everyone just buys OTM calls.
2021-04-06 14:07:42,wallstreetbets,I’ll bite. How come?
2021-04-05 21:58:58,wallstreetbets,It jumped like 8% not bad
2021-04-06 01:06:02,wallstreetbets,Well thanks for buying my 7 puts. If it drops to 7 im cool with averaging down.
2021-04-06 06:53:41,wallstreetbets,Why not?
2021-04-05 22:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Avg price per share? 

Broke as enlisted dude with 30 shares at avg ~10.54

Made money off GME but honestly BB seems like such a logical well thought out strong choice besides the curse (good news for BB scares the stock, it's a timid creature) I'm going to keep putting $100 every paycheck in while it's under $12.

Edit: Broke ass enlisted dude, not as broke **as** one, actually that broke lol"
2021-04-05 23:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Nah, you get to post. You have skin in the game now! 

Hopefully you didn’t invest more than you can lose (rule 0) so you can simply forget about them forever.

I believe in BB but it’s a long term play. I frankly doubt my September calls will be worth it but I figure there’s a chance it’ll go up and I’ll make a little profit, like those weeklies I have that doubled in price today ( bought for .05, will sell tomorrow morning but they closed at .12)

I feel very good about my 2022 and 2023 calls, though. If it drops more I’m buying a bunch of 10 strikes for 2022"

2021-04-06 09:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Yeah, I think I will sit with the shares I have and mess around with some shorter-term stocks to get a feel for that side of things. While keeping Rule 0 at the for forefront of my mind haha"
2021-04-05 21:33:28,wallstreetbets,Name checks out
2021-04-06 09:11:05,wallstreetbets,On BB?  lol nah.  Upside is theoretically infinite but not actually.  I sure as shit wouldn't sell naked calls on a heavily shorted stock though.
2021-04-05 21:48:56,wallstreetbets,Learning the same thing. I often try to buy something right before close and sell shortly after open. Avoid a day trade and try and catch some momentum. Like you said if that spike doesnt happen they turn to shit quicky.
2021-04-06 00:23:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I’ve been watching theWalrus Street and he tends to cash out at +25%
2021-04-06 02:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Can you please explain this a little more? I’m trying to understand contracts, options, etc. new to the game 3 months later I’m only down 8% with about $20k in the game. Wanting to understand the next step after shares."
2021-04-06 00:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not nervous though..,"
2021-04-06 10:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Excellent!

Just remember, as long as you follow rule 0 - even failures are just opportunities to write new rules for yourself and in the end develop an actual investing philosophy."
2021-04-05 22:09:31,wallstreetbets,Whatever floats your boat I guess.
2021-04-06 00:46:40,wallstreetbets,Probably best play long term. If it even gets to 25% lll
2021-04-06 03:35:05,wallstreetbets,92% to go

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MTCH is pushing users to travel, but not in the way you'd think I like $MTCH a lot as they've commodified sex and romance which essentially allows them to feed off desperate horny guys, of which there will be no end, but I'm here specifically to make the argument that $MTCH is actively increasing its own stability and profitability under the guise of bRiNGinG pEOplE FrOM aLL aroUnD tHe wOrLd tOgeThEr. 

If you don't use Tinder, it has a feature called passport that allows you to set your location to different areas of the world, so that instead of getting ghosted by your high school crush, you can get ghosted by a person in Argentina instead. Normally this feature is only provided to paying users, but $MTCH has made passport free for all users through the end of April. IMPORTANTLY there is no way to prevent these passporting profiles from showing up in your feed. 


How $MTCH making Tinder passport free for a month is a tricky and likely significant move for their dating app holdings:

-The obvious, easy to sell reason for passport being free: it potentially attracts travel-obsessed women to the platform, which could provide a large increase in female userbase (the pandemic has already driven female users to all time highs), and maybe these women will stick around and become regular users. Maybe same for men, though to a lesser extent. But this is all SMALL FISH compared to the following. 

-Making passport free GREATLY dilutes the actual valid dating pool in popular cities - at the moment in NYC 5 out of 6 women are passporting in, usually from Brazil or Russia. People looking for real, in-person relationships cannot filter out passport users. So these users either have to just keep swiping (thereby increasing app use and ad revenue from non-paying members), OR, what I believe to be the major scheme, these users will *flee to other apps that do NOT have the passport feature*.

-$MTCH has constantly pushed its goal of diversifying their dating apps as to reduce redundancy and to better engage users by providing niche user pools or specific features. In their recent earnings statements, $MTCH has touted Hinge as their rising star, with revenue that is nothing to sneeze at and a growing user base that is specifically relationship-oriented. Tinder's passport flooding may redirect Tinder users to the other dating apps it owns, which is great for their stats, but I'm specifically interested in Hinge.

-There is likely a large number of relationship-oriented Tinder users who have never used Hinge just because Tinder is sort of the go-to dating app. Or, like me, they might have used both Hinge and Tinder before, but realized that the people on Hinge are significantly less attractive than those on Tinder and stopped using it (this sounds silly, I know, but I've asked my female friends and they've said the same about Hinge guys vs Tinder guys, and we've all moved to different apps b/c looking for a relationship on Hinge is difficult when you're not attracted to 85% of the users). 

-If the passport flood moves users (even temporarily) to Hinge, $MTCH may achieve some significant gains: Hinge-naieve relationship-oriented users may stick around, further increasing the separation of apps and possibly increasing purchasing of premium features as these new users may feel their matches on Hinge may be more meaningful than those on Tinder. AND the move may increase the average attractiveness of Hinge users, which will make Hinge more viable overall as a relationship-specific app. 

-$MTCH gets to say ""Look! We can do more than just Tinder!"" Given that Tinder's revenue dwarfs all the other apps, I think this is a legitimate achievement. 


Side notes and risks: 

-Back on Tinder, desperate/thirsty male users (i.e. the cash cow for dating apps) may feel even more unseen as they are aware that their gender pool is flooded with passport users, thereby potentially leading these local men to spend money on premium features that increase their own visibility e.g. superlikes, boosts. I am totally unashamed to say I've purchased boosts and it seriously gives you a huge ego boost, to the point that it is addictive, and WSB knows how lucrative addiction is. If passport flooding causes a fraction of men to purchase a premium feature just once, there's a good likelihood they'll keep coming back, and revenue will drastically increase. 

-Passport flooding is equally likely to shunt users to Bumble ($MTCH's only real competitor in this space). Aside from heavily relationship-oriented users that will hopefully go to Hinge first, I can't see any reason why Bumble won't gain users from Tinder's passport decision. 

-I don't know if its just my phone's OS, but it seems Tinder has made it so that viewing profile bios is a laborious process, requiring an additional click to get there, and the click is no longer right where your finger is when swiping - its now a tiny button all the way on the upper left - quite inconvenient when browsing. Just seems like more evidence that $MTCH is making big moves to separate the hookup world from the relationship world. Also, as a guy, if you'd reaaaally want a female to look at your profile cuz you're actually insanely interesting (/s), you'd have to give her reason to stop and make the effort - superlikes ($) can help with that. 


Bottom line: $MTCH is serious about differentiating its apps. Specifically on this iteration, passport flooding can sequester real relationship-oriented users from the rest and place them into Hinge, improving the userbase and targeting these types of users with specific purchasable services (e.g. a Hinge boost is more likely to land you a LTR than a Tinder boost). It also benefits other $MTCH owned apps (but also unfortunately BMBL). All of this is coming right before May earnings, where as usual they'll probably brag about how they don't rely singularly on Tinder for revenue. 

TL;DR: The world of dating apps is expanding and maturing, and $MTCH, with the greatest number of users in this space, is positioning itself to occupy as much new room as possible. The move: buy and hold (cringe, I know) or, since I think May earnings are gonna look good due to these moves and MTCH's general performance, buy May puts. Fucking earnings. 

Positions: 50 shares in $MTCH, by far the largest holding in my poorboy portfolio."
2021-04-05 22:48:13,wallstreetbets,"It’s an elegant way to silo brands — Tinder is a word of mouth behemoth that doesn’t benefit - risks dilution - from the wrong kind of folks using it

Passport is like a spammer in a chat channel if that’s not your thing.

Match is older than most of its users, OK Cupid, Hinge could pick them up ...

Big opportunity to extract fees for multiple apps from the same customer, particularly with micro transactions and Covid ending

2021-04-06 01:25:27,wallstreetbets,"The agreed exchange ratio is 0.8381 meaning if you own 100 APHA after the merger you'll own 83 TLRY (I believe theres no fraction shares and it will round down - someone correct me if I'm wrong). TLRY closed today at 22.07 meaning APHA should trade at 22.07x.8381=18.49. APHA closed at 18.19 meaning today it was better to buy APHA. If APHA closed above 18.49 it would have been better to buy TLRY. The merger is not a sure thing until its done, so some folks might say buy the one you're comfortable owning if they don't merge.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on Office Furniture First time doing some TA. Very green behind the ears from the crayons I store back there. I work in the design industry and know things have been crazy the past year with the big WFH movement. Offices will be back, it's just a matter of if not when.

I have been watching companies that supply systems furniture and just did a comparison of Herman Miller and Steelcase. Both of these companies are comparable with product lines and have relatively similar financials. What is different, however, is the float held by institutions. Looking at Yahoo Finance, you can see that MLHR has 87.16% vs 101.9% for SCS. MLHR is currently trading $42.18 vs $14.60 for SCS. 

Another interesting number is the EBITDA for both. MLHR is 17,200  vs 138,200  for SCS. I know my brain is as smooth as the day is long, but it seems like there is something there there.

I work with companies across multiple industries and a common theme throughout is that this whole remote thing is fast becoming a permanent part of doing business. Even my most stubborn client finally agreed to hire remote employees to save on costs. Two of my clients cancelled their office leases and have moved 100% remote permanently. 
 
I do think home offices will be furnished so there is room for some growth but I don't see it being crazy."

Shipping freight rates are through the roof right now too. Like, literally 4x the cost it was this time a year ago to get a container to the States. Retail prices are going up as a result but I don't know of anyone who's compromising on profit margin.

You’re probably also going to see that working from home will become more mainstream than it was pre covid. It’s less expensive for many companies, talent pools are no longer limited by geography, and productivity as well as happiness actually improves in many cases."

2021-04-06 14:07:53,wallstreetbets,"I may have to do a dd on this: when large institutions expect a liquidity crash, the first thing they do is sell their gold. They own gold stocks instead of gld bc of tax reasons.

This is bc owning gold is like putting money in your savings account as a hedge against inflation. 

What do you do when you expect a big Bill? You move money from your savings to your checking account. This is currently happening when they sell gold for dollars. 

Big dogs know something and are liquidating in order to have cash on hand. I love gold long term, but I am sitting in bonds for the next few months. Good luck 🚀🚀🚀😎"
2021-04-06 19:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Even if your thesis is correct, your conclusion could be wrong. While printing money will drive inflation, if a substantial enough portion of that printed money goes into the stock market, because stonk go up, then you will still see a free market of companies dying AND surviving. The dollar will still be valuable, and your gold stock, or even smart if you got bullion, won't deliver the same returns as something like TSLA calls. So the money will flow where people think it will have the highest returns, which could itself stifle inflation."

Platinum is FAR more scarce, which could be a driving force for a much higher return; Palladium and nickel are both more valuable for application than gold. There are all sorts of better plays than gold."
2021-04-05 22:36:10,wallstreetbets,Gold was inverse interest rates when we were on the gold standard. It meant people were selling gold. Now rising rates means people are selling dollars because of inflation fears. Rising rates are.good for gold but everyone still thinks the relationship from the gold standard times exists.

2021-04-06 06:32:08,wallstreetbets,"The markets went bear a month ago out of fears of inflation and gold hasn’t done shit. 

If you look at golds and other pm historical performance and inflows vs outflows lately you’d be astonished. JP Morgan and Citi have both published lengthy reports on these outflows to digital assets. Everyone is talking inflation yet gold is down, why is that? No one wants that shit anymore, unless you’re a god damn boomer. 

I think it is clear as day a digital asset is wreaking havoc on gold as it has all the same properties only it is more scarce, more transferable, and more divisible."

I admit that I may be proved wrong, but there is no history that says bits may hold their value during an inflationary spike, or a market downturn.  Therefore, holding gold and silver, not bits, in order to protect against inflation."

Why do you think there is this daily $20+ range to only settle as if it never happened? I will tell you why: increase IV and inflate option prices and sell expensive OTM options to retail. Most options expire worthless. Citadel can take a lot of profits, refuel for the next time GME pops and they can then short at even higher price point. This will happen. They will pop it again when they know they can short a lot more shares at higher prices for almost certain jack pot.

2.  China exclusivity will probably come online by end of year. Already got the ok for Hainan Medical Hub.
3. Insiders recently sold shares on Form 4's, but the bear minimum to cover taxes most likely .
4. Paid off all long term debt in one fell swoop. Plus has $900 Million loss carryforward.
5. But here is the kicker. They recently added the line ""**In the case of a Change of Control**"" under remarks. That wasn't there before. Link to one of the Form 4, if the picture doesn't load.

The reason this took so long is that the House exclusively files their disclosures in PDF that vary wildly in quality and format, so for this project I have been transcribing every transaction disclosed. I am nearly done with 2021. I am sure 2020 will uncover lots of interesting trades.

2021-04-06 16:25:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!  Is there any way to dig into that to see who executed the trades?  That would really be useful.  I'm probably getting carried away here, but..."

2021-04-06 16:32:51,wallstreetbets,"Ah, unfortunately it only shows ""None"" ""Self"" ""Joint (like trust or spouse)"" or ""Dependent Child"" as the executioner.

It is only right to assume that the trades executed with ""self"" as the owner were direct actions - though people assume influence on the other types as well"
2021-04-06 08:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Nah, that will lead to bailouts using tax payer money."
2021-04-06 11:32:19,wallstreetbets,"On one hand, I like it. On the other hand, that incentivizes even further the uncoupling of the stock market from the economic reality for most citizens. It would lead to even more wealth inequality.  Right now we are very pay to play and it would be bad if it got even worse."

2021-04-06 01:04:51,wallstreetbets,Honestly if you feel that way it shows you don’t know what your doing.
2021-04-06 02:25:30,wallstreetbets,This is a productive conversation. The confirmation bias is strong with this one.
2021-04-06 02:30:27,wallstreetbets,"They defended $2000 since Feb even against rising yields and March sell off. A number of firms have Google as their top Fang pick or top pick for 2021. The thought process was to buy 4/23 $2150, because I felt going into earnings the end of April you should have a rotation back into Mega Cap tech, and Google would benefit the most since it has large reopening/travel exposure. My idea worked so that’s my confirmation bias."
2021-04-06 02:44:42,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your insights - I appreciate it!

2021-04-06 08:48:21,wallstreetbets,What's up with this month and tesla? I haven't been tracking stocks too well for the past month but I've been holding tesla since March last year.
2021-04-05 21:15:33,wallstreetbets,Can’t it get exercised if it hits atm and you’re out some serious $ before you can roll out?

2021-04-05 20:19:57,wallstreetbets,I have tried this but cannot locate them GD bootstraps...
2021-04-05 23:42:44,wallstreetbets,Sell it immediately and buy a 5/7 or later. That’s going to go to zero quick.
2021-04-06 12:36:27,wallstreetbets,tesla reported a good amount of car sales last week and theyre going to announce earnings at the end of the month which is expected to do well
2021-04-05 21:11:23,wallstreetbets,420 gap closed indeed...its comin
2021-04-06 18:28:35,wallstreetbets,He didn't ask about buying options he asked about selling them...
2021-04-06 18:45:14,wallstreetbets,Based on your answer you definitely must not touch options. 💯 😂😂😂
2021-04-06 00:40:28,wallstreetbets,Whats the opinion on other car manufacturers joining the ev market? I seen news of significant progress being made by Toyota. Is this one of Tesla’s main worries?
2021-04-06 00:16:48,wallstreetbets,"it’s a $2 lotto ticket lol, you guys don’t look at the option chains often do you"
2021-04-06 18:55:25,wallstreetbets,Are you that fuckin retarded?
2021-04-06 07:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you have no fucking clue about EVs. 

Research before you start posting something you have zero knowledge about.

My car is an EV and I make 3,000 mile round trips from AZ to ND and back roughly every 6 weeks, my average charge stop is less than 20 minutes."
2021-04-06 00:25:44,wallstreetbets,Your username is offensive.
2021-04-05 23:34:54,wallstreetbets,Fuck/duck this guy. You are misled.

2021-04-05 23:36:27,wallstreetbets,You’re dumb. Swapping is dumb and cost ineffective. Elon says so. You think you know better than the guy building it with demand in mind? You don’t.
2021-04-06 07:27:22,wallstreetbets,Do you get all of your EV/Tesla info from 🌈 🐻 or are you one yourself?
2021-04-05 23:42:06,wallstreetbets,"You are so misled and ignorant. Do you need your phone to be at 100% to function for a day? Or,  most of the day? Obviously not. It’s inconsequential in functionality if it charged to 80 vs 100 % for most purposes."
2021-04-05 23:40:16,wallstreetbets,What a great reply. That know it all thinks literally Elon’s idea from 2012 that he designed and perfected then abandoned because it wasn’t effective or even demanded by the market forces who don’t want swappable batteries due to cost and inconvenience of having to go somewhere and wait In line. He/she is probably too much a moron to understand your thoughtful comment.
2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO: I know this is a casino and I know how much you degenerates like to gamble so I wanted to share what I came across. Broke through the ascending channel, rising OBV, increased volume (but still low), and short interest is 39.41%! Looks like $RKT at the beginning of March! Not Financial Advice!! "
2021-04-05 20:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Got impatient this morning.
Got 4/16 $40 calls this AM @ $2.05 and got to see them tank  to $1.48.
Not worried... Still plenty of time."
2021-04-05 20:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Bought in at the top, don't really know any better....

I learned from RKT to buy wait for the little squeeze and sell. No more bag holding for this fucking tard"
2021-04-06 11:33:36,wallstreetbets,"I have GME and holding that dh, but this is a solid company aswell thats got a heavy short.   The stock price is fair and should only rise even without a squeeze.   I am in for 65 shares and holding until it bores me!  Financials are solid too which is beautiful"
2021-04-05 20:55:41,wallstreetbets,"22 @33, was too late for gme, lost most of my earnings on it but still holding, hopefully this will.help me break even at least, but i think i got in too late"
2021-04-05 21:50:26,wallstreetbets,You got updates waiting for you on creative cloud.
2021-04-05 21:11:30,wallstreetbets,Question. How do you get through drawing all these charts without eating the crayons in the meantime? I mean... those yellow ones are tempting
2021-04-06 17:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Well, I’m up almost $.60 on my buy in this morning 😂"
2021-04-06 10:09:46,wallstreetbets,"Either learn how to control your emotions or don't trade. This company is long term even if it did crash you could even hold it for a bit longer. I don't trade with a lot but I had similar issues like you. I only invest in these riskier bets if the company is solid behind it. That way I don't lose until I sell, and the price has a chance to recover."
2021-04-06 01:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low. This is the way"
2021-04-06 01:34:09,wallstreetbets,Hey I sold mine at 2.05 this morning. Bought them at .2. Enjoy my contracts lmao
2021-04-05 21:17:37,wallstreetbets,Might buy a late dated put and ride the slide
2021-04-06 01:35:32,wallstreetbets,If you hold shares you don’t lose anything unless you sell at a loss...

2021-04-06 00:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but most of your points are just fundamentally false. Half their debt was paid off last quarter with the rest refinanced. It is true that they are over indexed to China, but some is everyone else. They do have a decent online presence, growing 60% yoy. Do some real DD before disparaging a good company 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-06 02:21:48,wallstreetbets,Just stick to a single route I guess never fight it
2021-04-05 22:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Yup....
4/16 $40 calls shot up from $0.58 (market close last week) to $2.05 at market open.
Things calmed down a bit but still $1.48 at close today."
2021-04-05 20:17:32,wallstreetbets,Now it’s up even more in AH lmao. Dear god people are finicky creatures.
2021-04-05 22:25:38,wallstreetbets,How do you filter out the never ending plague of GameStop?
2021-04-06 10:02:33,wallstreetbets,Green in a sea of red today. *Nice*
2021-04-06 00:15:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah it is these calls were dirt cheap last month
2021-04-06 00:13:40,wallstreetbets,"You might have to use a third party app, unfortunately. I thought you could filter by keyword on the official app, but I guess they still haven’t implemented that :("
2021-04-06 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,"I've been with WSB for 1.5 years and didn't know I could filter out things until just now.   


I want to learn this."
2021-04-06 02:22:41,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t mind owning long term shares for this one too
2021-04-06 13:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Apollo for Reddit (iOS) filters out keywords that you don’t want to see and doesn’t have ads, I’m pretty sure RES does it on desktop, but idk what Android app has a keyword filter. It’s all third party apps. Once you leave official, you never go back."
2021-04-06 08:10:45,wallstreetbets,I agree. They have 6 straight quarters of increased earnings at this point
2021-04-06 09:07:36,wallstreetbets,They’re paying debt off too like 1/2 already or something along those numbers
2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Took a few flyers on $30, $35, and $40 ASO calls on Thursday. Woke up to some nice gains today! Not bad for 24 hrs of trading gains. "
2021-04-05 21:20:47,wallstreetbets,People are calling me a liar about my ASO 10 bagger identical to this ( except I bought less). Saying there’s no way you could have got 1000% gain. Well here’s proof.
2021-04-06 10:55:26,wallstreetbets,Still time to get in this? Seems like we are predicting at least 40 this week.
2021-04-06 18:52:13,wallstreetbets,How did you even know to be looking at ASO?
2021-04-06 19:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain options real quick, because when I go on RH it says that I have to pay like $3,000 to be ITM or break even today, and unless it's about to go high, it's almost not really worth it."
2021-04-05 21:56:35,wallstreetbets,Just buy weekly expiration calls on SPY and enjoy the massive gains. Nothing else to understand
2021-04-06 16:31:59,wallstreetbets,There is still time left on the option so he can resell it to someone else that wants this option for more than he paid. Think of what you would have paid for otm options that DFV paid 20 cents for knowing what went down.
2021-04-06 10:59:19,wallstreetbets,"The $40s expire 4/16 (next week).

I’m still holding $35C and $40C. Short interest is >40%, earnings were outstanding and the stock is undervalued, now it’s getting attention on WSB. I’m bullish."
2021-04-05 22:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Congrats man, DM me next time you have a big brained idea"
2021-04-06 11:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Will do! Sounds like a true undervaluation here. 

Hoping to report back with good news 😄"
2021-04-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’ll shave my head if I make any money off this option call 
2021-04-05 23:16:01,wallstreetbets,when you believe in GME just a little too much
2021-04-06 01:22:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, $17,600 on a single GME contract."
2021-04-05 20:22:52,wallstreetbets,"I fully interpret this to include every hair on u/TeslaBullSchok 's head.  Eyebrows, lashes, etc."

Why are these computer movies so expensive to produce anyway? It's just dudes hopping around in front of a green screen and then a nerd making it look cool with a computer. That should be much cheaper to produce than the old school movies with real sets and real actors and real stunts and real explosions."

2021-04-06 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have a very hard time that this is a barometer to measure with. We walked by the theatre by us and they said they have plenty of tix to that movie left and it was 5 minutes before the start.
2021-04-05 22:18:30,wallstreetbets,Bro I watched this shit at home with my lady and it was so underwhelming. It made me wish I saw it in surround-sound with other people and on a 100 inch screen LMAO.

2021-04-06 12:45:18,wallstreetbets,I miss the old theaters with normal seats and affordable tickets. I hate what movie theaters have become. $2 surcharge for purchasing an $18 ticket online rather than at the theater. Pshh

2021-04-05 21:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Movie theaters were dead, or at least on life support even when they were mostly full.  AMC especially.  Selling tickets and concessions will help for a while, but their cost to run a new release is too high, so much so that their business model can't work without charging much more for everything."

2021-04-06 02:39:23,wallstreetbets,"With the ""Snyder Cut"" having been a success, and Dune (2021) being also slated for release through HBO Max, is there any chance of HBO (maybe in partnership with the theater chains), throwing money at David Lynch and saying ""Make the 'Lynch Cut' of Dune (1984), and we'll scan the film in 4K and show your vision""?"
2021-04-06 00:04:32,wallstreetbets,Tenet definitely needed the big screen. I completely understand why Nolan got pissed off. So many of the scenes were specifically made for IMAX and the grandeur would have improved the aesthetic of the film.
2021-04-06 00:41:58,wallstreetbets,Ya it sucked

2021-04-06 01:27:50,wallstreetbets,"That's just filler.  Much cheaper frame by frame than any monster / grand scale action.

I doubt producers will be adventurous enough to release a shorter, action only movie (though that's all alot of moviegoers want.)

Could have spent a little more in money and effort on the filler and had it at least be entertaining / suspense building like that Korean movie from ages ago. ""Host"" I think?"
2021-04-06 01:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha I read some reviews and decided to fast forward through probably 50% of the movie whenever it got boring, and ultimately enjoyed it"

While I do think we’ll see a huge spike in outdoor activities this summer, what people are missing more than simply being outside is community in general.

It's also being streamed HBO max, and they don't seperate the revenue. It's impressive for the Covid Era- by no means is AMC going to survive the next 5 years- there will be a maybe year long ""nostalgia"" phase of people wanting to go to the movies. 

Guess what? You still have self serving executives who give a fuxk less if a dying industry, well dies. 

I've made more money buying puts then I did holding 1000 shares at 7.47 

Enjoy the high- it won't last. The number one rule is don't get of emotionaly attached to an investment. I did and lost a lot of money with AMC. Now, I'm making money. Buying puts $9 puts for end of month and will cash out by EOW.  For the same influx to happen on Monday."

Lol I’m not attached to AMC. It’s run like shit. Movies are going no where though. This isn’t the high. The high will come in the weeks ahead. And good for you on making money.
2021-04-05 21:22:29,wallstreetbets,"You make some great points. Theaters are going to have to shift what they do to capture pre-pandemic revenue (or cut costs).

What I was trying to say is that one of the most successful movie streams would be a mediocre theater opening pre-pandemic. With life resuming I think streaming will slow down a bit. Studios have a lot of incentive to cut out theaters and deliver the product to the consumer though. I’m holding and selling CCs through the end of the summer at a minimum"

I’m not saying one thing or another is more likely than each other. What I’m suggesting is that we don’t base the value of a stock on one movie, during one weekend. People have been aching to go out and do things, will they continue to go to movies when everything else opens? Not sure. 

I’m just stating that there are a lot of reasons to hesitate, and AMC is likely overvalued by several dollars a share right now."

Edit- I'm not the one 1,000% convinced in these studies, I didn't read them.  But I know for a fact you didn't. You didn't even care to google for more than 1 min. I have no evidence otherwise, and these studies are peer reviewed by skeptics, approved by boards, include many intelligent people, and if you claim we shouldn't listen to the 'experts', should we listen to YOU then?

It’s still in phase 3 trials - https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/01/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-six-months-bn/index.html

2021-04-06 07:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Not so sure about that. Current Ryzen mobile is pretty much on par with Apple M1. x86 are essentially RISC designs now, so there's no reason why they should fall behind pure ARM designs. 

ARM's looking at further growths, true. Amazon designed their own ARM cpus for server usage. Those are already in AMD Epyc territory, so things are gonna get interesting. 

Intel is still a major player, has their own fabs, has a large stack of products for every imaginable use case. My guess is: Both manufactures will continue their existance, as if one would go south, government would step in as we'd look at a world monopoly, if there was only one x86 cpu designer/manufacturer. 

I think, and this is no financial advice, that AMD is the better investment right now. Within the past 36 months, they virtually did everything right."

Day 2, ticker A goes down 5%, so ticker B goes down 15%. Ticker A is now $95, and ticker B is $85.

Day 3, ticker A goes up 5.263%, so ticker B goes up 15.789%. Ticker A is now worth $100 (back to base price), and ticker B is now worth $98.42

&#x200B;

After day 3, you can see that ticker A has recovered fully from the 5% drop on day 2, and is back to it's starting value on day 1 of $100. However, even though ticker B tracked 3x the % gain/loss of ticker A, you can see that on day 3, ticker B is only worth $98.42

Amazon will probably use their own cpus. Their ""Graviton"" design is highly efficient and, depending on the task, already as fast as the older AMD Epyc designs. This of course will also affect Intel sales numbers, when a company like Amazon uses their own cpus instead of buying at AMD or Intel. What in five years will happen, nobody can tell. A few years back, ARM based cpus were considered low performance designs and look where we are, now.

As I said: x86 is a RISC design on the inside, while appearing CISC on the outside. Both ARM and modern x86 designs are on a comparable level of power efficiency. What we really would need is better efficiency using all that tech. Remember the first Iphone and remember what it could do, back in 2007? Phones basically do the same now, but are using a 8\*2800 Mhz cpu design instead of the 600 Mhz single core the first Iphone had. What I'm saying is that we have an abundance of raw calculation power on our servers and our clients and we're wasting it. The growth everywhere wouldn't be the same, if resources were used in a more efficent way.

>  
>Sure, you can make X86 chips efficient but you will take a massive hit on speed.

Yeah, it's their first laptop cpu design. But it's using one of the most advanced manufacturing processes from TSMC (5nm node). AMD's still using their 7 nm node and yet, the mobile Ryzen cpus are pretty much as power efficient as their Apple counterparts. AMD laptops with the current APU design can last up to 20 hours without a charge, that's two workdays and it's highly efficient.

Here's a big one: The European Union has plans to spend a huge pile of money to increase its share in the chip market to 20% by 2030. We're talking billions of €. So overall, the dependency on fabs in Asia will reduce till the end of this decade. Intel has, from what I remember, plans too, for creating or upgrading fabs in the US."

2021-04-05 22:24:11,wallstreetbets,"They didn't. My understanding was he bought spreads and one leg executed but the other leg hadn't executed yet so he bought or short sold shares for a massive deficit but he retained the option to buy back or sell back those shares for a similar price meaning losses would have been a very small percentage of the deficit shown.

It's on RH for not being more clear about this to some extent, but it's also relatively hard to actually visualize this. The real answer is it's probably on RH to not allow options trading to people who don't understand options, but how do we test if people understand options? Currently every broker I know of just asks...what's your experience with options...and any wsb genius can just select expert and go to town."

As the value of the options increases, the value difference between the strikes increases. This is bad on a credit spread, as you want the option values to get closer together so you can buy them back cheaper than the difference you sold them for. 

Likewise a debit spread will increase in value during this, as your long leg will increase more than your short leg will decrease as the two contracts end up with a greater difference in price 

Throw in delta changes and the other Greeks in a more realistic scenario, and yeah, weird stuff can happen. This is why for pure IV plays I don't think spreads are a great play most of the time, you want some direction to also help narrow or widen the price points in your favor."

2021-04-05 23:34:35,wallstreetbets,"I cleaned it up but other than an autocorrect from IV to I, it seemed fine. Maybe an example is better.

If you have a spread at the 20 delta and one at the 80 delta, then an increase in IV might bring those to be at the 30 and 70 delta respectively. A debit spread going from 20 to 30 delta will increase in value. A debit spread going from 80 to 70 delta will decrease in value.

In general, debit spreads that have a less than 50 delta will have their delta increase which gives them more value while those over 50 will have their delta decrease which will decrease their value. Delta 50 is usually ""at the money"" so you can use ""in the money"" or ""out of the money"" as a more accessible way to approach the rule.

For credit spreads, the opposite value direction happens."

2021-04-06 00:21:14,wallstreetbets,All you've outlined here is that an ITM debit spread benefits less from an expansion in IV than an OTM debit spread. I know you said this earlier in the thread but that's a terrible response to someone saying that you should sell credit spreads in high IV environments. When some recommends selling credit they're normally saying you should trade on extrinsic value.
2021-04-06 02:11:10,wallstreetbets,What about Brazil Puerto Rico Venezuela? 🤔
2021-04-06 00:36:46,wallstreetbets,"Uhhhhhh... No I don't think you understand. It's not just that one benefits more or less, it's that one is a profit and the other is a loss.

What you're not getting is for a spread you are trading on the price difference in extrinsic value, not directly the value itself and this price difference changes with IV. 

So, you can and should totally sell an otm credit spread in high IV. Because when the IV is really high, it'll sell for near 50% of the spread. The when IV crashes, the price difference drops to maybe 30% of the spread (assuming no change in price). Then you buy it back and you've made 40% profit.

Alternatively, if IV is low, you can sell an itm credit spread at 70% of the spread. Then if IV spikes, the price difference goes to 50% and you buy it back for a 66% profit.

Or... You can do the exact same thing with debit spreads but on the opposite side (if those were call credit spreads, then do it with put debit spreads)."

So you're saying you sell a spread in low IV and IV spikes even though the option price has increased you think that the offset caused by delta decreasing will mean that trade will overall be profitable? I'm very confused why you think that high IV but lower delta is profitable.

I think you're under the false assumption that lower delta causes cheaper options. You've got the causal relationship backwards"
2021-04-06 01:24:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming no delta change from stock price movement here. I'm only talking about how a change in IV changes the value of the spread. 

In case it's unclear, I do agree a change in delta from stock price can absolutely outstrip the change from IV.

Another example. Let's say a stock price moves a lot in a day. The IV spikes. And lets say we think the price is going to stay exactly where it is for a few days, causing IV to crash. So then, you should either sell otm credit spreads or buy itm debit spreads.

The otm credit spread you might sell for 40% of the spread, but as IV drops, the credit spread becomes 10 delta (10% of the spread value) and you can buy it back for the 30% difference.

Meanwhile, you buy the debit spread at 60% of the spread value and it becomes 90 delta so 90% of the spread max value and again you pocket the 30% when you sell.

In both cases, you had to put up 60% of the spread value of your own money, and in both cases you pocketed 30% of the spread value so 50% gain.

The stock price didn't change.

I'm trying to come up with an example of when IV might shoot up but the stock price doesn't move but I'm kind of drawing a blank. The one above, I use to make money often enough to say it's a real world example (with percentages set to make the math easy)

Maybe there's a misunderstanding here about some terminology. When a person talks about a delta change, they often mean a change in the underlying stock price, but when someone talks about X delta, it's [something else](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+20+delta+mean)"
2021-04-06 01:42:40,wallstreetbets,"This example does not demonstrate that a change in delta can outstrip the value of a change

> The otm credit spread you might sell for 40% of the spread, but as IV drops, the credit spread becomes 10 delta (10% of the spread value) and you can buy it back for the 30% difference.

What options language are you using here? What do you mean the credit spread becomes 10 delta therefore 10% of the spread value? Could you tell me what you think Delta is? I can't tell if you're being retarded on purpose to throw me for a loop. ""90 delta so 90% of the spread max value"" ????????"
2021-04-06 08:36:31,wallstreetbets,"Delta is the probability that an option will finish in the money. There's a very complicated formula for determining this precisely, but an acceptable way of estimating it is by having an option be the midpoint of a spread and seeing what percent of the max value of a spread is the present spread value. You can the think of the delta of a spread as the percentage of its own value. This is only an estimate but it assumes an efficient market that prices the spread according to it's profitability.

And yes, I've seen examples where this is wrong and it's an arbitrage opportunity, but for the most part I find it pretty true that a spread at x% of it's max value has an expected value of x% of max value at expiry. And even if it's wrong, the perception is that it's (about) right so the changes in prices follow this perception.

Anyway, I wasn't trying to show a change in delta outstripping a change in value. That sentence doesn't even make sense. Generally, a change in delta is paired with either of two things, a change in the stock price or a change in volatility of the stock. I'm isolating on changes in volatility for the purposes of this discussion.

Let's get back to basics. You agree that when the implied volatility of an option changes, that the probability of it finishing in the money changes? Yes? Do you see how the way it changes is that as IV rises, ""out if the money"" options become more likely while ""in the money"" options become less likely?

Also, I want to be crystal clear about something you said earlier that kind of put me off: there is no causality between IV and delta. The causality is market forces. The changes are parameters describes by changes in prices and they happen lock-step. It's an ""iff a then b"" situation. It's not ""IV is changing and that is causing delta to change"", it's ""the market perceives a change in the stock volatility and that causes a change in the options' implied volatility and deltas"". But there is a relation to how changes in IV translate into changes in delta (and the relationship isn't isomorphic, so you can deduce dDelta from (delta', dIV) but you can't deduce dIV from (IV', dDelta) so it seems causal but it isn't)"
2021-04-06 12:28:34,wallstreetbets,"> Delta is the probability that an option will finish in the money. There's a very complicated formula for determining this precisely, but an acceptable way of estimating it is by having an option be the midpoint of a spread and seeing what percent of the max value of a spread is the present spread value

This may be the point where your confused. Delta *is* the estimate of the probability that an option is ITM come expiration and that porbability can be overstated/understated depending on whether you're holding a put or a call as well as the time to expiration. The dual delta of the option is the probability that an option will expire ITM and differs from delta mathematically as it's the derivative with respect to the strike price. This is why on your brokerage platform POP will differ from delta. I also tried to use your method of estimation here and it either was wrong or I understood it incorrectly. If you can provide an example in your brokerage platform or a link to wherever you learnt this that may help me understand you better.

> Anyway, I wasn't trying to show a change in delta outstripping a change in value. That sentence doesn't even make sense.

I didn't finish of my sentence there. You said you believed a change in delta could outsrip a change in the value ***of IV*** which is what I was discussing.

> Do you see how the way it changes is that as IV rises, ""out if the money"" options become more likely while ""in the money"" options become less likely?

I never disagreed with this the way you tried to link/equivocate this with delta was very wrong and made little sense.

> Also, I want to be crystal clear about something you said earlier that kind of put me off: there is no causality between IV and delta.

They're no causal in the strict sense as obviously it's the rise in options price that causes a change in delta but depending on the moneyness of the option I was just trying to demonstate how the percentage increase in the extrinsic value of an option will result in a smaller delta.

> But there is a relation to how changes in IV translate into changes in delta (and the relationship isn't isomorphic, so you can deduce dDelta from (delta', dIV) but you can't deduce dIV from (IV', dDelta) so it seems causal but it isn't)

Again I have no idea what you're talking about here. There's no such thing as a non-isomorphic derivative. Please explain better what you mean"

You must realize the poor demographic trends as well. More and more people can't have children, or they choose not to because their financial situation doesn't allow for it. If there's one child or less per each pair the population will be HALVED over a period of 30 years. Which means that with all the new construction/building happening, in 30 years there will be a surplus of real estate and nobody to live in it. The prices will go down drastically and you'll still be paying dearly to the bank. Not to mention you'll pay interest and end up coughing up roughly 680k for a property that's worth 500k even with a starting downpayment of 75k. Let that sink in."
2021-04-06 01:33:38,wallstreetbets,I can see you’re a very optimistic person
2021-04-06 03:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Uh, if your mortgage payment is less than what a rental costs might as well buy. If you're planning on relocating in the future consider renting."
2021-04-06 02:25:39,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, I wish."
2021-04-06 02:21:20,wallstreetbets,"It has nothing to do with optimism, it's the numbers and everyone needs to act accordingly imho. In order to stay positive, position yourself in a way you're able to keep that optimism ;)

Smile and wave boys, smile and wave."
2021-04-06 04:38:47,wallstreetbets,"That makes no sense if you're looking at it from an investment point of view. Regardless of how high your mortgage payments are there's still interest rates. Basically you're at the mercy of the Central bank in your country. That's not where you want to be. Idk where you live but if rent is higher than mortgage then something is very wrong. The point is to keep your liberty to do what you want with your money. You don't own anything even though you pay mortgage constantly. Until it's fully paid off you have nothing. Just a sizeable debt you cannot get out of without a loss. If you're renting, you can just up and leave. You cannot do that if you owe the bank. And you're assuming that in 30 or so years the house will be worth the same or more. Which it won't be. Think about it, how much higher can real estate go?"

2021-04-06 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,"I transferred my account from Robinhood. My GameStop shares came in but had a little M next to them and when I highlighted it it said those were margin shares. I use fidelity. I called them and said those are not supposed to be margin shares because I only have cash account. He said no problem and it took a total of 10 minutes to fix it over the phone and show the changes on my account. I also read that if I would have just waited a few days it probably would have fully settled into cash shares. This is 100% truthfully my personal experience.

Edit: before everybody asks me I had less than $1,000 in those shares in my Robinhood account and the transfer took like five business days I think."

2021-04-06 03:40:52,wallstreetbets,"> Do you have source for “a lot of deep itm call options being converted to shares when they expire?”

Yes, of course, I linked to the raw options position data from the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) in my post, but here's a textual summary of all in the money put and call contracts today:

    2021/04/09:  PUTs:    16,991 ; CALLs:    39,273

         total:  PUTs:   241,921 ; CALLs: 1,166,295

As you can see, there's over 1.1 ***million*** in the money call contracts open today - most of them clustered around long-term quarterly LEAPs that were purchased in the 2019-2020 time frame and moved into the money during last year's huge TSLA re-pricing event.

The delta hedging inventory is ***heavily*** biased toward calls - the estimated inventory is over ~100 million TSLA shares if we use a conservative delta hedging estimate that underestimates the true inventory requirements.

(This huge call-bias of in the money options contracts is why both Citadel and Susquehanna had to file a 13-G SEC filing when their TSLA stakes exceeded 5%.)

As to your question: the ratio of selling vs. conversion can be captured via the OCC data as well, and the majority of LEAPs that expired recently were not sold but were left to expire. This created a long-TSLA delta-hedging inventory building pressure not just while the options were live, but the options makers had to distribute millions of TSLA shares when these options were exercised as well.

But, as I argued in other comments here, market makers have to delta-hedge to zero continuously and cannot rely on the percentage of calls sold before expiry vs. left to expire. The delta-hedging requirements & inventory pressures are identical while the options are open, regardless of the profit taking method of holders of in the money calls."

2021-04-06 00:42:11,wallstreetbets,"i've been sober now myself for maybe 2 years or so. the first weeks, months are rough. i would smoke everyday and was really in a bad state back then, mentally just fucked. it might sound like a cliche or whatever that a lot of people say but if you can muster the energy for it getting into some form of exercise can really improve your mood /mental state. i think especially as a recovering addict. after staying sober for about a year i decided to do that to try improve my mind further and it really did work well for me. 

exercise will take your mind off things for that time, you can just focus on that simple routine, you dont have to go crazy with it, i would recommend starting super slow and easy. like even just walking for 5-10 minutes. my body was completely fucked when i started out and i couldnt even run for 5 minutes. but i stuck with it for an entire year. you can meditate through the process and think during this time. i had an overdose a few years ago before i started all this, you can work through things like that. just enjoy the simplicity of exercise and for me i was thankful i still had the opportunity to do it. i hope you and other will be able to work  through your difficulties. all the best for your commitment and recovery brother"

I have totally different outlook and haven’t even thought or gotten the urge. It feels really fucking good. Best of luck to you my friend. It’s tough but can absolutely be done. 

P.S. one of my buddies let me know that I might have ADHD awhile back and that I should check it out. Little did I know I had a lot of the symptoms but the one that really hit me to the core was how many young males that go undiagnosed are like 80% more likely to develop drug/alcohol abuse. Getting on adhd medication changed my life and I haven’t even thought about looking back to my old ways. Might be something to check out. Thought I’d share because it helped me out so much"

They found a tree that gives them Gold nuggets without laboring honesty but by manufacturing synthetic shares of companies that hard workers built and shared with others who can not build such a company. Unfortunately, there come greedy evil doers that believe have the rights to sell other people belongings for the sole purpose and intention to devalue their worthiness and even just as the builders of the company manufacture shares to sell and sell and swell their accounts.

Its a real hard hole to dig yourself out of on your own. And sadly the majority of addicts/alchoholics die loaded. Recovery is rare. But its a beautiful thing. 

I can see how trading can become harmful for sure. I am investing money I can afford to lose first off. And second off I dont do calls or puts or options. And the  reason for that is im retarded. Im fine with basic buying stocks and selling stocks.

[but] he never knew anything about the wash sale rules” wrote Wruk. “He booked a profit but was disallowed all the losses because he never once waited the 30 days on those stocks to book the loss,”

Lol"
2021-04-05 20:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Literally happened

Here is the article. https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill/

It's simple, due to the wash rule he traded so many times per day that he never held any of them for the required 30 days to call it a loss so claimed a profit but couldn't write off any of the losses lol."
2021-04-05 22:14:38,wallstreetbets,Damn there should be a crash course on the rules of the stock market. For example: I didn’t know about the two day rule for being “on record” for dividends. I bought in in the day the date said it was but found out that you had to be in 2 days BEFORE hand. I mean wtf?
2021-04-06 00:41:59,wallstreetbets,Wait what the long term on spx is taxed more than the short term? Am I reading this right?
2021-04-06 09:43:11,wallstreetbets,I don't think anybody aspires to be a socially retarded lunatic on the internet...
2021-04-05 20:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Just spent all afternoon reading about them. It's definitely something we all need to be aware of lmao. I actually just now got around to looking at my RH statement from last year and sure enough there was 14k in ""wash sales disallowed"". My friend who's in investments said it was actually impressive that I funded my account with 50k, had 920k in transactions, and only 14k were wash sales."
2021-04-05 21:08:15,wallstreetbets,And if you go on /r/DayTrading you'll see a post not 1 week ago explaining how that article is missing a ton of information and is not true. Journalists do not equal tax specialists.
2021-04-06 03:02:31,wallstreetbets,"No, it's taxed less. Since SPX doesn't have underlying shares its special. You can only trade options, they are cash settled, and European style so no early exercise. 

Because it is special, 60% of your gains are taxed as if you held them longer than a year (even if you only held them for a week, and 40% as short term.

If I made 100$ and my income bracket put me at 30% income tax Id pay 30% tax on 40$ and 15% on 60$. So 40 × .30 + 60 × .15 = 21. 

I'm no financial advisor so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/sp_500/spx_options/

Edit: I now realize you are talking about holding SPX longer term e.g. more than a year. I'm not sure what happens then.
I'm sure it's in section 1256 on the tax code. I'm just not aware."
2021-04-05 22:32:04,wallstreetbets,"It's entirely plausible though. Whether it's true or not is questionable, but it could happen. Simplest way for it to occur is by getting into volatile stocks like GME. Invest 10k, turn it into 100k, sell at 100k, but get back in at the dip. Eventually stock crashes and you paper hands at 25k cause it's better than nothing. Drop reverses so you buy back in. You have now realized 90k in capital gains and wash sold 75k in capital loses until you sell and stay away from the stock for 30 days. 

Now, most good brokers will warn you of a wash sale and add it to your cost basis, which freaks people out enough to learn about it. However, Robinhood has 0 warnings of wash sales outside of the faq and doesn't include them in your re-purchase cost basis so you have no idea it's occurring. 

So yeah, if you day trade the same stock the entire year all of your incremental loses will get washed and you'll be left with only the gains."

2021-04-05 22:55:58,wallstreetbets,Is that true Robinhood doesn't factor in the wash sale to cost basis? If so then there's your answer for the whole article.

2021-04-06 00:33:13,wallstreetbets,Motley Fool must have a savage short position to write 2-3 articles per day shitting on GME and trying to convince people to buy their bags on other stocks. To devote so much time must mean they are in deep or taking mad cash from those who are. Either way I hope they choke on dicks when this thing pops off.

2021-04-05 23:17:38,wallstreetbets,"My LERD almighty this shit is fantastic. 

For me personally, I really like the stock.  I’ve held since mid-late 2020.  I like frogs and I like McDs ice cream cones.  

Looking forward to: 
1) the book of gme memes 
2) the book of tweet explanations 
3) infusing soooo many tendies into my local community and many many friends in need 
4) anonymous donations set up through donor advised fund.  The only stock that will be held in that fund is GME.  
5) watching our society shift.  Hoping many people can watch the phenomenal examples that Ryan Cohen, Keith Gill, their families and their teams are setting.  Integrity, honesty and teamwork are the deepest fucking values.  

6) the exclusive mini-series release showing this incredible story.  

Power to the players. 

May we all have peace, love and many many happy returns.  🙏🏼💪🏼🌟"

What the hell?"
2021-04-06 02:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Bullish as fuck on this, NNSA basically gets its own printing press from the treasury because, you know, NUKES. $90mil is just foreplay for this relationship."
2021-04-06 08:22:14,wallstreetbets,Time to buy more PLTR
2021-04-05 21:45:19,wallstreetbets,They need to tweet a picture of an electric car or something.  That's worth more than actual contracts in this market.
2021-04-05 23:01:02,wallstreetbets,Ready for that dip!
2021-04-06 02:47:54,wallstreetbets,EOY
2021-04-06 04:54:21,wallstreetbets,"I see this said about every single contract/deal Palantir make, and people will keep saying this with every deal they ever make. But I don't really get why you are saying it for PLTR specifically. No one is saying that $89m extra revenue suddently brings them to being appropriately valued based on traditional methods. Basically every growth stock is ""overvalued"" in that sense, such is the nature of them and the drivers behind their pricing. Valuation of growth stocks isn't strictly about fundamentals and never has been, there are different pricing theories that have always been more aligned with growth orientated tech.

Not sure why people think every PLTR contract should be the one that suddenly brings it in line with their fundamental valuation approach."
2021-04-06 07:49:47,wallstreetbets,"Everyday one of these contracts is posted and everyday someone says the same thing. 

It's like....disney isn't moving on my disney+ subscription....but they are moving on all of them..."
2021-04-06 08:46:30,wallstreetbets,Im sure you are have your DD. What product can PLTR have and use to expand its offering to the NNSA?
2021-04-05 20:44:02,wallstreetbets,Russssss
2021-04-06 03:17:15,wallstreetbets,What was the IV and price when you bought em though
2021-04-06 00:01:53,wallstreetbets,"From the comments Karp has made, sounds like a lot of compensation was in stock, and people are just able to make some money working there now."
2021-04-06 06:54:06,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow
2021-04-06 11:01:23,wallstreetbets,"An 89m contract over 5 years will not move the stock price long term. that’s $18m a year, and government contracts leave under 10% for profit margin normally. So that’s less than $2m a year profit margin from this contract. If they’re currently valued at $40b then it has little impact."
2021-04-06 11:07:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s a bad comparison. Disney+ adds a massive amount of cash flow to Disney. If they have 100m subscribers that’s a lot of cash flow every year. ($8x12x100m). Disney is also a long standing and established company, not a growth stock. The fact that they were able to add a growth aspect to their bottom line is huge for them. 

Palantir gets about $18m per year in revenue from this contract, which is less than $2m profit each year for the next 5 years. This one contract specifically isn’t going to move much for them. If they really are winning a contract like this every day then there may be a slight uptick but you also have to understand that every contract requires new hires and overhead, it’s better for them to get a much larger, long term contract... like 10 years $10b rather than a lot of small contracts that add up to $10b over the next 10 years."
2021-04-06 11:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Without going into specifics, my knowledge is broader on NNSA's mission and function than it is with Palantir's capabilities. Palantir has a lot to offer the agency through efficiency and cheaper maintenance, to begin with. Then there's the potential to branch out into new relationships with weapons and reactor manufacturing & development companies under the NNSA umbrella. 

If Palantir can integrate with NNSA's weapon testing & employment studies hold on tight cause Papa Thiel is going to make it rain gold bricks... The Defense Nuclear Agency and NNSA have relied heavily on computing to accomplish their testing and readiness missions after the Test Ban was initiated, and this reliance is only getting deeper with the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear Triad. 

On a lighter note, if Palantir integrates with NNSA and the DOD to the extent I believe they will we could quite possibly be seeing the formation of SkyNet and all die as a result... Isn't nuclear war fun kids?"
2021-04-06 07:54:51,wallstreetbets,So if the stock rises their compensation is worth more. It makes no sense for them not to wish the price rises
2021-04-06 17:28:29,wallstreetbets,"Federal contracts aren’t that profitable, commercial is significantly more."
2021-04-05 21:48:50,wallstreetbets,Someone beating them for a contract would imply they have competition.  Part of the bull thesis is they don't have competition and 17 years of data acting as a moat for any other data analytics ai software to keep any competition away.
2021-04-05 21:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Wow, people really didn’t read 3 words in huh? 

Like, three different people.

Wow."

2021-04-05 21:53:25,wallstreetbets,With Palantir specifically it would tank the whole stock.  It's already very hard to value because some of the contracts are classified and the software is some of it classified.  The big moat of no competition is a big thing people are hanging their hat on.
2021-04-06 02:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Not really, bubbles happen when value is based on nothing. For example, there cannot be a bubble with say Apple or Amazon because the companies are worth that much per share. Simple metrics.

Others such as GME are due to pure frenzied speculation and WILL burst at one point or another."
2021-04-06 11:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the majority is based on speculation, guesses or just everyone agreeing it is worth more, just so everyone can make more money. 

In my state, it's housing again. Everything is up about 159,000 from a few years ago. People never learn. It's great if we all agree our assets are worth more. But it always topples. And instead of learning the lesson, everyone rushes back in to buy it while it's cheap and ride the pretend valuation bubble. It's a terrible system, but it is the system we all live in. Inflation and bubbles..."

Imagine if they needed his advice, they would have only been able to finance a few hundred million or had to dilute by a lot more.

Shareholders are surely glad Ryan Cohen is in charge because he wasn't short sighted enough to listen to CNBC because he realized he could get a lot more and without pissing off his customer base in the process.

2021-04-05 20:58:27,wallstreetbets,"So this will push the stock price down through them selling, while technically pushing the intrinsic value of the stock up because GME will raise capital for their transition into an esports beast. So short-term bad, long-term good?"

2021-04-06 03:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Do I have to buy 3.5M shares now? Sorry, retarded..."
2021-04-06 04:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Like AMC its a stock offering. Its not even a bad thing to offer or even sell shares responsibly. If they issue all 3.5m at once it could hurt but if they sell bit by bit, positive news from the selling could cause hedgefunds to buy back. The stock offering from GME and AMC is something they are planning to get back at the hedgefunds with.  

Now imagine you are a hedgefund and shorted a company for 20m shares, that company now approved a stock offering of 20m shares. Theoretically if they release all 20m shares at once you can buy them all up at current price and be on your way. 

However, if they do say 1m at a time, you could choose to buy buy all 20m shares today when they only released 1m into market essentially shooting the price up, or what you could do is buy 1m+ shares and as the price begins to shoot up you realized that the shares released have been bought back so you stop buying but the problem with this is you end up driving the price up and up every time they release more shares. It will be a prolonged cycle of small share releases into the market as hedgefunds compete with other institutions and retail for those shares. IMO hedgefunds shorting after AMC/GME do the offering just dig the hole deeper. This offering by GME and AMC essentially say, “you can buy back all your stocks now, or compete with retail and institutions to buy back your stock in the coming months, if you choose option A VW squeeze, if you choose option B Tesla squeeze. Either way hedgefunds are fucked imo."
2021-04-06 04:23:25,wallstreetbets,I do not think this will have a major impact the squeeze. Bullish intensifies.
2021-04-06 04:43:20,wallstreetbets,"So, 1 share ?"
2021-04-06 04:51:07,wallstreetbets,"You tards realize that $1,000,000,000 divided by 3.5M shares is $285 per share right?"

2021-04-05 20:32:00,wallstreetbets,"A lot of institutions were waiting on GME to do this before jumping in. Not only does it show good management insight (by not selling out and doing it back when it was only 40 dollars) but now they don't have to worry about frontloading a potential offering that hangs over their heads like a sword of damocles.

Once the offering closes in a few days, this should go up."
2021-04-06 01:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Also notice how they released it before market hours,  so that retail don't get scared from sudden announcement and start paper handing during day, by the time everyone wakes up and market opens enough clarification is achieved.

I think before, they could short for years and years selling synthetic shares until investors lose and sell. Hopefully, soon they will get burned for all their immoral atrocities they have inflicted in their uncontrollable greed. This is historic in my humble opinion that darkness are getting exposed and disgusted by the people who like to earn honest living and enjoy the fruit of their labors protected from the thieves to better their families and communities.

They’re shorting ETF’s with GME in them now and all kinds of crazy shit. 

Go add up the shares of GME owned by all the investment funds (which you can easily find) - that’s 100 million in itself. 
Then we have the shares owned by the company - that’s at least 20 million, then the public float- at least 50 million.

1) Sell a $35,000 car you don't own and don't possess. You don't have to borrow a car; you just have to locate a potential car that could theoretically be lent to you.

2) Pocket the money

3) At some point in the future, the person you sold the car to is going to want to take physical possession of their car. But since you don't own the car, you have two choices: You could go buy one and hope you can find the car for less than $35,000 and then pocket the difference, or you could ... 

4) Fail To Deliver the car you sold to the guy who gave you $35,000. In this case you just walk away and pay small fine.

That's Wall Street, girls and boys."

2021-04-06 02:54:59,wallstreetbets,"Well I found that they often smell because like people with house cats after awhile they don't smell it anymore. Horses cost a small fortune in maintenance, feeding, storage and general upkeep. They go wrong and cost lots."

I mean... legally it's theft, sure, but it's also literally short-selling something.

In the horse case, there was an agreement that was breached so there's a whole new world of shit there, but in general, borrowing something and selling that which you don't own with the expectation of buying it back in the future at a lower price and pocketing the difference is literally short selling."

You would have to go and get the stolen horse back from the victims who bought the stolen property."
2021-04-06 05:11:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it is.

I called it, you were arguing that they were going to make a cash ay hand play against someone who was saying they should do a stock buyback.  I said they were going to do an acquisition and made several comments explaining why, out I was correct and you were wrong shitbird.

> It's the same thing. Otherwise they could just borrow money to fund that acquisition.

Your argument was immaterial to mine and self-contradictory.  You went on to argue that debt doesn't matter (so why did they need to issue stock to fund this acquisition-- this is the self-contradiction) and that Discovery was their target (which is where I called you a retard).

And it is/was irrelevant to my point about debt.  I pointed this out, linked you the comment I made at the start of this saying it was irrelevant, and you still persist in trying to make a strawman.

> You repeatedly lacked any understanding of how debt with companies actually worked and anyone following this will laugh at how wrong you were.

How was I wrong?  You still haven't answered my basic question-- if there's no problem with them taking on more debt, then why did they issue more stock?

> You made your stupid fucking thought process, I pointed out that it was retarded

Is this what you do?  You just claim ""I kept proving you wrong"" and hope it sticks?

> provided actual information as to why

When?  What information?

>and less than 8 hours later an acquisition happened exactly as I said it was likely to happen.

1)  It's still irrelevant to what I said about debt, which is what I said from the start.

2)  You said they were going to acquire Discovery.  I told you they wouldn't.  They haven't.

Cant convince stupid.

I have no doubt the comment history proves you've learned nothing.

How many times in this paragraph have you said ""You're stupid and wrong"" without ever showing why or backing up any statements?

I can do it too.  You're a retard.  I'm right, you're wrong, and you don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about.  Want me to keep going for a paragraph without bringing up any new points, or is that level of stupid reserved just for you?"

The massive short interest keeping it from walking up for 4 years or so prevented a traditional pattern from emerging. Thus, we must be more fluid in our interpretations."
2021-04-06 16:48:57,wallstreetbets,"Similarly to you. I rarely play puts for more than 6 dollars when I’m scalping. Upside is more predictable and follows better resistances. Like 80-90% of the days range is developed in the first 90 minutes so once I get rips in the mornings I wait till ~1230-1p and enter calls again after the dust settles. 

Far too much to type on how I actually trade it but I say trade with options. 

Damn! You really are a madman and a magician. I’m more of an intraday scalper than I am a hold swing trader capable of doubling my money like you holding overnight. I don’t do that much in this current market. Not since early January. One of these days the market volatility will smooth out and it’ll be safer for holding, for me, but I like to get my money and run and not over trade. Be careful over trading. 

If you’re finding great success overnighting try and stick to what’s working instead of feeling like you need to play every move. I guarantee you’ll slip and lose more than you think by over trading."

The delta is way better on monthlies but you don't get nearly as good of a gamma as within the 2 week mark. I'll bet you're too autistic to follow my instructions and will lose 50% plus of your portfolio before learning the ins and outs of options and holding overnight like this guy for a brief period then getting out to avoid theta and IV decline as expiration approaches."

I don't think you can look only at the SPX chart and make deductions based on times so different than our own based solely only on those technicals. However, there is no scoreboard so everyone can have their opinion and when they're wrong we all just forget. The survivalist bias is strong with predictions like this.  


Think about how the GDP growth of the US in the past 50 years is much different than the GDP growth of the 1900-1950. Exponential.

In the past 40 years it's been a near exponential growth pattern along with exponential growth in China. I think some technicals are going to have to find their new place in this new paradigm.

2021-04-06 17:34:22,wallstreetbets,Flat Premarket usually predicts tight ranges. Days like today wait for the ranges to be set then trade them.

2021-04-06 17:35:29,wallstreetbets,Better to wait for better days and make money than possibly over trade on flat range days in my opinion but look at your PnL and see if you’re profitable. Probably not over time because algorithms control days like today.

2021-04-06 14:29:12,wallstreetbets,Your comments on margin are appreciated and respected. I still maintain that you cannot base your prediction of an impending market crash based on technicals of the SPX over 121 years when there is a dramatic paradigm shift that has occurred in wealth and asset prices and inflation. Especially considering that this margin usage was NOT prevalent in the creation of the boom occurring since 1950 in real GDP growth. That is a more recent phenomenon.
2021-04-06 14:29:45,wallstreetbets,"You can, however, base your assumption that there could be a correction coming as a result of margin but NOT because of technicals of the 121 year old data. That's my assertion."

I just tried looking for the original comment to say exactly why but Tesla did something it hadn’t done all year, which was lose momentum on its bollinger bands and break below its lower band, that break felt bearish. I thought it would dip to $700 and I thought about buying back in but then the entire market overall started to get volatility and it went lower. Now, it’s more up to what the market does than anything else.

Where we currently stand feels like being on a frozen lake on thin ice. We could fall through any moment as we glide along."
2021-04-06 18:13:11,wallstreetbets,I gotcha. Sounds reasonable. Thanks. Price action looks bearish as hell right after the peak for a few days consolidating. I owned it going into earnings lost quite a lot overnight in my calls. Closed and scalped for the next few weeks and then have been cautiously scalping and swinging 1-2 days only ever since.

The Video essay is going to be about the culture/community of WallStreetBets and what users think about the GameStonk situation. If you could answer a question or a few (listed below) it would really be helpful and if you’d be interested in being interviewed, please let me know!

2021-04-06 11:27:26,wallstreetbets,Damn it. Am I late to this? I was trying to buy it earlier but I was waiting for a dip in options prices. They got pricy quick. This looks like a reasonable buy-in now despite the higher IV.

2021-04-06 13:47:35,wallstreetbets,"levering up 8\~20 times the initial value of the TRS, as Billy did through his family office. Then buying back shares incrementally, since you are only buying the shares of the select few firms, it is guaranteed that the price would increase. And as long as there aren't some unforeseen announcements like Viacom did with their new issuances, this pretty much guarantees you'd profit. That's how this guy turned a few hundred million into 20 billion dollars in the past 12-14 months.

The very real risk here is that once the value of the share dips suddenly, you can be totally wiped out, say a 15% dip as in this case, ergo there is no room for error.

Now, the question is whether any majority shareholders are also allowed to do this through family offices, ala incognito, or are they barred from doing so due to regulation?"

2021-04-06 12:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Not saying ""I don't understand, so sell""

I'm paraphrasing what most posters promoting PLTR are saying. There saying 1. At first I didn't understand what PLTR does. 2. But after studying and research , I do. 3 But when I try to explain to you, it becomes apparent I still don't really understand. 4. But doesn't matter, it's all good cause PLTR is still so awesome."
2021-04-06 12:27:36,wallstreetbets,"I mean wall street articles are literally saying that.

I do actually understand what PLTR does. But I am also in that line of work. It is possible wall street stops becoming dumb this year, but I doubt it. It took amazon years with AWS, and I am still not sure wall street understands what they do, but it makes lots of money so they are happy now.

PLTR will be for the 90% of companies that just want their BI and analytics to work, and have lots of money, but haven't figured out how to build out an analytics team. They are essentially apple, while splunk, snowflake, datadog, and aws services are like early android. 

My only worry right now is getting my shares called away and be chasing price with CSP."

2021-04-05 20:45:51,wallstreetbets,"That is wrong again. TLRY has definitely sold Marijuana to and in the US more than once already. They don't do it regularly, but the channels of distribution are already there. If any foreign company were going to be exporting Cannabis to the US, it would 100% be them.

Do you really think the largest Cannabis companies don't have plans to enter the US market further? For Tilray those considerations are likely going to be post merger, once they've secured more cash and had a chance to evaluate the market further. Considering they've said they will, and have already bought a few US businesses, this should be pretty obvious I would think. Go look at how much cash the two have combined. It's plenty to quickly jump in when the time is right, and I expect they will.

All it would take is a purchase of some of these more run down US companies that have licenses, but no sales. Pretty obvious this is how the Canadian companies will enter the US markets when the time is right."
2021-04-05 20:54:43,wallstreetbets,I’m not gonna argue with you bro. They haven’t sold a Gram in the states and they don’t hold any licenses. That’s zero exposure to the market. Hold them if you want.

You really think you're smarter than Elon and his engineers that directly disagree with you?

Interesting. I haven't seen that written about anywhere else. Makes sense, intuitively."
2021-04-06 14:08:41,wallstreetbets,Great reply. Thoughtful and is roughly the same research I have come across with similar predictions.
2021-04-06 14:14:45,wallstreetbets,"You do that super fucking annoying Reddit thing where the entire basis of your comment is built on a straw man “YOU THINK YOURE SMARTER THAN X OR Y!?” Fuck that is so annoying. 

“[MarketWatch: Tesla TSLA, 0.28% CEO Elon Musk and others have been critical of the Lidar technology your company uses for its vehicles. Why are they wrong?  Russell: Our 50 other commercial partners and seven of the top 10 largest auto makers in the world would probably disagree with Elon along with pretty much every expert in the industry. I think he’s kind of on an island there. Back when Elon started with his anti-lidar ideas, he promised the world he could deliver this full self-driving stack off this basic camera solution.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-the-26-year-old-billionaire-trying-to-take-on-elon-musk-and-tesla-11617027597)

Cameras are really good at seeing some things out there in 2D and kind of understanding the general picture of what was going on. Not very accurate and reliable. It’s orders of magnitude different from what you can do with a lidar and what’s actually needed to solve an autonomous problem.

MarketWatch: What is Musk not seeing?

Russell: What Tesla has today, what they call full self driving you don’t need lidar for. The problem is that it’s not full self driving (laughs), it’s actually not self driving at all. That’s where I think they have drawn huge criticism in the industry with this rogue branding approach to what is being delivered.

Lidar gives you a true 3-D understanding, not a 2D understanding. Instead of keeping your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road at all times, take your hands and eyes off, use your phone, read a book, watch a movie. Actually autonomous.”

Literally the answers are on Google. Elon has been over promising and under delivering for years now."
2021-04-06 14:25:41,wallstreetbets,">Elon has been over promising and under delivering for years now.

I agree. It's part of Tesla's success being capable of tapping the capital markets. 

>Not very accurate and reliable. It’s orders of magnitude different from what you can do with a lidar

Remember that your assumption is based on the technology we know today and Computer Vision's current capabilities. Add it radar and sonar and I will just say I believe that Elon and his engineers being confident that they can deliver eventually without the use of Lidar is probably worth considering as a reality. Albeit, it could be far away."
2021-04-06 14:27:41,wallstreetbets,"https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39647/tesla-admits-current-full-self-driving-beta-will-always-be-a-level-2-system-emails

Yeah, it could be years away. But with Lidar it wouldn’t be. If this is a race, they can’t afford not to have lidar & get passed."
2021-04-06 14:33:26,wallstreetbets,"If they feel that it'll be necessary, I believe the bravado and charm of Elon can quickly switch to Lidar. He's already switched positions on the use of HD maps. 

The point is: you're viewing this argument and Elon and Tesla as static. The current Lidar competitors do not have a product competitive with current level 2 of Tesla. Therefore, when the market demands more, the market will get more. When the tech becomes cheaper, better, and capable, they'll implement what is needed. 

They're the most dynamic manufacturer led by the most dynamic leader since probably Kelly Johnson in the 1950-1960s."
2021-04-06 14:35:51,wallstreetbets,"You're also saying that if they just implement this tech, it'd be ready to go when the most valuable companies in the world have been trying to do autonomy based on Lidar for years already.   


If it was possible and needed, they'd use it. Your assumption is based on false pretense. Just like when Elon addressed the comment about hiring more capable engineers ""if they'd just hire more engineers fallacy"" saying they don't exist or aren't hirable. The tech doesn't exist or isn't feasible, yet."
2021-04-06 14:34:38,wallstreetbets,I’m not viewing them as static at all. I’m viewing the stock price as having priced in a lot of promises & a lot of hopium. That is not going to mean much if the market corrects.
2021-04-06 14:38:46,wallstreetbets,"Sigh.... you’re exhausting man....... there’s so much research you haven’t done. So damn much. When Waymo is at taxis that are truly self driving using lidar, that’s how I can be confident that if Tesla had adopted lidar they’d be further ahead. 

https://insideevs.com/news/492220/tesla-fsd-beta-vs-waymo-driverless-taxi/

One is clearly driverless. One is clearly not. It’s hands on system you have to pay attention to. Now please, any further arguments you have please go to google & take your time there. I don’t have time to continue to give you knowledge in this space that should be obvious."
2021-04-06 17:06:35,wallstreetbets,Just so we’re clear: Tesla’s current forward P/E is 122. That’s not crazy for a company growing at 50% annually by historic measures. There’s literally too many examples to back up my statement that I’m not going to.
2021-04-06 17:04:37,wallstreetbets,"The odd thing here is I think the same about you and your research. I have read about and followed Waymo for years. It’s still a toy at best and if you think it’s advanced beyond the parlor trick of driving in a geofences area, then you’re mistaken. 

The LiDAR mapping is great for ranging out the surroundings but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s necessary just because of what theoretical possibilities LiDAR could afford. 

You’re so caught up in your biases you don’t realize you’re literally using the same logic I am about why Vision can be capable of handling autonomous. 

Logic you’re proposing:
LiDAR CAN provide for a better range analysis and mapping for a car to avoid obstacles and thus this translates into a better system and makes autonomous possible. 

Variable A (LiDAR) makes variable B (autonomous driving) possible by providing a better understanding of surroundings. 

My logic:
Variable X (better more capable computer vision combined with radar and sonar) makes variable B (autonomous driving) possible by providing better understanding of surroundings. 

Same argument. That which CAN become better will become better but that which will enable autonomous driving has NOT yet been borne out. Otherwise there would be autonomous cars capable of driving outside preselected isolated corridors. Waymo is a joke. If you came at me suggesting something from MobileEye I’d take you more seriously. 

We can argue responsibly here and guess what, we can each be wrong. Including you, oh wise one. 

Finally, your abstraction and deferment to questioning my credibility instead of my merits of argument are giving credence to my notion that you’re one of those cynical know-it-all types that cannot take even constructive criticism."
2021-04-06 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I’ve cited the people working on Lidar & their direct thoughts on the different autonomous systems. Your response was “a breakthrough could be made” my response is that we’re already seeing systems that are hands free built with lidar. Actually autonomous. Both are making advances. One is being built purely autonomous. I’m not using any kind of bias here, I’m sticking to the facts that I see. Tesla in their own filings said they will stick with level 2 description & have admitted the limits. You’re not going to change my mind on current facts."
2021-04-06 17:16:53,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. I respect the notion of autonomous possibly needing LiDAR but I gave a counter argument saying autonomous might not need it. Then qualified that it might be possible and if so, it’ll be incorporated by Tesla eventually. 

We will see. I learned something from you hopefully you did from me."
2021-04-06 17:18:43,wallstreetbets,"Okay but confusing that Tesla made a government filing not taking ownership of autonomous because it would cause legal or financial struggles isn’t strengthening your argument. 

Learn to see through the headline. Why would Elon and Tesla make that filing? Probably to avoid litigation or regulation on their current work. Why introduce more possible oversight? It would be dumb not to write that filing. 

Don’t fall for the bear thesis because of stupid articles or filings like that."
