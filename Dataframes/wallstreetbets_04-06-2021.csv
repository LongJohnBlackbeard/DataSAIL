# The service and Product.

&#x200B;

[General information on how SDC does business.](https://preview.redd.it/q3hif166rkr61.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b93787de857cb99c9bd688b61b65e5526a217ca)

SDC is a telehealth dental company that provides clear aligners for 1/3 the cost of $Align and mom and pop orthodontists. SDC has developed a vertical integration system where the customer has the ability to work with them in a couple of different ways.

&#x200B;

1.) Work solely through SDC where they scan their teeth at home or in one of their dental offices where the scan is sent back to the production facility for their aligners. The aligners are molded and shipped directly to the consumer thus cutting out the middleman and overhead.

2.) Work with an in-network orthodontist and have the orthodontist submit the information to SDC and the same process is completed at a fraction of the cost.

The consumer then has regular checkups as they begin adjusting their teeth with an easy in-person meeting or call over the phone.

# Partnerships and contracts.

1.) SDC has developed partnerships with major insurance companies from blue shield to MetLife thus helping customers have little to no cost.

2.) They have also developed a payment plan to help customers who do not have dental insurance to afford the payments.

3.) SDC has developed partnerships with major network orthodontists and dentists across the United States and other countries. Dentists get paid for their time and a referral fee for having SDC recommended.

4.) Agreements with CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Sam's club to present their ancillary teeth whitening product line that is normally given as a bonus to those who pay for the teeth straightening kit. This promotes brand awareness because they are on every shelf in America as well as a small amount of revenue.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals

SDC IPO'd just before covid and suffered as many other companies did during that time. Since then they have been growing QOQ, paying off high-interest debt by securing 0% convertible notes, bringing on power marketing players to the board of directors, and soon will be increasing their gross margins by \~10%.

&#x200B;

1.) QOQ growth.

[During a pandemic, a discretionary income product and service was able to create QOQ growth.](https://preview.redd.it/hc639k7uskr61.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc848aa4163d3b0aae464f732452ae4e12b7fac)

As seen above SDC was affected in q2 over 2020 significantly, but was able to survive and bounce back. Now it is only a matter of time before SDC is a name in every home.

2.) Debt Paydown.

&#x200B;

[Elimination of high-interest debt with 0&#37; interest capped calls.](https://preview.redd.it/vcqjsp9gtkr61.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a578d5ffe592d4830fa43ad3336212f5ddab02)

As seen above SDC has recently been able to enter a large cash position with this convertible debt offering. This debt payoff provides a few benefits. No interest is eating away at their profits, it protects current shares holders from dilution under the lower cap of $18, and it puts SDC in a great cash position to further their expansion into international markets.

&#x200B;

3.) Marketing and New board members.

Ted Ward has recently been brought on for his expertise in marketing. You may know him from developing Geico's marketing. [https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/](https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/)

Also as seen below, SDC has been growing significantly QOQ with a reducing Marketing budget. They are seeing a healthy referral-derived customer base. This is only expected to increase as SDC further expands its operations.

[Less Marketing with Growth](https://preview.redd.it/hcmf03sgukr61.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dcf5aa04e9d80470257c6d1d7ab57f01b147cd)

4.) International Expansion.

&#x200B;

[SDC has its sights focused outside of the U.S. where teeth straightening is unaffordable for most other middle-income workers. ](https://preview.redd.it/99wiosr1vkr61.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=73d76ef4c9627794b2551ee8c676f5201e58ce79)

SDC has been setting up small brick-and-mortar and pop-up locations in countries around the world. (Most recently Mexico city).

&#x200B;

# Technicals and Mechanics

&#x200B;

[1-year chart SDC](https://preview.redd.it/bzkeq05kvkr61.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6c684bf21d768232e144758cbf46cf784f45147)

&#x200B;

SDC at the current moment has been on a downward trend since February where it reached around $16. It has been consolidating since where it has met heavy support at $10. It set for an upward trend soon however the shorts have been having their way for quite some time. Essentially ""training or choo chooing"" this company.

1.) 30% short interest. That's all.

# Counter arguments. Weakness and Threats.

1.) Rivalry amongst existing competitors. SDC is up against every orthodontist in the U.S. that wants the process of getting braces or a clear aligner from $align to stay the same. This is affecting their pockets and unless SDC is able to continue building trust with orthodontists to use their product, sadly SDC will lose market share.

2.) Bargaining power of suppliers. Nonexistent because smile direct owns and operates the creation of the straighteners.

3.) Bargaining power of buyers. Yes, consumers have many different options when it comes to finding a way to straighten their teeth. However, find a company that provides the same service at the same cost as SDC. You simply cannot.

4.) The threat of substitutes. Yes, people could choose to decide, ""Hey I don't want straight teeth. It is what is on the inside that counts. He/she will choose me for my personality.""

5.) The threat of New Entrants. Non-existent. SDC holds a patent on their process. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html)

I am long and hard. I do agree that I am not sure when this company will spike, but I am not looking to have this jump next week. Just wanted to share what I have seen over the past six months or so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some demand for a TLDR.

\-Large Cash positions with convertible debt at 0% interest that will only be converted above the $18 share price

\- Patent on their process. Not even Align can do what SDC is doing and ALign is in the 4-500 price range

\- New Company that has 30% short interest that has been growing quarter after quarter even with covid

\- The guy who created ""So easy a caveman can do it"" is now running their show. Ted has control over their marketing. Big players are involved now."
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,13k Earnings YOLO on $APHA 
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested! By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. 
 
&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. 
 
&nbsp;
  
Ok, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. 
 
&nbsp;
 
**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: 
 
1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. 
  
2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  
 
&nbsp;

 
Retailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. 
   
&nbsp;

Let's look at the short interest over time for ASO: 
 
&nbsp;

|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|
|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|
|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|
|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|
|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|

&nbsp;

We can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. 
 
&nbsp;

Most shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. 

&nbsp;

Some may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, 
&nbsp;


>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.
&nbsp;


So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. 

&nbsp;
 
**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**

&nbsp;
 
[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  
 
&nbsp;

Did someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: 
 
&nbsp;

|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|
--:|:--|:--|
|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|
|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|
|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|
|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|
|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|

&nbsp;
 
Price at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. 
 
&nbsp;

Let's see that in a table: 

|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||
:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||
|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||
|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||
|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||
|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||
|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||

&nbsp;
 
Now, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. 

&nbsp;

 
|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|
--:|--:|--:|--:|
|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|
|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|
|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|
|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|
 
&nbsp;
 
I'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. 
  
&nbsp;

**Indicators** 
 
I don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) ""crossing over"" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). 

&nbsp;
 
**Conclusion** 
&nbsp;

For me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. 
 
&nbsp;
 

Thanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.


&nbsp;

Positions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.
 
&nbsp;

Edit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps ""gapping up"", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.

 
&nbsp;

Edit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now."

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"The Billy Hwang Gang Bang and Why I Am Still Balls Deep In $VIACA In a [previous post from last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhp1fe/spongebob_vs_hwang_gang_and_the_banks/), I outlined why I thought $VIACA would moon like $DISCB. I bought the calls, envisioned the massive money I was going to make, and was promptly kicked in the dick. I am ride or die so you can bet your ass I am still in the trade.

The premise was that the big banks that were holding the Billy Hwang’s Archegos’ bag, most notably Credit Suisse and Nomura, were about done with selling. As it turns out, the risk management department at Credit Suisse is more retarded than I thought, and Monday’s trading was still filled with lots more selling.

**What changed**

In the afterhours last night, Credit Suisse showed just how shit their risk management department is by revealing that they only managed to sell 3m of its 37m $VIACA/$VIAC shares over the course of a week. Credit Suisse is running/ran a sale process in the afterhours tonight to [get out of their remaining 34m shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/credit-suisse-said-to-offer-viacomcbs-vipshop-farfetch-blocks). I speculate Credit Suisse’s large, unmoved block of shares was an open secret around the Street and inspired traders to keep pressing shorts until Credit Suisse visibly raised the white flag. Well, we know Credit Suisse has now folded.

With the Credit Suisse selling out of the way, I am guessing that there will be a lot of short covering and rebuys coming in the next week or so to conclude the trade on the short side. My preferred way to play Viacom is with $VIACA for the same reason $DISCB was the way to play Discovery. I believe $VIACA is now primed for takeoff and will probably buy more tomorrow because I am a degenerate.

**TL;DR**

VIACA 4/16 $50c, $60c, $65c, and $70c

Most options expire worthless and these probably will too."

This is my first post here, so if there are some aspects not to your liking, please let me know.

I am a pattern trader, and today I noticed a double bottom forming and other entry signals on Walmart (WMT) :

Here is an overview of the situation and the move I will be making on it when I get confirmation:

**The catalysts :**

* Double bottom pattern
* 50 day moving average (MA) breakout.

Now, when there is more than one signal forming on a single stock, the probability of the trade going your way is much higher than when there is just one signal.

**The play**

Today I will wait for confirmation of the breakout (the stock trades higher than yesterday's close) and I will enter using the following **setup:**

**Entry price :** 140$ (breakout confirmation)

**Stop loss :** 137.5$ ( half way through yesterday's bar - breakout failure - setup not valid anymore)

**Risk :** 2.5$/sh

**Target :** 147.5$ ( the next resistance level, also the target level of the double bottom)

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"$ROO vs $DASH - Fading work-at-home plays - Pair trade? It seems to me like Deliveroo's IPO had a bad timing, getting caught in the middle of a rotation away from the work-at-home play and towards the economic-recovery play. Similarly, US comp Doordash lost 40% between mid February to mid March. Comparing the two:

**Doordash** (**$DASH**)

* 2020 revenue: $2.9 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%
* Market cap: $42 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.5x

**Deliveroo** (**$ROO**)

* 2020 revenue: £1.2 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%
* Market cap: £5.6 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.7x

So Doordash is trading at 3x the multiple that Deliveroo is trading at, with 4x the growth rate. Also, Doordash is the dominant player in a much larger market. Looks like a pair-trade.

**Thoughts?**

Fyi, losing 30% on its first day of trading, Deliveroo's IPO was the worst first-day performance for any company that IPO-ed with a valuation >£1 billion in London on record."

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,$PLTR load the boat 
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,Credit Suisse cuts dividend on hit from Archegos hedge fund scandal; investment bank head and chief risk officer step down 
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"DD on $WKHS Aii to be clear this is neither a bull nor bear case for WKHS, it's just regular DD. Also I'm not putting emojis in this shit. 
 
**What does WKHS do?**
  
They make last mile delivery vans C-650 and C-1000 (these numbers denote storage capacity, not mileage or battery capacity). They have been making them for more than half a decade, whence they started by converting diesel vans into plug in hybrids. Their actual EV offering only began around 2018-2019. This is also the time they started showing off their drone delivery tech (which is not the point of this post, but it is why they are in ARKX). This is one of the only major EV companies that actually shipped (albeit very few) product.
  
**Fundamentals**
  
I don't know too much about what everyone looks for in fundamentals, and I'm absolutely garbage at reddit formatting but here's what I know. Since the financing that occurred from end of last year, they have a huge cash position and own the 250k sqft factory in OH. Their cash positions is hundreds of millions of dollars, so they are in a position to continue developing their production. This financing came from the 10% stake in Lordstown Motors, which recently put out two beta trucks and operates in the GM factory in Lordstown, OH. 
  
They came to fame when they were in the running for the USPS truck which obvs they didn't get and went to OSK, a decision which has a tonne of scrutiny on it (but probably won't change for at least another 6 months until DeJoy is ousted). 
  
They currently have a MKT cap of under 1.7B, despite having a backlog of 8000 trucks (easily 400mil worth of product). In comparison, ARRIVAL (which hasn't released anything yet) has a market cap of 9.5B, and NKLA (which has neither a factory nor a product) has a dwindling MKT cap of 5B. 
  
The stock itself follows $RIDE closely, and I'm mad bullish on $RIDE, so I expect to it at the very least take off when $RIDE takes off. Also, they have a 50% institutional holding, showing pretty solid support.
  
**Good Stuff**
  
So there is some good stuff about this company. 

1) They have shipped products - we know it's not vaporware. 
  
2) They own 10% of Lordstown Motors, which has a crazy high potential despite the hindenburg report. 
  
3) They are partnered with Hitachi to help them develop and finance the scaling of the manufacturing line. They are getting proper experience to help them build this line up. 
  
4) They developed this truck with UPS - they worked to get everything that UPS needs in a truck. 
  
5) They have a pretty high short %ge. Not enough to cause a squeeze IMO, but y'all like hearing that. 
  
6) The 10% owner of Lordstown still has some 5.5million/6million shares, and the CEO has 75% of their shares (down from around 490k to 350k). 
  
7) they are working on a holistic solution with their truck, including the drone (they've started the FAA certification to fly it)
  
**Bad Stuff** 
  
There are also reasons to be bearish on this company. 

1) They will eventually have a lot of competition. Most are 2-3 years out from making anything, but that competition will be Ford e-Transit and Mercedes Sprinters 
  
2) They are making 3 cars per day right now. They want to triple that by end of Q2. That's still 10 cars per day. that's not a lot. 
  
3) their drone solution needs some WORK. It's designed to be integrated with the truck but they haven't shown anything useful. I honestly see no reason this company should be in ARKX tbh. 
  
4) Although the CEO retained 75% of his shares, he still sold around 25%. Don't blame him, he'd been working there for at least 5 years, but it's still not nice to see. 
  
**My Opinion**
  
Based on the fact that they have a lot of strategic partnerships (namely Hitachi) and they own 10% of Lordstown motors, and how undervalued they are compared to competitors (especially those who haven't shipped anything yet) I expect them to climb up to about the $20 mark until about Q3, at which point the increased Q4 production rate should allow them to start really going past EPS rates. 
  
TLDR: WKHS is 1/5 the value of Arrival and is the only company currently shipping vans. Proceed with caution.  Maybe 2022 calls or Oct calls.

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"XLNX Arbitrage Merger with AMD on April 7th XLNX is merging with AMD. When the merger is complete, every XLNX share will be turned into 1.7234 AMD shares.

The window for regulators to object the merger has passed. The last major hurdle for the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th.

Currently XLNX is trading at $130 while AMD is trading at $81. With the merger XLNX is 1.7234 * 81 = $139.6 versus $130 (current stock price). There's an arbitrage opportunity, and on April 7th the biggest threat to that arbitrage is very very likely going to be removed.

https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing

So what do you, an ape, do with this information? Well you buy XLNX calls expiring April 9th of course. It's mostly algos trading options at the moment, but it looks like right now you can buy calls at $132 strike price for $2 a pop, and $126 calls for $5 a pop, which are completely reasonably prices compared to their equivalent AMD options. But unlike AMD calls, you wouldn't need AMD to go up for this YOLO to pay out. If the valuation gap closes after the yes vote on April 7th, and AMD stays the same price, you make 350% and 160% returns respectively. And obviously , if AMD goes up a few percent over this week, you make even more.

Full disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor. I lost 17k in a GME option play right when Vlad decided to stop trading on RH.

...but I still went all in on this play. 137c on 4/9


edit:
AMD has to drop to 75.43 (130/1.7234) to break even. If it's lower, then it's a loss."
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"$GOEV - Bullish theory - USPS Truck Contract Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.


Once I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)

If the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.

**E.V. low speed efficiencies**

Electric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. 

[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.
 

With a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.

307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.

Total Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh

Referring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction to be around 1.5x (9.760 / 1.5 -> 6.467 kWh) this puts the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. 

Now I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. 

Canoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.

For viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc

**Modularity**

A general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.
The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.


**Replacing other LLV**

The deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.


[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy. 


Looks like the short squeeze is back on if you trust ortex data see /u/brotherluminous for more information.

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"Options are for Apes too (just not GME) # What Motivates an Ape

I started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. 

I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.

I've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. 

For this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization\_of\_all\_open\_option\_contracts\_on\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme/)

# Comparing MSFT to GME

My presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).

**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. 

If you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** 

**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**

[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https://preview.redd.it/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)

The main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. 

For sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  

**No one is buying GME Options!!**

If you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). 

&#x200B;

[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https://preview.redd.it/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)

Notice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. 

**Implied volatility and why/how thetagang makes money**

Implied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. 

What is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. 

This phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. 

Thetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. 

Implied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f

Notice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.

# Conclusion

GME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.

Use the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).

***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***

Positions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both. Too stubborn to stop now.

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against America Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

Disclosure: RIDE stock will triple by September. 🚀🚀🚀 Do what you will with this information.

I hadn’t posted on reddit until recently when [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report.

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down.

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.
2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

I’m from Ohio, and about 2 years ago now, I saw [over 1500 people in our small community lose their jobs when GM closed their state-of-the-art facility](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gut-wrenching-day-ohio-gm-assembly-plant-prepares-close-n980136). Words couldn’t accurately portray the amount of hurt and pain that hit Ohio as a result of this.

But a couple of months later, I heard about LMC. I heard GM was going to invest in LMC in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). I then had a couple of friends get hired there who told me they were getting a jump start in the EV industry with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). Keep in mind, this was 2019, so large-scale production of EV’s was a relatively new concept.

Nonetheless, this was exactly what our community needed – some hope and excitement. American-made electric vehicles in small-town Ohio – helping create a more sustainable future and adding thousands of jobs in our country. Plus, this was a massive opportunity, as the [global light duty vehicle market is now valued at \~ $600B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market).

Fast forward 2 years, and [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all).

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report.

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). This is huge for LMC to have their battery supplier as a next-door neighbor.

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV. 🚀 🚀 🚀

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders**

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period.

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

u/DrReginaldWexley owns and operates his own small fleet of vehicles. I found [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/md063x/the_transition_is_real_its_happening_now_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I thought was useful to learn more from a customer’s perspective.

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did?

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Proof of Concept for LMC’s Endurance truck**

LMC is showing their level of confidence in their vehicle by enrolling in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17. Get your popcorn ready, this **major catalyst is now less than 2 weeks away** and will be publicly televised. 🚀 🚀 🚀

LMC is also in the [final due diligence phase for the ATVM loan](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which could be announced any day now. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means there has been substantial digging into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Brief Technical Overview**

From a technical perspective, the chart shows that this same downward movement has happened multiple times in the past 6 months, and each time, the stock has (quickly) rebounded back to $30. For folks who trade stocks based on indicators, the [recent Beta release](https://www.truckinginfo.com/10140497/lordstown-unveils-two-betas-of-endurance-pickup) could be the catalyst we needed to begin an upward trend back towards $30 and beyond. 🚀 🚀 🚀

&#x200B;

**Position:**

1500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and a few October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall 🚀🚀🚀

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story. It’s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000’s of jobs to our country. My advice to Hindenburg: Never bet against America.

I RIDE with Lordstown. #WorkForIt #MadeInAmerica

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

When this stock hits $150 in a few years, we’re all going on a RIDE to Vegas to celebrate. 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,BB yolo update 4/5/2021 
2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"$MTCH is pushing users to travel, but not in the way you'd think I like $MTCH a lot as they've commodified sex and romance which essentially allows them to feed off desperate horny guys, of which there will be no end, but I'm here specifically to make the argument that $MTCH is actively increasing its own stability and profitability under the guise of bRiNGinG pEOplE FrOM aLL aroUnD tHe wOrLd tOgeThEr. 

If you don't use Tinder, it has a feature called passport that allows you to set your location to different areas of the world, so that instead of getting ghosted by your high school crush, you can get ghosted by a person in Argentina instead. Normally this feature is only provided to paying users, but $MTCH has made passport free for all users through the end of April. IMPORTANTLY there is no way to prevent these passporting profiles from showing up in your feed. 


How $MTCH making Tinder passport free for a month is a tricky and likely significant move for their dating app holdings:

-The obvious, easy to sell reason for passport being free: it potentially attracts travel-obsessed women to the platform, which could provide a large increase in female userbase (the pandemic has already driven female users to all time highs), and maybe these women will stick around and become regular users. Maybe same for men, though to a lesser extent. But this is all SMALL FISH compared to the following. 

-Making passport free GREATLY dilutes the actual valid dating pool in popular cities - at the moment in NYC 5 out of 6 women are passporting in, usually from Brazil or Russia. People looking for real, in-person relationships cannot filter out passport users. So these users either have to just keep swiping (thereby increasing app use and ad revenue from non-paying members), OR, what I believe to be the major scheme, these users will *flee to other apps that do NOT have the passport feature*.

-$MTCH has constantly pushed its goal of diversifying their dating apps as to reduce redundancy and to better engage users by providing niche user pools or specific features. In their recent earnings statements, $MTCH has touted Hinge as their rising star, with revenue that is nothing to sneeze at and a growing user base that is specifically relationship-oriented. Tinder's passport flooding may redirect Tinder users to the other dating apps it owns, which is great for their stats, but I'm specifically interested in Hinge.

-There is likely a large number of relationship-oriented Tinder users who have never used Hinge just because Tinder is sort of the go-to dating app. Or, like me, they might have used both Hinge and Tinder before, but realized that the people on Hinge are significantly less attractive than those on Tinder and stopped using it (this sounds silly, I know, but I've asked my female friends and they've said the same about Hinge guys vs Tinder guys, and we've all moved to different apps b/c looking for a relationship on Hinge is difficult when you're not attracted to 85% of the users). 

-If the passport flood moves users (even temporarily) to Hinge, $MTCH may achieve some significant gains: Hinge-naieve relationship-oriented users may stick around, further increasing the separation of apps and possibly increasing purchasing of premium features as these new users may feel their matches on Hinge may be more meaningful than those on Tinder. AND the move may increase the average attractiveness of Hinge users, which will make Hinge more viable overall as a relationship-specific app. 

-$MTCH gets to say ""Look! We can do more than just Tinder!"" Given that Tinder's revenue dwarfs all the other apps, I think this is a legitimate achievement. 


Side notes and risks: 

-Back on Tinder, desperate/thirsty male users (i.e. the cash cow for dating apps) may feel even more unseen as they are aware that their gender pool is flooded with passport users, thereby potentially leading these local men to spend money on premium features that increase their own visibility e.g. superlikes, boosts. I am totally unashamed to say I've purchased boosts and it seriously gives you a huge ego boost, to the point that it is addictive, and WSB knows how lucrative addiction is. If passport flooding causes a fraction of men to purchase a premium feature just once, there's a good likelihood they'll keep coming back, and revenue will drastically increase. 

-Passport flooding is equally likely to shunt users to Bumble ($MTCH's only real competitor in this space). Aside from heavily relationship-oriented users that will hopefully go to Hinge first, I can't see any reason why Bumble won't gain users from Tinder's passport decision. 

-I don't know if its just my phone's OS, but it seems Tinder has made it so that viewing profile bios is a laborious process, requiring an additional click to get there, and the click is no longer right where your finger is when swiping - its now a tiny button all the way on the upper left - quite inconvenient when browsing. Just seems like more evidence that $MTCH is making big moves to separate the hookup world from the relationship world. Also, as a guy, if you'd reaaaally want a female to look at your profile cuz you're actually insanely interesting (/s), you'd have to give her reason to stop and make the effort - superlikes ($) can help with that. 


Bottom line: $MTCH is serious about differentiating its apps. Specifically on this iteration, passport flooding can sequester real relationship-oriented users from the rest and place them into Hinge, improving the userbase and targeting these types of users with specific purchasable services (e.g. a Hinge boost is more likely to land you a LTR than a Tinder boost). It also benefits other $MTCH owned apps (but also unfortunately BMBL). All of this is coming right before May earnings, where as usual they'll probably brag about how they don't rely singularly on Tinder for revenue. 

TL;DR: The world of dating apps is expanding and maturing, and $MTCH, with the greatest number of users in this space, is positioning itself to occupy as much new room as possible. The move: buy and hold (cringe, I know) or, since I think May earnings are gonna look good due to these moves and MTCH's general performance, buy May puts. Fucking earnings. 

Positions: 50 shares in $MTCH, by far the largest holding in my poorboy portfolio."

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on Office Furniture First time doing some TA. Very green behind the ears from the crayons I store back there. I work in the design industry and know things have been crazy the past year with the big WFH movement. Offices will be back, it's just a matter of if not when.

I have been watching companies that supply systems furniture and just did a comparison of Herman Miller and Steelcase. Both of these companies are comparable with product lines and have relatively similar financials. What is different, however, is the float held by institutions. Looking at Yahoo Finance, you can see that MLHR has 87.16% vs 101.9% for SCS. MLHR is currently trading $42.18 vs $14.60 for SCS. 

Another interesting number is the EBITDA for both. MLHR is 17,200  vs 138,200  for SCS. I know my brain is as smooth as the day is long, but it seems like there is something there there. 

Anyone with more wrinkles wanna chime in on this one? 

Full disclosure I have a minuscule position in each of these stocks."

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"GME Options Traded - 04/05/2021 Good morning everyone,

I wanted to see what option activity looked like and pulled data from Yahoo Finance, so it likely is not perfect, but it looks like someone/or some whale is pushing heavy, concentrated positions on certain strikes. Notice this morning the huge relative value of deep ITM call options traded.

Note: market value was calculated as volume on each day \* \[ (bid + ask) / 2\] \* 100.

EDIT: Updated 4/5/21 to reflect EOD.

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"Follow the breadcrumbs of AMRN buyout AMARIN a $2.5 Billion company is probably going to get bought out by years end. 

Here are the breadcrumbs I followed to get to the conclusion.

1. The company recently won EU approval for its drug VASCEPA with exclusivity.
2.  China exclusivity will probably come online by end of year. Already got the ok for Hainan Medical Hub.
3. Insiders recently sold shares on Form 4's, but the bear minimum to cover taxes most likely .
4. Paid off all long term debt in one fell swoop. Plus has $900 Million loss carryforward.
5. But here is the kicker. They recently added the line ""**In the case of a Change of Control**"" under remarks. That wasn't there before. Link to one of the Form 4, if the picture doesn't load.

2021-04-06,wallstreetbets,"I built a tool for us to track US Representatives Stock Trades Hey everyone, I am the guy who built [senatestockwatcher.com](https://senatestockwatcher.com) \- which has been really helpful for a few people and just general public knowledge overall.  


Well, I finally built a tool to do the same tracking and analysis for the US House of Representatives.   
[housestockwatcher.com](https://housestockwatcher.com)

The reason this took so long is that the House exclusively files their disclosures in PDF that vary wildly in quality and format, so for this project I have been transcribing every transaction disclosed. I am nearly done with 2021. I am sure 2020 will uncover lots of interesting trades.

Buy and Hold. buy when everyone else is selling, price discounts are very tasty and good for your financial health, having very low ACB and triple digit gains make the journey all that much more enjoyable. 💎🙌🚀 "
