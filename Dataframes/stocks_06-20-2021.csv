I’m in the XLE though"
2021-06-20 17:50:02,stocks,JPM. I am not a fan of the large Mortgage exposure BAC has..
2021-06-20 18:23:50,stocks,If you've done your DD then just pick one or both. Don't let a bunch of people that haven't done the work decide for you!
2021-06-20 18:31:36,stocks,Tough choice…I just went with VFH.
2021-06-20 19:14:58,stocks,"I think JPM is a bit more diversified, plus Dimon is a top notch CEO (their leadership team is solid overall). I don't follow BAC very closely but I know JPM has recently shown some initiative with getting into the fintech space. They're one of 2 stocks I own in the financial sector (7.5% of portfolio), with TROW being the other."
2021-06-20 18:39:41,stocks,BAC is cheaper and better value. Easy answer to an easy question
2021-06-20 19:19:06,stocks,"You can use jpm to buy stocks and jpm even has etfs 

Not sure if bac had those two things"
2021-06-20 18:33:29,stocks,I like JPM
2021-06-20 19:55:18,stocks,Not sure about etfs but yes bac owns Merrill Lynch which allows stock trading
2021-06-20 19:56:03,stocks,BAC also let's you buy stocks. They incorporate Merrill Edge. I use it and works pretty well.
2021-06-20 19:14:53,stocks,"Investing in penny stocks is always risky business. You're going to win some, but probably lose a lot more.

If you think there's a risk of a bankruptcy announcement investing now would seem, well, kind of dumb."
2021-06-20 17:45:22,stocks,"Depends on if you can afford to lose it all. Unless the company has a clear plan on how they are going to get out their hole and you have strong conviction they can do it. I would say no.

I am sure there better high risk better rewards out there. 

Another option might be cheap leap calls, if want to throw money at it."
2021-06-20 17:57:46,stocks,"I am holding 1000 shares for quite some time now. This play is high risk high rewards. If they don't file bankruptcy then it will be $10+.

Recent price action and movement looks promising. Couple of days it bounced and price is above 20MA. I think something is cooking and we will know before month end"
2021-06-20 17:39:51,stocks,If it helps I have $5300 in shares lol

2021-06-20 18:01:49,stocks,"I really didn't expect to find so many people talking about it positively here, especially seems like no one is talking about it on Reddit. High risk isn't a concern for me, it's when it's all risk and no chance that's putting me off."

2021-06-20 19:45:57,stocks,That's true.
2021-06-20 19:21:52,stocks,Free cash flow king
2021-06-20 16:55:17,stocks,"For me revenue is the top one because we as investors need to know if there’s demand for their services, the information for the demand can be gathered from previous years revenue and could be predicted if we think there’s going to be a boom on that sector in future years.

Net profit comes second because after you deduct everything we can see the real profit of the company. However, I placed it second because there are many companies making a loss like Uber or Palantir and the net profit don’t mean as much if we think their company is going to expand and make profit in the near future e.g just like Tesla, they started making profit in 2020. Don’t get me wrong, I believe net profit is important too in specific companies.

Thirdly comes gross profit. We have the same opinion on this one"
2021-06-20 19:10:03,stocks,"Ranking those really depends on the industry. Like, if I was looking at software stocks then net income is sorta meaningless to me... revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow are all much more important.

Speaking broadly across industries (except maybe banks), then cash flow is king."
2021-06-20 16:55:11,stocks,Net income
2021-06-20 19:03:28,stocks,"On a small business, or family owned I’d agree with you. With larger billion dollar public companies cute accounting can distort net income and I’d say Revenue is the truest number."
2021-06-20 16:49:42,stocks,"Net income  

Net income growth

PE  

Earnings growth  

But ultimately price is everything"
2021-06-20 17:59:15,stocks,"Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity… and cash is king

Even net income isn’t perfect - I would rank free cashflow higher."
2021-06-20 16:56:17,stocks,Good point on revenue! I actually agree with you on that
2021-06-20 17:01:02,stocks,"Having been an operations manager in the Auto Business for a very long time, I can promise you that only Net matters.
I could spend 1M a month in advertising and get a smaller % ROI even though we Increased spending dramatically..."
2021-06-20 18:30:49,stocks,Can you give me an example of how free cash flow is determined? Isn’t FCF based on net income?
2021-06-20 19:08:37,stocks,"Sorta, Free cash flow is OCF or operating cash flow (from cash flow statement) minus capital expenditures. (FCF = OCF - Capex)

OCF is what you get after you take out non cash expenses and working capital from net income. So like, net income feeds into free cash flow but it’s not “based” on free cash flow. I think that guy’s comment is that net income is easier to manipulate/disguise than free cash flow (I would agree with that)."
2021-06-20 19:15:03,stocks,"Free cashflow comes from the cashflow statement rather than the income statement.

Basically it’s net income +/- non-cash items +/- change in WC - capex

The cashflow statement reconciles to change in cash balances and the only real judgement call is classifying the CFs by type (operating, investing & financing), so it’s harder to manipulate and easier to audit. Net income can be manipulated by adopting aggressive policies, whereas the CF statement is only really vulnerable to fraud."
2021-06-20 19:23:28,stocks,"yes, that’s exactly my point"

2021-06-20 19:15:35,stocks,Same. I've only seen it referenced with very short timeframes. Especially in day trading.
2021-06-20 16:14:57,stocks,"50m, been investing for 20+ years. Like /u/yodaspicehandler said be patient, stay focused on your goals and don't get divorced. The last one is one of the biggest financial killers. While I am technically financially independent I want more (yes, I know I am being a little greedy) so for the moment I am still working. Do not chase. You can have a very simple strategy or a complicated one. It depends on how much time you wish to spend in the care and feeding of your portfolio. ETF's are really the way to go if you want  to not spend a lot of time researching. You can also do very well in just a few well picked stocks. For me, I have about 10% of my portfolio set aside for short/mid term trades to satisfy my want to pick individual stocks. Most of the rest goes into a few ETF's (and yes I have overlap and that is ok by me).

EDIT: Syntax"
2021-06-20 18:18:57,stocks,Everyone should be investing much longer than that for retirement
2021-06-20 16:23:17,stocks,"late 30s and have owned shares in apple since '11..never sold one time! also bought some google but not as much as I should have..but no regrets. 

I lost a lot of money when the housing market crashed and learned so much from it. I kind of laugh at most posts here. if you have a long term plan when investing..who cares what happens in the short term.

I also know it helps that I do well for myself financially and whatever money I invest I already consider it a loss..just never ever ever invest more than you can afford to lose..never get greedy..it will rarely work out for you don't invest in garbage"

2021-06-20 15:56:10,stocks,"41m, been investing for 20+ years.
I've done well, maybe 20% CAGR. 


If you have a decent salary and DCA into an S&P ETF for 30 years, you'll do good and obtain FIRE if that's what you want. But you need to be patient. 


My big gains were in tech stocks and being at the right place at the right time: I bought lots of Netflix when I saw them abandon their dvd business. Also bought Tesla early, etc.


My strategy is generally to DCA to S&P ETFs or high conviction stocks. Also, I borrow as much as I can during crashes to load up on cheap stocks, like in 2009 and 2020.

Edit: Revised my estimated CAGR from 30% down to 20%. My 20+ years of investing haven't been steady. I moved a lot, I started multiple businesses, I had periods where I withdrew a lot, or didn't contribute new money for years.  Nor did I keep meticulous notes on my in an outflows."

I currently am dumping a lot into my 401k (all in an s&p index) and have been putting other money into a fidelity account and doing like 85% ETFs and 15% stock picks. Should I be putting this other money into an IRA to avoid taxes instead of a taxed account? I would like to purchase a home in a few years so I may end up needing some of it to put towards that. I thought I read somewhere that you can pull out whatever money you put into an IRA without penalties, you just can’t pull out any of the gains you made. Is this true?"

Yes, you can pull out contributions from an IRA plus up to 10K to buy a house without penalties. If I were you I would just not worry about an IRA.

as for the housing market..i'm not really concerned this time around. i'm not sure where you purchased real estate in but I have some in a major city for tech and it's rising a lot..i'm not really worried at all.

I'd advise that no one knows which way things will go.  The exchange rate was pushing 1.42 for a month and has plunged back to 1.38 in just a couple days on a comment from the Fed.  

A stronger pound will reduce the value of your current investments, but it also gives you more buying power.  If you're a long term investor this isnt a bad deal unless the exchange rate runs away from you for years, which I dont really expect to happen.  Just buy us stocks that you intend to hold long term."

Of course some doomsayers have been preaching about the economic bubble conspiracy theory which to them explains why companies continue to rise in net worth and stock price despite downright apocalyptic goings on in the world (covid.) 

I'm betting it's the bubble. I tend to invest only in overseas (Chinese and Taiwanese) companies simply because in China they dont have to worry about lazy americans wanting to stay on unemployment instead of returning to work, in China the CCP will just shoot your family and then you if you dont go back to work. So they tend to rough out inflation or currency drops better in modern times."

On the other hand, a weak dollar makes me want to invest, because when it's at the lower edges, it's bound to bounce eventually. USD is not PLTR, it wont drop down 80% to climb back up. And if it does, there will be other issues to worry about than my position denominated in USD."

No I don’t think we are going to see another 2008 type crash. We might, but I think not is more likely than so.

I’m not sure what you are doing, so I can’t say if it’s good or bad, but when I hear AMC and GME it sounds like a big nope.

No it wouldn’t break the market. There is literally no way that’s possible (as in it’s actually impossible for it to break the market)

People always talk about a crash. There are an equal (or more) number of things that indicates that things can keep going up for a long while still.

In any case. It’s unpredictable. Don’t try and time it. Just invest as normal. It’s the only way to consistently make money in the markets."

I think we also have the Olympics coming in 2028? Those kind of things are generally a huge economic driver up to the event and the crash happens soon-ish after the event is complete.

But these crashes are more like par for the course 20% adjustments. With a quick recovery soon after. I don't anticipate a major event occurring until maybe a decade from now.

These are all massive guesses, my opinions, and I am often wrong. I'm an investor who buys at peaks and then rides them all the way down to 25% of my initial price and then gets out after it does (eventually) recover at some gain. Just want to set expectations...."

2021-06-20 15:26:48,stocks,"I'm confused as to what would cause another 2008 style crash, the banks have tons of cash and in my opinion the hosuing bubble is just getting started and stocks while valuations are high seem stable for the most part so I'm confused at what would cause a 2008 style meltdown?"
2021-06-20 15:30:56,stocks,"Some people really don’t understand, they just hear a bunch of idiots talking and they believe it, if u think there will be a crash put ur money where ur mouth is and short the market.... and well check back here in 6 months"
2021-06-20 17:27:13,stocks,One of the first things I did when I began investing was checking out the history of the markets. If you google it you will find that it makes more sense to remain invested; if you selected good stocks & cost average down; it may take anywhere from 6 or 8 months  to 18 months to get back from correction.  It is a great bargain sale if investing for long term goals such as retirement.
2021-06-20 15:25:58,stocks,Yes - I’m going to buy when the crisis/crash/correction happens.
2021-06-20 15:29:43,stocks,"First five posts here don't realize that this is basically another ""I think the MOASS is going to happen"" thread in disguise.

Which...yawn."
2021-06-20 19:27:18,stocks,So you think if there’s a huge crash that hugely volatile meme stocks won’t crash too? I think you need to go back to grade school and learn some basic common sense my friend.
2021-06-20 15:37:31,stocks,"Thanks for the insight haha okay understood. That’s actually a direction compared to some of the comments here, I guess people hear those two stocks and automatically think idiot. 

My portfolio outside of those two is up 30% which is fine I think since I started trading in March"
2021-06-20 17:30:14,stocks,There will be a second crash soon; but it is to be expected. It will go back up just make sure what you have selected are good quality companies price will go back up again.
2021-06-20 15:38:16,stocks,"Yeah, that’s what I’m leaning towards too.. just thinking out loud on this one to get some opinions"

2021-06-20 15:36:29,stocks,"Because this is pretty much a MOASS thread. It's not a ""is this economy going to fail"" thread.

2021-06-20 15:33:15,stocks,"Its not a bubble if the prices are driven up because of:
1) Inflation
2) Supply issues

2021-06-20 19:35:53,stocks,"The risk > reward is much higher than other stocks, currently my position is 500% up, this could potentially go up another 100x if the DD follows through.  

There are nearly 1 b shares to be bought back, if margin call happens them buying back wouldn’t be affected by a market crash.

2021-06-20 15:42:01,stocks,"I once liquidated all of my stocks when I was younger and didn’t understand what I was doing. If you have to make the mistake to get it out of your system, just make sure you aren’t playing with a lot of money."

They are not long term investment, if you think there will be market crash, sell them and DCA your portfolio when crash occurs or invest in solid companies."
2021-06-20 16:47:10,stocks,"So, nothing you can substantiate much less explain? Sounds good. Guess it's all superstonks for you"
2021-06-20 15:57:20,stocks,"Granted, corrections and a rare crash will happen, but knowing when is impossible it may happen tomorrow, it may happen in 3 years time, and waiting 3 years is silly, understand what adding and compounding money can do, u don’t need anything special a 10% annual Return will make u extremely wealthy"
2021-06-20 15:52:44,stocks,"Go onto the s&p graph look at where we was in 1990, ur telling me we’re not bullish?"
2021-06-20 16:10:05,stocks,"I guess what I meant to say is everyone is waiting for a crash. But in your post you mentioned you would not sell those two meme stocks.

So I took that to mean you meant the mother of all squeezes was going to collapse the market.

I think most of us agree that the market is overvalued, fears of inflation, global supply chains still underproducing, a labor crisis, etc. But if the crash happens, I don’t think it will be because of gme or amc - so I would expect them to crash as well."
2021-06-20 16:10:46,stocks,"The risk > reward is much higher.. currently I am up 500%. 

Also if those two stocks CAUSE the market crash from potentially billions of dollars bail out then I get paid from the short squeeze.

My portfolio outside of those two is up 30% so if a “crash” never happens I still make money by liquidating now. But I mean like I said in the post I am not decided whatsoever 

Just asking for opinions on the climate we are at.. opinions on those two I know are going to be mixed (that’s cool)"
2021-06-20 16:53:43,stocks,"I can’t explain every single point I have read and understood and explain it to 30 different people on a Reddit post can I? My post isn’t explaining why I think a crash will happen it’s peoples OPINIONS on what they think the current climate is like based on what they have seen/ what they know 

Jheezus some of Reddit users critical thinking sucks. It’s like Facebook 2.0"
2021-06-20 16:52:02,stocks,"- 0% interest rates

- post covid correction 
- inflated tech stocks"
2021-06-20 15:59:26,stocks,"Yeh absolutely fair enough, so obviously you are not too concerned which is completely fair."
2021-06-20 15:55:20,stocks,"Like the post says I’m not completely sold on it.. I do think a correction is likely soon as we come out of corona situation , I guess for me it depends on how violent it may be"
2021-06-20 16:14:35,stocks,"The chat on those two I tried to stay clear as it’s probs boring to hear to most people but Yes potentially if they squeeze I believe they have been over shorted so yes it could cost billions of dollars. 

But it’s two things, even if squeeze never happens I was really asking what climate people W think we are at… because minimally a correction post covid is coming. 0% interest rates. Overvalued tech stocks."

1. FDA-approved product - Trilaciclib (""Cosela"" is the only FDA-approved therapy that helps proactively deliver multilineage myeloprotection to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy)
2. High upside potential by the end of the year according to the respectable analysts (100-200% upside from the current price 21-22$)
3. Professional management with strong worldwide sales plan. Within a short time they made ""Cosela"" available in many regions, including USA, China, Israel. Also ""Cosela"" included in two updated national clinical practice guidelines, that means more sales.
4. They have enough money to avoid any dilution risks at least by the 2023.
5. Collaboration with Pfizer. G1 has a non-exclusive clinical supply agreement with Pfizer to provide palbociclib for its rintodestrant/palbociclib breast cancer trial. The trial was good and maybe some deal is around the corner. If that comes true the holders will see 50-100% market cap growth permanently.
6. ""Cosela"" has an universal myeloprotection mechanism and its approved only for SCLC cases for now. Approving Cosela as a myeloprotection tool against other chemotherapy types will mean tens of billions dollars revenue per year in the 5-7 years. That makes G1 one of the best stock to invest in June 2021 in both short and long term perspectives."

2021-06-20 18:20:34,stocks,"IIRC the actual numbers were that 90-95% of people fail to beat the market, while 90% of all people lose 90% of their money in the first 3 months. Depending on when the data was taken it differs a ton, just like the warning that people lose more than 80% of their money on CFDs (mandatory in Europe or at least Germany) swings around 70-85%.

I'd say world and entire market ETFs are the way to go, but you can temporarily boost up your profits by manually selecting stocks. If you notice it goes well you can continue, some people are amazing at realizing what is upcoming. And others that lose should then just fully swap to global markets (or for more risk and return to e.g. the SP500)."

2021-06-20 17:13:05,stocks,"Idk. Not even the biggest lines were doing too hot before COVID. It's really not a great business system because those sexy rigs cost 400 million to produce, and by the time they're 7 years old, they're already being sold off, having engineering issues, or just ""old"" and not fancy enough anymore.

They have 1000+ staff on board and sometimes they leave port with 200 guests on a flagship and 8 times the amount of staff on board because you cant send them home when your at port in a country across the Atlantic ocean from where your employees reside. And if you do send them home your paying flight fares for hundreds of staff.

It's really a dumb system because they commit to dates that they leave port and if they dont get much interest, they have already committed to shipping out even if they have only 100 tickets sold. Now factor in all the maintenance of a massive ship, free meals and drinks, employee wages, etc.

Bottom line is thin."
2021-06-20 17:50:12,stocks,I like cruise lines and think they could do well.  I am long RCL although looking to exit in another 20% or so.  The big thing you have to realize is that they all diluted heavily (20%-40%) to stay afloat.  So don't think they are going back to pre-covid levels because the dilution makes that target much lower.

2021-06-20 17:55:45,stocks,"I can see being wary of cruise lines but you are so wrong about a lot of stuff.  They pay the staff peanuts because most of them make their money in tips so staff is not that big of an expense.  I have never heard of ships sailing with 200 guests.  Ships hold 3,000-5,000 which is why the staff numbers are so high.  If they have trouble selling out they just lower the price (and yes you can sometimes find great deals) and then still make a ton on alcohol, gift shop, and excursion sales etc even if they don't on the tickets.  Cruise lines were doing well pre-pandemic.  I have hesitations right now due to dilution and risk of another outbreak but to say it was a poor business model before the pandemic is not correct."

2021-06-20 16:37:53,stocks,"Idk. I'm thinking if you look at (diamond) mines (in South Africa or the Congo Basin,) they sell wholesale for almost nothing to distributors, who sell for higher amounts to smaller distributors, who finally sell their Zales diamond ring for $3000 with a $2000 jewelers markup on a stone that was dug from the earth by some skinny Namibian who is getting paid a loaf of bread, soup, and a nickel every day, and the mine who shoves off massive shipments for next to nothing compared to brick and mortar store pricing.

Who makes the most? The suppliers closest to the source make the least, and the mope at the end of the chain makes the lions share. But that is in one niche sector of mining. It's certainly not the only market to work that way though.

Owning top brand businesses like Monster Beverage, Ferrari, Nike, Brembo, CocaCola, Xpel, Harvia, Apple, Adidas is often a good idea. High margins, brand moat, -> economies of scale. 

Check Monster's stock for example. Energy drink that tastes the exactly the same as every other energy drink. Not much of an Innovation but has performed better than any new innovation stock.

You make it sound like it's multiples overvalued. The only think I don't like is I would like them to pay down their debt.

I guess it's trading higher than that currently because people speculating they'll perform better as rich people will likely buy more expensive shit with inflation on the horizon."

2021-06-20 16:46:42,stocks,"Ferrari is a luxury company, much like LVMH or Hermès, and that means it has significant pricing power due to a history that’s impossible to replicate. 

Given the stability of cash flows and the relative certainty of growth, investors are willing to pay very high multiples for these stocks, such that they’re almost priced like bonds in terms of their earnings yields. For instance, a P/E ratio of 50 means an earnings yield of 2% (1/50), similar to that of long-term bonds. 

Over the past decade, the stocks of these types of companies have benefitted significantly from multiple expansion. Many investors are now fully aware of how good luxury businesses are, and their stock performance going forward is unlikely to be anywhere near as good as the past decade."

2021-06-20 12:28:35,stocks,"If you believe the stock market is going to drop considerably, then you first step is sell all of your equities.  Hold the cash, then buy back stocks at a lower price when you believe the market is bottoming.  That is the standard advice for a bear market.

If you believe inflation is here to stay, then you want to invest all of your cash into other assets like stocks, real estate, and gold.  In an inflationary environment, the last thing you want to be holding is cash.

So as you see, there is a big contradiction regarding whether or not to hold cash and stocks.  If a bear market and inflation happen at the same time, you can only defend against one of them, but will be worsening the effects of the other by doing so.  That is why the current situation is so dangerous and has the potential to really cause disaster."

In terms of what to do - I would consider liquidating stocks you have gains on that look vulnerable to a retrace and be ready to reinvest for capital gains :).

IMO they were fairly valued at $240 in a good day before the 737Max issues and Covid. Luckily, the defense and space contracts are keeping them afloat and this kind of mammoth doesn't just die because they hit a rough spot. 

Tourism is reopening and they have a solid contractual backlog of $340 billion, however China is a significant part of that.

2021-06-20 13:18:08,stocks,"I am 100% sure Boeing will survive. They however have many short therm issues.

Boeing has a massive and systematic management problem.

The 737 Max disaster was caused by management (not listening to test pilots). The resulting issues were also not handled very well. It was not a good idea to change from a CEO with an engineering background, to a CEO with a finance background.

There have been several reports of tools and other debris being found in new 787 Dreamliner fuel tanks. Some Air lines have even decided to not accept aircraft from one of the production sites. (this is also a management issue).

Boeing failed to get a Gateway Logistics System Contact because their bid did not meet basic selection criteria. 

Boeing failed to get a Human landing system contract, because their bid was massively overpriced, and relied on an unrealistic launch and development schedule of the SLS rocket.

The SLS rocket has several Issues. Boeing is lucky that Congress wants SLS to continue to exist because if NASA would decide, the chance that it already would have been cancelled is relatively high. Boeing is building the core stage of the SLS Rocket. Due to massive schedule and cost overruns, the Exploration upper stage was delayed (also built by Boeing). With Several commercial super heavy-lift rockets coming operational, the need for SLS is shrinking. Especially if the Starship system manages to work, it will be difficult to justify keeping SLS online.

The Starliner Capsule is massively delayed for several reasons, including a failed test flight 1.5 years ago. The Test might finally be repeated this year. the Issues were caused by a massive lack of testing, which, again, is a management issue. A total of 84 issues were found AFAIK.

I am not really up to date on the military contracts of Boeing.

There are several problems resulting from what I wrote above.

For a long time, Boeing got NASA contracts for ""Past mission performance"". With the Problems in the SLS Programm, as well as the Starliner programme, this is no longer the case. The Starliner contract was awarded to Boeing, mostly due to past performance. It is safe to say, that if the same competition to build a crew capsule would take place today, Boeing would not have gotten the contract at the wanted price. 

Fixing the Problems in the 737 Max has cost a lot of money. Since they had to continue to pay many of the subcontractors to prevent them from going bankrupt. I am not 100% sure, but I think they also had to pay some airlines and the family members of the victims.

With the change of the CEO some time ago, they have also restarted the design of the NMA or 797 Airliner, for the 3rd time. This will no doubt have cost a lot of money.

Airbus on the other hand didn't have these issues, which cost a lot of money and has instead used it to develop new technologies.

In my Opinion, Airbus also has a better small Aircraft lineup.

starting small, airbus has the a220 Series, which they got from bombardier, for a very low price, mainly because Boeing wanted to prevent delta from building the Plane. (relatively long story, can explain more if someone is interested). the a220 Series is very efficient, and its main drawback right now is that the production volume is too low. Airbus is however working on increasing the production speed. The a220-100 and a220-300 are more efficient than the 737 Max 7, and it is speculated that Airbus is working on a stretched a220, the a220-500. (the a220 series is so good, that most airlines are preferring it over the a319). This a220-500 would likely compete with the 737 Max 8. The 737 Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 are competing with the a319, a320 and a321. the Aircraft are pretty evenly matched, with the a321 being a bit larger than the Max 10, and with significantly more range, depending on the configuration. the a321 is also already certified, unlike the 737 Max 10, which just hat its maiden flight.

Airbus is building and delivering large numbers of a320 Airliners and has gotten many orders for the a321LR and a321XLR. Boeing does not have anything to offer in that area of the market. 

It is Rumoured that airbus might develop a new wing for the a320 family, which would increase the efficiency, as well as allowing the a321 to be stretched to an a322. Boeing would not be able to stretch the 737 Max 10 further, so would need to respond with a clean sheet design. depending on the financial situation of Boeing, they might not be able to respond quickly.

What is keeping Boeing alive, is that the Airbus order book is even longer than Boeings. If you could get an airbus aircraft quickly, way more orders would have switched from 737 max to a320neo."

Boeing's long term civilian aircraft market has three major challenges.

1. If another 737 Max crashes due to software problems, then the entire 737 Max fleet is going to be grounded permanently.  Boeing will face endless lawsuits as a result and the company may be bankrupted.
2. The COVID lockdowns and rise of remote meetings via Zoom proved that companies can succeed with much less business travel.  The high cost of flying personnel to meetings, that can be easily held on Zoom calls for free, is no longer justifiable.  Companies have taken note of this as a way to reduce costs and thereby increase profits.  Business air travel will struggle to recover to pre-pandemic levels
3. Until recently, Boeing's only competitor was Airbus.  There is now a rapidly rising third competitor in China's COMAC.  Founded in 2008, COMAC is already delivering a  regional jet seating 100 passengers.  This year COMAC will complete flight tests and begin deliveries of its mid-sized jet seating 150 - 190.  In five years, COMAC will begin deliveries of its wide-body aircraft seating up to 290.  These planes cost less and are equally fuel efficient to comparable sized Boeing aircraft.  COMAC already has 350 regional and 1,000 mid-size jets orders, mostly from Asian, Middle Eastern, and African airlines.

2021-06-20 16:19:14,stocks,"BA is between a rock and a hard place...

Most orders on the books, namely the MAX...will be heavily discounted due to the grounding. This affects the current sales price, the BA services portion of the business, as well as steep discounts on future sales...

As we now see, the MAX aircraft have significant issues with improper grounding...at first it was thought to be about 100 aircraft, now it looks like every single one...more $$$ to BA

Dont forget, every MAX they looked at, EVERY single one has FOD problems....

Let that sink in...

The 777X has been even more of a sales dud, and is years overdue...there are so many initial problems with the aircraft, at this point, it may NEVER see commercial flight...

The 787 has been a disaster, recently began shipping aircraft again after 8 months of stoppage due to manufacturing errors...the 800 already shipped will have to be sent back for major retrofits... more $$$$ to BA

Now we find out BA never fixed the front landing gear issue, and it reloies on ground crew to fix a pin at the gate (and then removed it before TO) or the nose gear collapses....another jopb well done!

BA lost it when they did not go through with the Embraer deal...they lost a bunch of young experienced engineers the desperately need....

BA backed out of the C series aircraft, letting Airbus take it and become a major threat to BA...launching a brand new aircraft, the A220 series...

As one can see...they have been relying on 737 and 777 sales..

The 777 was a solid AC, had some issues, but wasnt bad...the 777MAX with the folding wings is a disaster, even BA knows this...the rear tail stability has basically prevented the aircraft from even testing procedures...the aspect ratio simply wont work, and no software patch is gonna fix that...

the 777-300 already had tail issues, and the software  patch, to flutter the tail, makes the rear pax and crew sick...

The 737 should have been retired back around 2010...yet when the A320NEO slammed them to the tarmac, rather than a new AC which should have been in the works for years, they basket cased the MAX...the rest is history...

Other divisions:Military:The BA Tanker...well...who needs info on how much BA has lost on this debaucle...add to that the continued FOD problems...BA clean up your crap!

&#x200B;

Space:BA was deemed so inferior in tech/design that they did not make it past the first round on the Lunar Landing projects...low tech and twice the price....

BA Starliner...what a combination of rookie errors....funded same time as SpaceX Dragon (at twice the funding) yet has yet had a successful flight to to Station, or even reach orbit......is scheduled for another test flight in 2022?

meanwhile Dragon has had 24 flights to ISS with 3 crewed....

So, all in all, BA WAS a solid investment with growth...now it is an aged dinosaur, heavy on its feet, with reliance on the past, not the future...

As an investor, have you looked at their debt? Currently, they spend more on interest payments than they make off of sales...for the next 10 years, min"

Their competitor for the 46 had a way better jet but didn’t get it because of the name. The T-X is probably the best thing they have going for them and even then I bet Northrop could have done a way better job if they had tried

Even now, at $236, it's trading at a huge discount in my opinion. This is like buying AAPL at less than $100 a share. BA is one of my main holdings, along with AAPL (a worldwide cult that keeps giving the company their money) and BB (excellent revenue prospects with AWS Ivy, though not for another year or two)."

If we lose $236.00, I would expect a test of $226.00 and a retest short at $235.00 targeting way lower.  If we hold here and start gaining levels, it is an easy shot to $300.00.  Just trend ideas.

2021-06-20 12:28:12,stocks,"If I had 181 billion dollar, I could build a much better competitor to Boeing. 

Let's take a look at SpaceX. That required perhaps $10B to replicate to exceed Boeing's space capabilities. Building a better plane apparently takes $5B or so (if you would buy the rights to the now defunct Boom supersonic plane. 

Then you have some good will. Let's say you market the shit out of a few products for another two billion. That gives a grand total of $17B. Now, there is probably some manufacturing equipment, etc. Even if you were to value that at double, you would get at $34B. 

Boeing might have some other real activities, but those aren't going to add up to $181B.

So, is Boeing an investment? Not really. It's just going long on corruption. Plenty of people are corrupt, so that might work out for you. I prefer to invest in things that make economic sense.

Also, a net margin of between 5-10% isn't going to excite me. The company got lazy and as a result its value creation stopped a long time ago.

I'd recommend learning about the RSI if you don't already know about it and buy into BA when it is oversold following an extended period of consolidation. For example, I bought in at around $218 a month or two ago when it was oversold and sold when it reached around $254. As you can see it is in a period of dipping again."

It’s spreading fast. As of June 14, 2021, the delta variant has reached 74 countries -- just 6 months after discovery. In the U.K., it’s already overtaken the alpha variant in number of cases. That variant is thought to be 43% to 90% more transmissible than previous COVID-19 variants. Experts believe delta is anywhere from 30% to 100% more infectious than alpha.” WebMD[link WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-19-delta-variant-what-to-know)"

It will take them 47 years at 2019 earnings to get to their current valuation. Fucking absurd. Without government bailouts (and the fed propping up the market) BA doesn’t exist. If there ever is a liquidity crisis BA cannot refinance they file for bankruptcy protection (this won’t mean their stock goes to zero but it’s possible). 

It’s a sad state when such a shit company with rancid management can exists but alas c’est la vie. Just patiently waiting for the fed to remove eight trillion from their balance sheet and raise rates to 5% so BA can finally go away. 

Northrop and Lockheed will be happy to pick up their government contracts so BA’s military or national security dependency is moot.

You can’t just swap platforms. Someone has to pay for the initial engineering and r&d that goes into the swap and as far as I know the navy doesn’t want to pay for it and Boeing doesn’t want to either.

I live in Seattle, former Boeing HQ. I bought into Airbus at about $16/share and plan on holding for at least a few years. 

Boeing has a toxic corporate culture that they either will succeed in reforming or more of their aircraft will crash. I know too many people who work or did work for Boeing who prefer to fly their families on Airbus. Our local paper also does some amazing Boeing coverage, they won a Pulitzer for their coverage of the Max debacle. Lately the coverage is generally bad - Delayed projects, and angry customers, not even counting the two Max crashes..

Airbus just doesn't have those problems. They have better Airframes today, Airbus also don't have the debt Boeing does AND the EU is very willing to invest in low/no carbon transport so I'm willing to bet that Airbus are going to be in a solid position in the future as well."

Someone on here was talking about the tanker funding may be getting cut. While not realizing the government just cut a almost 1 billion dollar experimental drone tanker contract with boeing. With the contract potentially being worth more than 13 billion for 72 drones. 

Not to mention the new cold war with china, Russia and Iran. Which means more F-15s, AWACs, C-17s and etc being sold to isreal, Saudi arabia and UAE.

Not to mention all the satellite upgrades they owe the military the next 5 years.

Boeing isn't going anywhere and you have to be a fool to think other wise. It is the top 4 largest defense companies. Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and Boeing. They are also only the 3rd US military plane platform builder (Lockheed, Northrop and Boeing). The military/ government will never let them go under. 

For the last 20 plus years it has gone like this when it comes to the big new aeropspace contracts with the US government. Boeing handles the tankers / transporters. Lockheed handles the stealth fighters and Northrop handles the stealth bombers. Lockheed and Northrop are the designated ones for stealth technology. 

Finally speaking on Northrop their stock will probably hit 500 bucks plus within the next 3 years due to the B-21 going into production."

2021-06-20 18:10:59,stocks,"C919 will not be successful as the US will block China airlines domestically. But then BA is also going down the drain as many still not aware of the situation. I don't want to insult you, but your comment reek of those old trite cliche China violating this and that patent. I don't look at the number of thumbsup coz reddit is liberal and they will downvote anything against current narrative. 

Just to educate you a little bit, Airbus and Boeing are two major airliners in the world. But it doesn't mean they are holistically manufactured domestically. Airliners are assembled as the same way as other laptops, gadgets are done. The only difference is it requires more sophistication and thousands of parts to assemble. As at 2021, Airbus imports parts from 27 countries, including from the US. Boeing imports 60% of their components, mainly from China. 

Boeing struggle: Boeing 737Max has 2 major accidents, Indonesian and Ethiopian airliners, killed all the passengers. There's also another accidents similar with 737Max predecessor 737NG but FAA lifted the ban on Boeing grounding. BA is now catching up Airbus Neo and making agreements behind the curtains. 

Shorterm: BA will perform well, but in the long run, BA will plummet like GE. 

I have no positions in BA, this is purely observational take on the global airlines. 

Next time, don't use the cheap tactics like China violated patents or cheap shot. It adds nothing to the discussion. You're saying Huawei violated the patent, that's why US asked Canada to arrest their CFO? 

You'd better learn the history of Siemens and Alstom."

Everyone who has served in a DOD role knows that Boeing is uniquely afforded the capability to succeed and fill any gaps that they miss. BA accounts for over 1% of the total GDP and the pentagon cant get enough of these guys."

Sunset isnt for a while, domestically it needs to fill 130 P8s and the DOD has been selling the P8 abroad  extensively. 

Thank you for providing those insights, but this doesnt change the fact that Boeing has plenty of work they can do if commercial drops. Its highly unlikely that the commercial side becomes a zero, its one of only two major producers."

The 737 however is 20 years and 2 generations older, and now at the end of its life.

I hope they do something innovative like the truss braced wing concept. (the truss concept allows a reduction of structural wing mass, which to me seems like a clear advantage over conventional wings. I, however, don't know what the issues or disadvantages are, and why it is estimated for the technology to be ready around 2030 to 2035.)"

After that, bombardier also sold most of the products.

This caused Airbus to have a really good product to compete with the lower boeing segment, since the c series isore efficient than the smaller 737 max and a320 planes.

Boeing then tried to buy Embraer, but that deal fell through

Other risks include tariffs and embargo’s which could impact parts, maintenance etc. airlines work hand in hand with the manufacturer through the life of the aircraft.

You’re right though. Boeing has the benefit of using their commercial branch during defense downturns and vice versa during commercial downturns. It always cushions the financial impact during quarterly earnings calls.

Obviously being a new strain the exact efficacy will take time to determine but so far it’s impossible to say if any worse than the old strain as some still died after vaccination....you need to understand the difference in general studies and general population rollout, sample size differences are massive so 1% deaths in a study equates 100’s of deaths in a population rollout, but much better than the 10s of thousands without.

The training programm is certified by the FAA, and used by all pilots that fly the plane.

The training was completely insufficient however, and boeing didn't tell the pilots and the FAA about systems like Mcas. The same crashes could have happened in the US or other western nations.

Sinceost pilots fly internationally, they need an internationally certified language certificate.

The bigger language issue in my opinion is Spanish or French pilots and air traffic controllers, since they often fly routes between countries with the same languages.

Many people in 3rd world countries speak better English than many French and Spanish people."

A few notes on Schwab's offerings, because I use them for one my accounts and use their ETFs. They do not have an S&P 500 ETF. For some reason they only do a S&P 500 Mutual fund, SWPPX.  It has worked great for me an tracks the S&P 500 with near perfection. The expense ratio is 0.02%.

On their ETFs they have SCHK, which they define as the top 1000 stocks in the US. It is essentially the same rules as the Russell 1000, but they aren't tracking the Russell 1000. When I compare the returns the Russell 1000, the SCK, and the S&P 500 almost perfectly mirror each other.

I'm not sure why they do this, but they are nearly perfect equivalents and they are ultra-low cost.

I'm not too crazy about some of their generic large-cap, mid-cap ETFs. They seem to use the Dow Jones for selections."

2021-06-20 14:41:28,stocks,"I don't know with any certainty, but I suspect it's just a marketing thing why the ETF has a tiny bit higher expense ratio than the mutual fund version (0.05% or 0.04% vs 0.03% or 0.02%). Investors seem to have fixated a preference for ETFs, so if they'll pay an extra basis point why not take it...

Personally I'd rather have the mutual fund version, even if it did have a higher ER, to not deal with premium/discount on underlying assets and avoid the bid/ask spread on ETFs (as you always get the mutual fund at NAV). But practically it makes no difference."
2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on VIAC - ViacomCBS Is anyone holding VIAC? Im considering an investment, but wanted to see what some current holder’s thoughts are.

I’m most excited by Pluto TV. I’m a big fan of their model of completely free hit shows with commercials instead of a subscription, and I feel if VIAC stay on top of the market in this space it has a lot of market share to take from cable providers. I know a lot of people who are overwhelmed by the choices on streaming, and with this being free and preprogrammed, it’s easy to download the app and jump in on something to kill some time.

Paramount Plus is doing well, and has room to grow with original programming. A few good original hits and they can draw in a new crowd.

CBS has probably the worst steaming all in CBS All Access, but they have a fair share of programs that could attract subscribers with a better app and some good original programming to relaunch. 

VIAC also has deals with NFL, March Madness and college football.

That said, CBS’s traditional network is still big in its space, but network television is certainly on the way out. Also, the streaming world is getting overcrowded and will unfortunately turn into some crazy package thing down the line, completing the loop back to a single expensive package.

My main question for share holders: do you see VIAC as a good long-term investment?"

2021-06-19 23:24:38,stocks,I'm holding. I don't see a lot of growth but just based on their current revenue I think it's worth more than what it's trading at. It should be 20-30% higher.
2021-06-19 23:46:27,stocks,"Ratio of assets to liabilities is 1.57 approx, with a book value of 20 Billion USD. Positive cash flow. Book value per share based on the book value is approx 31 USD and current price is approx 40 USD (Closing on Jun/17/2021). This makes the price to book ratio approx 1.3 which is really good (lower the number - more value a stock has). Though a word of caution - a cheap stock can stay cheap for a long time, so value investing is for long (looo,ooo,ooo,ng) term holds. rest is pure speculation: based on adjusted delta for the assets and liabilities the value of the stock come to around a mean of 179 (138-218, lower and upper bound). so yes it may be a good value play. now for some technical stuff: the price is hovering around the 200 DMA which is an important support/resistance point whether it bounces or sinks is important before you buy in. the 200 day price channel is approx 10 USD to 100 USD, the middle of this price channel is 55, so there could be reversion to mean at that from 40-->55 in the near term,other news: Cramer guy on TV said it was a buy buy buy..so thats there as well, but I personally like to tune out the noise. Options are not good long term investments unless you have access to LEAPS, i see that VIAC has a Jan 20, 2023 call option for ask of 9.61 for a 40$ At the money call, which means by Jan 20, 2023 the stock has to break 49.61 to be profitable.

The entire history of the relationship is ridiculous and raises the question of whether it’ll happen again. They don’t have a ton of modern “hits”. They have a decent number of solid performing shows and movies but very few that people are passionate about. The sport contracts they have are largely not recurring in nature so the total content available isn’t by sports isn’t high (high quality sports though) so usage rates won’t be as high as competitors Disney or NBC. They have too many platforms which is confusing and expensive for users (Pluto, showtime, paramount) and user experience hasn’t been good for any. If they end up merging with lions gate then they’ll have another with starz. There’s reasons to buy this but I don’t like investing in companies that aren’t operationally sound."

If an app is “buggy” updating the app and turning your device off and on again will fix 95% of problems. In the remaining cases it’s often the device that needs updating. I just watched the full season of Star Trek Picard and it was a totally fine experience. Yes the ads are the worst but it’s hardly VIACs fault that this is the chosen business model of the internet. Just ignore the ads and browse news headlines for two minutes, do a few squats, get a drink, whatever. Ads are coming on Netflix too, it’s inevitable."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Apple a crap stock nowadays? Arguments for and against **Arguments for Apple**

1) Apple Silicon chips... wowzers. Good stuff. But x86 rules the world, so it's going to be a tough slope to climb.

2) Privacy focus, taking a stand against the government. This is a good thing, both morally and for customer cred.

3) Their trinkets still neat, even if they're starting to feel like they're taking on years... not much innovation or change in sight either

**Arguments against Apple**

I think Apple is just a poor choice right now and for the mid term as well. Here are my points.

1) First of all, there are just better tech stocks right now, such as Nvidia. So why not bet more on up-and-coming winners instead of buying has-beens like Apple? Diversification, maybe, but at some point just buy the Nasdaq index instead if you want the average.

2) Phones are not the big growing business they were years ago (everyone has one already, and no new features are enticing enough, so customers are opting to stick with what they have). This alone has some analysts predicting Apple stock will drop 20-30%. And Apple's move to wearables has been lukewarm at best (the Apple Watch remains a mostly useless bauble)

3) The truth is that buying Apple right now is buying an Apple without Steve Jobs and with the Notch. Make of that what you will

4) No Steve Jobs, again. Current CEO whats-his-name is ok, but ain't no Steve Jobs. His big idea was to make a credit card? Pfft.

5) The notch. It's just so wrong in so many ways (this should be my first indictment against Apple), and tells me that Apple is currently caught in one of those crap design cycles because they are beholden to some crap heavyweight employee in their company (see: the Scott Forstall saga), and the situation will not get better until they get rid of him, but that'll take at least a couple years.

6) The notch also tells me Apple is also beholden to their Chinese hardware partners, who of course must have pushed hard for this stupid thing purely because it gives them a lot of work to do. A plethora of hardware goes into that thing, and with that, a lot of money and clout to the China hardware division.

7) Combine 4, 5, and 6 above to see it's a pansy company led by a pansy who can't say no to the powerful vested interests within his company"

The consequence of running a netting operation is that you have to manage risk.  It is becoming apparent that some brokerages are more beholden to their upstreams than others and it is also becoming apparent that manipulating the market, via gamma hedging those brokers running netting operations must do, is an actual thing.  It's just now, instead of hedgies having all the fun, certain *ape* communities have figured out that, collectively, they hold just as much power (if not more) as multi-billion dollar hedge funds.  If the *apes* were truly smart, they would figure out which brokers produce the biggest gamma hedging while also having the largest exposure to shorting hedgies and every last one of those apes would pile into that/those brokers with their gamma squeezing collective action (buying shitloads of stock *and* options is probably the best strategy here).  

It's a balance.  

You have to find the broker who is simultaneously netting on the risky side of the spectrum who also has massive hedgie shorts while not being too beholden to their upstream market maker so that they won't gank-fuck retail apes with ridiculous trade restrictions announced out of the blue when the apes run their collective action campaigns.

Who is responsible for fulfilling an exercised option?

The 1st seller(writer) or the LAST person who sold it before being exercised.

Looking at getting into options, but i wanna make sure i don't over do it or set myself for serious problems

alot of the stuff i read says the seller is responsible or others say its the writer. By ""Seller do they mean the original ""writer"" or the last person who sold the option(s)?"
2021-06-19 21:55:28,stocks,"If you are the holder of a call option that you purchased and is now in the money and expiring, you are responsible for taking action.   Now, some/most brokers will automatically exercise those options if you are 1 cent in the money at the time of expiration.   If you don’t have the money to purchase those shares, then they will likely exercise them and immediately sell those shares and the difference is deposited into your acct.   But that all depends on the broker.   As you will learn, most who deal in options rarely let it get to that point.  They usually sell or roll them before the date of expiration.   I suggest checking out some videos on YouTube, in particularly one called In The Money."
2021-06-20 02:51:26,stocks,"If you write an option by selling to open you are required to fulfill the terms of the option contract unless you buy to close the option or the option expires out of the money. If you buy to close the option the contract is effectively terminated as far as you are concerned... your obligation ends then and there.

If you sell a put and it's in the money you may be required to buy the shares at the strike price as long as the option is still open. If you sell a call you may be required to sell the shares. Most of the time options do not get exercised early (ie, they get exercised on the expiration day), but you should be aware that it can happen.

If you simply buy an option (buy to open) you are under no obligation to do anything. You can sell the option (sell to close), exercise the option, or hold the option until it expires. Once one of those three things has occurred you are out of the contract. In other words, no obligation gets passed along to you by selling to close an option.

You can also roll options, but effectively all that does is close one position and open another.

Edit: so for your question, ""who is responsible for fulfilling an exercised option"", the answer is whoever last wrote the option (sell to open) without buying to close.

Person A writes an option (sell to open) and person B buys it (buy to open). A few days pass, person C writes the same option and person A buys it (buy to close.) Person B sells their option (sell to close) and Person D buys it. D sells to E who sells to F who sells to G and so on and so forth all the way to person Z. The expiration day arrives, the option is in the money so person Z exercises the option, person C is required to fulfill it. Person A is out, his obligation was fulfilled when he bought to close the contract. Persons B and D-Y of course have no obligations because they simply bought then sold the options."

An option contract has 2 sides, the buyer and the seller. When you want to start a position in options, you have 2 choices:

- Buy to open
- Write (or sell) to open

When you BUY to open a call/put contract, you (the option holder) have the right, but not the obligation to purchase/sell 100 shares of the stock at the strike price. On the other hand when you WRITE to open, the other party who bought the option from you has that right. That means you’re responsible for providing those 100 shares (for calls) or the cash (for puts) should the other party choose to exercise their option.

Once you have opened a position in options, you don’t have to wait it out until expiry. You can get out of the contract and release your obligations/rights in 2 ways:

- Sell to close (if you bought to open)
- Buy to close (if you wrote to open)"

2021-06-20 13:31:08,stocks,"Whoever is short an option at close is liable. But there is no tracking of a single option as they’re traded. They’re fungible. Assignment is (not exactly) random ( it is random for all reasonable purposes , if you’re interested in the exact procedure the CBOE has it explained at their site )"
2021-06-20 02:32:20,stocks,That YouTube Channel has a lot of good advice.
2021-06-20 11:58:26,stocks,"You ordered it correctly. But to reiterate what you are saying:

Call: You have the right to buy 100 shares
Put: You have the right to sell 100 shares

To illustrate. It’s best represented when someone does something **uncovered or naked**:

If you **sell a call naked** (not a covered call), and it gets exercised, then you have a short position in your portfolio. Since you don’t have the shares, you “sell to open” and are -100 shares of the stock. 

If you have 100 shares already, you would not have a short position as there are no additional shares to sell (*thats a covered call*).

If you **bought a naked put** and you exercise it and it makes it to expiry, then you also have a short position because your broker “sells to open” and you have -100 shares of the stock. 

If you have 100 shares already, you would not have a short position as there are no additional shares to sell.

So **selling puts and buying calls** are the opposite. If either trade is exercised at expiry or by the option buyer, then you are long +100 shares.  If you are buying calls or selling puts naked, it generally means that you do not have the capital to cover if it gets exercised and would probably get a margin call if overextended. The broker IRL tries to mitigate losses at all times."
2021-06-19 21:58:31,stocks,Same thing applies to puts as well then?
2021-06-19 23:22:33,stocks,"Examples:

Person A has 100 shares of Apple. He writes a call for $140 strike August 20th expiration. He asks a premium of $1 per share. 

Person B buys the call for the $1 premium and pays person A $100. Person B now holds the contract and the right to exercise. Apple shoots up yo $142 in July. Person B is not sure Apple will hold $140 through expiration or doesn’t have the cash to exercise the contract. He checks to see what the bid/ask is. 

Person C is now in the market for Apple August 20 $140 calls. He is willing to pay a $5 premium. Person B sees this and sells the contract to person C’s ask. Person C pays person B $500. Person B now has $500 and is no longer attached to the contract. The next day Apple moves to $147. Person C exercises the contract and pays person A $140 per share for Person A’s 100 shares. Person A is contractually obligated to give the 100 shares to person C and person A receives $140 per share.

A put works exactly the same way except person A is contractually obligated to buy 100 shares, not sell 100 shares."
2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Gap Theory and Indices Does gap trading theory hold any relevance if you're looking at an index like the S&P500 or is it only for individual stocks?

For example: Looking at the daily candlestick chart for the S&P there is a visible gap up at April 1st 2021 at 4019. Currently trading at 4166. Does this suggest that during the next downward trend it is likely to fill? 

Or since the index price represents a bunch other stocks is the gap just meaningless noise?

&#x200B;

I recently held AT&T until early May of this year. I was in AT&T because of the 7%+ dividend and I sold at that time because of the nice run up in price which I felt that a near term top was forming and that I could re-enter later at a better price.

&#x200B;

Good thing I did because I was out when the crash in price happened from $33 on 5/17 to the low of $29 on 5/19.

# 10 Things AT&T Wants Investors to Know

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/18/10-things-att-wants-investors-to-know/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/18/10-things-att-wants-investors-to-know/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From the above article I likes these points:

&#x200B;

## 1. Its wireless business is still strong

## 2. It is expanding its 5G network

## 3. It is doubling its fiber footprint

## 5. WarnerMedia is recovering

## 7. It won't cut the dividend until the deal closes

On the bright side, AT&T doesn't  expect to ""reset"" its current dividend until after the spinoff and  merger close. AT&T expects to close the deal in mid-2022, but the  actual deadline is July 15, 2023. Therefore, investors can still collect  its 7% yield for at least one more year.

## 9. It will have less debt

&#x200B;

These points not so much:

&#x200B;

## 4. Capital investments are rising

## 6. Reiterating its long-term guidance

Desroches reiterated  AT&T's prior guidance for 2022 to 2024, which reflects the spinoff  of WarnerMedia and its higher capital expenditure targets. It expects to  generate over $20 billion in annual [free cash flow](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/free-cash-flow/) after the deal closes, and maintain a cash dividend payout ratio between 40% and 43%.

In other words, the ""new"" AT&T will pay out  about $8 billion in annual dividends, compared to nearly $15 billion in  dividend payments in 2020, so investors should expect its current  dividend to be nearly halved.

## 8. Its yield is still ""very attractive""

&#x200B;

I like that the dividend yield is 7.3% for my purchase price and that the $0.52 dividend per quarter will continue until at least a year from now. Around this time next year I will reevaluate if I am to continue holding AT&T.

&#x200B;

Opinions appreciated in what others who are invested in AT&T will do around the spin off of WarnerMedia and merge it with **Discovery** next June."
2021-06-19 21:12:07,stocks,"T has essentially been in the same price range since 2003, +/- $10.  So I guess if you only want the dividend that's fine.  What is the opportunity cost and what are your goals?"

2021-06-19 20:51:11,stocks,"I've kept a modest position in T.

It's still a very established business and is growing in various ways. The upcoming cut to their dividend and the Warner/Discovery merger has made competitors more attractive in the next year or so. But you've got to decide for yourself whether that makes T unviable moving forward, and I don't think it does. I think it's a buying opportunity for the long term, though there may be some sideways or downward movement over the next year or so while this all gets ironed out."
2021-06-19 22:07:30,stocks,"One thing I'll be watching in the future is the 5G network. There are still some unknowns here. It has a long way to go. 5G is really split into two parts, one that is more like an upgrade of 4G and uses similar frequencies with wider coverage and marginal speed benefits and one using new lower frequencies with a huge bandwidth/speed/device # benefit, but it's very short coverage. Once they build the new part out in urban areas, at a large costs, we still don't know how much more revenue it will net them.

It might be an essential cost to stay competitive, but we don't know if we get greater returns for the costs. Perhaps they will be able to charge for people connecting their cars, smaller devices, more watches,etc... Perhaps they won't. I mention the different spectrums of 5G, because its the short-distance high bandwidth spectrum that has more of an ability to serve a much larger number of devices with higher bandwidths. There is still an unknown at what the best new part of 5G technology could lead us to or not."
2021-06-20 07:57:12,stocks,"I bought in just before the covid crash. The one stock I hold that sits at a loss. Even after averaging down I’m still down overall something like 12%. It is frustrating to see the sideways movement and then the slip back under $30 post merger news.


With that said, I actually think the Warner/discovery merger is actually the best move T has taken in a while. They are finally cleaning house, making big moves to pay down debt and focusing on telecom and being a top tier utility. Frankly even the dividend cut makes sense for the businesses long term health. 


So with all that, my plan is to hold and potentially buy in further while it’s still under $30, since it finally looks like they are building a healthy long term strategy."

2021-06-20 10:09:33,stocks,"I hold ATT, invested for the dividend and HBO Max. Main thing I like about HBO Max is that they have pretty decent content. But that might just be my taste in shows/movies. I don't like the content on Netflix all that much at this point. With the Discovery merger I expect HBO Max or whatever platform comes out of the merger to expand their library. So I might buy more ATT to get shares in their telecom business for the dividend and shares in their streaming business for growth."

2021-06-20 16:33:57,stocks,"They cut the dividend in half, and got rid of a bunch of their best assets. I dont see what the point of investing in it at the moment is. Look at VZ, KMB, KO, ED if you want dividends."
2021-06-19 23:02:38,stocks,"Nokia over att. They intentionally told the public that they were going to have shit earnings, knowing that they weren't.

2021-06-19 23:28:16,stocks,"I have a few shares of T. I'm not planning to buy anymore until the split happens, then I'll grab enough shares to start selling covered calls. I'm wondering if the split will make the real price plunge as uninformed people freak out about the sudden drop. If so, better for me.

The dividend will still be decent, even if it's not amazing, and T will be a stronger company overall. I guess the real question is whether you want to prepurchase the spun off company or not."

AT&T - Juiced the dividend this quarter by $0.3493

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mashqk/att\_juiced\_the\_dividend\_this\_quarter\_by\_03493](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mashqk/att_juiced_the_dividend_this_quarter_by_03493)

&#x200B;

Following advice on this forum I initiated a variation on the selling of covered calls on the AT&T stock I own to juice the income above what the stock earns in dividends.

My strategy is when the AT&T dividends are paid into my account I buy more AT&T stock with the cash then sell covered calls against all my AT&T stock that expires the week before earnings.

Doing this on 2/1 I was able to buy more AT&T shares at $28.79 and sell ""T Apr 16 2021 CALL 31.0"" for $0.49 which is near what the dividend is. If the stock would have been called at $31 I would have made $2.21 a share gain and pocketed the $0.49 for the call.

As of today with the earnings call happening on 4/22, the dividend date announcement happening soon and the ex-dividend date in early April I decided to close my covered calls at $0.11.

I netted $3423.56 in gains on the covered call options or $0.3493 per share.

Adding the $0.52 dividend to the $0.3493 will give me 0.8693 of income for my 9800 shares of AT&T this quarter which is a 3% return or 12% annually.

I plan to do this again at the beginning of August when the dividend is again paid."

Note the NEARLY halved. 8/15 = 53% and that won't happen until the earliest of June 2022.

Reset of the dividend will probably be around $0.29 or 4% annually.

&#x200B;

I didn't really like holding ivv and qqq, seemed redundant but I still wanted to be a little top heavy with a bit more of the market so swapped ivv+ijh for VTI and IYR. I think this balance is better for me.

2021-06-19 23:28:07,stocks,"Not gonna fail like it did with the snow storm. At most rolling brownouts and bullshit maintenance/repair timeframes for certain sectors, but no uniform widespread failure. We’re a fully self-contained power grid, and rates are all tariff or opt-in variable rates for the residential end-users, industrial is mostly contract block power rates, and most commercial wouldn’t be vulnerable to power outages in any significant way in the major cities. 

So producers are unlikely to be the answer, but power providers that are able to charge variable rates based partially off spot market may stand to benefit. If you go that route though, you’d want to check out ERCOT to try and get some current numbers for the provider entities, and check out any rules or regs capping rate increases above seasonal averages or other pre-set rate and usage ranges or restrictions applicable to their services (etc). Unlikely to be a strong investment target as a category, based on summer strain alone though, but I could be wrong.

2021-06-19 20:59:17,stocks,I bought in after it fell.  It's been bouncing around that level since.  So it depends on if it's likely to fall more with a grid failure on top of the winter storm costs that are already figured in.  It also depends on how they perform vs. their competitors in the area.  If the share price drops a bunch I'll probably average down.  They're the largest utility in the area so bankruptcy is not likely.  Some of their smaller competitors weren't as lucky after the storm.

They're acquisition smart, they're spreading stores like wildfire in CA, they already own the largest CBD and consumption gear online stores - and the Canna Cabana locations look like the perfect image of what gets people walking through the door, modern and attractive branding/design. Nothing to really scare me off here. Revenue climbing each QTR. EPS positive around the corner. Tilray and Aphria are invested. Their partner investment banks have substantial stakes well above the current asking price. Blah blah blah. The list goes on. HITI is comfortably about 50 percent of my portfolio ATM.

2021-06-20 12:02:59,stocks,"Not financial advice.

Cresco is struggling a lot out in Ohio. They should be a powerhouse based on location (yellowsprings), cultivar diversity, and branding. Sadly, they’re bottom of the barrel. Massive turnover at all levels, including upper management, at their cultivation facility. That’s a death sentence for large scale grows when consistency and attention to detail is crucial. Hard to accomplish those feats when you’re constantly hiring new lead growers and getting them up to speed on the company’s ipm, nutrient program, strain cycles, etc.

They don’t have a processing license currently and haven’t secured a premier partnership with any standalone processors to get extracts or edibles on shelves with their branding, which is a huge market. 

This is just in Ohio. A barrier to entry state where Cresco was a shoe in and had plenty of time to get a leg up on a small amount of competition and have done nothing with that opportunity. They barely put out any product and it’s average to low quality."

They have the largest E-Commerce presence in the world man and they are truly going to dominate this space. The CEO is a beast and the team is very dynamic. They have positive adjusted EBITDA (hardly any cannabis retailer has this). They made great deals and the debt is constantly restructured and every loan gets turned into shares. They have around 90 stores and will have 115 EOY. They consistently scale. This quarter might be rough due to lockdowns, but it is fine. They trade 1.4 times 2022 consensus estimates compared to a pretty trash peer group that trades at 8x that with completely shit numbers. Dilution went down by a good amount recently.

Most of the smaller companies will get acquired by the bigger mso's in this time, leaving next to nothing for an LP to buy with thier ""cash on hand"". Or the ones left will be equal or bigger then tlry in rev.

Tlry choose to trade on the big board rather then acquire a us company and start to make their foot print. They won't delist to enter the us.

Even after its federally legal, interstate commerce will be the last thing, and only till that happens can tlry enter the us.

Tlry will still be around. They may merge. Get acquired, or aquire another company to enter the us, but by which time it will be so far out, that it's won't be worth the hold. Once the mso's can uplist to the big board the big money will come out of the lp's and into the mso's. Tlry will be a sub 10$ stock."

However, Scotts is already pretty large cap, the argument for the pure canabis companies is that they are small and mid cap and have more room for growth. I don't see Scotts 3Xing on legalization news. But the smaller names, possibly.

So maybe an etf with Scotts is a good way to go, get the small cap exposure along with a solid large cap, pick and shovel, play."

While companies like Cresco and the like already have brick and mortar up in the US, HITI has more bricks up in Canada and it should be a very smooth transition into the US market. Raj is very capable and very ready. They also have celebrity licenses with people from the US. Europe and South America as well as everywhere else will become more available too. HITI will also likely acquire a retail company that is already up and running in the US. Maybe they can link deals with e-commerce and bricks in the US. My god if US legalizes and allows shipments of cannabis it is game over. Sorry, my responses are not well put together, but I think there is market share for many. I hold Cresco as well."
2021-06-20 00:40:57,stocks,"I think what they are getting at is that management has a history of using dilution to make acquisitions that are accretive to shareholder value. They add businesses at values with lower EBITDA multiples than their own and, in addition to cost synergies, generate further value for shareholders through multiple arbitrage. Alex M on YouTube does a better job explaining this: https://youtu.be/zuRehXHOJqk (skip to ~1:14)

Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of HITI and have about 7% of my portfolio allocated for which I've been underwater on for the majority of the time I've been holding but I'm not worried. I'm also off the opinion that this is the best play in the cannabis space"

I said it went down a decent amount so he knows it is not as bad as it was; however, he shouldn't worry about it anyways because it means they are growing. There is such a thing as good dilution. HITI does not dilute to keep the lights on. They do it to buy shit. Additionally, the CEO owns 15% of the shares and is essentially diluting himself when he does this. He says he will not sell any for quite some time from now."

I said they have an extremely diversified revenue stream. They already get 30% or so revenue from the US. Plenty of other places in the world will legalize. You do not have to listen to me, why don't you stop being a lazy piece of shit and do some research? If everything goes right they absolutely will be at 25B MC EOY 2026. What bag? I am barely down. There is way more certainty with HITI because the shit is actually legalized in Canada. Fuck I hate dumb people. If US legalizes the stock goes to Pluto instead of only going to Saturn...that's all.

2021-06-20 18:03:32,stocks,"Haha I’m not a fan of weedmaps. I live in a legal state and have been shopping in dispensaries for over 10 years. I think there may be some money to make short-term but I don’t like weedmaps long-term viability. 

Weedmaps can be useful in a new market for finding shops, but as consumers become more educated about cannabis and the market, they’ll cut out the middleman, weedmaps. Every dispensary I shop at has their own website and online ordering. They also update their menus/drops daily on Instagram. In this kind of environment I don’t really see a need for weedmaps. They also gouge the shit out of dispensary owners, so I think most owners are motivated to create their own website and online services. Weedmaps is a middleman. Just doesn’t seem like a good business model to me. 

Honestly as a cannabis consumer, I like Leafly better, but I don’t think I’d invest in either. Anyway these are just my thoughts as an investor and long-time cannabis consumer in one of the first legal states. I could certainly be wrong. Also, I think there’s potential for short-term gains. Weedmaps may have some success before people realize that they just don’t offer much as a business. 

As far as cannabis, I really like GTBIF and NXGWF. Green Thumb is one of the few companies that is already profitable!!! This is amazing when you consider how fast they are still growing. They have great brands which offer them flexibility in the future as a retailer or wholesaler. They have great fundamentals, great strategy, and great footprint. I’m extremely bullish if you can’t tell. Ive got 30% of my entire portfolio in Green Thumb. They will continue to grow even without legalization! They are extremely well-positioned. I think they’ll hit $50-60 in the next year and even higher if/when safe banking passes. They’re $29 now. 

Next Green wave is more of my long shot play as they’re in the extremely competitive California market. However they are also one of the few companies that profitable AND they have amazing quality cannabis. They will be almost tripling capacity when their new facility opens in early 2022. I’m expecting an easy 3x with these guys in the next year or so. Also long-term, if they execute their plan a 10x is totally possible. 

Those are my two faves. I also like Curaleaf and Columbia Care. Columbia Care has NY licenses and I believe they’ll see significant gains when that market starts to develop. 

A lot of guys on the weed boards like Cresco. They are a good option too, I’ve just chosen a different “horse”. 

I help IIPR for awhile but the SAFE act concerns me. They may find a way to adapt though who knows. 

Anyway there are a lot of cannabis companies out there, but I’d focus mainly on US operators as they’re the ones who will benefit from the loosening restrictions in the US."

Thanks for sharing LVVV. Never heard of them, but I’ll check em out. You might like NXGWF as they’re a penny stock trading about $0.65 now. I’m really excited about those guys and if they execute and get noticed in Cali they might cut years off my retirement target!

2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Should I sell NVDA before or after the stock split? Or just keep holding I have around 15 shares of NVDA, my average buy in price is $495.

Anyways for the last week or so, I have really been debating whether or no to sell before the stock split, to take my profits and avoid a mass sell off. Some other research I have done showed that some companies actually had some nice buy in after the stock split though. Another thought I had was of course to keep it longer term, just hoping that it continues to slowly rise. 

Anyone in a similar scenario or has any kind of advice?

thanks"
2021-06-20 08:20:07,stocks,NVDA is long hold. And given the popularity I’m sure post stock split it will see a spike from people buying it at a more “affordable” price.

IMO, i think there will be another run up post split, but the growth will plateau"
2021-06-20 06:47:46,stocks,I think there's a lot of exciting things in the pipeline for NVDA still. I'm planning to hold onto them for another year or two before considering to re-evaluate my position. I don't intend to pay the stock split any mind.
2021-06-20 10:29:16,stocks,Would hold.   More shares for you and more people will probably buy because it's cheaper.
2021-06-20 11:35:02,stocks,"I bought one a few days ago and will add on more after the split. I expect people who have been turned away at the current price are waiting till the split to jump in. Some just are not into the idea of partial shares and would like to at least start at owning 1. The split would help that. 

I’ve always liked the company and it has always been in my plans to jump in. I just got tired of seeing it constantly go up with me on the sideline. I’ll be holding long. 

That said, profit is profit, so don’t feel bad if you need to make that move or there’s another stock you’re looking to move the money into."
2021-06-20 11:35:06,stocks,"I'm holding, been since around 2016 or so gonna hold for the next 5 years at least and probably much longer.

2021-06-20 12:34:14,stocks,Keep holding.
2021-06-19 21:49:32,stocks,I would sell. Big run up pre split similar to Tesla and Expi. Both dropped massively after.
2021-06-19 21:34:49,stocks,You could look at TTD. They did a 10:1 split either Thursday or Friday. It immediately went up a couple of bucks. I think NVDA is a better company than TTD and would hold through the split. The only reason I can think of to sell NVDA is if the Arm acquisition doesn’t work out. And even then I’m still bullish long term.
2021-06-19 22:56:05,stocks,Ok so let’s look at recent stock splits lol. Tesla and Apple what happened ? Now that’s go back to when Berkshire Hathaway did a stock split what happened? In fact it made Warren Buffett say he’ll never do a stock split again even if his stock goes to millions ! Hope this answers your question. The recent boom in nvda is because the stock split and the banks will sell before. So that means you always sell with the banks. Theirs always better opportunities down the road. Sell now and take your profits ! Unless your long if your long then take some profits and rebuy a few days later when it drops drastically.
2021-06-19 23:45:40,stocks,Splits are typically a bullish indicator. I wouldn’t sell.

I do expect it to dip post earnings because alot of people think ""oh if it splits itll be cheaper and more retailers will buy it"" and that's not the best take. If the news is itll split that means smart money is buying it now, to make a quick buck so that when retailers buy it come post split they'll dump there shares the week after. Happened with tesla. And not saying it usually happens but this seems to be in the same direction. If it's a forever stock to you I wouldnt sell all of it. 

Tldr: if a stock moves up because of nothing news never a bad idea to take profit/trim"
2021-06-19 23:39:00,stocks,"On paper, stock splits shouldn't matter.  In reality, they sometimes do.  However stocks tend to be influenced more by other factors than the split.

2021-06-19 23:52:32,stocks,"Continue to hold (or if you’re really itching to free up capital sell 5 of the highest cost shares - at most). 

If you don’t need the cash for a specific other position that has better long-term prospects than holding NVDA shares with a cost basis ($250) below current market price, and if your  long-term thesis about the *company* hasn’t changed, then there’s no reason to sell. 

NVDA not a vulnerable spec play, you’re golden."

The split has no effect on the value."

2021-06-20 02:20:07,stocks,I think so. I don’t remember the last split and I watch NVDA closely.
2021-06-20 14:04:19,stocks,Ya that’s what i’m saying. Do you really think it’s going to drop $250+ a share to get down to that basis?

2021-06-20 04:05:03,stocks,"A stock split isn’t a catalyst for company valuation change though. If it has another catalyst that’s going to drop then it’ll drop, if it has another catalyst that’s going to raise it it’ll raise. That’s all there is to it. Again, it’s the same total value, just more units of smaller value. I think in this case financial comprehension is more vital than reading comprehension by a long shot."

2021-06-20 11:21:37,stocks,"It shouldn't be a catalyst for the price to increase as much as it has either really, but it has gone up 30% or more in the last month, so based on your reasoning the stock is probably overpriced and he should sell.

It's possible that so many people have bought it on the promise that ""more people will buy it post split because its more accessible and it will drive up the price"" that the price has actually been unnaturally inflated already and there could be a sell off instead.

But the real answer is nobody knows. I sold too soon expecting a sell off. Holding long is probably a safe bet because its a great company"

2021-06-20 14:59:39,stocks,"No. The cost basis would be adjusted once it dips below their currently held highest-priced share. Cost basis is calculated based on purchase prices not market prices. 

So 15 shares all purchased at $495 is always going to have a lower basis than 10 shares at $495 and 5 shares at $600 (for example) no matter what the current market price is.

(That’s why it’s called a “cost” basis)"

No, let’s round up to $500 for the sake of math


15 shares at $500 is *$7,500* cost basis is $500


You sell 5 of those shares at $600 and receive *$3,000* with a profit of $500, cost basis still $500 assuming you bought all shares at the same exact price


The price drops to $550 and you reinvest that money into NVDA for 5 shares at $550 which costs *$2,750* a total profit of $250 which you can now subtract from your initial investment since you now have the same number of shares you started out with. 


You now have 15 shares of NVDA for $7,250 and a cost basis of $483."

I bought nvda at $470 and even as recent as $750. If the share price is $1000 a share some day, I won't care about $470 vs $750.

I can't go back and purchase more shares at $470, so I buy them now."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in Companies Based on Technilogical Area? (x-post r/stocks r/investing r/investment) Let me preface this by saying that I am pretty convinced by the ""buy index funds and hold"" strategy of investing. Although I wouldn't go so far as to argue that no one is capable of picking stocks that beat the average market risk-return profile, I think this capability is probably extremely rare, at best, especially over the short term.

&#x200B;

However, my friend recently proposed an investing strategy somewhere in between this and short-term stock picking, that I am now considering. I thought I would lay it out here for constructive criticism:

&#x200B;

The idea is to pick some technologies that we expect to be a big part of the future, invest in some companies (or index funds) that are in this area, and hold them as long as possible (on the scale of decades). For example, I think that brain-computer interfaces will eventually be very pervasive and transformative, so under this strategy, I would take some money out of my various index funds, and invest it in Neuralink and similar companies.

&#x200B;

On the one hand, I do think that, as an engineer, I have a slightly better than average prediction of technologies that will be important in the future. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much better this prediction would be than the weighted average of all other investors. Additionally, although I think it's easy to say ""x technology will eventually be very important"", I think it's much harder to say exactly when. Just like pointed out in the book ""Soonish"", technological advancement is heavily interdependent and often occurs when an unexpected breakthrough suddenly opens up a whole range  of possibilities. Thus, timing and specifics are harder to predict than general trends. The idea is to try to mitigate the timing factor by investing until retirement, but I'm unsure if this will be long enough to average out the noise. (Both my friend and I are currently 26)

&#x200B;

Further, I wonder if picking individual stocks, even if at random, returns higher than index funds. It certainly has much higher risk, which is usually associated with higher average return, but maybe in this case, the risk comes without any gain because it is purely a result of failing to sufficiently diversify?

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'd love to hear all your thoughts!"
2021-06-20 13:55:51,stocks,"At the end of the day it just comes down to whether you think you have the ability and time to make better decisions than a team of professional investors with nearly limitless resources who’s entire day/life is a specific sector. 

You have to make that decision but for me, the premium that I have to pay to have kathy woods and her team at ARK do it for me is well worthwhile, especially when investing in budding industries where things can drastically change in an instant & it’s nearly impossible for one person to stay up to date on every minute detail"
2021-06-20 14:57:00,stocks,Why not go through all their holdings and see if there's any particular stocks you're bullish on?
2021-06-20 16:55:02,stocks,"That makes sense, basically it sounds like you think that neither of us can make better decisions picking companies (or technological sectors) than this company.

&#x200B;

I do wonder whether they can make better decisions than the market though. Like, to play devil's advocate, if they give a significantly higher return than index funds, why doesn't everyone invest in them? Lack of knowledge? Risk? Or those plus some other factors?"
2021-06-20 16:53:25,stocks,"That's a good idea. They change over time though, I wonder how frequently? One key component of the strategy I'm proposing is to sell stocks as infrequently as possible to avoid losses due to taxes."
2021-06-20 17:00:42,stocks,"That’s a good question and I think it has a lot to do with risk tolerance, same as why some people opt to buy bonds or invest solely in stable high dividend yield stocks while others dca into an s&p etf. 

Just take a look at ARKGs 2 year chart, definitely more volatile than something like VOO"
2021-06-20 18:05:32,stocks,"I don't think their core holdings change that often but they do seem to make frequent smaller buys/sells. 

Could potentially be a useful place to start although I don't have any opinion on their holdings or stock picking prowess in general.

2021-06-20 19:33:45,stocks,"Yeah, it looks like it has returned 40% CAGR since inception (2017). Which is way better than the market return of \~15% over the same period (used VTSAX for comparison). Of course, it is also significantly more volatile, but this isn't really what worries me. 2-5 years is not a long track record, and I wonder what the true average rate of return over a much longer period of time would be.

&#x200B;

For example, if it had a history of return 40% over like 100 years, even with the same amount of volatility, I would probably invest all my money in it. But this data isn't available (yet), so instead we have to make extrapolations based on the limited data that is available, and our understanding of the underlying fund and the market"
2021-06-20 19:42:13,stocks,"Oh definitely. There’s a next to  zero % chance it maintains this, just look at the past 6mo, down 22% vs voo up low teens. It’s definitely going to be way more volatile and long term cagr will likely drop down to something more reasonable but (particularly speaking to arkg as it’s the only one that I’m heavily invested in and semi knowledgeable about the sector), a few good picks in the fund could result in it beating the s&p long term. Granted despite how much I like arkg I’m still pretty heavily invested in VOO just for the stability"

[stocks split are...](https://https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/)

“The primary motive of a stock split is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors.

Although the number of outstanding shares increases and the price per share decreases, the market capitalization (and the value of the company) does not change.

The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier.”"

Nothing changes except the number of shares you hold which make up this total amount. Same holds true for fractional shares. Your total amount invested does not lose or gain anything from the split occurring and no one needs to do anything by any specific date to be eligible for the changes in share amounts. It’s an automatic process.

It took a week to resolve, multiple firms got margin called, and didn’t let up till Porsche themselves released a further 5% of the company. At the time something like 12% of VW voting shares were shorted, and only 5% of the vW voting shares were on the float. For a day or two VW was the most valuable company on the planet by a lot.

Porsche also nearly went bankrupt and lost money on the deal in the end if I recall correctly. But I forget how that part went down, a little bit later on.

What I think is you should do is to diversify.

A few ETFs I would recommend are:  

Next Gen internet: QQQJ & ARKW

For Growth stock: you can try to subscribe to Motley Fool Stock advisor/ Rule breaker or ARKK & ARKF 

For good dividend: QYLD, XYLD, RYLD & SRET - Do take note their expenses ratio is much higher than VOO. If you don't have that much cash. Pick QYLD or XYLD. 

Basically I stick with the above and has gotten great returns (around 500%) over the last 4 years. 

Few things to take note. 

1. Don't play on margin.
2. Look out for the FED & inflation and see if the FED is going to raise interest rate. 
3. LSI(Lumpsum investment) is great over the past few years but with inflation increasing to  5% in MAY 2021(highest we have seen since 2008.) I will do DCA(dollar cost averaging).

2021-06-19 21:02:02,stocks,"Sure, a generic ETF like VOO is plenty diverse, at least until such time as the US market isn't dominant.  

Being in an ETF is more/better than what many pensions and retirement and savings plans are.  

There's two approaches to stock markets.  One is to consider it like a casino or hobby, where you have no sober expectation for profit and the willingness/ability to lose most of the money you put in.

The other path is to treat it like a serious, self-directed investment program.  And to do that demands knowledge and ongoing investment of time, research, and homework.  As if you're hiring yourself to be your own ETF manager.  

Jim Cramer, who is ironically and unjustly hated by Reddit, has numerous books that explain this well for people in your situation.  Approach two you start by having your life plan and job lined up in front of you, then you first accumulate a minimum of $10,000 in an untouchable ETF.  

Once you have additional money that you can absolutely afford to lose, then and only then, would you buy individual stocks.  You want to have several, for diversification.  You want to be a bit careful about the timing of when you buy them.  Buying on sale is good, buying during a frenzy is not.  (That's just one reason why the most false slogan in the financial world is ""you can't time the market"")

But every stock you buy commits you to a certain amount of daily, weekly, and monthly homework.  And you're also going to be committing to annual tax filing homework.  

The homework means knowing the company you just became a tiny owner of.  Knowing their management, their products, their market, their competition.  Knowing what factors might be in their favor and which might be threats.  Reading their quarterly reports and press releases, listening to their conference calls.  Seeing what both fans and critics say.  And being ready to sell them if they achieve your intended goal, or if conditions change that make them less desirable to own.  

I say successfully owning stocks is like owning pets; they require feeding and attention every day.  You can't just ignore them for a long time and expect to catch up by binging.  

If you're doing that unpaid work to learn the subject and protect yourself, that's great.  But a clinical assessment of time spent versus the dollar size of your portfolio might tell you that for, say, $10,000 account, you're better off giving an ETF a few bucks to run it for you.  And you may also find that when your portfolio becomes six and seven figures, doing it yourself is worth your while."

Although it reduces risk to buy a single ETF, it would be interesting to know if the ETF itself trades at a higher cost than just investing in each company partially.

In fact, if they don't correlate the AP, I believe is what they are called, can just issue more ETFs to correct the price, and they make a profit of that too.

As time goes on, consolidate your money into the best preforming 3-7 companies. 

Obviously stonk selection is very important with this sort of trading strategy so make sure you do your DD before investing. Sadly, entire generations were tricked into thinking that volatility equates to risk and that risk can be mitigated by diversification. In reality, positively trending volatile stonks produce significantly more wealth when actively traded. ETFs are the lazy way to consistently make a measly 8%.

So there's no straightforward answer...  It depends on what you want exposure to.  VOO gives you lots of market-cap weighted exposure to most of the largest American companies.  If that's exactly what you want, no need to search elsewhere, you're done.  If you want to change your exposure, then you can search for other ETFs that either do exactly what you want, or simply buy multiple ETFs to make your own basket, weighted however you want.

Longer answer picking a market index like Voo has already given you multiple companies spreading out the risk compared to a single stock or industry sector.


The risk in owning a single ETF comes from it falling out of favor and it's price dropping. (This is likely a small risk but something to think about). Let's say a a different ETF that is similar to voo shows up tomorrow that had lower fees or is far more tax efficient people could decide voo is no longer  what they want to invest in.


Depending what your other investments are in, you could be limiting yourself to only a US market. Also some people could prefer more value stocks or even equal weighted funds so that Amazon doesn't dictated your price as much. 


This is also assuming your risk tolerance supports 100% equity fund. 


That being said with 3 ETF's you could probably get most things you are looking for as well as it being pretty easy to rebalance as needed."
2021-06-19 22:27:34,stocks,"It depends on the ETF. But VOO is pretty conservative and diversified. In fact, I would recommend an ETF like MTUM over VOO.

Personally I like to spread out more.  With EFT's you just have to do the research to make sure that you aren't getting too many of the same stocks in the portfolio.  Covering many industries can cover your security.
2021-06-20 00:04:22,stocks,"One equity ETF suffices to diversify your equity holdings.

But holding only equity is a form of concentration, so you should hold some other type of ETF, like a bond or commodity ETF (or both).

There's nothing wrong with VOO and gives you exposure to S&P 500 with a low expense ratio, where a combination of VTI and VXUS would give you exposure to the Total US Stock Market and Total International Stock Market respectively. Both VOO and VTI are really great shouts and starting out on those ETFs is good to get your feet wet into the world of investing."
2021-06-20 00:58:15,stocks,"That really depends on which ETF you choose and what sector it concentrates in.

In my opinion, once you start getting some more scratch to invest, diversify into 3 or 4 ETF's in differing sectors, and be prepared to leave the money there for a few years.

In addition to stock holdings I have a handful of ETFs that have done very well for me over the last ~3 or 4 years: FDN, GURU, CIBR & VGT have all been great, with at least 50% growth on each of them since roughly 4Q19."

You can also set aside some $ for funds in specific sectors you like… made a killing in a medical eft last year."

You  can further diversify by buying ETFs of S&P mid and S&P small -cap. companies like [EWMC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Advisor&ticker=EWMC) and [EWSC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWSC) respectively.

In my personal strategy, I like equal-weighted ETFs, which is why I recommended those.

Do some research though because many of them have similar holdings so you would just be duplicating your portfolio."
2021-06-20 09:39:11,stocks,Index funds.   S&P.  Seem to stand the test of time.   I’ve had long term success with PGX.   In doing my research with the exception of 2008 & March 2020 it’s consistently paid a monthly dividend around 5% with not much price fluctuation.  But I don’t invest in one ETF.  ETFs cover different sectors of the economy so it’s just as important to diversify among a few than just one.   Read and educate yourself on investing.   It’s a marathon not a sprint.
2021-06-20 10:41:49,stocks,"At this point what fund you invest in is meaningless compared to how much you save. An S&P 500 stock fund/etf is perfect. So would VTI. They are very similar. The point is spend your effort on finding ways to save more at this point, it will pay dividends greater than slicing and dicing your investments.

In addition you need to have a cash fund for life emergencies and things that come up. Usually 3 months or more is good."
2021-06-20 10:59:53,stocks,"Tbh my opinion is if you think that VOO will continue to rise see if you can average down when it drops, as one stock is diverse on its own by on top of that I think I’d try and get etfs in specific sectors such as green energy and so on if you wish to spread your money a little bit more."
2021-06-20 11:57:09,stocks,"In my admittedly limited experience, there’s a lot of “it depends”. Both on how many years you have to retirement and what your expectations are.
ETFs can target different market caps, and different growth potential. They can target overseas investment (e.g., Asian sector stocks), or areas of the market, all like mutual funds do.

An S&P 500 ETF is a good baseline if you invest in only one. But my advisor keeps me in multiple ETFs to diversify as well as balance risk."

No, you are just a simple investor--like me--who has no idea what is going to happen in the market.

This helps protect against volatility In unstable markets. It’s all about your risk tolerance. As I tell my friends who are new to investing in the markets, you need to decide how much of a risk you want to take. And usually this depends on your personal perspective and what you want to use that money for. If it’s for retirement and you’re 22, that’s a much different position than someone who’s 65. If it’s a down payment on a house vs. a boat or just extra cash, you get the idea. We all have our tolerance for risk and like anything it’s a personal decision where higher risks equal higher rewards (or losses).

2021-06-20 05:54:21,stocks,"Expense ratio for MTUM is only .15%. .75% for ARKK isn't that huge if you expect significant outperformance, but I don't have confidence that the investment philosophy of that ETF and Cathy Wood will continue to do as well as it has in the past couple years."
2021-06-20 13:37:36,stocks,"Not OP, but I would be more conservative with international companies. You need to research if the companies in the ETF are in stable countries that conform to IFRS accounting standards. if you can’t trust the government where the company is incorporated or you can’t trust the books - you're exposing yourself to massive risk - thats not diversification at all. 

You’ve said you’re new, so before you jump in the deep end give yourself time to learn and research. If you’re in your 20s still, or unmarried / no kids 30s (ergo you are ok with high risk / high reward still), just go 100% equities with 90% domestic and 10% international. Small and mid cap companies can and do grow much faster than large cap value companies. It’s easy to double from $100 M in revenue to $200 M. Much harder to double $10 B to $20 B. 

Fire and forget for a few years while you read and learn."

2021-06-19 20:39:38,stocks,Good job kid- are you hodl’ing w/ 💎 🙌 or are those “realized gains”
2021-06-19 22:19:47,stocks,One that is doing good for me is Avalon Bay. Do some research on it there is one that I'm going to add to my portfolio also mid america. Do your DD first before you decide. Now this is not a financial advise!
2021-06-20 12:34:05,stocks,"It doesn’t move much , stays around 22 . Just don’t buy it for growth . Only for the dividends ."
2021-06-19 22:07:09,stocks,"It really depends on how bullish you are, if you think the market will trade sideways then QYLD is a good option. Also I’d say a leveraged ETF is not a good long term investment, maybe for 6 months at most but they’ve been proven to underperform regular etfs over the long run."
2021-06-19 22:21:06,stocks,"This trading account is more focused on mid-term investing, like saving money to put a down payment on a house in my 30’s or to start a family type of thing. My Roth IRA is completely managed by a financial advisor that my parents had set up before I turned 18"
2021-06-20 09:25:47,stocks,"Great advice overall, but I gotta disagree with you on VCR- it’s old technology and I just don’t see it ever rebounding to its glory days. I’d recommend DVD instead."

2021-06-20 14:42:39,stocks,If VTI is mid and small is VOO large cap?
2021-06-20 12:19:23,stocks,"Right but a lot of that in euros too which are pretty well connected to the dollar. I would specifically look at Japanese, Russian ,and Chinese markets maybe?"
2021-06-20 16:13:26,stocks,From the limited research I’ve done just not great returns. If someone could prove me wrong please do.
2021-06-20 16:30:36,stocks,Where is the best place to learn about indexes?
2021-06-20 16:38:31,stocks,That's only a point if you assume EM will out perform though.
2021-06-19 21:14:11,stocks,i was under the impression that they didnt cover all the same stocks based on the fact that the number of holdings for VT is less than VTI+VEA+VWO. I could easily be missing something though.
2021-06-19 23:44:36,stocks,"**D**ividend **R**e**I**nvestment **P**lan.

Brokers will let you automatically reinvest dividends back into whatever stock, etf or bond that generated them.

It's the stocks version of compounding interest.

My problem with DRIP is that if stock X gives a dividend, it is automatically reinvested in X and no other stock, and only at the price X is currently at the time of the dividend.

So you can't hold the divvy and wait til X goes down, nor can you use X divvy to boost another position.

Therefor I have automatic dividend reinvestment turned off. In the past, DRIP was used to reinvest dividends or interest without leading to a brokerage fee for purchasing a stock and also without needing the capital to spend for 1 full share.

With today's zero-fee brokerages, and zero-fee fractional stock trading, I see no reason to use DRIP any more. I just sit on dividends until I have a good use for them."
2021-06-19 21:04:47,stocks,"I have multiple accounts, one is just VTI/VXUS/BND, another account is my solo picks, another account is just a.. well sometimes when I talk to my mom she says things like ""I love this (product) I should invest in them!"" but she'll never invest, so I note when she does that and throw some money into it. It's Mom's Picks and when she retires officially I'll give all of it to her.

My solo stocks account is all silly nonsense and currently it's all Credit Suisse ETN because I want to see what all the hype is about.

VTI/VXUS and BND has exposure to something stupid like 16,000 total stocks and bonds so I feel covered there. 

My solo account is for when I see potential to capitalize, ride profits and dump. Like, I bought in Ford at $11 with a sell limit of $16 - it hit $16, I made money, and the stock went back down to $14."
2021-06-20 13:46:48,stocks,"It was red for S&P 500 and commodities. Biden gave a speech, and any time an American president gives a speech the stock market goes down. it's voodoo but historically a real thing.

Follow that up with Powell giving a consortium talk about the Fed raising rates, and the stock market tanks even deeper.

If you've spread out enough then you wouldn't see a huge effect on your own brokerage, but people with *only* VOO or *only* VFINX or whatever, without a hedge internationally or bonds, would have seen a slaughtering."
2021-06-20 14:02:48,stocks,"Thanks for the lead! I'll do some dd on it. Generally I'd think the world is going to get flatter (optimistic I know), so the right ETF may be a good bet even with the expense ratio.


Edit: found this summary statement, this is exactly what I was looking for: ""EMFM seeks to improve upon traditional emerging market funds by excluding the slower-growing BRICs, South Korea, and Taiwan, while including the high growth potential of frontier markets.""


Still a lot more poking around to do but props to cruian for putting me on."
2021-06-19 20:03:26,stocks,Spread it around like butter.
2021-06-20 13:49:08,stocks,Thanks for the advice!! 🙏🙏

2021-06-19 20:47:07,stocks,I think you already know the answer to that.
2021-06-19 22:23:08,stocks,Gotcha 👍
2021-06-19 22:44:32,stocks,How far in the future is that?
2021-06-20 18:20:45,stocks,lol good one
2021-06-20 13:44:57,stocks,"No it wouldn't. VTI + VXUS + BND, yes.

Over half of VT (by weight) is most of VTI already, you'd use VT to replace VTI + VXUS, it probably shouldn't be held in combination with either."
2021-06-20 19:37:43,stocks,"VOO is large cap but VTI includes large, mid and small caps. It’s weighted by market cap so a majority of VTI is actually Large caps as well."
2021-06-20 07:03:05,stocks,i would have 60% of my portfolio and 40% split between a couple other markets...maybe a few shares of certain companies if i thought they had good growth potential i.e 15% a year
2021-06-20 10:00:24,stocks,"That example has literally nothing to do with diversification, you're just stating the AM–GM inequality.

An expected return of 10% is an expected return of 10% regardless of the volatility of the time series, it's accounted for in the definition."
2021-06-20 12:39:13,stocks,No the EUR is not strongly correlated with the USD. The EUR is mostly influenced by the actions of the ECB.
2021-06-20 17:37:25,stocks,"/r/ETFs, /r/investing, /r/personalfinance, /r/Bogleheads are a few suggestions."
2021-06-20 16:43:43,stocks,"If you buy VT; you get roughly 55% US, 40% foreign developed and 5% foreign emerging.  Having the benefit to tweak the ratios between those 3 to you current preferences has value."
2021-06-20 10:31:13,stocks,"They don't cover all the same stocks, but the difference in the number of holdings is mostly due to the fact that VTI tracks a CRSP index and VT/VXUS track an FTSE index."
2021-06-20 00:30:41,stocks,I haven't had much experience with this. Does it mean they lower your cost average overtime and keep the same # shares? or automatically accumulate over time with dividends?
2021-06-19 21:09:12,stocks,Interesting.  I asked because I have the same etfs along with SCHD and Jepi.  But I threw in a few reits and utilities and then the fun stuff….like Ford I jumped on from 12 to 14.  :).  Random stuff I’ll hold for a day week or whatever works out.  That keeps it fun for me
2021-06-20 03:14:07,stocks,The Mom's Picks account is the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
2021-06-19 20:00:17,stocks,"I'd argue the lack of complexity in smaller securities markets means they are *less* susceptible to hidden rigging. For one, I don't think they could sustain the kind of dark pools that the head of the NYSE recently discussed."
2021-06-19 20:53:01,stocks,"So by the time it becomes a long-term investment and costs you far less in capital gains tax, it’s going to be your “capital loss carry over” for the rest of your life 🤣🤣"
2021-06-19 22:49:33,stocks,About 10-15 years from now
2021-06-20 01:48:41,stocks,BRK does not pay dividends. That’s something to consider.
2021-06-20 18:29:42,stocks,Yes but it bears pointing out that the less variation in your average return the better your compounded return. For that reason alone if you view several ETFs as equal you would actually be better of investing equally in all of them instead of just buying one.
2021-06-20 12:41:28,stocks,Interesting. Isn’t the ECB practicing the same super loose monetary policy as the US though?
2021-06-20 17:52:17,stocks,🙏🙏🙏
2021-06-20 16:52:58,stocks,"I don't disagree, but 99% of people would have no clue how to do that. At that point I would make an argument to own all 4. Let VT serve as the core holding and tweak the other 3 to get more/less weight in those areas. In the end I believe it's more beneficial to balance between asset class vs tearing your hair out perfecting your equities only weights"
2021-06-20 00:40:49,stocks,"They automatically accumulate over time. It's like compounding interest.

Imagine you hold Stock X, and it pays $1.25 per share in dividends. With DRIP, if you hold 10 shares of Stock X, they will automatically use your $12.50 dividend to buy $12.50 more of Stock X as soon as the dividend is paid out.

Then you have 10 stock X + $12.50, which will factor in to the next time your stock pays out a dividend.

Then you take your Stock X plus Y and make a dividend, then the Y is factored back into the stock. It stacks and stacks and stacks."
2021-06-19 21:17:20,stocks,"Samesies! I have SCHD, JEPI and VIG/VYM on my ""consideration table"" when I finish running my Credit Suisse bidness.

SLVO has a 30% dividend, USOI has 21%, GLDI is 14% and REML is 11%. I'm riding these to see how long I can actually pull divvies if/before they get delisted, then putting the profits all into one or more of the above mentioned divvy stocks.

ETNs are like the Fallout New Vegas of investing, it's a wild wasteland where nothing makes sense but I can make a lot of caps. I could also lose everything overnight.

It's why I have separate accounts for my degenerate nonsense and my Vanguard stuff. I don't want my wildly-swinging doofus choices to affect the percentages of my main investments."
2021-06-20 13:50:26,stocks,"It started when we were having a conversation about savings and I brought up how investing has a higher rate of return than a savings account. She decided to give me $100 a month to split between CARZ and BJK because she likes cars and blackjack/casinos.

On top of that I've been adding my own money to buy stocks in things she likes and/or talks about a lot.

She's about 10 years off from retirement so it'll be a nice gift when her $12,000 investment is a gang of money more than she expects."
2021-06-20 16:05:03,stocks,Don’t base your life’s worth off of downvotes and upvotes. They are like taxes and they are inevitable
2021-06-19 20:35:32,stocks,"If a market is small enough, you could manipulate them openly and get away with it in the short term. 

But any market open to global institutional investors such as Vanguard or Blackrock offering mainstream investment products will have enough stability already to, in the long run, make companies tend to valuations based on fundamentals. Remember, with ETFs, we're talking not about day trading, but long-term value growth. This is why the existence or lack thereof of any such OTC liquidity pools is irrelevant to individual investors into ETFs."
2021-06-20 00:51:57,stocks,Somebody mad they missed the ship? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 dont be mad meme stock portfolios looking better than yours YTD 🤣
2021-06-19 22:59:18,stocks,"Yeah dude I would go VT or QQQ or something and get that long term equity market exposure, I wouldn’t be dicking around with covered call ETFs"
2021-06-19 23:35:57,stocks,Berkshire does not have an expense ratio
2021-06-19 22:03:09,stocks,What expense ratio? It's not like Berkshire is an ETF.
2021-06-19 21:59:19,stocks,Berkshire has an expense ratio?
2021-06-19 22:21:06,stocks,I believe in Buffet more than I do in AAPL...
2021-06-20 06:27:24,stocks,"It's roughly 20%. Berkshire is much, much more than just its investment portfolio.."
2021-06-19 20:08:56,stocks,"Partially what the person above me said, for me that account is with Fidelity(partial shares) and it's a set it and forget it account that I plan to hold for years vs my active accounts which I trade frequently. The benefit of BRK.B for me is simple growth with exposure to unlisted stocks. The returns tend to be a bit less than some of the other ETFs, but growth is consistent and as I said above it can be a bit of an anomaly compared to other ETFs, which helps me throw whatever $ I deposit from that check into the ""best deal""

Edit: typo"
2021-06-20 03:03:30,stocks,"This sub is the blind leading the blind, being upvoted by the blind.  Buy Berkshire and you are basically getting Apple, Insurance + consumer cyclicals/economically sensitive companies.  It is an Apple heavy ETF WITHOUT fees associated with ETF's, because Berkshire is a company."
2021-06-20 03:15:00,stocks,"Yea, at the moment my long term is really focused on pure growth, not dividends. The dividends on most of the ETFs doesn't compare to just plain dividend stocks from what I saw anyway, different ballgame. TBH I just got into actively trading a lot this year, and put a lot more money into those accounts. In doing that I felt it was responsible to also put money into a long term account also that I can touch earlier without penalties like my 401Ks. That long term account performs way worse than me actively trading in my other accounts(mostly wheeling options) so it was kind of just an afterthought yet/responsible safety net."
2021-06-20 17:09:04,stocks,"Because Buffett and Munger can probably get better returns than you do, and if you want to pull out some money you can just sell shares."
2021-06-20 13:03:25,stocks,"In terms of pandemic recovery, somewhat yes. Historically? Not really. Look post financial crisis, grexit etc"
2021-06-19 21:47:34,stocks,"Specifically in regard to ETFs, yes absolutely. I didn't clarify but meant in terms of day trading - and precisely because what would occur would be short-term instead of long-term manipulation. With smaller market caps, as I understand it, manipulation would tend to be much more noticeable and therefore unsustainable."
2021-06-20 03:10:47,stocks,"I’m not mad that my investments have made me between 10-18% consistently over the last 12 years… you’re caught in a “get rich quick” scheme, but you’re not the one that’s going to stay rich.  I on the other hand, will retire at 45 and only work if I get sick of traveling with my wife/family (not likely)"
2021-06-19 23:17:51,stocks,"I’m kinda stuck between VT and VTI, however I think I will be adding to VUG"
2021-06-19 23:46:18,stocks,Royalty fees
2021-06-19 22:12:16,stocks,Royalty fees. Same difference at the end of the day
2021-06-19 23:47:55,stocks,"What happens if you decide that you don't like BRK.B in the next 5 or 10 years?  You're basically buying an actively managed fund, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that the managers will start making decisions you aren't happy about."
2021-06-20 13:26:46,stocks,Never let the tax tail wag the investment dog.
2021-06-19 22:23:56,stocks,Yes but 45% of your belief is in $AAPL either way. You could match the holdings and prevent the expense
2021-06-20 01:59:49,stocks,Which one will be around longer?
2021-06-20 06:42:47,stocks,"I encourage you to go check some comparisons on yahoo finance, until 2015ish BRKB outperformed VTI and VOO(everyone's favorite ETFs), those ETFs also are by no means leaving BRK in the dust now either.. They have an unparalleled track record, up almost 1000% since inception in 93 I believe. It is basically the safest growth place you can put your money, again I'll use the phrase ""set it and forget it"". They might not see the same returns as others during big run ups, but they also won't dive off a cliff(looking at you Cathy woods)."
2021-06-20 03:38:56,stocks,I think you got it all wrong buddy lmaoo I can easily sell on the way down and have a % gain greater than what you will get in 10 years 🥱
2021-06-19 23:20:30,stocks,"VT is set it and forget it - you own the entire world market in proportion to it’s weight. VUG is good too, higher expected return but more volatile (which is ok for your time horizon)."
2021-06-20 17:07:12,stocks,"An hour before you posted this I explained that Berkshire's royalty fees are extra earnings for BRK holders, paid by Berkshire realtor franchisees. They are not equivalent to expense ratios."
2021-06-19 22:25:54,stocks,"I just googled that and it appears to be a fee charged to their real estate franchisees, so it's actually extra earnings for BRK owners. It's not something that reduces the AAPL earnings of BRK owners."
2021-06-20 02:42:53,stocks,"> so it's not out of the realm of possibility that the managers will start making decisions you aren't happy about.

It's a given. I'll give you my portfolio if Warren is still alive in 20 years."

2021-06-20 10:30:17,stocks,"Was this in some way a response to what I said? I am very familiar with Berkshire and have held it in the past.  It's just not an etf, that was the point.  Berkshire buys companies and someone from Berkshire sits on the board."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Anybody have experience with stock alert apps? Im new to stocks and dont know too much about them but im wanting to learn. Ive been seeing some ads about alert apps that send you a notification on stocks that are predicted to have good returns. Like i said im wanting to learn so if these actually work i think itd help me in doing so. Only reason i havnt already trued them is because on almost all of them they have $100+ monthly memberships which is a lot to just try something out. Or is there any other thing like this that someone could recommend me to try? Would really appreciate the advice

Edit: not looking for someone to tell me what to invest in. Im a very hands on learner so being able to look at a stock thats predicted to go up i can read into that company and figure out kinda what caused it if that makes any sense. Thats the reason i was curious about those apps cause if i can see it grow from the third person ill kinda know more what to look for when i read into a different one"
2021-06-19 21:37:19,stocks,I use my stock portfolio from google store to manually log my investments and alert me at target prices as well as sudden drops and increases. Been using for a year or so. Happy with it.
2021-06-20 08:11:17,stocks,"Those things are scams mostly. First you pay them money and then you pump up the price of stocks they already bought before.

Sounds like you are a beginner. Stick with broad etfs for now. Small part can be stocks as a hobby, good way to learn. When you have gotten some experience and knowdlegde start dabbling with individual stocks some more."

any idea how to decide weather I should invest right now or DCA over the next few months (on top to my dca plan which is running monthly anyway)?
Anyone here hase some good links or arguments that help me with maki g a profound decision?

Lots of tech stocks like DocuSign have gone up exponentially in the last 2 weeks. They’re up like 40% and have an RSI at almost 80. I believe the increase is way too high and way too fast. A correction would actually be healthy for some growth. I’d prefer to see steady growth like 1-2% up daily, but I still have a feeling that tech will go down a little next week for the short term.

2021-06-20 00:00:00,stocks,"SABR and MEOH: my off-the-beaten-path Reopening plays tl;dr - SABR is a hybrid travel-tech play, fully diversified across all components of global travel. MEOH is the global leader in methanol production - a market which is approximately half associated with fuel and energy and half specialty chemicals and polymers. I think both are pretty attractive from a risk-reward standpoint and are both going to outperform the broader markets over the next year or two. 

Full justification for this assessment below. Curious what your thoughts are, or if you have any other ideas for underappreciated reopening plays. 

=======================================

# SABR

The company does everything in travel from helping the internal operations (operating software, management of flight crews and hotel staffs) to airport operations to powering the search engines and pricing of sites like Kayak as well as individual rental car/airline/cruise line companies around the world. Its exposure to all industries and markets compartmentalizes the impact from things like India's massive COVID outbreak or the fact that cruise ships remain docked. 

The company is currently trading at about [75% of its pre-COVID market cap](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SABR/sabre/market-cap), while generating only about a third of its pre-COVID revenue, so it's seeing some elevated price multiples right now, as are most (all?) reopening and travel plays. I don't think that means it's over-valued, I just think that means that 12 or 30 months from now, when global travel finally returns to something resembling the Before Times, revenue will triple from current levels while market cap only goes up another 40-50 percent. (That's still 40-50 percent upside in a relatively short time frame, if you're comparing it to when the S&P will break 6K or the Nasdaq will top 20K.)

However, I think we're in a bit of a sweet spot at this point of the spring/summer. The share price took a hit after first quarter earnings as the company still declined to offer forward guidance, but we've seen some massive travel this spring. As numbers start to come in showing travel starting to rebound, SABR's share price will rebound as well.

# MEOH

For details about applications of methanol, read pages 6 thru 8 of [this](https://www.methanex.com/sites/default/files/investor/annual-reports/Revised%202020%20Methanex%20Annual%20Report.pdf), or google ""[applications of methanol](https://www.google.com/search?q=applications+of+methanol&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS904US904&oq=applications+of+methanol&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l9.3458j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)"" and knock yourself out. 

One characteristic of this stage of COVID recovery is the severe imbalance between supply and demand, which we're seeing in things like the housing market, lumber, oil, or even ketchup. Methanol is in a similar situation. 

In fact, from a global commodity perspective, the price per ton of methanol has [already recovered](https://www.methanol.org/methanol-price-supply-demand/) \- not just to pre-COVID levels, but to its mid-2018 peak. However, demand still hasn't finished returning to pre-pandemic levels, which means that when it does, global methanol prices are likely to see all-time highs, well above what we see today. 

MEOH's financial performance reflected this in its first quarter results - its first quarter top line revenue of just over $1bn was among its top three quarters since 2011, topped only by 2018. 

Another interesting point: in mid-2018, the last time methanol prices were this high, and the last time MEOH generated revenue like it's doing now, [MEOH's market cap](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MEOH/methanex/market-cap) topped out at over $6.5 billion. As of yesterday, it was sitting at only $2.5 billion. Despite generating massive revenue with an outlook that only points uphill, the stock is trading at pretty low price multiples, historically speaking. 

Disclosure: 75 shares @ 27.29, will continue to add while the share price remains below $35."

My son has a 15y old computer with new SSD and max processor for the mainboard and plays all games on Nvidia Webserver.

Whose pockets does the money come from?

So, OK, back to the original point. Yes, you made 17 cents, then.

If you make only small trades, perhaps you will come out ahead trading “commission free”, because you will avoid minimum commission charges. You will on average get poorer fills, but probably the slippage will be less than the commissions would be."

Nobody should be locked in to a mistaken trade or fail to take a profit by worrying about the Pattern Day Trader rule."
2021-06-19 21:48:43,stocks,"FINRA regulates all the brokers and it's their rule.

If you do it 4 times in 5 consecutive business days they won't let you do it (buy and sell one stock) the next day, and if you do they'll lock you out of buying anything for 90 days. You'll get to close your positions.

You probably shouldn't be planning to trade in and out in a day. You should be looking for things that will grow for years, rather than using the market as a casino.

But if you want to use it as a casino, all you have to do is put 25k cash in your account, and make sure at least 25k cash is in your account at the end of *every* day. Then they let you use 4X leverage (borrowed money) instead of the usual 2X.

There's another exception and that's using a Cash Account, where you have no ability to use borrowed money. Since you never risk any of the firm's money, you can day-trade yours all you want.

But you still have to follow the settlement rules, which say that when you sell a stock the person buying it effectively has two days to deliver the cash. The broker will let you buy again immediately, but then you can't sell until that cash is settled, and it *always* takes the full two days (really two nights; if you sell on a Monday you can sell on Wednesday). If you sell then buy with unsettled cash then sell before it's settled, that's called ""free-riding."" You get *one* ""good-faith"" violation of that assuming you're a n00b and don't know the rule. The second one, no matter how long it's been since the first, locks you out of even buying with unsettled cash. When you sell you have to wait two days to use the proceeds for anything."

2021-06-20 07:24:09,stocks,"So you’re telling me that 10% are getting in on every trade? Because a quick look at the dumpster fire that WSB has become shows people going in on CLOV, WISH, AMC, GME,BB, CLF, W,etc. So 10% of the forum jumps into each one of these and puts $10k….. while half of the people can’t even understand an option chain or afford one. 

you sir are one gullible individual. WSB is just a bunch of bots setup by Reddit to increase the companies valuation before IPO. The sub has 2-3 million real members half of which live at home with parents.

They can afford to drop $10k-> 4-5x a week"

Similar thing can be found with most of those other tickers that week if you track sentiment (google wsb sentiment trackews)

Maybe it's no 10% with 10k each, but it's enough to cause gamma/short squeezes. It worked for those tickets that week, until it fizzeled out because there became too many tickers (the apes got distracted/dispersed)"

Not sure if this is correct."
2021-06-20 00:28:24,stocks,"Two things: 1.) Rising rates: Banks primarily earning money through spreads in interest rates.  As market rates rise, they earn more money as spreads can widen aka a bigger profit margin. 2.) economic growth means more demand for loans."
2021-06-20 00:47:44,stocks,"The short answer is gold is both a commodity and a currency cum store of value, the people that buy, sell and hedge it can do so for reasons of supply and demand( industrial users) or due to reasons of fear and greed (investors)...

This dual property makes gold pretty uncorrelated with any other asset class, and extremely unpredictable, even for experts. Being so uncorrelated with anything else in itself makes it useful in an investment portfolio, but if you are looking to gold as something to make you rich, i suggest looking elsewhere.

The strongest correlation that gold has is real rates (10 year nominal yield minus current CPI). In the last 2 months we've seen it increase by about 200 dollars in response to high CPI prints. Gold is not what you buy to guard against inflation, you need inflation AND low yields on the  US10 year bond.

The recent 100 dollar drop on thurs took everyone by surprise, even experts. We will have to wait and see if gold resumes its upward trend in the next couple of weeks."
2021-06-19 20:41:31,stocks,Ppl have been buying less and less gold and silver and buying into cripto

2021-06-20 08:48:42,stocks,"I agree with Buffet for the long term but in the short term, I think gold is a great hedge against inflation.  I bought gold in 2018 before the midterm elections when it was $1260 an ounce.  My goal is to sell when it hits $2,000 an ounce.  I will retain a few ounces just because I don't trust the dollar."
2021-06-20 12:32:03,stocks,"Inflation is not on the rise. It is already happening. When inflation metrics go up they are not measuring what is going to happen in the future. They are measuring what happened in the past. Gold is an inflation hedge and if you look at its prices over the past year you will see it did go up. 

As for interest rates, again the market is forward looking. Back in March last year the Fed was saying they will hold interest rates at 0 for a long long time. If bond investors can’t find yields in bonds then they will look for an asset that at least has a chance at growing its principal and that’s gold. Right now the Fed is signaling that rates will go back up sooner than expected and who knows if you get stronger inflation prints in the coming months maybe they’ll move up the schedule more. That means bond yields may get attractive again and gold less so."
2021-06-20 14:15:52,stocks,"What I don't understand, and maybe cause I'm an idiot, is why everyone says the threat of inflation would/will hurt the stock market and make buying things like gold a good hedge. Shouldn't inflation just inflate the price of everything INCLUDING STOCKS? After-all stocks are (at least in theory) tied to the value of companies who offer a product or service, if the price of the product or service goes up with inflation then revenue goes up and so to should the price of the stock right? What am I missing here?"
2021-06-20 16:44:40,stocks,"I've learned to ignore the whole inflation>gold price influx logic. Silver hit a peak around 2010-2012 at nearly 40 an ounce and gold was like 2500 an ounce and the economy was pretty good. Big return from 2008 recession, inflation wasn't doomsday like as it is now, but prices were at their peak.

Right before the great depression gold prices hit a record number, but didnt go up further when inflation exploded, so it's not a clear cut causality."
2021-06-20 17:18:26,stocks,Because gold has always had almost 0 near term correlation to hedge inflation. It hedges inflation usually in time periods longer than like 20 or so years

2021-06-20 14:23:02,stocks,"That's a real good question. I'm not sure if got the answer. I think it has to do with the value of the currency it is tied to. Also, I think the question is more would I own bond (guaranteed return) vs gold when I don't really want to put my money in the market? Gold also has the value of being easy to get money for so you can sell it anytime and it's still going to be worth something. It's a nice to have when you want to have cash but not let it sit doing nothing IMO."
2021-06-19 20:00:40,stocks,That was beautifully written. Kudos to you! 🍻

2021-06-19 21:05:11,stocks,"Thank you for this way to look at my gold stocks.  You are so right, I wouldn't buy gold today and I need to go forward and not look back.  Also, I don't want to wait for years.  I've held onto gold stocks for way to long."
2021-06-20 00:20:39,stocks,Diamonds are a whole different ball game.  Diamonds can be synthesized and are extremely common being made from one of the most common substances on earth.  Gold on the other hand has a lot of uses and is actually quite rare.  Silver has much more uses and is much more rare than people credit it to.  Silver is under valued.

You're definitely wrong that the gold is from the past when we were on the gold standard. Lots of central banks have been buying since after the great financial crisis. Gold reserves have grown a lot since then. You seem upset or like this is some kind of competition or something. I'm just here to learn my friend"
2021-06-20 00:15:23,stocks,"Demand in industry is limited because the price is too high. You are arguing that the demand is inelastic. The counter argument is that there would be many more uses for gold if it were a cheaper metal, so it's not like the value would fall off a cliff if central banks stopped collecting gold. Lower prices would drive more industrial demand. (I'm no OP, but just fleshing out the point, I don't have an opinion either way),"
2021-06-20 04:42:35,stocks,"Sure. I definitely get that. I don't disagree with that one bit.

2021-06-19 20:44:21,stocks,">to bet on inflation would be to suggest that the trend then would reverse and go upward at a greater rate than we have seen in the past few months.

If prices remain at elevated levels, that signifies persistent inflation.  

>we discussed early there is no normal price level since prices always trend upward

There's no normal price but there is a typical price channel that tracks with inflation along with supply and demand.

>So prices remaining elevated does not equal inflation.

Agree to disagree."
2021-06-19 21:45:09,stocks,"Helpful, 

but 

if you are trying to own the underlying, then selling a put to reduce cost basis isn’t necessarily a bad play.

.HOWEVER, if you expire in the money, you will have to cover… pay out the cost to cover 100 shares. But if you want to own it in the first place, that’s not a problem. Not financial advice I’m more a noob then the original poster."

Buy companies you believe in. Believe in companies based on tangible financial numbers, and realistic outcomes of future goals (not graphs and trend lines). Hold them for months or (preferrably for US tax purposes) years at a time. That’s how you win in the stock market.

If you think you can predict anything in the market, just know that there are many groups of people with more money than you that will exploit your belief in whatever trend you see to profit off of you."
2021-06-20 09:41:51,stocks,"i think it’s easy to just look at valuations and PEs or forward PEs

the market decides on a PE and everything goes to that

So a market average PE of 30 might not look as attractive as a Bond returning 3%

Hell, find a privately traded competitor that I can't invest in and show them to me.

I would honestly like to be proven wrong, because I don't think another such company exists. If it does, my bullishness on EGLX would decline significantly. So please back up your comments and find me a true comparable.

If you can find a handful (or ""dozens"") of competitors who meet those criteria, I will sell all my EGLX stocks next week.

Imagine a company that can target gamers where they spend their time, across different mediums, regardless of what kind of game or platform they're using. That's quite powerful. If you'd like to market your company towards those gamers, you might consider reaching out to Enthusiast gaming too.I believe Enthusiast is on their way. But obviously we're at the beginning of their journey. They're currently loosing money. On the other hand they're working hard on brand awareness and sales. They're not a value company at this point. :)"

I’ve done that every time SPY has a good dip  over the last year and profited well most of the time. It’s all house money at this point since I’m up around 30k doing that. If I lose a few grand on next week’s calls, so be it. If it rebounds back to $415 or higher, which isn’t unrealistic, I will be looking at close to 100% returns on my weeklies so I’ll get out of those and possibly even my July calls if it a big enough spike on Monday. If it continues going down, my Monday calls will be worthless, Wednesday and Friday calls might sell for a few hundred combined, and I’ll try to hold the July calls for a week or two to see if it recovers enough."

Is it possible that 2/3rds of the money in this story is JPM's?"
2021-06-19 22:41:29,stocks,"Banks pay interest to depositors regardless of what they do with the money.

What they want to do with the money is lend it to home buyers and businesses so they can collect long-term compound interest on it.

The reverse repo agreement deposits money with the Fed overnight at virtually nil interest. It means banks are stuck with a ton of cash and nobody to lend it to, at least for a day.

The interesting effect is that it undoes a big chunk of QE. In QE the Fed bought a lot of debt paper to put more cash in banks' hands, but the reverse repo deposits mean the banks are placing cash in the Fed's hands.

What all this suggests is that at least temporarily there's too much money and the Fed should tighten the money supply somewhat. Unless they know why it's built up and when it's going to resolve itself."

In general I don't regret the purchase but I would have delayed it until the Silicon chips were more functional if I knew that using so many workarounds to get basic functions that I need quickly becomes annoying (Non-USB C support needs a dock/dongle, dual monitors needs DisplayLink plus a specific dock ($95 used vs $170 new for mine), I have to use Parallels ($79) for anything I require Windows for)."

On the other hand, some of those who already own NVDA will sell off some of there shares to take profit, holding onto some of them for longer term gains. More sellers means the price goes down.

No one knows when.  All I can say for sure is there have been progressively increasing red flags.  Mainstream media is starting to pick up on early warning signs now.  People like Michael Burry are starting to warn.

One thing I will say that a lot of us failed to realize back in the 2008 crash - don't underestimate the power of the gov and central banks to manipulate the market.  There are lots of tricks up their sleeves that they can use to delay or bring to an early end a market collapse.  Congress isn't passing these trillion dollar rescue bills for fun.... trillions of dollars can buy you a lot of time.

At the same time, you have to ask yourself how much confidence you have in our leaders.  Are our current leaders the people you believe have the economic skill to delay/recover effectively from a total market collapse?  

If the answer to that question is NO, then expect a crash as early as this year and lasting as long as five years.  If these trillions of dollars and other policy decisions fail, it will be catastrophic because they will essentially have wasted their only hope of bettering this situation.

If the answer to that question is YES, then it would be realistic for a crash to be delayed to sometime in 2022 and perhaps even as late as early 2023.  The crash could be short-lived and maybe largely over in a year.  This assumes our leaders are competent and execute monetary and fiscal policy as well as bail out measures in a skillful manner."

Some other guy was going on about heavily shorting FB about a month ago and I told him not to...stock went up like 50 points since then. I presume you understand what they are doing in the crypto space and the VR space. I also presume you understand IG and WA are not even close to being fully monetized yet. They will go down 10 points and you will get excited and then it'll shoot up 20. I see them at $900 in 7-8 years. They will pivot on this ad thing and you should not pigeon-hole them as a social media company or ad company. They are developing an extremely diversified revenue stream. You could be right over the next few months, which I guess is what you would need for your puts, but I would not bank on that. Long term though I guarantee they go way up. If it goes back to 280 (which I doubt), I will add more."

Their stock recommendations, which as far as I'm aware don't even use fundamental analysis and therefore aren't relevant to this conversation at all, are about as respected as Yahoo Finance's. Have you ever heard of Fidelity upgrading/downgrading a stock making the news before?

2. I'm not so certain the Gamestop CEO even was two rungs from the top; he doesn't show up [in this org chart from March](https://research-methodology.net/amazon-organizational-structure-2-2/) at all and he was definitely somewhere in Jeff Wilke's team. But moving up two rungs is 100% a massive promotion. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to move up once you're at that sort of level? I'll give you a hint: there is one CEO and probably at least a hundred people who report to people who report to the CEO. Oh, and smaller companies are perfectly capable of poaching FAANG directors without making them CEO. They just have to be well-respected and rapidly growing. Okta, Crowdstrike, Uber, Palantir, etc are all examples of this.

3. Jesus Christ. I didn't *lie*, I looked at numbers that were a couple years old. It's over a billion now, but as we discussed Amazon is growing rapidly and I didn't realize the first search result on google was dated. It's still a massive promotion.

4. You never provided a source to this so I ignored it. According to [Gamestop's website](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/fundamentals/balance-sheet) they have just north of 500 million in cash and 363 million in debt. 

5. Why would I respond to this? It's completely irrelevant to the conversation. My comment about how you should just invest in Amazon instead was obviously tongue in cheek, and if you were focused on having an actual discussion rather than trying to one up me you would've dropped this.

Have the last word if you'd like, but I have nothing to gain or learn from continuing this conversation any further.

**EDIT:** Oh, and of Amazon's billion dollar revenue from Australia, [only 511 million](https://powerretail.com.au/news/amazon-smashes-1-billion-revenue-mark-in-australia/) came from Amazon's e-commerce platform. Not sure where the rest came up (and too lazy to do a deep dive) but it's unlikely to me that the Gamestop CEO was responsible for it."

2021-06-20 14:33:01,stocks,"Seems like a great way to kill it by trying to move away from what makes it successful. The service has huge recognition as it stands today. Lean into its strong points, embrace it, and grow it from there. Sex sells and there's plenty of directions they can take it, especially in the future as VR improves. I'm a strong believer in virtual reality and once you throw sex into the mix, it's going to turn into a money printer. How bad it could potentially be for people's psyches is another discussion. 

If they want to promote non-sexual content they could create another service that runs side-by-side and use what they learned so far there. Imagine one service for the more adult material and one for the more artistic and day to day content. There will be a lot of people subscribing to both pages of their favorites, just like those who now subscribe to a streamer's actual stream and also their onlyfans. There's plenty of money do be made in the space."
2021-06-19 22:57:22,stocks,"That’s exactly why I like CLOV. Not for the possible short squeeze, which will drive the price up and straight back down, but for the long term opportunity using technology to help improve patient care. The long term opportunity is much more attractive to me than the short term potential squeeze."
2021-06-20 12:59:26,stocks,"Thanks, but I was a chicken with NVDA.  You held on and deserve the rewards.  If I didn't sell at $300 I bet I would have at $400. 

The lesson is long term holding can pay off.  

I talked to my doctor a few days again and he complained that the stick market was a rip off. He decided to get in last year and proceeded to lose 90k.  I told him he shouldn't have been trying to outsmart everyone and trade everyday.  I tripled my portfolio over the last year by doing DD, making a few smart buys and sells, and holding onto things.  
I guess I should add that I'm an investor, not a trader."

2021-06-20 13:25:24,stocks,I might be uninformed. I’d rather be correct than win the argument. Do you know what I could look up to learn more about it? That was just my understanding based on Econ but I obviously could have just understood incorrectly
2021-06-20 19:46:33,stocks,"I’m not sure what type of investor you are,
But wouldn’t the technical analysis be enough for a swing trade?

Edit: speaking of crappy products. People will literally buy shit all the time throughout history. I also have higher standards for myself but I think if their numbers are true, the business model speaks for itself in the long run"
2021-06-20 15:14:02,stocks,"It is a potential short squeeze because of the following:15% of the float is shorted and 5 days to cover according to [stockgrid.io](https://stockgrid.io). This means the short interest is 5 times the daily volume and it may take upto 5 days for all short sellers to cover their positions. However they do not need to and generally do not all cover at the same time.47.62% borrow fee according to [fintel.io](https://fintel.io). That means short seller have to pay the lenders 47.62% of the market price per year as a fee to maintain their short position.

I have a long and cash secured put position in the stock."

2021-06-20 14:34:46,stocks,"As someone who is buying a car before the end of the year, and was considering a civic, I can confirm civic buyers will consider this truck instead.  I will probably get a Maverick with a bed cover to give me a weather protected ""trunk"" most of the time, but will have the truck bed for the few times a year I need it (I usually rent the Home Depot truck a couple of times of year for home projects, etc.).  The civic really has no advantage over this setup, other than possibly long term reliability.  The Maverick hybrid will get better mileage, with similar passenger room and more cargo space at a similar price.  Not to mention the ability to pull a small u-haul trailer if needed."

2021-06-20 16:27:04,stocks,"My portfolios up in the last 2 weeks.

Selling is not the way to go as you can't time the market.

 Buying more shares at a discount in the dips is the way to play it this is because most of the markets best days come within 2 weeks of a bad day and if you miss the good days you may as well not play in the stock market.

So when are you buying back in ?"
2021-06-20 16:55:17,stocks,"My portfolio is still up 0.2% in the past week, so I’m glad I didn’t listen to you."
2021-06-20 16:41:29,stocks,"I day traded on Friday, bought Dal and BRK after their initial drop, made 1% on Dal and .5% on BRK, 
Going to buy back in properly next week, will use 1/5 of my capital each day for entire week, 
If it keeps dropping after next week and I m out of capital well then so be it.. at least I missed the initial drop by luck and guess work"

2021-06-20 17:02:55,stocks,"I'm not knocking you're investing Style but you're setting you're self up to lose you may have timed the market this time if you can get back in that is but that's not possible to do every time.

we have all tried it and won the odd time but believe me it's not strategy Mr wonderful would use. 

You're plan to buy back in next week is also a bad plan you should look for a good buy point and bang 80% in then hold 20% in cash then if it drops a lot more buy more shares at a discount with the 20% cash.

2021-06-20 19:59:09,stocks,"Invest it and be patient.  It's really tough to commit $200K down on a home and next thing you know, prices start falling in a year or so. 

Other option is to buy in the not so desirable areas. Have you considered Hawthorne, Lawndale, Carson, Inglewood? There's certain areas that aren't the ideal neighborhood, but with gentrification, all those areas will likely be different by the end of the decade."
