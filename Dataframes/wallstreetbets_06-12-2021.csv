2021-06-12 19:32:33,wallstreetbets,"It's kind of hard to compare directly to competitors, since both Costco and target are bigger and still can grow. I think you're right in saying it's undervalued, though often times people don't care much if it's not growing. Looks like LOTS from 2018-2020 only grew in single digit percents. They expect to do more like 10-12% this year which is pretty cool.

The way I would take this is to watchlist it, pay attention to key technical levels and buy breakouts, or try to pick some up on a dip near the bottom of the channel for capital efficiency's sake. Decent financials so you could probably feel ok holding it. I just wouldn't want it to turd out flatly for months. Know that stocks can be undervalued for a LONG time before hedge funds start adding to them to their portfolios.

What I'm saying is being right but early is pretty much the same thing as being wrong when it spreads your capital thin."
2021-06-12 19:24:00,wallstreetbets,"stick to vbux, great ROI"
2021-06-12 19:30:52,wallstreetbets,Sounds pretty darn good

2021-06-12 19:32:07,wallstreetbets,Most shorted company. Inflation prices going up. Look at Nucor bro crazy…I would say this company is Atleast half in Nucor with 35B market cap. CLF should be At least 20B at these levels in market cap for this company.
2021-06-12 19:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s the ticker someone is now trying to pump, obviously."
2021-06-12 19:13:58,wallstreetbets,I like the ceo and how is transformed the company. It’s very under valued and those hedges who are shorting will be running out of gas soon. Now let’s FG 💎🙌🦍
2021-06-12 19:52:35,wallstreetbets,There you go this is what I am talking about CLf
2021-06-12 19:39:32,wallstreetbets,Yes 90 percent shares and 10 percent options.

2021-06-12 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,Don’t no but CLF is way undervalued and is moving for that reason. Why you wanna play earnings. Very risky

2021-06-12 19:35:07,wallstreetbets,I a fuking retard. I don’t know how to look up shit. But gonna try and see how good you are. Should I trust you and buy 6/18 call or should I go for July?
2021-06-12 19:54:51,wallstreetbets,How do you do fellow kids.
2021-06-12 19:50:32,wallstreetbets,Because CMC is totally under the radar and I think earnings will be that good.
2021-06-12 19:36:38,wallstreetbets,But 90% shares and 10 percent options. Shoot for end of July.

2021-06-12 19:40:54,wallstreetbets,"I am a gambler and I am looking for the home run, so I only do option. I will get some July call on Monday when the market open. Hopefully you are good. The last few I got from wsb has been shit."
2021-06-12 19:42:58,wallstreetbets,But try to buy in the money options. Plz don’t do out of the money as no one knows whether this is going to 30 or stay here for 1 week. Those premiums and IV crush is going to effect you.
2021-06-12 19:45:39,wallstreetbets,I like to buy 10-20% otm to get better return. Is that gonna work with this stonk?
2021-06-12 19:46:53,wallstreetbets,This is a big cap and kind of slow moving stonk. My opinion is get those 23 C for end of July.

2021-06-12 19:23:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks.  What will President Joey think about this and his contradicting message on Fossil Fuel?   It’s doomed. Maybe when the “mean Orange” man gets back in office.  It’s on my watch list.
2021-06-12 18:56:40,wallstreetbets,"An ETF is more r/investing than r/wsb, but [LIT is up 165% over the last year](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/lit/), just sayin'."
2021-06-12 19:14:58,wallstreetbets,1k shares 46 contracts. You can shout as much as you want but no on else listens. LAC is the only game in town for domestic lithium supply in the next decade. They’ll see it when it’s too late
2021-06-12 18:40:39,wallstreetbets,Doesn't $TSLA have a related company working on recycling batteries?
2021-06-12 19:10:35,wallstreetbets,I read it the project got delayed
2021-06-12 18:50:53,wallstreetbets,There is better solid state batteries being developed without lithium.
2021-06-12 18:57:37,wallstreetbets,Not much of a DD imo
2021-06-12 19:23:26,wallstreetbets,Lithium will be replaced like what it did to alkaline. Good short term play maybe
2021-06-12 19:37:32,wallstreetbets,Lac does not even pull lithium out of the ground yet. I owned them for the hype and dumped it soon after. If you want in the ev game that’s not yet overvalued you go for the charging stations companies no one knows about such as clii (evgo)
2021-06-12 19:27:28,wallstreetbets,$LAC is my worst investment so far this year 🤦‍♂️
2021-06-12 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,I wipe my ass with my own ape cock 🦍🍆💁
2021-06-12 19:53:06,wallstreetbets,Looks like it's too late for LAC investment... If you didn't get in under $5/share you'll never make big gains on it. Tendies be scarce...
2021-06-12 18:42:06,wallstreetbets,"It’s not very reliable, and there will always be batteries just getting lost/damaged beyond repair"

2021-06-12 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Any DD on those companies and I'd invest a fortune

Ok so I know charts & trends aren’t an exact science & splitting hairs can really impact the outcome, but I’m inclined to believe the trend has been broken. It’s all about how much importance you assign to connecting those few high candles in the $30’s as compared to the last 2 or 3 days just before the Tuesday breakout. Not sure if the chart link will post correct. (My biased chart analysis). That said, we’ll know pretty soon which is correct."
2021-06-12 18:03:22,wallstreetbets,So don’t buy wish?
2021-06-12 19:59:43,wallstreetbets,Shouldn't your technical analysis include the fact that they unlock 46M shares on Monday and dilute their shareholders?
2021-06-12 19:12:01,wallstreetbets,You can if the company goes out of business
2021-06-12 19:43:31,wallstreetbets,Me too

2021-06-12 18:53:16,wallstreetbets,100m on a float that big is not much especially when average volume is usually 70m
2021-06-12 19:14:39,wallstreetbets,Depends on the timeframe you are looking at - in the ultra short term it obviously broke a downtrend - but for large moves you need to break longer term trends
2021-06-12 19:13:23,wallstreetbets,"In the long term if the fundamentals are there - the stock should do well - so if that’s what you are going for then it shouldn’t matter.

But - in the near term - for the trade everyone is trying to make - I’m basically just saying the odds of success are by far the highest once we clear 12.29"
2021-06-12 18:23:15,wallstreetbets,Just buy enough so that it breaks that $12.29 and then the op can buy too.

2021-06-12 19:45:12,wallstreetbets,"Anyone have thoughts on what that might do to the price? Obviously if the execs sell a bunch that won’t be good, but to me it looks like it’s about bottomed out right now. If the execs don’t sell that should be good for the share price. Is this the kind of thing where investors wait a few days/weeks passed expiry to decide if they want to get in or not? Looks like the current attention along with the lockout expiration might be perfect, solidifying the trend reversal."

2021-06-12 19:39:38,wallstreetbets,If you read the clause it states that would have been the date only if it was 33% above the IPO price for 10/15 days leading up to earnings. Since that was not the case Monday will be expiration.

2021-06-12 18:13:12,wallstreetbets,"A few things. Do they control their computational framework or is it provided by a third party, if so, which one? 

Do you know of other players in this sphere? What does this organizations relationship with USAF look like? While many of the customers on that list are impressive, if they can secure themselves as capable and proven at handling S, or preferably TS/SCI data for the DoD, they can very easily grab billion dollar contracts over companies with no such record. 

More specifically, do we know what exact AI technology they offer? It's a fairly broad field with technologies such as regression out evolutionary computing included and their value differs greatly based on what exactly it is they offer. Are they developing custom AI platforms for each customer or is it a basic framework that they tailor to each customer?"

2021-06-12 19:04:48,wallstreetbets,Not an expert. I have limited experience looking into their products. I will only ever be short this company and never long. Mostly tied to the types of questions you raise.
2021-06-12 18:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Bingo. The algorithms used in enterprise ""AI"" are predominantly available through free and open software packages. The secret sauce usually lies in domain knowledge and bespoke data pipelines out of and into legacy data backends. So I'd agree with your sentiment that it's mostly consulting and doesn't scale."
2021-06-12 17:41:21,wallstreetbets,aye
2021-06-12 19:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Okay, that was the position I was likely going to take if I get in on this. Obviously the business is in a field primed and growing, but that doesn't mean the company will. I think it would be one to mainly do short plays but keep an eye on. If they show promise of heading in the right direction then yeah go long but right now it's too uncertain"
2021-06-12 19:45:43,wallstreetbets,Dont care. If they come out with A.I. Sex bot then im all in.
2021-06-12 18:53:17,wallstreetbets,I find it hilarious that they ask to borrow your shares so they can drive your equity value down
2021-06-12 18:52:53,wallstreetbets,Some brokers don't ask at all. They get your permission in the initial terms and conditions and that's that.
2021-06-12 17:05:06,wallstreetbets,Post screen caps of the email request? Of course blur out personal info but I’m curious as to how they asked and the reason they put.
2021-06-12 17:08:30,wallstreetbets,Getting retarded on SOFI all in 🦍🍌🍌🍌🚀🚀💎💎
2021-06-12 19:11:32,wallstreetbets,Not sure why no one is answering the question. Sofi is currently hard to borrow which means there is high demand for the shares from short sellers. I checked the interest rate and it’s 60% per year at my broker. Your broker wants you to make your shares available to short and pay you a part of that 60% interest. You can also replicate that interest rate by selling calls against your shares.
2021-06-12 17:29:14,wallstreetbets,"It’s fairly simple, do you want them to pay you a tiny fee to borrow your stock and bet it against you, which will drop the value of your holdings?"
2021-06-12 17:39:12,wallstreetbets,"They aren’t asking YOU to borrow shares, they are asking if you want to participate in the stock lending program where THEY lend YOUR shares out for shorting to other HFs. If your brokerage is anything like Webull then they will pay you 💩 to lend out YOUR shares. Opt out if they automatically enrolled you! 😘✌🏼"
2021-06-12 18:00:02,wallstreetbets,I hope you said hell no..
2021-06-12 17:04:13,wallstreetbets,Sell me your shares there gunna be worthless
2021-06-12 19:22:14,wallstreetbets,Man a lot of people here are against you making money while they don’t even believe your claim lol. This is pretty common practice but this is the first time I hear the brokerage actually contacting the customer like this. I used to have an account with Schwab that you can setup to do exactly this. 27% is pretty good but keep in mind usually it fluctuates so it might tapper off with time. Also they might have a locking period for your shares so check that too.
2021-06-12 19:54:08,wallstreetbets,I wonder if they're trying to drive them out of business as they're competition?
2021-06-12 17:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing. Interesting to see and at least they asked before just using your shares. The risk for you is the share price falls in return for a minimal fee. I personally wouldn't do it because I don't want to support the shorters, but I'm not in the USA and hold shares in my own name rather than via a broker"
2021-06-12 18:48:06,wallstreetbets,"I see these posts occasionally for stocks I own, but Schwab never asks me if I want to lend my shares...do you need to have a margin account to qualify or something?"
2021-06-12 17:13:40,wallstreetbets,I wanna see that email or letter. Not calling u out. Just want to see proof. Too many fake ass post lately.
2021-06-12 18:48:50,wallstreetbets,Let them borrow your shares and earn extra free income on the borrow.  Definitely take up this opportunity imo.
2021-06-12 17:12:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe someone is betting on loan forgiveness? I would want to see the email. It’s pretty cool to hear stuff like this
2021-06-12 17:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Wow, 27% and nothing - nothing at all - about counterparty risk.  I smell lawsuit."

2021-06-12 19:12:02,wallstreetbets,It wouldn’t matter to him long term and he can use the money to scoop them cheap shares. Also it’s not necessarily them driving the equity down they just have somebody who needs to borrow them.

2021-06-12 17:52:30,wallstreetbets,"If he's long why does short term downward price pressure matter? He's confident that SoFi will do well over the long haul and indicates this is a long term hold. 

It may not be a large sum of money compared to the investment itself but lending your shares on a high conviction, long term stock is a great way to generate passive income. Also, if the share price decreases in the short term it creates a great chance to add more shares at a discount. It's a win-win 

The only real negative i could imagine is if lending the shares prevents op from writing covered calls."
2021-06-12 17:47:38,wallstreetbets,27% is tiny?

2021-06-12 18:17:08,wallstreetbets,"Excellent, thanks for taking the time to share this detail since it is very insightful on how they approach this topic. The imgur image worked well."
2021-06-12 18:15:28,wallstreetbets,"When you write a covered call you are selling a call to a person and it ties up 100 shares for each call.  If the stock ends the period over your strike price you may have the shares sold at that agreed upon price and you get to keep the premium someone paid you for the call option you sold.  If the stock is below the strike price you keep your shares and the premium and can rinse and repeat.  This is for the united states, I'm not sure how they work in other countries but I would look into it.

I just sold some BB calls for $300 each which made me a 25% premium and if it sells I make a bunch of money from the shares.  As far as I can tell BB will not hit the strike but either way I'm happy.

Back in the day this sub was all about options, today it is heavily into holding shares.  I guess you have to make hay while the sun shines."

2021-06-12 19:10:17,wallstreetbets,I sold a few BB calls when it had a surge a week or two ago for something like $450 each ($40 strike for September- LOL!).  Good luck to whomever bought those.

2021-06-12 18:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Backstory: 

A long time ago ‘Cliffs Natural Resources’ had a shitty CEO who managed to drive the price down from $90 to $20 (they had a lot fewer shares back then).  One of the largest shareholders in Cliffs was a hedge fund who got fed up and started a proxy fight with the Board to replace their CEO (and half the fucking board) with the newly retired Lourenco Goncalves.  

The hedge fund won and LG came on board and IMMEDIATELY sold off three of the non-profitable businesses that Cliffs had to focus on US iron ore production and to set the stage for how he saw the broader steel industry moving (more EAFs, rising scrap prices).  

Today, CLF is one of the greatest business transformation stories.  There will be tons of Harvard Business School case studies looking back at the ‘bets’ LG made and how they all worked out amazingly."

2021-06-12 19:15:26,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, it looks like they tell you straight up that they don't have combinations. So no covered calls/spreads.


I also want to address a common misconception. Selling puts isn't super risky. Selling a put is the exact same as selling a covered call. A covered call is a synthetic put. 

Anyways, I know I'm nitpicking at your points. I don't want to come off as defending this trash broker. I've never heard of this app. They sound like shit. Thanks for going through that so fewer people have to. 👍🏼"
2021-06-12 17:03:16,wallstreetbets,And u wonder why it’s free…. Go somewhere there’s fees it’s actually legit otherwise your the stug
2021-06-12 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,"Isn't everywhere free for stock trades though? Schwab and fidelity options contracts are a bit more, 0.65. Dough is a dime/contract. Never had any of those issues with them, or webull. Aside from dough, they all have phone #s. Dough may too, I'm not sure, because they reply to emails very fast so I've never had to call. Either way, live and learn. Every broker has its advantages and disadvantages. Decided to try this one out because I liked the app setup, which I still use for watch lists and dd. Really posting this for people who are looking into it in the future, try to save them the hassle I went through. It's a new app and there wasn't a lot of info online about it when I was looking before I deposited."

Wake up. USA don't need nor want more vaccines, especially since we got a SURPLUS supply that's expiring. We've begun donating excess vaccines to other countries.

Drop OCGN, or be left bagholding."

2021-06-12 16:32:56,wallstreetbets,"You realize that the only reason this is news is because the FDA is not going to approve any more vaccines for emergency approval.  In fact, they got rejected for EUA.  They had to either say they are going to try a different route or give up."
2021-06-12 17:09:46,wallstreetbets,OCGN probably won’t make it. Covid is already well under control in the US and these guys just have licensing and distribution agreements with countries that don’t need vaccine (US and Canada.) Big pharma and a few other small players like novavax that actually own the vaccine are pumping out doses by the second for overseas where there’s still a need. The CEO and their PR Dept have repeatedly made misleading statements about their EUA submission and timeline on approval over the past few months while selling shares right before they drop bad news. There’s a lot of red flags with these guys…Ocugen is a big no go.

2021-06-12 18:49:25,wallstreetbets,Actually this isn't totally true. Canada is laghinh far behind the US in getting it's citizens vaccinated so there is a market there. Also there will be a market in the US for children and for booster shots. Covaxin might be the best used for a booster because it seems to be highly effective against all strains while the MRNA vaccines have been kind of hit or miss with different strains.

And think of which states diabetes rates are higher. And overlap that with crazy conspiracy theory concerns.

Tend to agree with the overall vibe of your post but wrt this, people who suffer from serious disease like diabetes tend to have a more pragmatic view on life. They can't really afford to tin foil hat with something like diabetes because the consequences are real and are devastating."

2021-06-12 17:54:08,wallstreetbets,SENS is a great short term play with all the hype and the ridiculous amount of short selling going on right now. I am confident next week is gonna be huge. Based on your post I can tell you are not a type 1 diabetic. I would encourage you to watch some videos of people that have switched off Dexcom and started using Eversense - most people prefer SENS. This is a great long term hold as their tech is better than DXCM. Clearly they have an uphill battle in front of them but I am betting long on the tech and swinging short term.

2021-06-12 16:24:02,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this post. I’ve been going crazy seeing all of these misleading posts hyping sens to the moon. Everybody sees “180 days vs 10” and assumes it’s as simple as that, but there’s a lot more than meets the eye, this isn’t the revolutionary groundbreaking tech it’s being made out to be. I’m a type 1 diabetic who uses a CGM, and there’s a fair number of downsides to the sens over the other options on the market. It very well might gain traction and make money, but I highly highly doubt it’s going to take over overnight. I went over a pretty detailed comparison in previous comments."
2021-06-12 17:47:01,wallstreetbets,"These warnings are fair. But SENS doesn’t need to dominate the market to be successful. However, it can and likely will take a piece of it. Read diabetes forums. People are excited about it. Sure not everyone will want an implant but some will. SENS also has superior accuracy which is worth it to some. In 2 years they’ll have a 360 day sensor. I’m not trying to convince anyone to invest. I don’t give a shit what you do. But SENS will have a decent piece of the CGM market in the future. And no it won’t be a $100 stock anytime soon (or in the future)"

2021-06-12 17:45:56,wallstreetbets,">no type 1 diabetes patients prefer Medtronic guardian

Patient preference?  Really?  Almost spit my coffee.  The customers are the insurance companies, dimwit, patient preference is for the dildo shop"
2021-06-12 17:53:22,wallstreetbets,"When you say stickers, you mean the adhesive pads, right? SENS still has those, for the transmitter."
2021-06-12 16:01:57,wallstreetbets,"\#2 is the big one, though. There's no better way to say that your product is an unreliable POS than by instructing people they have to calibrate it once or twice a day. The entire point of a CGM is to end the finger sticks, and this one requires them."
2021-06-12 15:57:55,wallstreetbets,You’ll need both a tinfoil hat and tinfoil chaps.
2021-06-12 18:05:12,wallstreetbets,"1 - I disagree that most patients with chronic conditions consider the consequences and I think I am right by just how hard it is to practice preventive medicine in the US. It is so hard to get people to start preventive medications or change lifestyle and yet with a heart attack they will do and take anything. American patients overall are more about treating than preventing.  Not all, but our system encourages it.

2) I would semi agree if there weren’t other options. But there are. Multiple. Including ones that if you don’t like you can peel off, toss, and you’re out $35. Not “I have something implanted and I need to schedule an appointment in 2 weeks and undergo what is technically billed as a surgery to excise” (I know it’s not a surgery, it’s pretty simple but it is still a procedure and it is about image — you can get Abbott (Libre) and dexcom are going to play this up)"
2021-06-12 18:12:23,wallstreetbets,Should I think of SENS like a AMD when it was worth $5
2021-06-12 16:09:01,wallstreetbets,All the way mate 😂😂😂

2021-06-12 15:58:57,wallstreetbets,I know those engineers. They tip well after our time together behind Wendy’s
2021-06-12 18:12:52,wallstreetbets,"Your second the last sentence is the key, as I’ve said in other comments. I think they’re going to do great once they integrate w transmitter, stop needing calibrations, and work hybrid w a pump. But that is years away, not August call strike price $20 YOLOOOOO"
2021-06-12 18:11:36,wallstreetbets,"That’s the key. I agree with you that it will likely eventually take a nice part of the market, especially when it is part of a hybrid closed loop system, doesn’t require calibrations, and doesn’t need the transmitter sticker. Then a lot of people I think will be up for it. However that day is not near. This post was a warning to the people signing up for august 2021 crazy OTM calls thinking this is going to capture 40% of the market in that time.

About the accuracy: it’s not a game changer. It’s minimal, and when you’re talking about numbers in the 100s that’s like 2-3mg/dL. Not a big deal. SENS will market that but I don’t think it will make a big difference. Also remember they are not competing against a static system. dexcom g7 is rumored to be more accurate too, will have to see how much."
2021-06-12 17:58:44,wallstreetbets,"This is a key point. If you take the transmitter sticker off, it will continue measuring glucose but does not actually transmit it so you can see it. It is going to be YEARS until they have a sticker free, integrated transmitter option. So what I am saying is getting a Jan ‘22 call because you think it’s going to blow up and everyone is going to be on one — it’s not going to happen."
2021-06-12 18:00:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s not unreliable, it’s a good system it’s just that it is behind and the FDA moves phenomenally slowly with this stuff. Dexcom used to require fingerstick calibrations too. Eversense will eventually not need it, but that is not coming soon.."
2021-06-12 18:16:21,wallstreetbets,"I think if you buy SHARES and you don’t need the money for 5-10 years you will be fine. I think buying options thinking this is going to disrupt the space in the next few months that is looney. Just my thoughts, not financial advice."
2021-06-12 18:07:45,wallstreetbets,Nothing would make me happier than to see your success. Just want to make sure people know what they’re getting into.
2021-06-12 18:10:48,wallstreetbets,"What can I say, I LIKE THE STOCK!"
2021-06-12 18:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Thing is there is some good DD on SENS that sees the potential for a good gain either long or short. Then there is the DD that touts it as x100 for next year, which is like ""AMC to 100000!!!1!!"""
2021-06-12 19:07:17,wallstreetbets,"I hear it. I’d be real careful with this short term movement too. And it’s already up 130% in the past month. My EOY price target was like $5 so this is unexpected. At the very least even if someone jumped in around $4-$5 I do think it’s a fine long term hold. Unlike other WSB pumps this company looks very promising long term. I’d also consider it an acquisition target. 

Position: 8k shares @ $2.32 + 25 2023 leaps"
2021-06-12 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,"I mean, a JAN22 ITM call isn't necessarily a bad idea, but I wouldn't buy one right now. SENS is due to come back down after the run is over and sentiment dries up due to the long lead time until 180 day approval and the upcoming ER in August (probably) still not showing profit yet. I'm waiting until it gets back to reasonable levels for a company that's burning through cash, or that they show sustained profit, before I buy some LEAPS."
2021-06-12 19:09:16,wallstreetbets,"It may not be unreliable IF you calibrate it twice a day, but it necessarily is otherwise. It's an improvement for people that don't have one at all and are used to sticking themselves half a dozen times a day, but it's a giant step back from the Dexcom that doesn't require finger sticks at all. I just can't see anyone used to the Dexcom wanting to go back to sticking themselves twice a day, no matter how infrequently they have to replace the internal sensor. They better develop one that doesn't need calibration very often in a real hurry if they want to stay in business."
2021-06-12 17:41:09,wallstreetbets,This looks like an old position- when did you buy it?
2021-06-12 15:24:17,wallstreetbets,WTF!! You have more option contract than me. I thought I was a crazy retard

UWMC is a play based on fundamental value, it will do well with or without this sub spamming the ticker to “squeeeeze” it. But when I see a short term opportunity with many catalysts colliding and retail interest I’m taking it. I don’t care what everyone else does and you shouldn’t care about what I do."

2021-06-12 19:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Yep. They were 130 a few days ago. 

I sold pmcc’s against them and made back far more premium than I initially paid. I really hope the 15c’s I sold that expire this week don’t go itm, but if they do… i still end up making over 10x profit.

I’m just gonna kick the hell out of myself if we have a ridiculous squeeze"
2021-06-12 19:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Whoa look who read the front page yesterday and came back with some talking points

The whole “January” idea was to unofficially ™️ pile onto shorted stocks to fuck over MMs until recently . Wonder where those ideas came from

UWMC is looking at 60% naked short. If you want those 6/18 calls to print I suggest you don’t alienate a whole movement of people who are working with you to to get you rich instead of you bending over backwards for some hedge fund while squealing “THERE IS NO WE IN CASINO THERE IS NO WE IN CASINO” 

Wouldn’t surprise me if that OP was an astroturfer looking for gullible ppl to convince them that the meme economy is dead so those ass holes can go back to naked shorting as usual

But you do you, at the end of the day you’re not hurting the stock other than calling ppl who have $40k in shares “fucking goofy”. And yes, that does hurt it, ask me while I pulled out of the AMCult"
2021-06-12 19:56:03,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don’t know any of those references you are mentioning about front pages or other OPs 

But I would love the source showing 60% naked short interest. I hope you are aware that short interest does not equal naked shorts. 

And stop being dramatic, I didn’t call you goofy for owning shares, I called you goofy for using the word “selfish” for someone’s positions. The moment you aren’t selfish in the market is the moment you become an actual retard. 

I first got in UWMC in March, I don’t think it’s a meme nor associate it with a “meme economy”.  I got in for the fundamentals, and I’m still in for the same reason. I fully support the retail momentum and punishing those who tried to hold down a undervalued company, but those two things are not mutually exclusive. I’ve had shares and leaps up until recently, where as I said I took a gamble on a more aggressive position based on impeding catalysts (not just WSB squeezing yadeyaya) If these print then I plan on going back into shares to play theta and enjoy divies. 

I’m not against you, man. This just isn’t the same as a GME or AMC. Those are so far detached from true value that yes, retail holders are important. This isn’t on that level, this is under true value. Again, it will see growth with or without this sub. Good luck brother"

2021-06-12 18:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Definately dont dump. Especially if you have shares. Your loss from Thursday will come back. As the apes say its only a loss if you sell.

 In the case of CLNE, it WILL go to atleast 13.50 short term due to Amazon deal essentially setting a floor price. So if your average cost is below that, it's going to be a win sooner or later."

2021-06-12 14:58:12,wallstreetbets,there will never be enough cow farts to power the the economy that trucks provide
2021-06-12 14:51:24,wallstreetbets,well my you have to create the infrastructure check out you local truck stops it’s 10 pumps for diesel and maybe on CNG spot until there is enough demand truck stops won’t change. as a driver i can get 1600 miles per fuel up. o can refuel in about 20 minutes. for owners operators they are gonna go with cheapest they can go with company fleets are also willing to invest for cheaper alternatives but the issues is both fuel and service to the trucks. as a company you will have to open your own pumps at your facility and know where the next one is an app can take care of that. also CNG has been around for a while but hasn’t even come close to replacing diesel. the cng does not get the same mileage as the diesel so the driver have to fule up more often. also the cold effects how much fuel can fit in the tanks. even though company’s have signed on to this it only for credit. The companies will do a big press release of how they are going green they will get a couple discounted trucks and they will find so small route that they can do to make it look good and 5 years later it’s all over. i can see how some companies like UPS and Fedex can do this that already have the trucks and they don’t care where the fuel comes from but man if you can sell green delivery to the public that makes them wet their panties then good deal as for cross country driving you got to have the infrastructure to support the fleets
2021-06-12 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,"2019 they qualified for certain subsidies that they no longer qualify for and they had special one time income.   


When they have a seat on the board. They are an insider."
2021-06-12 19:42:13,wallstreetbets,"Tl,dr: Calls give you the choice to buy a particular stock (in units of 100), at a particular price by a particular date. Unlike stock though, calls/puts expire on that date, so if the stock doesn’t go in the direction you like by that date, you lose your whole investment."
2021-06-12 15:19:22,wallstreetbets,"I like your input and I agree with you that they will not be able to support the whole industry.  I also agree with you that more infrastructure will need to be built and they are in the process of attacking that issue.

However no empire was ever built overnight, it is a process.  The trucking industry is huge and I think we can all admit the amount of emissions produced from running a nationwide fleet of diesel motors needs to be reduced.  Visit almost any major populated city or area in the U.S. and you can visibly see the air pollution.

With the U.S. now back in the Paris Climate agreement their is a push to reduce these emissions.  CLNE has the product available now to make an impact now.

I think we could also admit that Electric semis are no where near close to being an option for either short or long haul trucking."
2021-06-12 15:24:36,wallstreetbets,"Amen. I ran 3 sets of maxi A-trains to SLC every week for 8-9 years. Lumber out of here in the NWest and reloaded salt from Cargill background yo all the Big R stores. Lot of steel pipe out Provo SMP.  Ran a couple reefers export of WA to Nogales and down into the Texas valley McAllen to Mexico. Transition to gas infrastructure is costly to truck stops and getting supply lines to support the demand. Not sure that6going yo happen in my opinion 

Keep on Keepin on my brotha"
2021-06-12 16:02:19,wallstreetbets,"The thesis is not about total replacement of diesel. If we use 2019 number (2020 was a special year for transportation), the annual consumption of diesel in US was 47 billion gallon.

If RNG manages to capture a fraction of it, CLNE would go to the moon easily."
2021-06-12 16:35:21,wallstreetbets,"http://www.ngvjournal.com/s1-news/c1-markets/us-biomethane-surpasses-50-of-all-on-road-fuel-used-in-natural-gas-vehicles/

Well nobody says that natural gas will take 100% market share.. it is reasonable to expect 10-15% market share and there might be enough RNG and fossil natural gas for that"
2021-06-12 15:20:21,wallstreetbets,"I see more local service and last mile delivery trucks using CNG like garbage trucks and UPS trucks, maybe it's not as practical for long haul trucks"
2021-06-12 19:52:14,wallstreetbets,"400 million joint venture let’s do our homework here at this point.  CLNE sold $200,000,000.00 in common shares through a shelf offering last week for a total of approximately 22 million shares.  Total SE started selling off shares about a month ago slowly.  (Hmm….probably in order to not greatly affect share price.)  How many shares do we think they are going to sell?  I’m going to say they continue their trend until they reach 22 million shares or about $200,000,000.00.  How do I come to this conclusion.  Well there is a 400m JV.  So they both need $200m.  Rather than take a loan why not round up some money by selling shares they have easy access to.  Ahhh….great idea.  This is not a sell off to evacuate a sinking ship.  It’s an investment into the future that even this smooth brain 🦍 retard can see."
2021-06-12 15:37:53,wallstreetbets,what probably is going to happen is some kind of government tax credit for those companies that buy from Cline
2021-06-12 18:17:02,wallstreetbets,"As a driver I'd be concerned about going OTR with anything other than diesel. I couldn't find information about engine lifespan, but natural gas generators don't last nearly as long, and fuel/tank weight & range is already an issue for CMVs, especially pickups like Annheiser busch which wanna load you to 79,999.9 . 

Even if things are the opposite, I'm not sure drivers would wanna risk the more rare maintenance and fueling opportunities, and O/O's would be wary of that and very sensitive to up-front pricing."
2021-06-12 15:30:21,wallstreetbets,CLNE is working with Flying J to install fueling stations at their locations.  I’m pretty sure this is a nationwide fueling station and heavily used by truckers as they have a lot of other useful ammentities for truckers.
2021-06-12 15:34:57,wallstreetbets,i feel that the only fule that can replace diesel all together is hydrogen
2021-06-12 15:45:35,wallstreetbets,"I believe the government subsidies kick in when you buy a new truck that uses CNG, just like when you buy an electric vehicle now.  It’s not in the fuel, it’s in the equipment."
2021-06-12 18:22:49,wallstreetbets,"CLNE has the zero now program to help off set any up front costs.  I understand the apprehension of switching motors as I myself work in an industry where diesel motors are a part of every day life.

There have been numerous studies that show the new natural gas motors are just as powerful as diesel motors.  As for the reliability I have not researched that."
2021-06-12 18:23:37,wallstreetbets,i hear that brother gonna have to take them panties off
2021-06-12 15:33:35,wallstreetbets,Fly J already has a pump or two but only a truck or two every one ina while come in. i fray need to be able to support hundreds of trucks a day
2021-06-12 18:30:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm having trouble looking into reliability myself. I saw something suggesting a 1/20 lifespan, but if that was right they'd have to be free to catch on."
2021-06-12 18:31:45,wallstreetbets,I ain't got no panties on
2021-06-12 15:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, as of right now CLNE is only used in a small portion of trucking fleet, but as the number grows, I would imagine the support for the drivers would to also grow so they have options of locations to fuel.  Not efficient to have trucks parked waiting for fuel.  CLNE is not stagnant on growing their infrastructure and I also understand that natural gas has been around for a while now.  What has changed, the world is starting to realize that emissions need to be reduced.  CLNE has the option to reduce each and every diesel burning motors emissions by 300%, this will not happen over night.  Chevron, Exxon, Shell all did not happen over night.  It’s an evolution.  CLNE is a disruptor to the normal."
2021-06-12 19:04:01,wallstreetbets,"From what I see in brief 0 DD Nat gas has an engine life 15/20 years.  Diesel 25/30 years.  This will change with technology.  Also RNG is less expensive compared to diesel by at least .50c so there would be cost savings at the pump to offset costs of a new pusher.

Let’s not kid ourselves either, diesel motors still breakdown, leak oil, and blow turbos.  So there is still maintenance costs with these motors no different than a Nat Gas motor."
2021-06-12 15:52:39,wallstreetbets,well at the moment don’t kid yourself they ain’t a pimple on big oils ass
2021-06-12 19:11:14,wallstreetbets,"I found a paper called ""The per-mile costs of operating compressed natural gas trucks"" on Google, and CNG gets .8 lower  MPG and 5cpm higher maintenance costs. For an O/O counting their pennies or a company watching their margins, there's still a ways to go for operation costs. It says 2015, so things are probably closer to itm, but I don't see this catching on soon. 

I'm not bearish on CNG, I'm just thinking along the lines of ""not yet"""
2021-06-12 15:54:38,wallstreetbets,"Yep I realize that.  Every pimple starts under the skin under it boils up and gets ready to pop.  CLNE has already implanted itself under the skin, now it’s getting ready to boil up.  Why else would BP, Total, and Chevron get in bed with them, doubt it’s all a publicity stunt."
2021-06-12 19:13:31,wallstreetbets,"Amazon, UPS, Estes trucking, USPS through EVO transport.  I’m sure all those companies did their homework on cost."
2021-06-12 15:56:25,wallstreetbets,we shall see
2021-06-12 19:18:58,wallstreetbets,"They probably did, and they probably used someone smarter than me to do it, too. I'm just a driver, spewing crap. Gotta wonder what the difference it is for those of us who aren't getting all their subsidies and can't ensure there's always a tech available to fix it and a pump to fill it."

Shopify: 25x revenue

LSPD: 33x revenue

NVEI: 15x revenue

2021-06-12 14:00:02,wallstreetbets,Plenty of liquidity and EBITDA margins are continuing to improve. Should be roughly break even Free cash flow in 2022 then eps positive in 2023 & it’s only trading at 2x 2021 expected sales.. this is the best value growth stock you can find. In 6 months people are going to look back on this past week and think it was so obvious why didn’t I buy. Long the shares and not even thinking about trimming until we make a new all time high

2021-06-12 13:55:31,wallstreetbets,Your wife is more of a value play
2021-06-12 18:57:19,wallstreetbets,Shopify is the shittiest online retailer out there and they have a market cap of $188bn.  Etsy sells Dollar General trinkets glued together and they have a market cap of $21bn.  WISH is the third largest online retailer in the US and they have a market cap of $6bn.

2021-06-12 18:58:55,wallstreetbets,Why is wish down so hard? Are financials trash?
2021-06-12 19:10:31,wallstreetbets,"I can’t believe I have to keep posting this but their logistics rev is gross revenue. So you can remove 85% off the top as money they bank. Redo your calculations removing all of their logistics revenue and you will see why they are trading above fair market price. Removing the gross logistics revenue also gives them a YoY rev growth of 10% which is modest. Still more room to the downside.

 Below is from their latest 10-q:

2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. **Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.** Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes."

2021-06-12 18:19:36,wallstreetbets,They're a garbage company that sells inferior products and provides a space for shady manufacturers that create cheap knock offs to rip people off. You support them if you want to. i'll pass.

2021-06-12 18:58:48,wallstreetbets,"This is good info, I'll add it in. Thanks brother."
2021-06-12 19:26:42,wallstreetbets,I already mentioned to you specifically that they use gross rev in their logistics space and You are using their logistics revenue in your calculations. No PE or VC firm would ever value a company or provided funding based on gross revenue. So there is no reason to use gross revenue in your calculations. Remove 85% of their logistics revenue or ~$400M FY20 from your calculations.
2021-06-12 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,I made a similar move: I downloaded their app then fingered my starfish
2021-06-12 18:51:23,wallstreetbets,I like ur avatar costume. Where lambo!?
2021-06-12 19:28:17,wallstreetbets,The company has been around ten years and has given no indication they will be profitable. Please provide any statement that says they will be FCF positive anytime in the near future else you just look like an idiot.

2021-06-12 19:18:51,wallstreetbets,Looks at this idiot. Short interest is less than 8 percent of float. Shorts don’t have to cover it’s still massively overvauled.
2021-06-12 14:46:32,wallstreetbets,How do you have confidence in this company as a long-term investment? They sell horrible products AND they cheat customers by not presenting the quality accurately. How many repeat customers do they even have?
2021-06-12 19:43:47,wallstreetbets,Dude get off this sub.
2021-06-12 18:51:53,wallstreetbets,Hell no

2021-06-12 14:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Their quality has always been crap even at their ATH, you get what you pay for, think the percent of ATH is still relevant… also agree most of their product is crap but that doesn’t stop anyone shopping there, dollar tree, ali-express etc 😂 WISH gang 🚀"

2021-06-12 15:32:17,wallstreetbets,Insiders aren’t going to sell their shares at this low of a stock price. This should be trading at 3-5 times the current levels.
2021-06-12 17:18:29,wallstreetbets,Lockup was may 15. A quick google search should confirm.
2021-06-12 14:25:09,wallstreetbets,Damn. Can I leave that a 5 star?
2021-06-12 19:54:26,wallstreetbets,"They don’t have much capex at all, it’s a very asset light business. It’s not going to be difficult at all to be FCF break even given their growth. It’s the non cash costs that’s killing their EPS. 

Here’s a JPMorgan analyst screenshot saying EBITDA profitability in 2022 (EBITDA is often very similar to FCF) 

https://twitter.com/aonesbg/status/1397026853890703360?s=21

Here an analyst is forecasting positive eps in 2023

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/wish/earnings

Here’s the cfo on the last conference call.

“So on the first question, if you look at first half of 2019, when we slowed down growth, we became extremely profitable. So we know this business when you slowed on growth becomes very profitable just because we have a lot of returning cohorts. But we are focused on driving growth, and we are focused on driving growth, at the same time, improving our EBITDA margin. And if you look at our history, our EBITDA margin has improved from negative 30% to negative 9% while delivering growth. So our goal would always be to deliver growth, and at the same time, continuously to improve our EBITDA margin by expanding -- looking forward, going expanding gross margins as well as getting leverage in operating expenses. So that’s how we kind of think of the business.” CFO Raj Bahri, 2Q conference call

They’re currently projecting -7 to -8% EBITDA margins in Q2."
2021-06-12 19:22:56,wallstreetbets,Fuck You pay me shorty
2021-06-12 14:54:01,wallstreetbets,They are the middle man in this. I’ve gotten plenty of stuff from Amazon that was crappy. They have gotten a lot better over time. I don’t buy from WISH but I believe in the concept. More broke people in this world then rich. I guarantee this stock will be in the 100’s in years to come. I’ll never sell!! WISH TO THE FUCKING MOON BABY!!
2021-06-12 15:14:05,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that what alibaba is..? A lot of people use wish to dropship.
2021-06-12 15:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Plus heavy exposure to China.  I'm considering a short term play, definitely not long term"
2021-06-12 17:41:03,wallstreetbets,Plenty of people outside of the United States and western europe use wish. What's crap to us is standard to them.
2021-06-12 14:55:36,wallstreetbets,I love how we are investing into bloatware now because that's all this shit is.  Buy a cheap ass phone and guess what app comes preinstalled.

Some people invest only in stocks of companies they shop with or would use themselves. Those people are often degenerates. I look at numbers, I look at hype. I see everyone talking about $wish, I see the volume spike massive, I bought. Let’s see what the stock price is in the near future"

2021-06-12 19:59:35,wallstreetbets,"JPM was their underwriter for WISH’s IPO so you can discount anything they present. 

It is asset light and yes they are profitable without sales and marketing however they are increasing marketing expenses higher than rev growth with 175M last quarter and 500M quarter before. And as a growth company they still will continue to increase this line item for growth. They will burn through the 1.8B COH and have to go back to the debt market before they have FCF IMHO."
2021-06-12 15:05:00,wallstreetbets,"Poor people can buy from places that don't lie to them. A poor person will not buy from a place which has given them lower quality product than was advertised.

They are a trash company."
2021-06-12 15:21:06,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely positively not! Alibaba sells full range of products and that includes good quality, value-for-money products. They are also truthful about their products and trash is advertised as such. They are not comparable at all."

2021-06-12 19:32:02,wallstreetbets,"I've reached out to their department prior regarding annual report filings and they responded within a day. I've reached out again regarding this lockup period. Hopefully we'll be able to set this to rest but regardless, as many others have noted, selling your shares at a rock bottom price would be highly detrimental to your own finances as well as their company's stock performance. This stock was 20% higher just a month before and it was 300% higher last quarter.

I remember this same pattern from Chrysler in the early ‘90s, engineers vibrating with excitement about their cars (like the Viper) and the stock went from 8 to over 60 in like 18 months if I remember correctly. I feel the same energy from $F today. That’s why I’m still holding a large position."

2021-06-12 14:55:26,wallstreetbets,The Maverick tows 2000lbs at base but can be equipped to tow 4000lbs. I think you're misinformed
2021-06-12 18:09:27,wallstreetbets,No chance Reddit will pump this stock super high like the meme stocks because this is an actual good company and there isn’t that many moron hedge funds shorting it.
2021-06-12 14:58:48,wallstreetbets,"And the bed payload capacity is rated at 1,500 lbs. 2,000+1,500=3,500. If you opt for the bigger motor, you take the fuel economy hit. At that point, you've just sold yourself on a Ranger.

Second edit: That's not bed payload... That's TOTAL payload including passengers. The Santa Cruz also has a towing capacity of 3,500 plus an additional 1,700 in payload. If you get the AWD version, it goes up to 5,000 lbs towing. All this to say that the Maverick is a bit of a dud except that it'll be cheap-ish. Options will drive the price up a ton but on paper it starts pretty cheap. However the Lightning and Mach E are gonna print big time so I wouldn't worry about Ford."
2021-06-12 18:41:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought the LEAPS as a long term hold, but may sell for a quick profit if they jump ITM in the near term.  I was surprised by the price movement Friday"
2021-06-12 15:15:32,wallstreetbets,"As someone who owns a Ranger, you're off base. I average 20mpg combined in my Ranger and they have a tow capacity of 7500lbs in addition to being quite a bit more expensive if you're comparing similar features.
The Maverick 2.0L Ecoboost fuel economy rating hasn't been released, but it's built along side the Escape and Bronco Sport which both offer the 2.0L Ecoboost. In the Escape it gets 23/31mpg and in the bronco sport it's at 21/28mpg. Safe to assume the Maverick will fall somewhere between those ranges.
Back to your comparison of the Outback, you also take a fuel economy hit to 23/30mpg to get the tow capacity, less payload, and no bed. What color would you like your Maverick?"
2021-06-12 15:47:24,wallstreetbets,"The Maverick is taller an heavier than the Escape but a little more narrow. It's the same weight as the Bronco Sport and with the bed, probably less aerodynamic. It should be right around the Bronco in economy. I have no plans on buying a compromise minitruck."

I mean why not but shares? 
You paid 16.76 per contract for shares that were trading at probably like 17.50 and you’ll have to pay that 1 dollar per share when you excersize. Why not just buy the shares outright? I guess you save like .75 cents a share if it drops to 0. But that seems unlikely.  All you’ve done here really is overpaid for shares."

2021-06-12 12:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Buying a call option is buying the ability to buy 100 of a stock at a certain price if it indeed hits that strike number.

Say you have $80 amc calls expiring on 6/18 that you paid some premium for, if the stock goes up to $80 it’s considered at the money, and you can now exercise the call and buy the stock at $80. If it goes to $85 you still get the ability to buy it at $80. So you’d have made $5 x 100 =$500... then you have to subtract the premium you paid for the call option and that would be your profit

2021-06-12 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,A call is like a side bet. If you buy a call you are buying a contract from someOne that says “if the price reaches x amount of dollars I will sell you a hundred shares at that price” you can then sell that contract to a third party later if it is in the money if you don’t want to purchase those underlying shares. you have a chance at a big return without ever owning the stock.
2021-06-12 19:35:27,wallstreetbets,Great point
2021-06-12 19:57:44,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck buys an 800call on a $200 stock that's already up 1500%? Oh LOL morons
2021-06-12 17:08:59,wallstreetbets,AMC would literally have to go tits up to clap those contracts. I'm not saying I'd play anything that deep ITM.

2021-06-12 19:33:36,wallstreetbets,"I cannot think of a reason to buy a call that's .90+ delta. Not even as part of some weirdly complex iron condor, butterfly, or a Reverse Jade Lizard (I just found out that's a thing.)"

2021-06-12 16:26:43,wallstreetbets,Wtf. Anyone with a brain can judge. All this guy did was overpay for shares. He should’ve just bought shares. He lost potential profits doing this and yes this would’ve been obvious to anyone with a brain. Please explain how you can possibly defend this stupid fucking trade.
2021-06-12 12:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Because its stupid and the same as buying shares, like he just said. Are you smooth brained as well?"
2021-06-12 15:00:21,wallstreetbets,But the poster is right. 1 ITM calls is equivalent to 100 shares. Just buy the shares at that point...
2021-06-12 18:29:52,wallstreetbets,Its preference I guess. I always buy calls that won't deteriorate immediately. Especially with this crowds suggestions. I'm cool with making $1k a week on average with day trading. I always have money bc I'm not stupid with it. Sometimes your peoples stuff makes me thousands out of nowhere. Other times I regret the idea. Anyways good luck to you
2021-06-12 19:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Hey throwing my two cents in. 

I think he was/ still is selling poorman covered calls against them. If you have a longer dated option you can use that instead of 100 shares to sell call options for cheaper than owning the 100 shares. Once you collect all you can you sell the call option to collect premium. It's risky but people make money off of it."

Buy a cal, so if the price goes up and you were right about the price going up, you can buy the stock at the increased price? Why wouldn't you just buy it when it is low, if you think it will go up? And make all the profit?"

2021-06-12 17:15:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly my point. There’s no risk mitigation. It’s not dropping below 1, so he going to exercise or sell the contracts. He overpaid for shares."

2021-06-12 13:25:10,wallstreetbets,Depends on the OI and volume I don't even make a move unless either is at least 1000
2021-06-12 16:28:45,wallstreetbets,It’s actually worse than buying shares because when you add the premium and share price to exercise he will be paying more per share than he would’ve paid to just buy them outright. And if the stock drops below a dollar (I know it’s very very unlikely) he owns nothing but paid 95% of the share value. There’s literally no upside to this trade when compared to buying shares outright.
2021-06-12 18:47:10,wallstreetbets,Way to not address anything I wrote I guess?
2021-06-12 12:38:27,wallstreetbets,A put is when you yeet $$$ into a raging dumpster fire and pray to jesus that it rains cash
2021-06-12 12:48:44,wallstreetbets,"Because the call option itself has value and can be sold when it increases in premium as the stock price increases. The inverse is also true, when you buy a call option and the stock price lowers the value of the call also lowers. So if you buy a call for $1 and your stock price goes up a certain amount you can then sell the call for $2. There are more important things to know such as Implied volatility and Theta specifically when choosing call options. You should google how they work, watch a youtube beginner video or something and then try your hand at one this week on a meme stock. Just get a cheap OTM call, watch the stock price, and watch the change in value of the call based on the price movement and you'll figure it out pretty quick. Options seem more complicated than they actually are and IMO the best way to learn is by doing, but for god's sake don't risk a bunch of money learning them, watch tutorials and then start very very small. Not financial advice."
2021-06-12 12:39:25,wallstreetbets,"A call reserves the right to buy at the strike price   so when the actual price of the stock exceeds the strike price, when you exercise the option you are essentially buying a discounted 100 shares per contract. Also previous comment was slightly wrong in the sense that you can exercise the option at any point before the expiration date; doesn’t have to be ‘in the money’"
2021-06-12 12:37:39,wallstreetbets,"I think it's so that if the price doesn't reach that, you're just paying the premium for the call, rather than the price of the whole share"
2021-06-12 12:45:58,wallstreetbets,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_7pGmY58iBw

Same thing I said, but with animation and spoken word. Easier to understand.:)"
2021-06-12 19:28:12,wallstreetbets,"There is a certain amount of leverage even for a call that deep in the money. It's miniscule, but it's there. It will likely be eaten by the fee when he sells though."
2021-06-12 19:05:22,wallstreetbets,"It costs $100 to exercise one contract at $1. Also, AMC options are the most traded derivatives in the United States. They could find a buyer"
2021-06-12 12:39:00,wallstreetbets,Ah yes I see
2021-06-12 12:45:01,wallstreetbets,What’s a dumpster fire?
2021-06-12 12:45:30,wallstreetbets,When I open Robinhood

2021-06-12 11:52:43,wallstreetbets,"That’s why they say escalator up, elevator down!"
2021-06-12 11:50:58,wallstreetbets,Them slow but sure gains were killing it but that free fall was so much more exhilarating.
2021-06-12 12:05:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna say Dec 2020.  Yeeted the money you'd saved up the rest of the year...$2500ish...into the account and tested the waters.  Had a good first run, held the bag too long...finally got out...did the same a couple more times...then sometime last month found that most of your consistent gainers had stalled or reversed.  Moved to cash thinking interest rates would cause crash...no crash....pushed back in again hard which worked for a week or so, but forgot all about that sell button again.

Anywhere close?"
2021-06-12 12:20:00,wallstreetbets,Put it in reverse terry
2021-06-12 11:52:15,wallstreetbets,"In fairness, 2020 was a pretty easy year to make $$ if you started after March."
2021-06-12 12:16:09,wallstreetbets,Just because you made it to 25k doesnt make daytrading a good idea.
2021-06-12 11:52:15,wallstreetbets,now you just gotta do it again but in reverse😎😎
2021-06-12 12:06:03,wallstreetbets,Someone discovered weeklies
2021-06-12 11:51:36,wallstreetbets,Beginning of last week.
2021-06-12 12:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you're about to test the resistance at 22k, seems like a perfect opportunity to go all in"
2021-06-12 12:36:34,wallstreetbets,"TA guys:  ""it looks great it's just testing the low support, if it breaks upwards out of this arbitrary triangle i drew then it should return to ATH"""
2021-06-12 12:28:03,wallstreetbets,"You have to look at this like a roller coaster, that big drop, that’s the beginning of the momentum for the rest of the ride! Get them hands up mother phuck a!"
2021-06-12 12:30:18,wallstreetbets,That’s the spirit! Keep up the good work
2021-06-12 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,Those options will get ya! Fuck!
2021-06-12 18:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Back in the late 1990's,  I was about 18 and researching cheap stocks I was interested in. Found this company called NEORX. They were working on a new cancer treatment and the more I heard, the more I loved it. I waited until payday to put my paycheck in... I had a margin account and stuff. Well,  I got paid after market had closed on Friday, so I went and put in a MARKET order for 300 shares of NEORX, which was trading at about $3. Made the order GTC.  


Anyway, I get off of work, and magically NEORX is on all the stock shows that night and I thought :"" sweet, I'm at the front of the line to buy that stuff Monday Morning and I'll get it cheap still""... no.. not so. Monday comes and the price went up well over $100 per share, and my trade went through at that price... before immediately settling in at around $30, and just slowly going down until the company finally was delisted a couple of years later or so...  
Good times."
2021-06-12 11:55:13,wallstreetbets,looks like about december
2021-06-12 11:52:52,wallstreetbets,Probably when your portfolio got cut in half

2021-06-12 12:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Not taking profits on the +80% week goddamn. Please don't learn ""hold to the moon"" from WSB, that ain't it."
2021-06-12 14:09:33,wallstreetbets,"Same.  And I found this because I had already been interested in making money in the stock market,  I get it is a casino but for some reason I believe this is one gambling game I can do better at than cards, mainly because I do my due diligence before I place my bets.  I haven't had your gains but percentage wise I'm up 125% for the last year so, just started with a smaller initial capital investment.  Now I need to figure out how not to get raped on taxes."
2021-06-12 12:01:05,wallstreetbets,Just flip the screen upside down. What's the problem again?
2021-06-12 11:57:18,wallstreetbets,Looks like your back to where you were when you first found out lol

2021-06-12 12:17:31,wallstreetbets,Would be funny if that drop is from FDs lol
2021-06-12 12:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Well it was looking like a bullish cup and handle, but bro you broke yer handle right the fuck off."
2021-06-12 12:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Not at zero, are you sure you really discovered?"

2021-06-12 13:32:32,wallstreetbets,"School is not free. Although, that last drop looks like you went to jump school!"

2021-06-12 14:59:48,wallstreetbets,I only made money on CLOV because I have been bag holding for several weeks. Sold at 22. Knew it wasn't going parabolic. I saw WISH hype and noped the fuck out.

2021-06-12 12:03:29,wallstreetbets,"That’s like watching a bad movie. Diversify. Carve out 10% to play with if you want to be aggressive. Get some good dividend stocks, market average etfs (after the next dip), and some safety hedges."

2021-06-12 14:24:29,wallstreetbets,I’m no financial analyst but it looks like you should rebalance your portfolio to whatever you owned at the start of Jan 2021.  Oh wait.  That’s when Biden started reversing all of Trumps policies.  Could have been that too.
2021-06-12 13:57:56,wallstreetbets,This sub is honestly incredible. A bunch of redditors being conned into holding the bag for meme stocks pumped and dumped by HF

2021-06-12 13:33:16,wallstreetbets,I see a 300% gain in a year.
2021-06-12 13:33:45,wallstreetbets,So when you make a big score on wsb the best thing you can do is take your proffit and stop trading untill that invincible feeling of god-hood has passed.
2021-06-12 13:34:12,wallstreetbets,Clearly the peak
2021-06-12 13:34:18,wallstreetbets,Regression to the mean
2021-06-12 13:34:47,wallstreetbets,Still positive
2021-06-12 13:35:37,wallstreetbets,"""Buy the dip"" not ""Buy K2"""
2021-06-12 13:35:42,wallstreetbets,"You must have found WSB July 2020, before it got sucked down and caught up in 2021 Q2 MSM pump and dumps."
2021-06-12 13:35:49,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing July 2020 🤔
2021-06-12 13:36:13,wallstreetbets,Chaising gains you get fucked. Should had invested in s plaid amd fuking moon
2021-06-12 13:36:44,wallstreetbets,Looks like around May
2021-06-12 13:37:11,wallstreetbets,That looks like me. Steady growth and safe trading then I went to the casino...
2021-06-12 13:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Why everyone here assume that everyone here only lose money?
-geniiius appe"
2021-06-12 13:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Bro!  Following the latest trend never backfires.  I get all my best investing advice from Starbucks Barristas, Chipotle Spooners, and Lyft Drivers!!

What could go wrong?"
2021-06-12 13:38:54,wallstreetbets,July
2021-06-12 13:41:27,wallstreetbets,Oops.
2021-06-12 13:41:54,wallstreetbets,In June.
2021-06-12 13:42:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-12 13:42:26,wallstreetbets,Nice chart
2021-06-12 13:42:29,wallstreetbets,Did WSB help you go from 26K to 45K first thou?
2021-06-12 13:42:37,wallstreetbets,Is it the part that looks like a dick? Just a guess.
2021-06-12 13:43:04,wallstreetbets,June? lol
2021-06-12 13:43:27,wallstreetbets,Looks like about June 1st
2021-06-12 13:44:21,wallstreetbets,Flip it upside down. That’s u by next month

2021-06-12 13:46:05,wallstreetbets,Good job dumb monkey
2021-06-12 13:47:06,wallstreetbets,It be like that
2021-06-12 13:47:54,wallstreetbets,Yesterday?
2021-06-12 13:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Easy explanation. WSB is an instrument owned by hedgefunds to gain money to cover the shorts on amc and gme. Just do the oposite of the to rated suggestions on WSB and you are on the sunny side of the egg. 

No financial advice!"
2021-06-12 13:49:08,wallstreetbets,Ooof
2021-06-12 13:49:09,wallstreetbets,Lmao that’s how mine looks too
2021-06-12 13:49:12,wallstreetbets,Yep. I see it exactly. 📈Excellent.
2021-06-12 13:49:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-12 13:50:04,wallstreetbets,You went full retard.
2021-06-12 13:50:39,wallstreetbets,July 2020
2021-06-12 13:51:19,wallstreetbets,End of January haha. What happened then??
2021-06-12 13:51:44,wallstreetbets,Chart doesn't go to zero so my guess is that you somehow never found this place
2021-06-12 13:52:21,wallstreetbets,I guess you can feel every heartbeat since January 😂😂😂💎💎🚀🚀. To be a member of WSB you got to have a very good mental health and never blow more than you can afford to lose.
2021-06-12 13:52:40,wallstreetbets,I believe this occurrence is called “reversion to the mean”.
2021-06-12 13:53:04,wallstreetbets,Umbasa

2021-06-12 13:56:11,wallstreetbets,You found the shit posts of WSB.
2021-06-12 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,Meanwhile VT had 40% gains since july with almost no risk.
2021-06-12 13:56:33,wallstreetbets,"Bottom left, but I’m not sure it’s my first time here"
2021-06-12 13:56:39,wallstreetbets,i give myself 4-6 weeks…
2021-06-12 13:56:59,wallstreetbets,Just turn the chart upside down Stonks!
2021-06-12 13:57:58,wallstreetbets,If you came to lose money then you’ve found the right place.
2021-06-12 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,You built a time machine and went back months!
2021-06-12 13:58:10,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you're about to bounce of that strong 20k ""fuck me"" resistance"
2021-06-12 13:58:22,wallstreetbets,you found this place out during the peak and now your money is half of what it was when you bought it. good job
2021-06-12 13:58:35,wallstreetbets,Let it ride!
2021-06-12 13:59:25,wallstreetbets,Were options involved?
2021-06-12 13:59:50,wallstreetbets,I think it’s Jan 2021. Am I right?
2021-06-12 14:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you found Reddit in late January, and WSB in may"
2021-06-12 14:00:49,wallstreetbets,HahahaHAHAHA CAUSE YOU LOSSED MONEY THATS HILARIOUS
2021-06-12 14:01:20,wallstreetbets,At least you’re up on the year

2021-06-12 14:06:39,wallstreetbets,Actually not a loss seeing as you’re still up from where you started
2021-06-12 14:07:21,wallstreetbets,"End of Jan it looks like, shits all over the place after that."
2021-06-12 14:08:49,wallstreetbets,How?! What did you gamble it on?
2021-06-12 14:09:48,wallstreetbets,The peak? 😂 this is the way.
2021-06-12 14:10:47,wallstreetbets,December 2020
2021-06-12 14:11:06,wallstreetbets,Haha same
2021-06-12 14:11:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry but I’m with this person, also have no clue how and where to spot. Noob here"
2021-06-12 14:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Mid-late janurary. Before then, it's a steady climb. After that, it's completely erratic."
2021-06-12 14:12:37,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-12 14:12:43,wallstreetbets,You handsome dapper. Easier to spot when you flip the picture
2021-06-12 14:12:44,wallstreetbets,Lol right
2021-06-12 14:13:52,wallstreetbets,I was lurking for a while too. I would suspect that you bought in almost at the top of may though. I only recently took a position in $gme$ on Thursday afternoon. I suspected that it would be attacked hard as it was the last quarterly.
2021-06-12 14:14:30,wallstreetbets,dw that's a bullish pattern
2021-06-12 14:15:21,wallstreetbets,Get a plate of tendies while you’re here

2021-06-12 14:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh, oh, I see it… right there!"
2021-06-12 14:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Bullshit, you're still up"
2021-06-12 14:20:47,wallstreetbets,Dont worry mate. Only big highs possible with steep lows
2021-06-12 14:22:41,wallstreetbets,And all the times you took a break.

2021-06-12 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna say early May…this is why you take your profits when you’re up big instead of just saying “diamond hands diamond hands” and then referring to yourself as a long term investor after it tanks and you’re stuck holding it. Sorry to rant but I’ve been there and it blows.
2021-06-12 15:59:16,wallstreetbets,Looks like you’ve hit support. Should be good for a bounce back

Some advice I would live to give myself in my early 20s would be to invest as much a possible, living well below my me  as me. Most of my investment should have been great companies with a great leader and heavy insider investment. Hold steady because ultimately the turtle wins the race but you should have 10% to 15% of my investment in high risk high reward companies. The highs and lows of going all in on high risk high reward companies is no good for the nerves. Sit back and relax and let time and 20% returns grow a nice stockpile of cash. It’s not a sprint it is a marathon."

2021-06-12 14:40:49,wallstreetbets,"See if you're eligible for a ROTH IRA (or possibly a ROTH 401K). I know, you're probably young and all retirement accounts sound boomer boring, and they probably are, but, hear me out ...

You may know that contributions made to a traditional IRA are tax deductible and NOT tax deductible for ROTH IRAs. However... The beauty of ROTH IRAs is that nothing you hold, buy or sell inside a ROTH is taxable. So you can trade your way to a fortune and not pay tax on it.  And, when you're finally old enough to start getting regular disbursements from your ROTH IRA, the money doesn't normally count as income for tax purposes then either, unlike with a traditional IRA. Win!  
One other potentially helpful thing about a ROTH IRA... It is possible, in certain situations, to take out some/all of your profits without being hit with penalties, unlike with a traditional IRA.

Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and other big names offer 'self directed' ROTH accounts but not all companies do. You need 'self directed' because then you can do your own investing - trading - if you want. I have accounts with both of those companies and was approved for option trading within my ROTH IRA as well (once I adjusted my account profile to show I was OK with high risks).

Just an idea for you to think about. Of course you should do your own research before doing anything at all. :)"

2021-06-12 13:30:59,wallstreetbets,"Me too.  Made some pretty poor long term decisions around Nov 2019 which have thankfully recovered.

Started the daily again March 2020.  Hadn't played much since 2010-2011, when my $500 Scottrade account managed to outperform my $100K+ 401K in terms of total $$ gains (even factoring in contributions).  Ended up leaving that money sitting there to rust as I focused on career and new family.
March changed that.  Had some idle time and idle cash.  Decided I had already wasted too much time putting together bank rolls for kids' futures.  Now it's a part-time job, and full-time obsession trying to make up for lost time without gambling too much.  Figuring if I can keep my head in the game, should be able to make goal."

Edit: sorry it was actually BB that gave me 30% gains and WISH 68%, CLNE actually took me to 30-40% when it hit peak $13….

All these gains evaporated Wednesday-Friday

1.) Go in deep on a volatility index hours before the fed says that she won't touch interest rates for 2yrs.  Be stubborn...hold that m'fer.

2.) Go really deep on the company you work for right as big announcements come out to public.  Wait a day, and have yet another analyst downgrade their outlook on your company despite the great news.  This can successfully work time and time again.  Don't be a pussy...keep putting more in.  Finally break even...have not one but two banks change their outlook on your right before exciting new products launched."

If I were a bag holder though...already 60% down.  I'd be super excited about the pump right now.  Not to get my 60% back, but just to make losses less.  Would keep a super close eye on it, because looks like it still has downside potential.

Looks like you're in for a full lesson.

Good luck to you."
2021-06-12 13:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Honestly...the announced plays will probably not get you there.  WSB is a good place to look for ideas and momentum.  Parsing the whole of multiple exchanges daily isn't doable.  WSB gives some.focused points of attention.  Still gotta do your own DD and TA, evaluate your own comfort with the risk, and then keep a damn good eye on it.  Ain't nothing on WSB a good decision for passive investing.  Other subs for that.  This is the casino.  That guy that's been rolling for 15mins with a massive stack, can roll 7 as soon as your money is on the table.  That's my PSA for the day."

I've been tracking what plays I would have made, and likely outcomes too.  Trying to get more towards playing gut than head...because so far my gut has outperformed my head by at least 10X...sometimes 20X.  Had I played gut last year, I would already be at goal of two fully funded college accounts and would now be working on paying off house.  Keep playing too conservative though...probably because what the money represents.  Keep threatening to open up a second account for gut plays and let the chips fall where they may."

2021-06-12 18:29:23,wallstreetbets,"I know that you probably already know this, but this is wsb so… what plays you ‘would have made’ is not an indicator of future success- it is completely different when you have skin in the game, and when your money isn’t invested your ‘gut feel’ is completely different to when your money is invested. Specifically, freeing up money to invest in new things- what do I sell what do I keep? If you haven’t invested all your money, how much do I keep out of it? That 10’000 I have for safety would be 30’000 if I just put it all on! Then I know I would take it out and be happy with that… etc etc. 

This is literally gambling. If you have taken steps to tell yourself otherwise, stop taking those steps! No play is once in a lifetime, unless you stop. And the worst thing you can do is win big early, you’ll always have that in the back of your ‘gut’ telling you this next play is the one, this is the one that will bring it back."
2021-06-12 19:52:14,wallstreetbets,"I feel that. Most of my stuff is small gains, but I have some stuff in index funds and stocks that give slow growth and monthly dividends. That’s very slow but it’s all the long game"

2021-06-12 19:21:34,wallstreetbets,I should probably clarify.  When I say that I've been tracking which plays I would have made...I mean real points in time where I've chosen a safer play against what was right in front of me and the gut was saying yes.  Lot of regret on missed gains over the past year...no doubt.  I'm here on WSB to figure out how to take rational thinking out of the equation.

2021-06-12 11:47:48,wallstreetbets,I V R and UWMC go hand in hand they. Both have solid technicals rn. Except I V R has more potential with over 20% short volume and a huge gap on the upside to fill. It did a 20% run up too and held its value. These are both winning plays!
2021-06-12 12:47:33,wallstreetbets,"What do you guys consider RKT?  2, 8, 20 a share?"

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All crashes are similar, only perceptions change.  Some of you have not spent 10 yrs compensating for your small penis by studying market crashes, and it fucking shows!

&#x200B;

Here's some observations about the market from a paranoid mere fleshy balls. This post will discuss forecasting and trading bear market moves using exclusively technical analysis methods. If you're here to troll, that's probably all you need to know and you can skip to the comments section. For anyone else, let's apply some mathematics and market geometry (We're just going look at some lines, relax).

&#x200B;

Through this post I'll provide some evidence for the following things, which most people think can not be true;

&#x200B;

**Paradoxical truths about market tops**

&#x200B;

* All assets top and drop in a pretty similar fashion

It's possible to study the charting patterns and market conditions of the Dow Jones through the years 1927 - 1931 and then use the same principles learned from that to apply to a GME crash in 2021. Understanding how the SPX topped and dropped in 2007 can supply you with a model to understand the recent drops in stocks like PLTR.

&#x200B;

* Most topping and bottoming areas in a market can be approximated months/years before they fill

There were methods to approximate the high point before the Great Depression (1929) from as far back as 1908 - 1918. The level where VIAC made its spectacular high and entered into capitulation could have been defined as early as 2009. Crashes, historically, have always had strong forward looking indicators to hint at them coming, long in advance of them coming.

&#x200B;

* Fundamental news compliments technical support and resistance levels / known chart patterns

This is the one that fucks most people up. Your mind seeks out a logical chain of cause and effect and it therefore stands to reason new causes bring about new effects and these could not be foreseeable using technical analysis. But didn't you see all the bears in 2019? From a technical perspective, the March 2020 drop was one of the most anticipated drops ever.

&#x200B;

In short, if you're not using the magic lines you might just have no fucking idea what is going on.

&#x200B;

I know how dumb all of that sounds, so let's move into applying some models to support these big claims. We'll start with having a look at some historical crashes in the SPX and DJI. This is where a lot of these concepts were taken from. Analysis of every drop in the DJI or SPX over the last 100 and something years. Looking for consistencies in these drops, finding forward looking rules that would have forecast them and then designing trading patterns to take advantage of these moves.

&#x200B;

I suppose the first thing one would want to do before seeing if you can apply charting patterns from the Dow in the 1900's to the Dow of the 2000's would be to check how well the Dow or today and then relate to each other. Because there should be no relationship, right? Tech's changed. World's moved on. Etc etc. Should be no obvious matching points in these markets, right?

&#x200B;

Let's start with the two most famous crashes that no one ever remembers because a much more famous one came after. The 1908 and 1918 bears.

&#x200B;

**1908's Panic Crash**

&#x200B;

In 1908 there was a 50% drop in the stock market. This was a camel crash. With two crashes happening within close proximity to each other.

Before both of the crashes here the market sold off, and then made 1.62 expansions into the high.

https://preview.redd.it/fkaroqksmu471.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d176582f7f4bdefe63fd39ec127421e8674a9b6

 

From the topping swings the full drop in the respective crashes were into the 1.61 on the left and into the 2.61 on the right.

  

https://preview.redd.it/aa14v3nwmu471.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b4adb6d4d19829452131dffe2f1c61cb0c8bd7

 

In both crashes the fall would stop around 76/78% of the last upswing. The second would make a low a tiny bit under the first.

Both moves would extend about 500% of the little topping move. And both would find strong support when back above 4.23.

The full drop was about 500% but an obvious support level at 423%. ([See extensions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciextensions.asp))

&#x200B;

 

**2000 - 2008**

100 years later there'd be another couple of crash. One on the busting of the tech bubble in 2000 and the other when investment banks sold time bombs to the market during 2006 and they blew up heading into 2008. Resulting in a 50% drop in the stock markets.

Before both of the crashes here the market sold off, and then made 1.62 expansions into the high.

(Psst: In case you missed it, I copy and pasted all of that. Even it was 100 years later. Only the prices changed. Not the percentages - the same rule set to trade the 1908 and 1918 crashes would have worked in 2000 and 2008. And the news releases through the crashes did not make a tiny bit of difference to any of that)

&#x200B;

 

I don't have 10 yrs to explain all this shit to you, so we'll take some shortcuts by just taking a few key principles from historic crashes and then applying them to modern day stock moves. And to make it interesting we'll pick some assets that should not be able to sync up with each other. We'll take the DJI crash of the 1930s and the GME crash from 350 (Second rally).

&#x200B;

We're going to look at these concepts;

&#x200B;

* Markets will top and bottom on 1.61 extensions
* When 161s are broken the market will usually continue further
* Markets will form predictable patterns during a bull trap
* Using the correct fib levels can give you accuracy on highs/lows within 20%, on the biggest moves.

&#x200B;

All of the charts I am posting here are from a couple months ago and they are lifted from real time forward looking analysis on GME. None of this was curve-fitted to the move after. Everything I am posting now I posted at the time.

It started with the 161 high. Spiking a little above there but then settling under there in the retest and this would mark out the top of the move. This was pretty obvious to see setting up in real time if you applied the rules learned from previous market tops.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/culmsvdknu471.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89e259562fd00d4329d4b1d295ea0daff3e5a9a

 

The market would then trade from the 161 high into a 161 low. This is where the selling would take a pause and price went sideways for a while.

https://preview.redd.it/54tjfiymnu471.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d836af77959c284571eb2adc4c160c66ea1592

 

The market's failure to be able to hold this 161 as a support level was the warning this move was going to drop more. Not only a warning if would drop more, but also told us we should be looking for some sort of harmonic pattern to tell us where we should be looking for the drop to start. Here's the same couplet of signals in the DJI of 1929.

 

https://preview.redd.it/4ccm9v1pnu471.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=88d80d0ebf53e8a2446f11feb495b44d9bc3c1fd

 

The big break. Takes the market down about 50%. And then from that 50% down it entered into a dummy rally / bull trap, which ends up forming as bearish butterfly before the real sell off begins.

And after GME dropped pretty much the exact same percentage - the same sequence of swings would happen to set up the same move.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfaeulxqnu471.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=965b6c71c5417c9d2508c8fb6b6e1df5253d5e40

 

At which point, this forecast could be made.

https://preview.redd.it/anq1ubrsnu471.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a480db307d0d3e8d62250936489c952dbbf8324

 

Which would be a pretty accurate representation of the GME move that would follow.

 

https://preview.redd.it/h384kzjunu471.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f9a4e7cf3be981287148495784f69e9d6322a3

 

These same principles could later be applied to AMC.

Making a top on the 161.

https://preview.redd.it/b5etiuwwnu471.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=bafa42120a0ce9d5c37677796f4762ad106914bc

 

It would then drop 50% before entering into a bull trap rally and then settle into this long slow ranging pattern.

 

https://preview.redd.it/dxpulvnznu471.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=28cfa52f48b7d507fa24dd69782fefac18b7e4aa

 

Using the basic rules covered so far, this would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ucn2qlq1ou471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f920e389f0dec9de770cae4cd9e81a4420f77e8e

 As with the GME move at the time, this AMC move is read as a bull flag by the AMC buyers. That the 50% drop was a healthy correction and now this is the ideal buying opportunity. And the public reacting these sorts of moves in this way has also been a [constant since the 1920s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) 

https://preview.redd.it/2mc9jpt3ou471.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad62f6072f8392a8dd0ffaf3510d5331fdf21d71

 

An interesting little bit of history not many people know. On March 8th of 1929, a new investment pool was started. From the 8th to the 17th they run a pump and dump on a stock. Driving up 50% and then selling out and letting it crash. [They made about $100 million doing this](https://youtu.be/FAZjlxWNszw?t=1059) \- watch up to 19.10, you'll see a meme.

Your final statement implies buying OTM puts on AMC towards the 20$ would be theoretically lucrative if the market behaves as your prediction. 

I guess a way to seek a hole in your theory would be to look for similar patterns formed in previous stocks or points in time, as seen during the market crashes discussed, that never truly materialized as they did in this model.

I'd say this would have to be dealt with on a case to case basis. It's not as if TA is one single thing. There's many different methods. it's not possible to make informed blanket statements.  TA has subjective qualities and there is also known levels of variance to be expected. Do you remember when the hedge funds were losing late 2019 shorting the market?

2021-06-12 12:56:04,wallstreetbets,"I've been saying for a couple months the sequence of events I'd expect to see in a big crash would be;

**Crypto crash**

In a risk off setting this is the most speculative thing and the drop in that should come first. [Here's my mentions of this at the high](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeatTheBear/comments/mt2m4d/a_crash_in_btc_would_probably_be_an_early_warning/)

&#x200B;

**Speculative stocks first over-perform but then turn into crashes**

Markets are always paradoxically strong before reversing. And the assets that may become the weakest are usually the strongest just before this all starts. You can look up the pricing of CDOs in 2006 and through 2007 for a good reference point on this.  And we've seen a lot of this in the meme stocks recently. 

&#x200B;

**Flight to cash** 

The natural stepping-stone for investors pulling out of risk markets is to go to the USD while they decide what to do with their money next. This cashing out of the market should have its first signs in the gaining of the USD against other major currencies. The DYX should reverse its downtrend and start to become a top performing asset (Signs of this maybe starting over the last week or two). 

&#x200B;

**Broad weakening of the markets**

Probably off of some sort of fundamental trigger. Some sort of unexpected event happening causing the start of the sell off in blue chip stocks, ETFs and resulting in broad market drops in the indices.  Given the current state of things, I'd expect to see this start within the next 3 months."

When your idiot friend or neighbor is talking to you about how so and so tech company is the next big thing or that if you put money into real estate you'll double or triple it within months if not weeks the crash is right around the corner.  Hell i was 18 years old when the dotcom bubble burst and everyone knew that was coming, then lived in Naples Florida in the mid to late 2000s and would drive up I75 every day going to work and see the same billboards advertising housing developments that the only thing that ever changed was the price kept going up.  Meanwhile ive got friends who are working barely minimum wage jobs and are now buying those homes.  Didn't take a genius to figure it out that was unsustainable.

My best guessestimate of what brings this one on.  Stagflation.  Inflation doesn't turn out so transitory.  And the narrative that this is going to be like the roaring 20's because hey they had a virus and got through that is missing the key component of you know having a bunch of the world's countries lose like 10% of their male population in a war then factor in a pandemic on top of that the people who were still around had a much better labor market to return to.  I mean what's the real true figure on how many businesses were lost during COVID and how what is the real unemployment number.  I think the assumption that we are going to be roaring again is based on the false idea that those numbers are reliable.  I can drive down the main street in my little podunk town and see a couple of dozen businesses that closed and nothing has replaced them.  I'm seeing signs everywhere and all i think it will take is just one shitty GDP report to set the entire house of cards on fire."

2021-06-12 15:17:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they can hide all that under GDP growth that wont be the catalyst.  Market might go sideways for a little bit but it wont correct as long as we keep meeting or exceeding GDP growth.  My thoughts are that once that number fails to meet expectations we will see a sell off into correction territory which will then lead stagflation and a steady decline downward.  I think the stagflation part will come because the economies of China and India will grow after this and continue growing thusly propping up commodity prices and keeping inflation up despite the US going into a downturn.
2021-06-12 13:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Broadly speaking, the economy is very unstable at the moment, so I don’t doubt if a major crash happens soon.

As Warren Buffet says, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”

Another age old sign of an impending market crash is euphoria. Leading up to the Great Depression, literally everyone was getting interested in the stock market. People were taking out loans to invest in the market. That is basically what is happening now. 

And similar to the .com bubble, there’s euphoria surrounding terrible companies without earnings (GME, AMC, Hertz, etc.).

2021-06-12 13:46:26,wallstreetbets,">What surprises me is that not many analysts are bearish right now.

But they never are at the high.  And the reason is the first signals come early. Making people expect it early and then encounter a lot of stuff suggesting they are fucking stupid. And by the high, they still think it's going down but have started to hedge the way in which they speak about it.

It's pretty easy to find old news reports from just before the 2000 high in tech showing this. There were early bears but as the market made wild 20% jumps people expected it less and less. By the jump from 100 - 120 a lot of people thought the bulls has broken, but that was the high - and 100 would not be crossed again once broken to the downside for many years to come."

2021-06-12 17:58:24,wallstreetbets,Not the person you replied to. I think in our current market conditions the 100->120 could be the equivalent of the SP going to 4400+ in the first half.

Here's a couple things I have in mind when looking at a big drop, and some things hinting it may be sooner rather than later.

\>so convinced in a large drop?

&#x200B;

I'm not convinced. My trade plans all have exit signals for me being wrong. The optimist in me still hopes I am a fucking idiot.  But I've been very surprised how well these have worked in the past. It worked really well in March. High to low of the move both were marked by the 161 fib - which was astonishing."
2021-06-12 18:01:38,wallstreetbets,"When considering a blow off of that style in the SPX today, what I'd expect to see would be about 20 - 25% out of the the previous high.  If this was yet to come, I'd be looking for my next selling levels in the SPX at 4,700 - 4,800 and my system stop loss is just over 5,000.

&#x200B;

Here's a cut/paste of a comment I made speaking about this elsewhere recently when asked about a parabolic move coming in the SPX.

&#x200B;

>As a short, it is a risk that can not be ruled out. SPX could make another 20% jump and trade around 4,800 in such a case and that would really sting the bears.  
>  
>The reason I am willing to short early is before the parabolic topping move it's common to see a 30 - 38% drop. And then the topping move being a 161 of that. This is what the March drop was. And then we've been in a parabolic market since then. So here I'm trading off the 161s of that  - which is about 20 - 25% above the last high

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR : Way More Than you Think I've seen several theses defending the investment in Corsair, but it seems that most of you are looking at it as if it were a company that sells keyboards and few components.

For that reason, I come to elaborate a bit on what kind of company it is.

To put us in context, Corsair has been trading sideways for about 3-4 months since its peak to 45 produced by the boom in disruptive companies. It is a recent IPO, it went public in September 2020.

It is clear that there are funds interested in keeping it below 35, as there have been moments of 6% drop in the aftermarket with a ridiculous volume : less than 50,000.

Also on the other hand there is downward pressure: Eagletree Capital, as I understand, has to reduce its position in Corsair from the current 61% to 10% in less than 5 years, which is helping to keep the price flat.

Edit: apparently this eagletree Capital was a fake new, so not confirmed. anyways they reduced position from 70% to 61%, so they are atleast taking some profit.

Let's talk numbers:

Corsair's latest report has shattered all expectations:

· EPS of 0.58 versus the 0.25 estimate.

· A gross margin of 30.3%.

· Revenue increased 72%  YoY.

· Adjusted ebitda was up 197% to 80.4M

· They reduced debt by 28M

**Basically beat all 4 estimates.**

And Corsair improved forecast from 1.8B to 2.1B. They tend to be quite cautious with their estimates, just look at how they have far outperformed analysts in past quarters.

And now, let's get to the key point. I see a very repeated comment and that is the comparison between Corsair and Logitech or Dell.

They have nothing to do with each other.

Corsair's strength is how well it utilizes its capital to obtain profitable ventures.

This is where the good stuff comes in.

· Corsair owns elgato. That company that has a monopoly on capture, green screens, spotlights, streamdeck... and aggressively increasing their products to cameras, capture, mic stands, microphones... I don't know how high up you are in the streaming world, but elgato is literally in any setup. And if you see the exponential growth of Twitch, add 1 + 1. Not only for streamers, but also the work at home movement is driving the sale of their products.

· Corsair has just acquired in February 2021 Visuals by impulse, a company dedicated to the creation of overlays and alerts, to further monopolize the stream environment.

· Corsair owns Scuf gaming, a company dedicated to custom controllers for pc, xbox or play station.

· Corsair owns Gamer Sensei, a platform that connects professionals or people skilled in video games with others who want to improve their level.

· Corsair owns origin pc, a platform for selling peripherals and pre-assembled computers.

**The acquisition of Visuals by impulse, gamer sensei and scuf gaming occurred in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In other words, they have an insurmountable acquisition hunger.**

And of course, Corsair, market leader in peripherals and components in various niche markets, the king of RGB, amazing towers, probably the best software and a HUB to control all your components.

Basically it remains to expand into the mobile sector, but their intentions are quite clear, they are looking to be leaders in multiple sectors.

When I was younger, about 10 years ago, if you liked video games you were basically the class geek, and your chances of being bullied increased dramatically.

Now things have changed, the freak is basically the one who doesn't play. And watching streamings has become the new television for the new generations.

One of the arguments against corsair is that once the pandemic is over people will stop playing and do other things. You can tell they have never met a gamer. When a person starts, they don't stop. You don't buy a $2500 computer and trade it in for a $500 computer later. And a gamer, is always a gamer.

It is also very relevant the fact that there is still a lot of population without internet access and the video game sector is one of the most expanding sectors ahead, which is a tremendously bullish argument.

And another plus point, this incredible surpassing of expectations has happened in an environment with chip problems, where people didn't have graphics cards (or they were extremely expensive), nor did they have PS5 to buy and stream with it, and Corsair itself has said that they focused on building only premium products with high margins to stay competent. This clearly says how much potential they have if they have overcome such a difficult time.

**TL:DR:**

I could give many empty arguments, talk about shorts, to the moon.... but that's not the point. We are talking about a temporarily manipulated high growth company trading at a FORWARD PER of almost 15. It is a simply ridiculous situation, and even more with the current valuations shown by the market.

45-50$ is the fair value, but we can go even higher.

2021-06-12 14:33:33,wallstreetbets,"Worst case scenario is keep going from 30 to 35 until we win funds. So not that bad. Well, or a mundial crash, but that affect to every single stocks. You cant be bad buying a 20 PE ratio high grow stock."
2021-06-12 16:06:28,wallstreetbets,"Amc is likely to go to between 5-10 sometime in the next month or so. Even if CRSR doesn't run from WSB remembering it, the most you're likely to be down on it ever from the current price is 5%.  Long term good company with great fundamentals and its basically at its floor price."
2021-06-12 12:58:50,wallstreetbets,I regret not putting more into Nvidia honestly. Corsair makes badass components plus this dude took the time to write this so yeah I’m in
2021-06-12 12:19:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking AMD is gonna really start clapping cheeks in the coming years. Such an a amazing turn around for the company, and they’re so consumer focused unlike Nvidia."

2021-06-12 17:27:17,wallstreetbets,Actually reached  top 5 reddit sentiment today. Another DD reached 1400 votes on friday. We just need a little push.
2021-06-12 16:42:38,wallstreetbets,"oh man, those were the days of sick covered calls and cash secured puts premiums. I made 1.7% of my entire networth in covered calls in january I think. I miss that"
2021-06-12 17:56:03,wallstreetbets,Coming to get you my friend!
2021-06-12 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,"Most repeated case is simply that once corona ends people will go out and come back to normal life and will stop spending on games. Simply no sense. Anyways, as I pointed, ridiculous valuation is more due manipulation than bears. And with the little freefloat corsair has we could easily change that pattern."
2021-06-12 10:52:38,wallstreetbets,Yesterday a DD reached frontpage with 1200+ votes. Went into top 10 trendy and  recieved a lot of love before close. Lets see if this is the time we fly. Just need to broke that funds pattern. And corsair small market  cap/free float can help us a lot doing that.
2021-06-12 14:49:58,wallstreetbets,That will become quickly insignificant if volume picks up.
2021-06-12 14:36:14,wallstreetbets,"Already went down to 60%. Anyways, that is bad just if they decide to sell, but what if they want to hold most of them? Is possitive in this case, since it will keep free float low so we can move the price really fast. Worst case scenario, thoose stocks will be bought by others funds and retails, so not that bad."
2021-06-12 16:10:57,wallstreetbets,"I mean, whatever they are doing now is clearly working for CRSR.  Why does them owning a large portion of the company mean negatives on the horizon?

If you're talking about share unloading - ya that sucks, and it holds the price down...but it is a good stock, and it won't stay undervalued forever.  Once the selling pressure subsides it will spring back"
2021-06-12 15:31:53,wallstreetbets,Dunno If I misstyped something. Normal PE is 20.3 and Forward PE between 15-17.
2021-06-12 13:56:31,wallstreetbets,I feel like logi is on its way down on a correction though
2021-06-12 13:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

2021-06-12 14:56:17,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been diamond handing in one of my cash accounts since the IPO average of 15.36 I heard Corsair was IPOing and said hell yeah I’ll jump in, then I listened in on the meetings, did DD and seen what they really were about and decided to hold, of course I sold some calls and shares on that first ride up but still have my average lol. Now that it’s consolidated, it’s getting ready for its next moves and I jumped in on my other account. Going to drop more Monday and will continue to add as I see momentum push forward. Good job though giving some substance to this company!"
2021-06-12 15:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Definitely massive upside long term, it has struggled of late, but it has also been out of site and dumped into the growth stock bucket which was out of style.  Waiting for it to come back any time now.

Esports will totally overtake traditional sports like the NFL in our lifetime"
2021-06-12 13:32:56,wallstreetbets,Not seeing the validity of that argument the risk reward is fantastic at CRSR.
2021-06-12 13:20:37,wallstreetbets,Truth 💯
2021-06-12 16:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Uh no, that is not going to happen in any of our lifetimes"

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed 3600+ IPOs over the past two decades to determine if you should buy into an IPO. Here are the results! Let’s be real here. We all have bought into an IPO that we regretted. We might have been swayed by the Red Herring report, the marketing pitch, or the investment banks' roadshow. I personally have lost money in both the IPOs that I bought into and now avoid IPOs like the plague. However, I wanted to keep my personal experience out of the analysis and wanted to understand

**Whether IPOs in general make or lose money for the average investor?**

**Where is the data from:** iposcoop.com

This is the first time in any of the analyses that I have done where the data was accessible directly in a usable format. They have documented almost all of the IPOs from 2000. I have cross verified the data with [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/) and have observed coverage of more than 90%. This period covers a wide variety of situations such as the dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis, market rally following the crisis, etc. which implies that our analysis covers both bear and bull market.,

All the IPOs and my analysis have been shared on a Google sheet at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/8cfa0ni07u471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc604e1016e7aa4550141751f9904567d7209daf

**Analysis**

Before we jump into the analysis, there are some things we need to understand about IPOs (if you know the inner workings of an IPO, please feel free to skip to the results). When a company wants to go public, they hire investment bankers to sell the shares. The investment banks are then responsible for creating interest, choosing the optimum time to go public, and make sure the price is right so that there is enough demand. But the banks offer a large share of the allocated stock to institutional investors such as pensions, endowments, or hedge funds. Retail brokerages can end up getting shares, but they may make up only [10% of the total allotment](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price).

Adding to this, additional factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not. (i.e., Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients). For e.g., in the case of [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

I have factored in the above limitations and have calculated the historical performance of the IPOs in two different ways

a. You get the IPO allocated at the offer price (the price at which institutional investors are buying)

b. You buy the IPO when the market opens on the listing day (opening price)

For the above scenarios, I have analyzed the following

* Listing Change (Difference between Opening price and Offer price)
* One day change - inclusive of listing
* One day change - exclusive of listing

To make it simple, let’s take the example of company X. If the offer price of the IPO is $10, the Opening price on the day of the IPO is $12 and the Closing price is $15 then,

* Listing change is +20%
* One day change inclusive of the listing is +50%
* One day change exclusive of the listing is +25%

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/vby0prh27u471.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6276dde250412988455ba3d78d3b7e37418e24

On average, IPOs did make money for the investor. But the amount is significantly different if you got allocated the IPO at offer price vs you bought the IPO at market open. The average listing change over the last two decades was 12% and the average one-day gain in the market inclusive of the listing was 13.6%. Adding to this more than 68% of the IPOs ended in green on the listing day.

But the story is markedly different if you choose to buy at the market open. Only 48% of the IPOs ended at a price higher than the opening price and the average change was a mere 1.3%. Now that it’s out of the way, diving deeper into the data brings interesting insights.

https://preview.redd.it/7f5sbp547u471.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=733dc5a1fb88e6c1d49490c2278c0e17d20913f3

Above is the list of top 10 IPOs having the most amount of gain on listing day. Baidu.com made a whopping 354% on its listing day. Another interesting observation is 6 out of 10 companies in the list were listed in 2000 and were predominantly tech companies (just before the dot com crash). But not all companies had a great experience on the IPO day. Here is a list of the worse performing companies on the day of listing. 

https://preview.redd.it/562w2az57u471.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfeeb4dcd44348538c657d3cfc0fb4a3920e6d59

There are certainly some familiar names on the list. [Funko IPO](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/funko-stock-plunges-in-ipo-shocker/) is considered to have the worst first-day return for an IPO in the last two decades. Sundial Growers also had a rough time in the market on its listing day with the stock losing 35% of the value in one day. 

https://preview.redd.it/c71zm1j77u471.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b5009abef9c0e0f90c4166767ef878824a730

I also calculated the IPO returns for each year after 2000. As expected, the year 2000 was the most successful year for an IPO with an average return (inclusive of listing gain) of 35%. The worst year was 2008 (after the financial crisis) with only a 2.3% return. This graph also showcases two important things

a. On average the IPOs have made positive returns every year in the last two decades

b. There is a vast difference in your returns based on if you got the stock at offer price vs opening price and the trend holds across the years.

This brings us to our final question of which investment bank made the most number of IPOs and how was their performance on listing day

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dxy9xq597u471.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4dbd6096edbb790669325b91cce48759b4f393)

Out of the top 10 list, only 3 Investment banks had below-average returns. We are not going to draw any conclusion from this as an IPO is usually handled by multiple banks in partnership and the above analysis is done using Fuzzy match (its an approximate match)

**Limitations of the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a.  We don’t have 100% coverage for the IPOs done since 2000. From comparing to other sources, I could observe more than 90% coverage and I feel that this should be representative of the whole.

b.  There is no data showcasing what percentage of each IPO was offered to the retail investor.

**Conclusion:** I have some theories to explain the IPO performance. I think it’s driven mainly by two factors. One being the hype/PR generated by the investment bank about the company and the second is that I think the investment banks slightly price the IPO lower than the market value of the company so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO). Both these factors contribute to the listing as well as the one-day gain that we see across the board.

Overall, this once again seems to a situation where having money makes you more money (institutional investors having easier access to the IPO) but as the analysis shows retail investors can still make significant gains by buying into an IPO!

Google Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHsXW7-2bu0jafuZe_0LmapSE5V5KXYF14Oe0lG2TKA/edit?usp=sharing)

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. If you are planning to invest in an IPO, make sure your brokerage support purchasing IPOs, minimum criteria to participate, and also the historical track record of your brokerage in issuing IPOs. All of this will significantly improve your chances of getting the IPO issued at the offer price.*"
2021-06-12 09:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Great data. Thank you for this. But let me see if I got this straight. 

Are you telling me that institutional investors and heddgies have constructed an exclusive system around IPOs that gives them a dramatic advantage over retail investors who aren’t part of their arbitrary two-class construct. 

This is blowing my mind.

Edit: aparently my sarcasm wasn’t palpable enough."
2021-06-12 09:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Nice. I learned 2 things. 1st, If Morgan-Stanley is involved, I will make that IPO bet. 2nd, My funko pop collection is worthless. I just hope my beanie baby collection holds value."
2021-06-12 10:03:24,wallstreetbets,"One of the things that immediately jumps out at me from this data: look at the years with highest number of IPOs. Theres a massive spike in IPOs during years when the market as a whole is overvalued. The first people in the door therefore get to make a value and growth play while people buying on the market usually just get the growth play. This is likely a major contributing factor in the differential for performance between offer price vs opening price and therefore the difference between performance for institutional vs retail. 

It makes sense from the underwriters and investors perspective to go to market when you can get the biggest capital raise you can. Sort of like the other side of the coin of doing share buybacks when your stock is cheap, but I'd be curious to see how IPOs performed in those IPO rush years vs more average years."
2021-06-12 09:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for reading. I have a sub where I do similar analysis and track trending stocks. Do check it out if you are interested.   
  
IPO performance over a longer period is definitely in the works! This analysis itself was very long. I did not want to cram any more information. The next one would contain  
1.	Performance over 1 week, one month, three months, etc.  
2.	Ideal time to buy into an IPO  
3.	Industry-wise performance split (whether a large chunk of returns are by tech ipos?)  
The main issue quality financial data going back that far is not available for free. I tried Yahoo finance but there were a lot of inconsistencies. Any suggestions for free and easy to access historical financial data would be much appreciated.   
  
Next week’s analysis will be focused on the best investments you can make in relation to the higher inflation trends that we are seeing now.

2021-06-12 13:34:57,wallstreetbets,"I used to day trade, 5000 trades a year, back around 1999-2004.  IPOs were fun on day 1.  I watched sycamore networks open at 200+ and drop like a rock.  I put my bid in at 111.51 (yeah, never on a round number)  back then you had to put your bid and asks in and wait for 10 to 15 minutes to execute on hot stocks.  my bid got bought at 111.51, and I immediately put my ask in at 148.49 and it sold.   All of this within 30 minutes of it going live.  Months after that it got crushed down to 2.   Afterwards, I analyzed all of the IPOs of the period, if I had shorted all of them 1 week after going live, I would have made a fortune.   I see the same with SPAQs this past year.  But... with WSB, shorting a SPAQ is a huge risk.  Besides, I don't daytrade  now.  DIAMOND HANDS.... and then back to my real job.  Morale, when you see stupidity, take the other side."

2021-06-12 11:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Lol people who buy IPOs are throwing away their money. Companies don't go public because they are good investments, they go public because they are unable to raise equity in the private markets and are willing to pay an IB an underwriting fee (that's based on capital raised) to sell an overpriced security to unsophisticated retail investors.

Edit: Underestimated the amount of windowlickers with an opinion on IPOs. When I said they are unable to raise private equity I **obviously** was referring to this specific round of fund raising."

2021-06-12 10:41:12,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you would have made money from being allocated shares is the reason most companies are considering SPACs or direct listings. Investment banks are underselling so many companies and short changing them. They're left with less capital that would have been beneficial for growth. 

I think doing a broad analysis of IPOs is useless, however, since each company is uniquely different. How is analyzing buying when they're first made available useful information for buying MongoDB, or Snowflake, or Zenga, or SNAP. They're all fundamentally different companies and to say you should or shouldn't buy a company because generally you'll make money on an IPO is awful DD."

2021-06-12 13:14:28,wallstreetbets,So much words ... Yes or no?
2021-06-12 13:14:36,wallstreetbets,"This is great data and analysis.

I pointed this out on another thread but the main problem with investing in the IPOs at the offer price is that there is adverse selection.  The hotter the IPO, the harder it is to get allocated shares.  And of course, those are the ones that are likely to pop the most.

So if you simply request, say, $10k worth of shares in every single IPO, you will find that your results are far worse than the results here.  You might even lose money, depending on how good of a customer to your broker you are (better customers are more likely to get allocated the shares they request, which make the adverse selection not as bad)

On the plus side, my shares of APP are finally trading above their $80 offer price."
2021-06-12 13:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Rule of thumb to me is never invest into an IPO until a few (~6) months in.  That’s about the time initial investors have/can jettisoned it.  If it’s made available to retail investors at the onset, you’re going to be holding the bag right away."

2021-06-12 13:27:49,wallstreetbets,"This is all good but is ATAI, Ipoing next Friday, a market price offer or a limit price Ipo? it says $13-15 but can I end up paying $20 for the shares I hypothetically subscribe to?"
2021-06-12 13:28:39,wallstreetbets,"So, I can just imagine companies being pretty damn happy if they get 90% of their allotment sold at X% just to have it tank \~40% at IPO. They get all those shares sold at a price higher than what the market actually wants to bare. Those institutional investors and funds get fucked, though.

Also, this is pretty neat data. I see there was no correlation between the IPO listings and the 2008 recession, but as you said there was some on the dot com bubble. I wonder if this kind of data can indicate a bubble forming in certain sectors (probably the ones with the highest listing rates in that period)."
2021-06-12 13:34:13,wallstreetbets,"I have upvoted because of the great data and exercise you did, thank you, loved the work!

&#x200B;

My practical ""perception"" (well, therefore not just perception) is that, in general, IPOs are:

\- to be played in day 1 \*only\*, and exited;     otherwise

\- better be skipped for better play days/weeks later, when there is already a chart to play with

\[in other words: buying the IPO at opening price and holding blindly does not look to be a good approach\]

&#x200B;

2021-06-12 13:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Awesome post man and appreciate the effort. 

One thing I would add is that all those institutional investors have a 6 month lock up period on their shares. Their actual return would not have much to do with the listing day gain or loss. It would be interesting to see what IPO returns are 6 months from listing date as realistically that would be when those institutional guys could realize a return."
2021-06-12 14:05:18,wallstreetbets,There's a website in Canada called Vested.ca that lets you invest in companies prior to their IPO. It's like GoFundMe for businesses. They give you promissory notes in exchange for your investment. But MAKE SURE YOU READ THE WARNINGS AND WAIVERS.

2021-06-12 15:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis. I appreciate the time and commitment this took to research and write. 

I’ve been investing in IPO’s for some time now. Like you stated, the real money is getting in pre Launch before retail. What I’ve found is basically it’s impossible if you’re a retail investor trying to get shares before it’s offered publicly. 

There’s many websites you can join that will give you access to initial offerings before the company goes public. The catch is you have to invest $250k plus from what I’ve seen. $20k-$50k isn’t even considered. 

Even know retail is getting the short end of the stick there’s still money to be made. Let’s use DIBS as an example. DIBS opened at $20 and closed at $28 last Thursday.  Great increase if you day traded it. There’s many IPOs that do this. The trick is determining which ones are going to be the winners. 

Here’s what I do. 

I go to nasdaq.com I navigate the to IPO Calendar. I then research all the companies that are going public for the month. I then look at their financials, ceo, website, and the company as a whole. What are they, what do they provide. I pick a few out I really like and make a list. I then compare that list with companies that are similar and currently trading. 

After all that I wait for opening day and I buy shares as soon as it’s listed. I buy, wait, and usually sell the same day. 

If you do the research more than often this strategy works."

I prefer investments with a few teeth marks on 'em.

2021-06-12 19:00:13,wallstreetbets,"I have a few questions:

1) If the company is so great, why are the people who own it currently getting rid of it? That's what happens when companies go public ... the original founders of the company are dumping the company ... i.e. selling it. If it's so great, why are they selling it? Wouldn't they want to keep it? I'm confused.

2) I analyzed the last IPO. Janux: Opened at $32 ... closed at $24.90 for a loss of 30%

3) Here is Seeking Alpha's headline on these events: ""Biotech firm Janux Therapeutics pops 100% on open after strong IPO""

So, if the stock opened at 32 and closed at 25 it would seem to me that the news media are fucking liars and the data you're relying on sucks massive donkey dicks.

So no, you should not invest in IPOs is the conclusion I've drawn. Change my mind."

You can do a direct listing skipping whole IPO roadshow.

But one of the things going with investment bank gives you is that they'll settle their ~~idiots~~ echm. I mean clients with your stock. In addition many IPOs have an underwriting rules, in which case investment bank is mandated to buy your stock with their own money if it falls bellow IPO price in the next few weeks."

2021-06-12 09:47:21,wallstreetbets,haha. That bank data is not that useful as explained in the post as usually 4-5 banks are involved in the IPO.
2021-06-12 11:56:47,wallstreetbets,The big jump between offer price and first trade tells us the underwriters are pricing the IPO primarily for the benefit of the customers of the underwriter not the company issuing the shares
2021-06-12 16:19:35,wallstreetbets,"My observation as well. IPO withdrawals could even be used to measure market cycles. The moment there is seriously doubt about short to medium term market performance, withdrawal rates go higher.

And as you already mentioned, there will be near no IPOs filed during a bear market cycle. Investing wise it's not a bad thing as it inherently protects you from downturns."

In addition, you have to get institutional buy-in PRIOR to IPO. Before you say it's rigged for those guys, they have a share lock-up of 6 months normally on shares sold before listing."

2021-06-12 17:09:04,wallstreetbets,">Institutional investors buy in to what their investors tell them to.

This is a bit of an over-simplification, but it's also not true. For example, a PE or Hedge Fund invests independently of its investors. They have no say in what they invest in."
2021-06-12 16:53:35,wallstreetbets,"You literally said they are unable to raise equity in the private markets. That's exactly what that means. They raise equity in private markets when they're not yet up there with the balance sheet and not visible enough for the retail investor, high risk/high reward opportunities."

Neat war to read up on--would you believe a decisive for the world naval battle on Lake Champlain--we won!  US (and Britain) were lucky on that one--Britain decided to cut their losses and we went along and made peace status quo ante."

2021-06-12 17:09:54,wallstreetbets,They market their funds with a specific strategy. If they don't follow that strategy the investors redeem their capital. Institutional investors who invest in IPOs do so because their LPs expect them to. Most PE firms have investor advisory commitees with chairs for their largest LPs. They do need to get explicit approval on most large purchases. Also lol PE funds don't invest in IPOs they list them.
2021-06-12 17:02:12,wallstreetbets,Additional equity genius it is implied they have already raised money since they are an established private company.
2021-06-12 17:05:08,wallstreetbets,Why do you think SPAC IPOs are prolific right now? Because investors with two brain cells to rub together know not to invest money in a company that has literally no assets.
2021-06-12 17:14:42,wallstreetbets,I see you not only bought at $33 before Citron shitted on PLTR but also at the ath of $45 .
2021-06-12 19:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Investment banks buy the shares from the company and they distribute them to themselves, clients, institutions. The bank buys the shares and sells those to clients for a list price. The first day trading isn't the IPO, but the first day on the secondary market. When a company pops on the opening day, it means the bank undersold the value of the shares. This shortchanged the company going public because they would have make more off the offering than they did. 

I.e. the investment banks are often way off. CEO makes money either way, but would have made much more had he not IPOed."

Think Polaroid.  Cautionary Tale: I went on vacation leaving a seriously out-of-the-money buy order on Polaroid bonds standing. Polaroid's collapse started mid-vacation--lost 2800D on that one. I now cancel ALL orders before going away. Have the Young Folks here ever heard of Polaroid?

2021-06-12 17:27:25,wallstreetbets,Having watched my boss struggle to raise investments over the last year and a half for our expansion I get it. I’m sure it’s a lot of work and negotiating but it’s a faster route to full funding.

2021-06-12 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,Almost everyone raises equity round by round regularly. Private equity raising is very much proprietary and investors can have a variety of demands/questions.
2021-06-12 18:08:50,wallstreetbets,"SPACs are prolific because the SPAC creators and the hedge funds they work with are making a killing on them at the expense of actual investors. This is common knowledge. Most SPACs are just going the SPAC route to avoid scrutiny, IPOs are inspected carefully. So if you're running a scam operation, SPAC is the only way to go public."

Seems awfully racist that the white lady/dude would know better than everyone else (especially those who actually tried it)... EVERY COMMUNIST REGIME HAS KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC WESTERN NATIONS COMBINED."
2021-06-12 18:14:53,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with retail investors losing their money in IPOs lol

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC or RKT - Who will hold the light? Good day to you degenerate apes. I guess the title says it all. RKT has been dominating the stonk market as a housing lender. It looks like the sleeping giant UWMC is stepping into the light. UWMC says they have better long term potential as they don't revolve around refinancing like RKT. Also they claim to be more tech savvy and able to scale up with growth. RKT has been on a nice run but may just be Quicken loans rebranded.

They both have YUGE piece of the lender pie. Who is going to eat the whole pie and leave nothing but the crust? Who will hold the light as we chase the sun into tomorrow?

I think RKT can still run short term but UWMC has more promise short and long term. 

RKT PT 25$ UWMC PT 25$

Should I ( not we )  buy some stonks of RKT or UWMC?

I believe I should buy UWMC as tension and rocket fuel look primed for a big run.

What should I do ? Should I buy UWMC or RKT?"
2021-06-12 09:30:41,wallstreetbets,I think we will see many fomo into uwmc after the CNBC ceo interview and Cramer endorsement.
2021-06-12 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,"For quick gain UWMC has more potential this coming week. Worth it for long hold too though, 3-5 years could be $50"
2021-06-12 09:30:05,wallstreetbets,"I love both. But I will have to side with $UWMC. Her cherry hasn't been popped yet. The day she's ready, them weeklies going to turn so nicely."
2021-06-12 11:42:33,wallstreetbets,$UWMC long & short term.
2021-06-12 10:16:06,wallstreetbets,My bet is with UWMC
2021-06-12 11:23:03,wallstreetbets,UWMC - no brainer. Can see it hitting 40-50$ in the coming years. 🚀
2021-06-12 10:13:04,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is the way .
2021-06-12 11:03:40,wallstreetbets,Since UWMC is our current lender. I'll support it
2021-06-12 10:59:32,wallstreetbets,You are a smart ape my friend. A lot of people are not seeing what you just mentioned in your post. I am loaded heavy with UWMC after crushing it with CLOV earlier in the week. UWMC is looking very primed after cracking the $10 mark and holding it on the daily. Let's see what Monday and Tuesday brings us!
2021-06-12 09:57:00,wallstreetbets,Uwmc all the way all in
2021-06-12 10:01:18,wallstreetbets,Im on both. PT. RKT $30+ UWMC $20+

2021-06-12 09:48:14,wallstreetbets,You might want to remove “we” as it’s a literal SEC invite. UWMC.
2021-06-12 10:31:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m in with uwmc. If it doesn’t rocket, it has steady growth with a dividend. So it’s a safe bet with a soft landing if it doesn’t reach a moon"
2021-06-12 10:43:31,wallstreetbets,I am locked and loaded on UWMC at the moment! Great opportunity in my opinion.
2021-06-12 11:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Mirror mirror… Well, RKT is solid and good looking… but it’s undervalued peer UWMC is just beautiful. More upside potential with UWMC IMO. Mat Daddy making the right moves…"
2021-06-12 15:48:48,wallstreetbets,It looks like they both are good stonks short and long term.
2021-06-12 10:02:25,wallstreetbets,Look at the monthly chart. UWMC for sure
2021-06-12 11:22:32,wallstreetbets,I've worked for both companies and RKT doesn't deserve any support.
2021-06-12 12:49:31,wallstreetbets,I got both!

2021-06-12 12:14:09,wallstreetbets,UWMC for the win.  Getting more next week.
2021-06-12 10:27:23,wallstreetbets,U-Dub!
2021-06-12 10:40:59,wallstreetbets,I have both. RKT I think long term. UWMC for a spike.

2021-06-12 12:18:02,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t decide so I bought both 🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-12 11:40:32,wallstreetbets,I own a ton of shares of both  companies
2021-06-12 16:14:23,wallstreetbets,UWMC is the stonk for me!
2021-06-12 16:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Uwmc is pretty hot right now, and RKT is pretty dead"
2021-06-12 09:43:27,wallstreetbets,"RKT here, more revenue and income growth (even though it was already much higher than UWMC).

I’m bullish on both though, they are down due to inflation and interest rate hike concerns, but the Fed isn’t going to raise rates anytime soon so we’re off the the races."
2021-06-12 14:27:54,wallstreetbets,UWMC
2021-06-12 12:26:22,wallstreetbets,UWMC for me ... 150 shares + 16 option contracts.
2021-06-12 09:27:55,wallstreetbets,We should buy and then doggy your wife

2021-06-12 11:23:48,wallstreetbets,"Buy both. Take control, force a merger."
2021-06-12 12:16:38,wallstreetbets,Rkt is a piece of sheeeeeit
2021-06-12 15:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Don't go into RKT yet. Although it might be bigger in terms of market share and market size, as a shareholder stock, it is not as good as UWMC. RKT does not release a normal dividend, but UWMC does. As of the end of May, UWMC has roughly 20% short interest, RKT has about 15%. RKT has drastically cut their forward guidance, whereas UWMC has increased theirs (in an environment of fearing increased interest rates). If you want short term growth, UWMC is the way. If you want super long term growth, either one really."
2021-06-12 16:23:51,wallstreetbets,"If you think both companies are going to 25, and one is currently valued at around half the other....why would you buy the more expensive one haha.

2021-06-12 09:54:13,wallstreetbets,Only monthlies at the moment
2021-06-12 10:39:17,wallstreetbets,I bet too.

2021-06-12 16:53:08,wallstreetbets,Tried to refi with them and it was horrendously expensive.  The estimated costs they told us at the beginning ballooned 3x by the time we got to the final paperwork.  Seems like their model is to just rush you through at warp speed and hope you sign everything.
2021-06-12 11:14:09,wallstreetbets,You got it backwards if you think UWMC is just short term
2021-06-12 10:52:25,wallstreetbets,this is the way
2021-06-12 13:02:17,wallstreetbets,I felt the same
2021-06-12 09:29:51,wallstreetbets,We should buy and kitty your husband
2021-06-12 10:43:52,wallstreetbets,maybe you probably right. Why though?

2021-06-12 11:00:51,wallstreetbets,Could start Monday. Watch the premarket action!
2021-06-12 16:19:38,wallstreetbets,this. hes rubbing your sack so you dont feel bad about being bagholders.
2021-06-12 16:40:02,wallstreetbets,Cramer pumped XL Fleet.  Never forget.
2021-06-12 12:15:25,wallstreetbets,Same here.  I like this strategy.
2021-06-12 11:20:26,wallstreetbets,sorry i should have said a steady solid $50+ in 3-5 years. You never know with fomo 50 could happen next week
2021-06-12 16:59:57,wallstreetbets,Those will likely still print because of the IV but I highly recommend getting some July options as UWMC only gets included into the Russell 1000 and 3000 June 25th at close IIRC. That means Monday the 28th ETFs that track those Indexes need to buy shares no matter the price. You're Def missing out on the bigger hypetrain unless you plan to exercise your 06/18s.
2021-06-12 13:46:59,wallstreetbets,For some of us just the tip is all we got

2021-06-12 11:01:06,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is married to the middlemen and voraciously defends them at their own expense as a ploy to keep the middlemen's marketshare.

RKT is focused on direct sale.

I think the mortgage brokers are a thing of the past and RKT will benefit from the market becoming more democratised.

Also RKT is more aggressively expanding their business model, while UWMC is very focused on a single revenue source."
2021-06-12 13:08:44,wallstreetbets,"Broker market share is increasing since its the cheapest way to get a loan, and uwmc has way better scalability and way less overhead.  Rkt has loads of overhead employing people to do all the work the broker would normally do.  Long term, I think rkt will do well with retail customers, but I see UWMC becoming the bigger lender."

2021-06-12 13:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Wholesale mortgage lenders will nearly always get you a better rate. When rates start to rise, UWM will grow while RKT shrinks because RKT can't compete on pricing, closing time, or cost to originate.

I think both companies are going to do well in the future, I invested in both, but I am heavy UWMC for the next 3-5 years, because I don't think RKT can really shine until rates normalize above where they are now and we see what their business looks like in a rate-competitive environment."

2021-06-12 10:53:59,wallstreetbets,If you say so
2021-06-12 13:39:25,wallstreetbets,RKT will take a haircut on margins to maintain competitiveness. The bet with RKT is that they can increase market share to the point that revenue continues to climb even as margins tighten. That is why they put out tight guidance last ER.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why you should make a WISH *^(EDIT:)*

* *^(For people complaining about the legitimacy of my account, I'm indeed a new Reddit user. And so what? I detailed the methodology I used and you can check the figures by yourself. I guess you were once a new user as well...)*
* *^(For people complaining about WISH offering. I personally do a lot of shopping on their website (bought a laptop stand, kindle case, bicycle saddle protector, magnets for whiteboard, elastic bands for training, etc))* *^(and I'm very happy with the value for money although it takes time to deliver (obviously if I need something urgently I won't buy it on WISH.).)* *^(Every time I didn't receive the product, I got easily refunded. Then either I'm a super lucky user or the people complaining never really tried WISH.)*

&#x200B;

I just WISH to highlight some facts from my own analysis on why I think WISH is worth a look. I used several criterias and detailed the methodology used for each one as well as the results. Enjoy the reading.

&#x200B;

**Analysts Opinion**

* *Methodology*: Comparing the price target of WISH as of today with some others meme names the day before they started rising (obviously those dates are subjective and my choice might differ from yours).
* *Results:*
   * The average price target (PT) for WISH is 18.4 (+84%) whereas meme stocks had averages below (GME, AMC) or close (BB, CLOV) to their respective PT
   * WISH is the only stock where even the most pessimistic analyst has a PT above current price ($12 / +20%) and 0 sell recommendation
   * Majority of analysts are positive on the stock (81.8%)

https://preview.redd.it/kkhjl5okyz471.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=db7766702100caa8024f048f3531e17fa4e0ec76

**Fundamentals**

* *Methodology:* Comparing expected price-to-sales ratios, expected revenue CAGR and expected adjusted EBITDA margin based on analyst forecasts at end of 2023. Note that the selection of meme stocks is subjective and so are the resulting averages in the table below.
* *Results*: WISH has, by far, the smallest expected price-to-sales ratio although its expected revenue growth and EBITDA margin are only slightly below average

https://preview.redd.it/rnrgnpunyz471.png?width=261&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b7ad7f4b1dfda49a2e6fb909bb4c90bf6cce6d

**Short Interest**

* *Methodology:* Comparing the short interest as a % of float of WISH, as of today, with some other meme names before they started their rise (again: dates choice are subjective). Note that I only have access to short interest information updated twice per month; therefore I used the closest date as a reference point.
* *Results:*
   * WISH has a short interest ratio close to BB when it became a meme stock
   * The lock-up period on WISH shares ended in May and its float increased from 60.6m to 376.5m shares. The ratio before the end of the lock-up was then around 45%

https://preview.redd.it/jf5juafqyz471.png?width=285&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41f8db43a6f4be98e19f63df135932fefd0c86e

**Technical Analysis**

* *Methodology:* Using trend lines, resistances and exponential moving averages. Note that this is highly subjective.
* *Results*:
   * A major downtrend line has been broken recently, which led to a furious increase towards a strong resistance at 15. $15 used to be a support until beginning of April
   * The exponential moving average of 25 days used to act as a resistance and might now act as a support (Friday close just above it)
   * If the downtrend is indeed broken, this pulldown would be an interesting entry point

https://preview.redd.it/mmnywgqtyz471.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3f61744af7ad0dbabc2c564ab9ea00927e6d6d

**Conclusion** *(personal and subjective)*

I believe that WISH has strong attributes to become a winning meme stock: 1) an under-valued price as suggested by analyst forecasts; 2) a high short interest ratio; 3) a potential entry point based on technical analysis

&#x200B;

**This is not a financial advice or recommendation, I'm just sharing my own analysis and I highly suggest you do your own as well**

2021-06-12 10:07:46,wallstreetbets,I was in @ $8.21... dropped out around $14.40 as it started dropping. Considering jumping back in as the prices have dropped down again. I do believe they will rise again.
2021-06-12 10:01:48,wallstreetbets,"The good thing about WISH is that it has everythingb for a bull run: string balance sheet with 2 bln.cash on hand, no debt, 75% yoy revenue growth, insiders own a huge stake in the company, the quality of the service is increading, brand loyalty increases, business expands to offline pickup locations.  

WISH currently is valued at least 3x less what it should be. 

For me WISH is minimum risk, high return investment 

Market conditions are grest 10.y.o.bond yoels go down, FED is Ok with 5% CPI,market has started to beluve that the inflation is transitory. So everything seems to be perfectly aligned for WISH investors."

2021-06-12 09:54:41,wallstreetbets,I think wish is probably the least risky of all the meme stocks and seems worth a risk at current price range.

2021-06-12 09:38:42,wallstreetbets,I know there's a market for wish and a lot of potential for the company but has anyone ever had a good experience ordering from them? I guess it's like Walmart where people will put up with crap for cheap crap but I personally can't stand wish...in the same way I can't stand Walmart. I bought shares because I think this company will do well but just wondering what other people's thoughts were on the company
2021-06-12 11:00:54,wallstreetbets,9 day old account... seems legit
2021-06-12 09:22:05,wallstreetbets,"This is the only meme stock that I added shares and not just options on Friday. I didn't do as deep of an analysis as you but I liked the analyst price targets for a long term hold if people don't run it to the moon. I kind of like wkhs too but at around $13....that's not to say it won't run to the moon but if it loses momentum, I'm not sure it's worth $15. And obviously amc and gme aren't worth their price tag. Not too sure on clov and the others but they seem too pricey as well

Wish, amc and gme next week!!"

2021-06-12 10:30:04,wallstreetbets,"My favourite analysis of Wish so far ""Every time they make a sale, they lose a customer"". Even if that weren't mostly true, how could Wish turn public perception around enough to keep any of their fundamentals? How many people really wanna wait two months and get a broken item they didn't actually order to save $1 off the Amazon cost?"

2021-06-12 12:51:01,wallstreetbets,"I sold CLOV given it was mroe risk than rewards when it was 23. and I bought more wish recently since the IPO was 20! Low risk and high rewards. Not to mention ppl are getting poor from CPI and pandemics, cheap things are better."
2021-06-12 14:12:54,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm. On the chart technicals, daily closes, it didn't break the downward trend lines. It closed above 1 of the downward trend lines, 1 day. Then it closed below both trend lines the next 3 days. All red candles. 

On SMAs, it's sitting in kind of middling areas. On the daily, looks like move to 10-20 MAs for retest, then try another break out. That might not play out before 6/18 calls for anyone looking at options. 

Long term, no idea. I'm not sold on the companies pitch for say a 10 year investment."
2021-06-12 17:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Whoever shorting the stock, good luck paying on the short interest rate that is increasing. Also, whoever mention about the legal class action, just come back to your senses and ask another question, have you ever heard any well known company that is free from lawsuit?  
Amazon has multiple lawsuits up their rear and it's stock price is 3000. Yes it's no comparison due to the company size but it just comparing one e-commerce to another e-commerce.  
$WISH deserve to be where the stock price were at before or even more, it caters to different market level that probably Amazon will have a hard time to tap into cause of their ridiculous prime membership fee."

At the very very least a double up is what they are more than worth. Even a triple up at this stage. So yes extremely oversold and undervalued.

2021-06-12 14:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Wish is fundamentally not a good company. That's all the reason you need to not invest. In this case, the product is so bad that they have developed a reputation as comically stupid alternatives to real products. Their pictures are fake. This is not a sustainable business model. Fundamentally, you cannot get rich selling shit. 

Eventually, they will crash and burn. There may be temporary gains but in absence of a valid business model, they will not survive."

2021-06-12 12:25:55,wallstreetbets,This guys an idiot
2021-06-12 13:15:07,wallstreetbets,"I did, actually.

Ordered a few analog things for my ps controller.. arrived just as advertised.

Other time I bought a case for my IPhone and it didn’t arrive at the estimated day, so I requested a refund and was promptly attended..

A few weeks later the case arrived, and I got in touch with WISH, explaining the situation, and they said I could keep the item.

Good customer service."

2021-06-12 12:12:21,wallstreetbets,Can’t imagine they get a lot of repeat buyers based on small sample of experiences I know about. I’ve bought shit direct from AliExpress that was better and took less time to to arrive than a buy from Wish. I’m in at $12 though... every hole’s a goal
2021-06-12 12:34:42,wallstreetbets,"If it's cheaper with a little less quality, most of the population will jump all over it. Learned that a long time ago selling nugs"
2021-06-12 14:23:27,wallstreetbets,"I have bought fishing lines, hooks, and rigs. And still surprised for the quality i received. Idk too much but they seem legit, my friend ordered a drone and it was 💩 he requested his money back and got it within a week. The shite is legit wether they can compete thats only a matter of time… i see a 40 dollar stock if they turn a profit"

2021-06-12 17:09:44,wallstreetbets,Wish @ 10 on june 18 11.32k vol lets raise wish up to 20 this week apes aftwr that to the moon
2021-06-12 17:14:44,wallstreetbets,Wish its at 17 % of the float lets keep running and we will see wish to the moon its not a pump and dump
2021-06-12 15:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Yep i just checked his twitter, he posted on June 11 8:42 PM : $WISH Got more on the dip. Short term swing.

The guy has 500k followers on twitter"
2021-06-12 12:31:20,wallstreetbets,"The prices are in-line with the quality of their goods in my opinion. I mean shit the second I signed into the app they tried to send me a product of my choice for free. What kind of idiot would buy a $30 DJI knock-off drone for or a Rolex looking watch for $9 and expect it to be anything more than mediocre? I've bought a lot of stuff off of AliExpress and Wish is just a more stylist version of that which appeals to a younger market. Sometimes you get something that is legitimately a really good bargain, sometimes you're out a very small amount of money on crap. A lot of their goods are equivalent to the stuff you buy on Amazon, just without branding or customer service. Overall if you're okay buying Chinese knockoffs and waiting for shipping from China it's not a bad site."
2021-06-12 13:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Dollar Stores also sell garbage, there’s money to be made in selling crap."
2021-06-12 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,Ali express does the exact same thing selling a bunch of Chinese stuff though and they have a 566 billion market cap
2021-06-12 12:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Does that change the fact that tons of people buy from it?  


I mean, whether you sell garbage product or not doesn't matter so long as people give you their money, no?"
2021-06-12 14:19:44,wallstreetbets,"Harbor Freight Tools. If I only need it a couple times, I go there every time. Wish (based on my wife's experience) seems to be the same model."
2021-06-12 12:05:22,wallstreetbets,Was thinking the same. Don’t they also take weeks to months to deliver your stuff?
2021-06-12 11:54:12,wallstreetbets,"I can't ignore it. Which is why I haven't bought any myself.  It sells garbage that doesn't work as advertised (see all the videos on their body armor out there just as an example) and it doesn't look like its executive picks are set up right to build an online retailer. I think their business model is to get bought out by Amazon, which will hopefully just shut it down."
2021-06-12 12:28:57,wallstreetbets,They don’t suck. They’re basically the dollar tree online. Sell same stuff as Etsy (search for the same shit)
2021-06-12 11:56:33,wallstreetbets,Why not execute and buy the shares and hold. Theta is going to eat you up if next week sucks
2021-06-12 12:56:41,wallstreetbets,Well I bought but doubt I’ll make any difference 😂
2021-06-12 12:24:44,wallstreetbets,"If they are still mid p&d, that's a good thing for us bag holders. That means I might be able to make some of my money back."
2021-06-12 11:24:55,wallstreetbets,I was actually searching for someone to point that out and your comment was actually hidden. Had to click on it to see it. Dude wtf. It's all distraction.
2021-06-12 10:01:19,wallstreetbets,"Dude, it's crazy. Look at the history of some of the commenters. Straight up bots."
2021-06-12 12:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Their current market cap is their valuation. Current valuation is 6.2B with much more room to the downside. Firstly no one trades at 4/5x expected revenue go look at grub/uber/lyft/dash(though is is skewed from their IPO) and come back with a accurate number. Secondly, their revenue numbers in the logistics space are false. They recognize gross and not net. So you can remove 85% of the logistics revenue as what they actually bank as that money has to be paid to the logistics providers. 

Let’s say you take an Uber for 20 bucks. Uber’s margins are 20% so you pay uber 20 bucks, they pay 16 dollars to the driver and 4 dollars uber collects and recognized as revenue. 
In the above example WISH, in their logistics space, is recognizing the entire 20 dollars that was paid to them as revenue. Though still has to pay out 16 dollars. It’s pretty shady accounting.

If uber booked gross rev like WISH does uber would had have $65B dollars in rev for just 2019. For a company whose market cap is currently 50B. Just to show you how misleading this gross rev number from Wish is in their logistics space.

 Below is from their latest 10-q:

NOTE 2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. **Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.** Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes."
2021-06-12 11:28:07,wallstreetbets,It's not. It's a distraction from the stocks we originally love. CLOV apperantly was owned by Citadel by a good amount. I wonder about Wish. Don't have time to look into this but these accounts being otherwise not active should tell you a lot.
2021-06-12 12:27:28,wallstreetbets,Any company that doesn't have a lawsuit is either selling meth or cocaine.
2021-06-12 12:17:04,wallstreetbets,This is complete BS. It’s very very typical. Go look at Pinterest news feed on finviz.. same thing. Just a bunch of lawsuit spam & it’s been that way since Pinterest was in the $20’s. There are very specific legal requirements to succeed with these kind of lawsuits. They basically just throw whatever they can at the wall and see what sticks. Like if they do this to 100 stocks & are successful on 1 it’s worth it to them. It’s absolute bull shit
2021-06-12 10:13:58,wallstreetbets,Their products a garbage and seem to be made by children I can't see a bootleg product company that make shit noone wants being around 2 long
2021-06-12 12:26:15,wallstreetbets,Any company that doesn't have a lawsuit is either selling meth or cocaine.
2021-06-12 10:37:51,wallstreetbets,Ever wonder why all these lawsuits pop up. CLOV has one as well. Slander tactics from I can gather.

2021-06-12 18:26:54,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly my pound-the-table argument for WISH. It's not a store targeted for educated millennials on wsb, but you can't deny it has a big market.

It's like Burger King for fast food. Everyone knows their nuggets/mozzarella sticks etc are shit and it takes 15 minutes for the one underpaid guy manning the whole store to get it to you. But you can't beat $1.5 for 10 nuggets."

2021-06-12 12:29:46,wallstreetbets,Yea they take awhile for delivery. But I've bought clothes off of wish for my wife that were just as good quality as anywhere else.
2021-06-12 13:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Amazon offered to buy them several years ago and they declined, so I don’t think that’s their business model.

2021-06-12 16:57:26,wallstreetbets,Dollar tree is cheap garbage repackaged in convenient dollar increments.  Etsy at least allows independent creators and retailers a platform even if it has a bunch of garbage on it too.

2021-06-12 13:18:13,wallstreetbets,"This is the standard way to report for this kind of revenue. Why don’t you look into how Amazon recognizes logistics revenue for sell by 3rd party, fulfilled by Amazon. Dude thinks thousands of analysts and he’s the only one who see this."
2021-06-12 11:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Citadel was not a major stakeholder in CLOV by any real measure. Has, or had, about $8 million in shares, $7 million in calls and $4 million in puts.  That's pocket money to them. No idea if it was involved in any shorts of it, but it probably is, too.  They're playing all sides of the table."

2021-06-12 12:37:21,wallstreetbets,"This, we guuci"
2021-06-12 12:31:59,wallstreetbets,"This is complete incorrect. Firstly the rev numbers in their logistics business is scam accounting as they recognize gross rev and not net. So you can remove 85% of the logistics rev as what the actually bank. The cash the have on hand is from their IPO and they are losing money (175M last quarter and 500M the quarter before) which is fine it’s a growth company but they don’t have plans to be profitable and will eventually go back to the debt markets. You taking earnings in 2026 with a pe of 30-40 is a fucking joke. Forward looking measures the next year and pe multiples historically are 10 which is moot for this company as it will be a negative pe. Shareholder equity is $1B which gibes this a price of 2 dollars and EV is 4.8B which gives this a price of 7. I value it at 5 with much more room to the downside.

From my understanding Amazon actually purchases the products up front that they warehouse. If it’s completely third party and Amazon never takes ownership of the product itself they wouldn’t recognize it as gross.

Ibid, you do not use gross rev when determining a valuation as that revenue is already account for. Just pointing this out because I keep seeing posts that their trading x times rev but you have to remove over 200M from the calculations as gross rev."

Espacially those who invested in undervalued, overshorted, growth companies like 
WISH, WRHS, CLNE, CLOV, BB,CLF, SENS etc. 
(Add your ticker in the comments if i missed it)

The market sentiment towards growth companies is swinging back to normal. 
1.  The 10.y.treasury yiels have been going down for the last days.
2.  The FED and the market has started treating high 5% Inflation as transitory. 
3.   The economies in North America and Europre are reopening. 
4.  Q2 Earnings season is approaching and expectations are great. 

So my dear APES I  wish your all investments turn greeen and bring you the returns you were not even thinking about. It is the right timing to be invested in my opinion and  You deserve to be rich !"

WISH currently is valued at least 3x less what it should be.

2021-06-12 16:41:42,wallstreetbets,"I rarely say this on WSB but I think your $15 PT is very reasonable for this week. If it really picks up, the compounding hype and mentions on the sub will snowball and much higher is very possible. 

I think $18-25 in the next two weeks could happen, it just depends on whether Apes can focus on one ticker for long enough to trigger FOMO before the next shiny banana comes along and the sell off starts."

WISH currently is valued at least 3x less what it should be. 

For me WISH is minimum risk, high return investment"

2021-06-12 13:05:31,wallstreetbets,Just start by connecting two dots; you will reach there. Switching between candles and lines is helping as well. Try to do your own charts 👍
2021-06-12 10:06:17,wallstreetbets,This. Look at Dollar Tree and Dollar General. They sell cheap products and they're brick and mortar companies. WISH being an online retailer has lower operating costs. WISH is a growth stock and it confuses me why it's shorted to oblivion
2021-06-12 09:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Amazon AND Alibaba wanted to acquire the company at more than the market is currently valuing the company at.

Also just because I don't buy from them, doesn't mean other people don't. I don't shop at dollar stores either but their stocks are killing it. Dollar stores sell garbage. Some people get I guess get a little high from shopping and buying cheap shit. Who knows. The point is it's profitable, growing like crazy, and wanted to be bought at a price higher than it's current market cap.

No brainer."
2021-06-12 09:23:59,wallstreetbets,Depending on what you are buying.  Some of the stuff is the exact same thing as the name brand.  Just no brand.

2021-06-12 09:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it definitely worth a shot at current price. Wouldn't bet the house, but definitely worth a little dip into."

2021-06-12 11:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Why $20? 
From its fundamentals it atleast worth $40 and with WSB fuel it might reach $100."
2021-06-12 10:25:04,wallstreetbets,Your WISH is granted 😎
2021-06-12 12:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Just look at the hourly chart, that is a fact that can't be altered. I believed institutional or retail investors are shorting it heavily due to class action next week hoping it will go down in price but hell, which huge LLC that is free from legal class action?
I can only think if there is one, maybe the company that sells meth or cocaine will never be sued.... even Amazon probably get their daily dose of lawsuit of any sort every single week.
Jeff Bezos can confirm it too."

2021-06-12 12:40:59,wallstreetbets,And also search for the short interest rate for wish. It went up fast as of yesterday which proof the shorting interest volume is increasing.
2021-06-12 13:13:42,wallstreetbets,No one can make a prediction but read about them. The fundamentals and technicals look good. It should be a safe investment with highly probable growth. That's why I'm in too🤝

2021-06-12 18:20:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was like they both carry similarly crappy products. The difference is that Wish is valued 4x less than Etsy. Holding till this quadruples!

2021-06-12 09:37:55,wallstreetbets,Some of y’all need to understand that there are also plenty of other investors and traders that follow this stock on other platforms & they all just saw on Tuesday that WSB is obviously where the action is
2021-06-12 09:55:30,wallstreetbets,"For fuck sake you need to stop complaining. Why you're so salty. If you don't like stock don't invest in. Its doesn't matter how old account is ,we are all here to make money, learn lessons. I love all the account if they provide genuine information.

2021-06-12 13:34:52,wallstreetbets,it broke the down trend. now just started up trend. right now it should move to upside. last 2 days it was completed corrective move.

I think the people here all know  ,what to do with their money and how to play with them. We are all betting here on our own risk.  I don't think anyone here need any  DD from anonymous , they are well educated enough to do their own DD."
2021-06-12 11:04:47,wallstreetbets,Wow.. just read the post first and then start whining
2021-06-12 11:11:28,wallstreetbets,How do you think Alibaba started? They were selling fake ”brand names.”
2021-06-12 09:44:59,wallstreetbets,"Half of that was from IPO related non-cash stock based compensation, some of it was from other costs related to the IPO & refunds & other pandemic induced shipping problems. They are a growth company of course and are not profitable yet so even if none of that happened in 2020, it still would have been a loss. But context matters."
2021-06-12 16:29:37,wallstreetbets,They spend a lot on advertising to increase their customer base. Revenue is high which is more important for growth. They will be profitable soon

But if we’re at peak gdp growth/inflation right now & lower growth & interest rates, that’s perfect environment for no earnings, price to sales, revenue growth stocks to perform well. Wish will not be a market leader, but it should definitely bounce with tech. Look at a weekly chart of Arkk. Not set in stone by any means, but even that looks like it’s ready to rally."

2021-06-12 13:11:27,wallstreetbets,Ok. It just seemed strange to me because I don't know why anyone would continue to go short at a price below about $10. So I don't quite understand why yahoo is at 15% at the end of May and it should be 30% now.

The short interest rate has been increasing since then for people that is shorting it which if they don't succeed to get the price lower with this negative press, they are paying hefty interest rate plus the buy back price.  
There are more information on r/WISH_STOCK if you want to know more since there are couple of people that has some valuable information.  
And one last thing, ask yourself about this legal class action, is there any big company ever free from a single lawsuit? Another e-commerce such as Amazon probably has 1 every week...."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Can Reddit predict earnings movements ? Hi everyone,

I always see posts about earnings releases in the upcoming week in different subreddits and a lot of discussion usually follows. I thought it would be interesting to see the general sentiment in these comments about the upcoming earnings, and if they actually correlate to the stock movements of the discussed symbols in the following week.

I crunched the data with python and some classic nlp packages and here are the results.

I analysed comments from these posts since they have 200+ comments. I cleaned the the text to keep mostly relevant comments to end up with a dataset of 100+ inputs for each.

[most anticipated earnings april 26th](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxhrhs/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)

[most anticipated earnings may 31st](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nng6r6/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)

[most anticipated earnings may 17th](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ne6di0/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)

Then I compiled the sentiments with the actual movements for the most positive sentiments

&#x200B;

|release week|symbol|reddit positive sentiment|stock movement following earnings|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021/05/30|AAPS|25%|\+3%|
||SNDL|32%|\+6%|
|2021/05/17|ROCK|24%|\-9%|
||MSGS|20%|\+7%|
|2021/04/17|AGNC|47%|\+3%|
||GE|16%|\-1%|

&#x200B;

Some might see correlation, some may not, but it was a fun exercice anyway! Let me know what you think!

2021-06-12 12:11:55,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t affect the price of the stock, it’s a characteristic of the price of the stock. A higher IV means that the price of the underlying stock is less stable and expected to swing by a larger amount. 

This characteristic of the stock price affects options trading because options are essentially insurance. The higher the uncertainty in an outcome, the higher the demand for insurance will be. So if the IV is high, option prices will be high."

Edit: Read product review 

https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/implantable-eversense-cgm-product-review


%of diabetics in America=13%


Total diabetic Americans(out of 400 million)=50 million


Total diabetics using CGM(10% of diabetics)= 5 million


1/5 diabetics (on CGM) using SENS= 1 million

Insurance allows upto 10$ a day for CGM=$ 3650 per year


Total revenue per year (conservative)= 3.65k*1mill=4 billion approx


At 15 times earnings we have marketcap of 60 billion


Current marketcap= 1.72 billion


60/1.72= 34.some change

2021-06-12 12:52:52,wallstreetbets,"If you're looking for more DD, there is A LOT out there from some of us have been following for a while, especially over in r/senseonics.

I'll try to summarize. There is a lot of growth potential here, even without any meme attention or a pump. SENS recently released data that shows strong accuracy for their 180 day implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. This data comes from a thorough study that took about 2 years to complete. From reading responses from diabetics, SENS products are arguably better than Dexcom, which has a much larger valuation from it's growth over the years.

FDA approval is coming soon. No one knows when, but it's very likely it will be this quarter, so anywhere from a few days, weeks, or months. Retail investors will probably be the last to find out about it though, like always.

I think OP's ""$100 stonk"" won't happen anytime in the near-term, but it's an opportunity for massive gains for both short-term and long-term holders.

In addition to the study, SENS has partnered with Ascensia who will be helping them roll out a nice marketing push.

There's also a theory that following the initial rally a few months ago, the MMs brought the price down so they can load up for cheap before it takes off.

Below are some of the results of the study. The translation is that their product works.

* Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) against reference value was 9.1% for the primary sensor over 49,000 paired points and 8.5% for the SBA sensor over 12,000 paired points.
* The percent sensor readings within 20 mg/dL or 20% of reference values (20/20% agreement rate) were as follows:
* Across the full 40-400 mg/dL range, the agreement rate was 92.9% for the primary sensor and 93.9% for the SBA sensor.
* In the hypoglycemic ranges of 40-60 mg/dL and 61-80 mg/dL, the agreement rates were 89.4% and 92.2% for the primary sensor and 96.5% and 96.8% for the SBA sensor, respectively.
* Confirmed hypoglycemic alert detection rate was 93% for primary sensor and 94% for the SBA sensor.
* There were no related serious adverse events, all sensors were removed during the initial removal procedure and 1.1% of patients had a mild infection at the procedure site.

2021-06-12 14:21:55,wallstreetbets,"PLEASE READ, IM SICK OF SEEING THESE BOGUS NUMBERS.

These numbers are wrong. I’m a type 1 diabetic and I keep seeing this mistake with regard to sens. There is a BIG difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetics. Type 2 diabetics make up ~95% of all diabetics. When you see that 13% of Americans are diabetic this overwhelmingly refers to type 2. Something like 1/8 Americans have type 2, and 1/400 have type 1. CGMs are specifically useful to type 1 diabetics, but they’re barely in use by type 2 diabetics. Between 10-25% of TYPE 1 diabetics use cgms, NOT diabetics as a whole. There are only about 1-2 million type 1 diabetics in the US total, so you do the math. This poster claims that 10% of diabetics = 5 million diabetics are using CGMs, but that’s more than double the total number of type 1 diabetics in the entire country.

Unless CGMs get a lot cheaper and easier, they’re all but out of the question for most type 2 diabetics, and medically it’s nowhere near as useful to type 2 diabetics. This is a much more niche product than you’re being led to believe. Even if we forget about the distinction between type 1 and 2, there are other problems with sens that I won’t go into detail about this second, but this is being sold as a game changing revolutionary product with mass market appeal, and it’s simply not the case. It may be a useful medical device for type 1 diabetics, it may continue to improve and it might even sell well and marginally improve some type 1 diabetics’ treatment regime, but most of the DD that I’ve seen on this is based off of some very skewed data."

Near term, not much has changed, other than the accuracy beat conservative estimates, but was in line with a lot of people's expectations.

Now imagine instead of your shirt, it's your CGM which is attached to you by a needle (Libre) or an injected metal wire (dexcom) and it gets ripped out of your skin. It's quite painful.

A 5 minute in office procedure once every 6 months (and eventually 1 per year) is a lot less hassle than worrying about weekly disposable sensors that can get ripped out of your skin."

2021-06-12 14:59:11,wallstreetbets,"This is incorrect. Both the sens and Dexcom both have above skin transmitters that are kept on with adhesives, and in fact the sens transmitter is a fair bit larger than the Dexcom, therefore easier to get snagged. Both devices can get ripped off. The implantable portion of the sens is only 1 piece of the puzzle, but you’re completely forgetting the fact that both have very similar transmitters outside of the body."
2021-06-12 14:19:52,wallstreetbets,"This has been my goto argument for senseonics as well. Injections every 10 days means you'll always have a somewhat open wound. Even if it's a pain in the ass to schedule the procedure, it's pretty non invasive and once you're healed, you don't have to worry about it coming loose. The whole of it is water resistant and it synchs with your phone, rather than a separate receiver that can become damaged and need to be replaced. It's a better product with less discomfort and more convenience."

2021-06-12 11:22:03,wallstreetbets,"https://tcoyd.org/2021/03/the-next-gen-dexcom-g7/

Dexcom is their real competition, but the G7 redesign looks like they're investing on making the sensor pack smaller but not that much on longer lasting.

As of right now, it looks like two weeks between replacements. The bet here is that the government isn't going to want to pay for that, they're going to want six months or maybe the 365 Sens implant if that gets FDA approval."
2021-06-12 08:59:48,wallstreetbets,"He doesnt know shit hes basing his entire DD on FDA approval for one which good luck with that they find even the smallest inkling of something being off and its right back to resubmit time and the stock takes a 50% hit.  Its literally a bad gamble to throw money into something before FDA approval.  This is coming from a guy who lost his ass last year on Aquestive Therapeutics because they had a revolutionary supposed sublingual drug for people with seizures that they were positive the FDA would approve.  Well guess what apparently it didn't work well enough for fat fucks so the FDA threw it right back at them and told them to resubmit and the price took a giant shit.

Just wait till it gets approved and put money in then yeah you may take a short term loss but it will only climb up from there."

2021-06-12 11:41:57,wallstreetbets,"If you have any diabetic friends, you should have a talk with them on what a world of difference that 10 days vs 6 months make. Plus, the costs associated with it. The problem for SENS thus far was not being covered by insurance - but recent partnerships look like that won't be an issue soon."
2021-06-12 15:10:01,wallstreetbets,"I never said the SENS didn't use a transmitter, I said it wasn't attached by a needle or implanted wire. If you bump off the SENS transmitter, you just put it back on. If you bump off the other two, it's both painful AND the entire sensor has to be replaced. That is a BIG difference."
2021-06-12 17:55:20,wallstreetbets,"I’ve used Dexcom and libre, although I’ve gotten a very good look at the eversense from my doctor and diabetes educator’s office. I’m using the Dexcom now. Between that, the publicly available product information, and using these products in general for many years I’d consider myself pretty well versed in CGMs. From what I know, it’s waterproof the way your phone is “waterproof”. They recommend taking it off during showers to charge it, and then reapply the transmitter afterwards, and to me that’s a lot more of a hassle than swapping out a sensor every 10 days. I never said that you claimed it was only an implantable, but that is a very common sentiment that I’ve seen when people speak about this product, so I just want to make that part clear. After implantation you also can’t swim/submerge the implant site/participate in any sports for 5-10 days according to eversense. Although it’s small, it is still a surgical operation, I wouldn’t consider it easy.

To some people reapplying a sensor of the Dexcom may be a bit of a burden, but all said and done it takes maybe 30 seconds or a minute from start to finish, and I haven’t met many people that are too concerned with that aspect. Type 1 diabetics have so many shots, finger pricks, and general health related decisions on a daily basis that the actual act of putting on a new sensor is usually pretty low on the list of concerns. I can’t speak for everyone, but that’s what I’ve experienced and heard from others. With the Dexcom you basically just put a sticker attached to the applicator somewhere on your body, press the button, and it clicks into place. With the eversense, about once per day you’ll have to do something similar, that is take the transmitter off to charge, put on a new piece of tape like adhesive, and then re-place the transmitter. To me that seems like more hassle to go through more frequently. The fact that the Dexcom reapplication process happens to involve a small needle/wire makes no difference, it’s not very painful or obtrusive. All in all speaking about applying sensors, adding up the time and effort it takes to change a Dexcom unit 9 times in 90 days pales in comparison to the difficulty of scheduling even a minor surgery and healing for roughly a week, and reapplying the transmitter daily, even if the sensor placement itself is less frequent. The patient will have to put in plenty of time with either product, so there’s no clear winner.

Personally I don’t have any problem finding a place to put the sensor. I actually appreciate the fact that I can move it often, because it means that I don’t build up scar tissue in any one particular spot. The eversense does need 2 calibrations per day, which is a minor downside. Dexcom’s latest product doesn’t require any. 

When it comes to setting and forgetting, I guess what I’m trying to say is that you really aren’t forgetting much, there’s still a ton of upkeep and daily work that goes into using this product. If it didn’t require charging, was fully waterproof, didn’t require calibrations, didn’t need to be reapplied so often, I’d understand it more, but as it stands it really doesn’t differentiate itself from the Dexcom other than the way it gathers glucose information. For the patient, the day to day use is basically the same, with the other downsides that I mentioned. I’m sure that for some people the pros will outweigh the cons, but I highly doubt that this is going to take over the market unless it sees some significant changes.

I’ll also just add that I’m not here trying to stick up for any one brand, in fact I’m thrilled to see any and all work being done to help people manage type 1 diabetes. I fucking hate dexcom’s business practices, so I would love nothing more than to see another company bring in some serious competition. Investment wise though, I’m seeing a lot of people jumping on the hype train without truly understanding the product or it’s user base, seeing the “10 day vs 180” thing being led to believe that it’s a breakthrough, and I’m just trying to clear up some of the common misconceptions/misinformation regarding this medical device because it’s not common knowledge unless you have experience with type 1."
2021-06-12 15:05:25,wallstreetbets,"Dexcom connects directly to smartphone as well, and actually the sens takes much longer to heal. Type 1 diabetics already take between 5-10 injections per days, and I can guarantee that the small wire that’s inserted with the Dexcom is not an open wound, its barely noticeable. Most importantly, the sens is NOT just an implantable. It requires a transmitter device to sit on top of the skin, stuck there with adhesive, in order to read the information provided by the implantable sensor. This transmitter must be worn in order to use the device at all. This is just like the Dexcom, that is, both use some type of sensor (either an implantable or a small wire) connected to a transmitter that sends the information from the sensor to a receiver or a phone. It is not waterproof, and it also runs out of battery, while the Dexcom is fully waterproof and has a battery life of 110 days. Believe me, I’m a type 1 diabetic, I’ve been on CGMs for years and I wish this product was everything it’s being made out to be, but a lot of this information is simply incorrect or misguided. Read my previous posts if you’d like a more in depth look at the differences between the two devices."

2021-06-12 09:35:50,wallstreetbets,"you should really do your own DD. this person is right. sens already has a 90 day version in the US, this next FDA approval just pushes it to 180. and the study they just completed proved that it works and has equal to or better efficiency than dexcom and lasts 180 days compared to 10.

https://www.reddit.com/r/senseonics/comments/nxu7s3/my\_last\_yolo\_part\_6\_sens\_about\_to\_go\_brrrrrrrr/

check out this thread and the other threads this guy links to in his DD. SENS is actually poised to gain huge market share. especially once their 365 version gets approved (this is years away)"
2021-06-12 09:49:41,wallstreetbets,"I suspect as much. Yes, when it was down at .30 it was an easy bet it would shoot up substantially if the company stayed solvent. But the FDA approval process takes a long time and is not guaranteed. At best this is a long play. I agree that it's probably better to wait for either approval or for it to be actually in the end of the approval process."
2021-06-12 16:11:41,wallstreetbets,but there is a massive difference between a drug that a person consumes and a device that they wear so the risk is slightly lower here
2021-06-12 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,"Did you read the fine print where Sensetronics' CGM requires two finger sticks per day to calibrate it? The others don't. And as u/RuffRhyno noted, it requires an office visit to implant. The other don't require that, either. The whole point of CGMs is to end the finger sticks, not rely on them."
2021-06-12 12:23:53,wallstreetbets,You should also consider that the 10 days replacement can be done by the patient themselves at home. The SENS replacements must be done by endo as a surgical procedure. Far different process
2021-06-12 14:56:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m a type 1 diabetic, I use CGMs. You should read my previous comment about the difference between 10 days and 180 days, it’s not what it sounds like and people who aren’t familiar with these products are being sold on this without having the correct information."
2021-06-12 15:17:08,wallstreetbets,"You’re missing the point. The “entire sensor” being replaced takes about 30 seconds, it’s not a difficult procedure whatsoever, nor is it painful. The most painful part is taking off the adhesive, which applies to both the Dexcom and the sens. The Dexcom isn’t attached by a needle either, it’s attached by adhesive too. Both of the devices take roughly the same amount of time and effort to reattach. I should know, I’m a type 1 diabetic and I’m wearing one right now, I’ve been doing so for years."
2021-06-12 18:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Great information. I'm glad you took the time to go through everything. I think there's a good spot in the market for eversense, if they can get the calibrations taken care of. Their recent clinical trial was looking at accuracy, and I don't think they're done with trying to get past the requirement; they just need more proof that it's stable and they have to be conservative until they have definitive proof to support it. 


They're still very early stage with this product and I expect things will get better, but I don't see them being a $200 stock any time soon, for sure. I'm very much long term on SENS because I think they have something they can market and sell that will help people. Plus, competition in medicine is good for the consumer, and I think they will be competative in the longterm. This recent run is almost entirely sentiment based, and the first real hurdle of getting that 180 day approval is what's holding them up for profitability IMO. I think it could go up to around $10 a share and stay there *if*, after they get approval, they can get covered by an HMO and start posting profit on their ER. That will drive the growth that they can put back into R&D and time will get them what they need as far as reducing the amount of required calibrations. There are a lot of *ifs*, but I see the potential here."
2021-06-12 16:59:57,wallstreetbets,"You've used eversense? [Ascencia website says the transmitter is water resistant up to 30 minutes at 1m](https://www.ascensiadiabetes.com/eversense/eversense-cgm-system/transmitter/). I never said it was waterproof, just that there is no separate receiver that isn't water resistant. I also never said eversense was just an implantable, I only mentioned that you don't have to worry about it coming loose (because it's implanted and removed surgically), and while your experience is that dexacom won't, I've read about others complaining about that and how frequently they have to inject the thing. All the CGMs have a transmitter, not all of them synch to the phone (some older models have separate receivers, instead). Also, just because you're used to giving yourself injections doesn't mean doing another one every 10 days is necessarily desirable, though I'm probably overestimating the inconvenience, especially when it's part of your routine. 

Do you find yourself having to dance around where to implant the sensor, or is that not really a problem? From what I was reading it sounds like a pain to have to use a different site every 10 days (nothing was said about switching back and forth between 2 sites) and work around the insulin pump site. 

I really think being able to set and forget the sensor for 180 days will be attractive for quite a few people, and 365 days moreso. If the accuracy results mean that calibration doesn't have to happen as frequently (twice a day seems steep), then they have a serious advantage with their product. Downsides being that they don't pair with insulin pumps (subject to change in the future, if they know what they're doing), and that you have to schedule and receive minor surgery every 90 days (for now)."

2021-06-12 15:31:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m not misleading anyone, I’m trying to dispel the misinformation about it. Yes, it’s attached to the skin by adhesive, and a piece of filament rests underneath the skin to measure changes in the interstitial fluid. The only difference between the two is whether it’s a wire or an implanted device, but the differences between the two products are being completely misunderstood, so I’d like to correct some of that. I have no interest in helping Dexcom or senseonics, in the end I want the best medical device for my own good and I don’t care which company makes it, but I’ve seen tons of bogus information from people who don’t understand these products trying to hype this stock up as if it’s a massive revolution in CGM tech, and that specifically is what I’m disagreeing with."
2021-06-12 13:51:49,wallstreetbets,"LOL! That's not it. The product is an overhyped POS and the OP's financial calculations are off by an order of magnitude or two. Do you not know the difference between earnings and revenue, either? You belong here, too.  


Did you know that Sensetronics' CGM has to be calibrated twice a day with finger sticks? No, you didn't. That's another way of admitting that their sensors are unreliable garbage. Any sensor that requires that much calibration is. I'll lay 10:1 odds that this is the main reason they're having trouble finding investors and convincing insurance companies to cover it. 95% of the people who try this out after using the no-calibration Dexcom will drop this one ASAP like the stinking pile that it is.  


If you are too blind/stubborn to see that this is not an improvement over the existing 10-14 day CGMs, then so be it."

I personally, well ill be doing more research and hoping some of my other positions move enough that I can free up some cash. But my target is probably july 30 100s or 105s.

The Chinese ‘tesla’ (I hate calling it that), has been working its way up from the low $30s and is now at $45 already a significant move. This is a critical point and in my opinion will continue to show bullish momentum. A golden cross of moving averages (4hr chart) is imminent but a hold of this key support level and consolidation at this point will mean a move up to the low 50s with the potential to move back up to the 60s. Min 50% of upside.

Potential for WSB APEs to get on this and ride a quality stock back up.

Who is with me? Worth waiting on a slight pullback before buying heavy but this will no doubt move.

I look for these companies when I invest. NIO has a strong upside and it dropped recently because of a chip shortage. The company’s upside didn’t change, just the short sided emotional investors drop the price. I bought more. Those same investors emotional investors are now running back in. Get yours."

2021-06-12 18:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Nio is LT for me too but as an alternative perspective, it's advantageous for you to sell your LT holds to rebuy more shares when the time is right. This way you can increase position size from the inherent movement of a stock versus drumming up new capital. 

If I sold all my Nio shares around $58 when the 9/21 EMAs crossed the 50 EMA downwards a few months ago, I would've had $20k cash in hand to buy again when it cooled down into consolidation. I would've been able to buy over 600 more shares of Nio bought at support when the $30 range held. History repeats itself and it happened to me again with UPST. I watched it wick to $190 and it knifed to $125 last Fri. 

TL;DR When the 9/21 crosses down past the 50 (or 100/200 if you wish), man up, sell your LT holds, and buy back at consolidation or confirmation of a range breakout (Like Nio on Friday).

$NIO 🚀"

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"That Four-Letter Word in Your Vocabulary... Dear Apes and Autists, 

I want to talk about that four-letter word we all know and use frequently, whether it be consciously or subconsciously. RISK <-four letters; not the word you were thinking of right?

Fundamentally, risk is a life philosophy and how we each measure the potential for reward vs penalty. (blah, blah, google stuff, theory on decision analysis, statistics and practical examples)

Here's my simplified version:

**RISK: Four Tenets for A Four Letter Word**

1.  **Live another day**. (Lesson from wreck and cavern diving) Don't go in so deep you can't make it out when everything goes wrong. Same applies to depth and (lack of) diversity of investing plays. Someone asked in r/thetagang about what to do with 100 naked calls they sold that are now ITM. Others YOLO their tuition /rent /mortgage /savings /medicine money. Don't do this.

 [I’m dumb and feel so hopeless. Never SELL NAKED CALLS. My 100k loss turned into over 600K in minutes with AMC. I’m not even sure how I can recover from this. : thetagang (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/) 

2.  **Have a Plan. (aka Exit Strategy)** (military maxims) ""Failure to Plan is to plan to fail."" ""A plan is a baseline for change."" This is about figuring out ahead of time what your personal exit points are. There was a guy one weekend on WSB holding options up 3000% and wondering if he should sell some.

3.  **Call it off when it's going wrong**. (diving, trail riding). This is not a life or death mission. If it's a bad day and things are going screwy, recognize it, and call it early, rather than late. Have a beer and talk about what might have been...Do not ""double down"". (Like I did when CLOV was being suppressed in May, but I was on hopium, so I bought more calls, and they all became worthless.)

4.  **Recognize how little you know.** (every sport, hobby, and pastime) The world is full of excited, happy hobbyists! People who know a lot about subject are experts and usually do it for a living. Experts can recognize the limits of their own knowledge, unusual situations, and unashamedly seek counsel from trusted peers. Hubris is a common character flaw in Greek tragedy plays. Be aware of your own limitations; there's no Deus Ex Machinas out here! Seek advice before you get into trouble!

There a bunch more I could have added, but I know there's some awesome experience and brainpower lurking on various subs (and yes, even here) who can add what the average investing hobbyist should look for under one of these four headings.

Resources:

 [Options Strategies | Learn To Trade Options - The Options Playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) 

investopedia, youtube

Recognize that you WILL make mistakes, and that the market can move in mysterious ways.  Have a plan to get above water.  And may your tendies be hot and crisp.

Cheers!

Whose the bigger retard?  The ones throwing feces at each other, or the ones watching and buying up feces because we’re tossing it around?

Like me, I could never afford stocks up until I came here a year or so ago and decided to struggle to save up 2k.  

I invested in gme, made nearly 12k, lost it all down to 2 again, then got back up to 5 and now I’m betting it all on $wish next week.

If I was being sensible, id prob spend that 2k I had on replacing my car that broke down, but fuck that noise - a car and being a broke ass bitch is still a broke ass bitch.

2021-06-12 11:27:33,wallstreetbets,"So if JPow really doesn't raise rates until 2023, are OTM SPXL LEAPS the play? Because LEAPS can be bought on margin, there's an OTM SPXL LEAPS strike that if bought on margin gives ~24x leverage on SPY with the same dollar amount needed to buy 100 shares of SPY. I may do it on the next market dip. Channeling my inner CTN.

Edit: wait fuck I apparently did my math wrong while drunk last night. 22 ATM SPXL 6/17/22 $105c provides almost 38x leverage on daily SPY moves for the same amount of money needed to buy 100 shares of SPY:

$42400/$1885 = 22 LEAPS that can be bought for the money that would buy 100 shares of SPY. The call has a delta of 0.5741, so that gives 22*0.5741 = 12.63 delta on SPXL, and SPXL is triple leveraged SPY daily, so 37.89 delta on SPY daily moves for the price of 1 delta on SPY daily moves. And that's without even using margin. 

Fuck it I'm definitely doing this on the next dip. Might pair it with a VIX LEAPS to be slightly less retarded."

Also would be great if anyone knows an excel alternative to automate importing stocks prices and other data? Company device blocks me from using data types. Google sheets formula seems to be more manual?

2021-06-12 16:44:01,wallstreetbets,I thought I read somewhere that prenup can be useless depending on the circumstances and the state. Any truth to this?
2021-06-12 18:25:23,wallstreetbets,I feel like a sure-fire way to end lots of relationships is by requiring a prenup to tie the knot.

2021-06-12 10:51:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s a good suggestion, the issue is we’re such a large sub that it attracts a lot of volume. If it’s pinned it’d be advertising that sub and anyone clicking to check it out can then go to those other subs. (Brigading)

Maybe the private ones would be ok, but as a mod I’ll get pressure to get a post approved. I’d hate for people to get swarmed with dm request asking to be let in on a private sub. (Trolling)

I see your point though, hard problem to solve perfectly. 🤔"

Out in the veggie garden I pack in everything too tight so  they have to fight for the water, so I don't over-water."
2021-06-12 15:43:44,wallstreetbets,That's part of the rush though. I've diamond handed plenty of poor decisions into the ground before.

2021-06-12 16:46:51,wallstreetbets,Yes this is true. Prenups aren’t 100% but can be helpful.
2021-06-12 17:40:18,wallstreetbets,"State laws vary.

For the most part, they are very helpful for dealing with premarital assets — like preventing you from losing your already large fortune if your marriage doesn’t last.

Less useful for fortunes acquired during the marriage."

(and also a cat wouldn't ever really be in these states because it's too big for quantum mechanics to be the major forces at play on it) By observing a particle you're locking it in a state because a photon of light has a measurable effect on it, because quantum particles are so small.  So now it's definitely in that state, and it's partner particle if it comes in pairs needs to be in the corresponding paired-particle state in order for the laws of physics to be satisfied.  You can't really know what state it's in before you look at it because it can be in multiple."

2021-06-12 11:10:30,wallstreetbets,If I **have** to go for a morgage stock it would be UWMC. At least you get a nice dividend for holding + it's still very good price wise + many other reasons to be found if you willing to look. Rkt will go down in marketshare and guess who will take that piece of the pie. But hey I understand your intention here. If it goes 17or perhaps 18 I'll step in and help you out.  Before that I suggest you average down if you still can or get out with half and invest in better potentials. Good luck anyhow you look at it. **Fyi** I went for UWMC / but I guess you figured that one out.
2021-06-12 06:02:38,wallstreetbets,Did you know that their market is drying up and soon their revenue will shrink in the coming years?

2021-06-12 08:20:39,wallstreetbets,"No, they are right. Housing sales are slowing immensely due to high prices. Rates eventually going up which means all the loans on the books now will be earning less profit than any newer ones. Usually a negative effect on company value. Might see a very short term play but 6 months to 1 year I'd say the price will likely go down."

2021-06-12 09:22:56,wallstreetbets,Yup. Mortgage business as a whole is at a peak. UWMC is a smarter play as they’re in the commercial business. RKT has has nowhere to go but down in the long run.

2021-06-12 04:51:40,wallstreetbets,"every single options contract is 100 shares of control. They do not carry the cost of 100 shares and their price volatility is higher than stocks due to the nature of time limited options. So, theoretically, your gains on options will be higher, but you could also lose your entire investment.

e: On Wednesday, I had 50 shares of CLF and 5 call options. The calls netted me $1200 while the shares made me $115. I had $400 in the options contracts and $1000 in shares."

Their \*NEW\* state of the art ""Direct Reduction Plant"" in Toledo Ohio is running with natural gas their smoke stacks aren't billowing tons of PM 2.5 particulates into the air. In fact the smoke stack is blowing out STEAM. ZERO pollution.

Lets take a look at the effects of reducing iron the CHINESE way

Now for a quick comparison lets look at the steel TITAN CLF in Toledo Ohio

It would take YEARS to change to a green reduction method. China is about 10-20 years behind. CLF is already there and investing even more into R&D."

2021-06-12 10:17:24,wallstreetbets,"I work for Cleveland Cliffs. I disagree with alot of what you just said.

If comparing us to China. Yes we are miles ahead.

But if you are trying to convince people that it will be with zero emissions... Completely wrong. Cliffs owns Steel Mills that have been around since World War 1. These are far from being environmentally friendly and would cost them billions and billions to get slightly better.

I love the CEO, they seem to be talking the talking and attempting to walk the walk. But don't try to take one ""newly built"" facility and act like the whole company is this way.

Just my two cents."
2021-06-12 09:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Nobody cares because it’s misleading at best. $CLF is a mining company eroding the soil of the Great Lakes region because well, that’s what mining companies do. But we need them keep mining so they can help the mills turn raw steel coil into products that we use everyday day. 

The problem is that right now they don’t want to give coil to the mills and in turn the mills don’t want to turn on the furnaces to produce steel. In the end we have an over demand for steel products and very little supply. Guess what happens to the price of the product? You got it, it goes up. So they are able to manipulate the supply chain, with tons of government support and way less overhead than what they had when the pandemic started. 

The result? Poor revenue but amazing earnings which is what investors want to see. Insiders know it and buy more company stock. Analysts know it and recommend as a “buy”. Then the herd follows suit and we get a perfect storm of inflated stock prices when the reality is there is no steel and steel products being produced. The very little being produced is getting sold at 3x last year prices.

If you need more proof just look at (USS) $X and (Nucor) $NUE. All domestic steel stocks follow the exact same pattern - except for JSW because they haven’t been given raw steel since 2018 and just filed a lawsuit.

By the way, natural gas burning produces a ton of emissions but it *can* be 50% less CO2 than usual. If $CLF was so smart and green they would actually recover the vapor from burning their gas and sell it to the City of Toledo.

My point is this is all a marketing plot folks. $CLF is doing just fine as a company and will ride this manipulated market as long as it can, then sell the stock real high to have enough cash to go back to normal operational levels. Be smart and do you DD so you don’t hold all the bags.

BTW, gotta love how tree huggers love the initiatives to natural gas but condemn producers and the whole oil and gas industry. People need to become more educated about how their lights turn on when they flick the switch."

Keep in mind this plant was not fully operational during a large part of that quarter and that was when HRC prices was $1,000 - $1,200.

This upcoming July earnings will surprise all of us.

The Reduction plant was in full operation (I think they were understaffed but not significant) and HRC is $1,400 - $1,700.

And lets not forget that acquisition in late 2020 that secured MT.

China has cancelled their 13% VAT rebate in May.

But to answer your question. Yes, I think they will have a few tendies left over."
2021-06-12 14:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Uh?!? I was talking about stock prices not world steel prices. 

But at any rate everything you said on your previous comment is incorrect. World prices are not “just that” - they absolutely influence domestic production and prices especially now with tariffs in place, plus there is absolutely no production going on and old furnaces are being kept off on purpose citing the high cost of turning the old tech furnaces back on. It’s not true, but but it’s what they have to tell the public.

In the mean time the country as a whole has gone back to importing all finished product at astronomical prices as China has lifted the 13% VAT subsidy which has been passed on to foreign customers, plus we haven’t touched section 232 due to political lobbying, and to top it off there is the increase of the raw material world prices. 

In the end all imported material has become impossible to buy at 2x and 3x what it was 8 months ago. Domestic steel companies are having a blast increasing their own prices and reaping off humongous profit. So of course there is more room for $CLF $X and $NUE to grow. But when the party is over it will be very very ugly."
2021-06-12 09:44:18,wallstreetbets,"You are on the money on this. See my explanation on the other post. It’s all about earnings and the earnings will be HUGE in the next report.

By the way the plant is still not fully operational because they don’t want to. $CFL will ride this horse as much as they possibly can. And if the current administration decides not to touch section 232 this could last a little while."
2021-06-12 18:27:44,wallstreetbets,"I feel the same way that when this one ends its going to end ugly for lots of steelworkers.  CLF bought those assets as hedges for when iron is low.  Because everything is so high right now, they can make steel, but if the spot price drops again and contracts for production dry up, they'll be moving to Iron production and working those plants in Toledo to make reduced iron for use in EAF units which will continue to run regardless.  First shuttered units are going to be where companies have redundancies and excess production.  I'm expecting the axe to fall on Granite City to start, probably the former AK Dearborn next would be my guess (CLF facilities at Gary and Toledo would cover Dearborns production would be my guess).  There will be another round of reductions in probably 2024-5."

Here's how arcelormittal played y'all's steel meme for hoes, sold them their worst quality assets and proceeded to keep a us footprint, whilst maintaining their name as one of the greats:

https://agmetalminer.com/2021/03/10/what-are-arcelormittals-prospects-in-the-us-after-its-cleveland-cliffs-deal/

On January 15, 2021, X completed the acquisition of Big River Steel for roughly $774 million from cash on hand. Big River Steel is, according to X, the newest and most advanced flat-rolled mill in North America. Its advanced manufacturing technology combined with X's product development capabilities will allow the combined company to produce 14 advanced steel grades. The acquisition doubles the mill's hot-rolled steel production capacity to $3.3 million tons annually, establishing it as one of the largest electric arc furnace-oriented flat-rolled mills in North America. this combined with their stronger for longer shit, their recyclable steel shit, they're figuring out you don't need vertical leverage by acquiring mining ores, you have all kinds of already made steel to take advantage of. And X is doing it, their on some green shit for the hipsters, too.

2021-06-12 03:32:53,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why buying options at this time is worse than buying shares? Obviously the premiums are extremely high even for weeklies but wouldn’t you see similar if not better gains than with shares?
2021-06-12 03:18:11,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what makes you think that but cool

2021-06-12 03:34:50,wallstreetbets,You paid $11 for a $49 strike call. Your breakeven is $60. Just to break even. Seems like you bought when IV was crazy high and thetagang comin' for you.

2021-06-12 08:59:02,wallstreetbets,This response makes it clear you really don’t understand options.
2021-06-12 03:40:27,wallstreetbets,"That doesn't even matter. With IV this crazy high, unless you consistently see 5-10%+ days up until expiry, or you decide to sell, IV crush and theta are going to eat these alive. As the price doesn't go up towards your $60 breakeven, the chances of it hitting that are lower and lower.

It's a YOLO, I'll give you that, just seems like you got in pretty late considering the Premium is 25%+ of the Strike price. That's high."
2021-06-12 04:05:35,wallstreetbets,Dude you'll already have lost a chunk of that value over the weekend due to theta before you can even sell on Monday. You are holding way too close to expiration on calls way under break even with 300% iv.
2021-06-12 05:30:28,wallstreetbets,"More like he got in too early. I do alot of option trading and with AMC and other meme stocks at where they're at, the only real way to make money on them is to buy weeklies or dailies (expiring same day) for quick 50 - 200% spikes on the stock going up a couple of dollars.

With current premiums, shouldn't be buying anything more than a week out from expiry.

I would recommend buying strike targets of $50 to $60 expiring June 18 on Monday."
2021-06-12 12:00:30,wallstreetbets,Is there still a market to sell them OTM in the last hours of same-day expiration?
2021-06-12 12:51:24,wallstreetbets,"Majority of the time, no. They're going to be worth so little that its probably not even worth it to sell them most of the time."

Cathie Wood’s ARKK & ARKW continues to shop and accumulate shares in $SKLZ.
Both the funds bought 10.4M shares at average ~$16 during the early may lows and increased its position size enormously to 23M+ share across ARKK & ARKW. The position is very big but they still bought shares at low levels continues to bode well for long term outlook.
Also, great news as $150M acquisition of Aarki to broaden SKLZ’s footprint: Cathie Wood’s big bet on SKLZ starts paying off.
Aarki, a technology driven marketing platform shall give access to advanced Machine Learning algorithms to be augmented by Skillz’s deep first party data. Aarki’s reach of ~465 Million monthly users on its demand side platform will extend Skillz’s player acquisition capabilities & result in lower CACs & improved margin profiles.
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005341/en/Skillz-to-Acquire-Aarki-to-Form-First-Integrated-Esports-Advertising-Platform
This is fantastic for $SKLZ as the TAM expansion is enormous by gaining access to 465M monthly users some of which can be converted to full time users on SKLZ with a high chance of cross-selling
Time for it to take-off in a big way! Come on redditors! Squeeze the $SKLZ

2021-06-12 01:37:28,wallstreetbets,"LEAPS ARE SUPREME

Not sure I understand all the hate here? Maybe novice investors.

It looks like you may have entered at a bad time... but if Palantir shakes out the way it can... you'll be fine. Maybe pick up some more LEAPS at a lower strike... and find a better entry.

*not financial advice*"
2021-06-12 10:19:51,wallstreetbets,"The decay of the time component of he options value means that it will be very difficult for those options to become profitable. The time component decays rapidly in the last 30 days of the options life... so during the period it is a bit like a down draft you are fighting against.   
   
I personally use the time component as an asset ... so I typically buy options 60- 90 days out and sell them 20- 30 days out... replaced with more 60-90 as required.   
The other strategy is to buy them very short term (10-20 days out), but only if there is a compelling case to eat the time component. I rarely do this as it is hard to make money this way."
2021-06-12 01:37:47,wallstreetbets,35’s should come back but I think those 55 and 65s are fucked. 40s have a lot of time left

2021-06-12 01:31:50,wallstreetbets,Where did you learn this investing strategy from?
2021-06-12 01:31:39,wallstreetbets,"You got leaps, you’re fine. Average down. It’s a solid company. It’ll rebound, prob in July. But don’t buy such ridiculous strikes. Either way, theta only starts to eat you apart once you’re less than 90 days to expiry, 60 days worse, 30… so come sept 17, those fuckers could have you 200-300% up. The IV crushed on palantir, but it’ll spike back up when people get interested in it again… you don’t lose til you sell to close… if you believe in the company, just wait…"

2021-06-12 01:49:16,wallstreetbets,"I’m strongly considering liquidating most of my account(currently @6k) to throw in LEAPS just to see if I could strike gold with PLUG, PLTR, FUBO or WKHS"
2021-06-12 06:05:34,wallstreetbets,No that’s for 2023
2021-06-12 01:35:03,wallstreetbets,Inthemoney on YouTube…he’s all about leaps rn and it’s actually decent advice
2021-06-12 04:04:37,wallstreetbets,on the moon ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-06-12 01:49:49,wallstreetbets,"it’s not a leap anymore

it’s june man"
2021-06-12 11:33:50,wallstreetbets,27 months? It’s 7 months away. He has one buy for 2023. Rest are 1/21/22...
2021-06-12 01:38:21,wallstreetbets,"PLTR doesn’t have to do to $65 for him to make money, just a big move within a couple months would do the trick…assuming he’s averaging down"
2021-06-12 13:12:19,wallstreetbets,This is why I low key kinda hate CSPs. When PLTR got down to around 17 my dumbass was stuck with a 21.5p that netted me about 30 bucks
2021-06-12 13:14:53,wallstreetbets,U gonna be loaded after selling those calls for 30 bucks a pop.
2021-06-12 02:25:43,wallstreetbets,Question of the year
2021-06-12 06:23:56,wallstreetbets,By putting your head down and being a workhorse. I went to public schools with no college education and still figured out how to make 250k/year
2021-06-12 04:35:49,wallstreetbets,You still equate wealth with intelligence? So much for calling people stupid.
2021-06-12 08:11:17,wallstreetbets,"Reached almost 40$ end of January, ain’t nothing stupid. You stupid for calling my fellow pltr retard stupid, stupid😉"
2021-06-12 10:24:26,wallstreetbets,"You can do this by buying options f enough out that the decay rate of the time component is very small over the time you intend to hold the options. During the period the major component of the price change will be the change in share price and the change in volatility.    
Change in share price will result in a slightly muted option price change. Change in volatility will also increase the price of the option. As a result the option s kind of like a share bought at half price with most of the share price changes reflected in the option price."
2021-06-12 12:01:22,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t need to hit 65 to make money

2021-06-12 01:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea IV crush is a son of a bitch 🤣

I held my IPOE-->SOFI calls too long recently and got IV crushed... luckily they've still got some time till expiration but definitely flipping them on the next bull run. Luckily their still itm."
2021-06-12 01:51:30,wallstreetbets,"PLUG having financial issues I've heard... but this is rumor... I can't support this with DD. They did just make a nice climb... I bought and sold July options during it.

LEAPS are basically free money over time. Maybe that term is a little loose... but this isn't financial advice lol"
2021-06-12 01:38:51,wallstreetbets,"I love LEAPS. As long as you pick a good company, enter when IV is low and try to enter at the beginning of an uptrend... boooooooom baby"
2021-06-12 01:40:51,wallstreetbets,"These aren't really LEAPS as inthemoney would suggest..

Inthemoney definitely wouldn't reccomend such a low delta LEAP

I have PLTR LEAPS doing just fine .70-.80 delta 16 and 17 dollar ITM calls"
2021-06-12 02:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Wait, 225 days to expiry is pretty leap-ish fo sho"
2021-06-12 02:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh, yeah you’re fucked."
2021-06-12 01:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Steal leap-ish by the sub standards. And he probably bought them a while back, I would think."
2021-06-12 02:22:41,wallstreetbets,I guess we will find out in 6 months.
2021-06-12 19:31:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you can sell cc until it recovers unless it drops way past your csp
2021-06-12 15:00:41,wallstreetbets,I’m enjoying the profit from my covered calls and cash secured puts
2021-06-12 10:07:34,wallstreetbets,Construction? Business owner? Do tell
2021-06-12 07:59:56,wallstreetbets,I think those who accumulate mass wealth operate on more of a base animal level if anything. Gotta have as much as possible put away so that your genes are the one’s that remain at the top of the food chain.
2021-06-12 02:14:34,wallstreetbets,I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT PLUG HAVING ISSUES…I’ve been riding since $3.20/share only on 26 shares until I rounded up to 100 shares around $23 lol I’m blind to their fuck ups at this point 😂 the streets are saying this is could go to 60?!?! I’ve held through the peak so fuck it why can’t it reach new highs?!?!?!
2021-06-12 02:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I still very new to leaps because I just started utilizing them beginning this year, but yeah seen leaps down 90% on BB  for January 2023 recover to small gains because of the recent run just due to averaging down. The leverage is unbeatable for the risk taken on such a far dated leap"
2021-06-12 03:35:19,wallstreetbets,I totally forgot PLUG was a thing.
2021-06-12 01:42:53,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the way inthemoney explains it, you don’t even have to have an optimal entry just as long as you average down, eventually any significant move in your favor should launch you into gains if it’s a decent company"
2021-06-12 02:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah he would suggest exactly the delta you have mentioned I just meant LEAPS in general. Fuck those are juicy leaps, I copped one $17.5 call leaps for 1/20/23 on my brother account and have $16 call for 11/19/21 on my account, both a over a month ago so yeah I’m enjoying those with you man hopefully it cruises above $26 next week 🙏 Ive got a sell order on my account just a little run from where we are now🚀"
2021-06-12 15:12:30,wallstreetbets,Profits? After tax it’s about 30 bucks. What profits?
2021-06-12 10:56:39,wallstreetbets,Quicken loans refi banker. Saved up for 6 years. Took a year off in Florida and decided to stay here.
2021-06-12 02:21:56,wallstreetbets,$3.20 a share?!?! Didn't PLUG go up to like $70 something??? Why you wouldn't sell at that point is beyond me lol. At some point you gotta take profits.
2021-06-12 02:13:58,wallstreetbets,Are you from nor cal?
2021-06-12 01:49:39,wallstreetbets,My SENS LEAPS are PRINTING 😆
2021-06-12 02:00:23,wallstreetbets,"I laughed when he said he doesn't give a shit about dips, he'll just average in anyways. LEAPs are supreme"
2021-06-12 15:26:36,wallstreetbets,I didn’t say I sold these exact contracts
2021-06-12 14:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Good job man, congrats, sincerely."
2021-06-12 02:36:09,wallstreetbets,Bro PLUG going to 100+ give it a couple years 🤣 I was an early holder on ENPHASE a few years back around $5/share. Held it to 60+ but sold around 45-50 after a dip back in March of 2020 🤦‍♂️ I’m still upset about it to this day man… verified good shit takes timeeeee
2021-06-12 02:15:09,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-12 15:27:47,wallstreetbets,Well enjoy getting your shares called away cuz she about to *pop*
2021-06-12 15:27:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir 🙏
2021-06-12 02:59:08,wallstreetbets,So LEAPS on PLUG it is... I'll do more research. I was just swing trading some calls lol.
2021-06-12 02:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Nice man. I grew up in Santa Rosa. I still rock the 707 phone number haha.

I hope PLUG flips back into this uptrend and it's just consolidating. I still have call options open on it. Closed some, kept some."
2021-06-12 15:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Every call I’ve sold has worked

I then used that money to buy more 

Jokes on you, cause I want them to be called away"
2021-06-12 15:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Jokes on you. Because I have a hidden 💎

Wait what? You buy more in the hopes you’ll sell the shares you’re selling calls on? Jokes definitely on you bruv"

2021-06-12 00:55:31,wallstreetbets,I don’t want to include AMC in the title because that might be why it got flagged as spam. This was made before the end of the day so it should be 15%

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I have been looking at WWE stock recently and I think it's undervalued right now. https://i.lensdump.com/i/ZgNacv.jpg

Covid and the absence of the top star, Becky Lynch had an affect on the stock price of WWE. This is a fact. (Refer to linked img)

Wrestlemania 38 is next year's biggest Pay Per View to take place in Texas, the home state of legend and icon, ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"".

For those who don't know who he is or follow wrestling, Austin was the most popular star in all of pro wrestling back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Rock and Stone Cold had the greatest feuds ever, and their WM matches were legendary and very exciting to watch. Arguably more popular than Hulk Hogan during his 80s and early 90s run, it's safe to say next year the stock of WWE will reach new highs.

Stone Cold will make some sort of return next year, but not as a wrestler since he has been retired since 2003.

Next year will be a large show, since vaccination rates all across the U.S. should be over 70% but likely closer to 90%. This would mean MANY fans will be in attendance. The live shows for the weekly RAW, NXT and SD will bring in lots of money and the stock will clearly rebound.

I also predict by next April, Becky Lynch will most likely return before or at WrestleMania 38. She already has a kid, and so I'm sure she would have found a babysitter for her girl by then. She made a lot of money during her rise to the top of the company since 2018, so she can easily afford one.

I will be buying some January calls on Monday or Tuesday, assuming it's a red day again. I think $80 strike for Jan 2022 is a safe bet. Once April options are available, I will buy $90 calls for that month."
2021-06-12 00:41:09,wallstreetbets,As a huge wrestling fan i can confirm this a not a good play with Vince still running the company… you can look at charts and graphs and projections or whatever the fuck you want but that company is run by a senile old man LOL
2021-06-12 00:50:27,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think this is a good move but if you put in the money, may it go in your favor 🤝"
2021-06-12 00:57:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure quality of the product reflects financial success when it comes to WWE.

Otherwise they would be out of business rather than posting record profits."
2021-06-12 00:59:32,wallstreetbets,AEW to the MOON
2021-06-12 00:59:53,wallstreetbets,"There’s big talks of them selling the company 

And if you’re not down with that, we got two words for!"
2021-06-12 00:29:41,wallstreetbets,WHAT?
2021-06-12 02:03:57,wallstreetbets,Wee has been overvalued since it stopped being called wwf
2021-06-12 08:54:12,wallstreetbets,"For years WWE didn’t have much competition, but with AEW heating things up… now that’s a different story. I bought shares around $44 about a year ago and recently sold as I believe this is currently the top. Also, I believe the last stock pop was when they expanded in the Middle East and did that tour, which was also short lived and had some problems with their events there. I once thought WWE was undervalued too, but Vince is not very progressive. Just my thoughts."
2021-06-12 00:34:23,wallstreetbets,"Dogshit, washed up…. MMA constantly eats its lunch in views.  Great you looked for hidden value but this ain’t it"
2021-06-12 01:18:49,wallstreetbets,"I vaguely remember reading something that Vince is selling the company? I could be wrong, though I do a lot of Valium because my fish don’t get along."
2021-06-12 02:17:59,wallstreetbets,Your wife’s undervalued
2021-06-12 01:34:41,wallstreetbets,If you smell!
2021-06-12 01:58:21,wallstreetbets,I mean. I wouldn’t.
2021-06-12 02:54:49,wallstreetbets,"There are rumors circling around that the company has changed a few executives, most notably is the appointment of Nick Khan as President and Chief Revenue Officer, that the WWE is preparing itself for a sale to Disney. 

I'd suggest to look into that as this purchase would definitely have a great effect on the WWE stock, if said rumors are true. I'm assuming once the pandemic is 'done with' and fans are allowed back into arenas weekly, that might come into fruition."
2021-06-12 15:19:31,wallstreetbets,People still watch this shit?
2021-06-12 00:32:51,wallstreetbets,"Good luck.

This isn't something I know very much about."
2021-06-12 00:32:34,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t read, but they just let go of Braun Strowman, who I know…….wwe has been on a downward spiral. Fuckin lame. Their product has been on the decline"

2021-06-12 03:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Haven’t been a Wrestling fan since I was a little kid lmao but I read an article saying WWE is trying to turn this years summer slam into a Wrestlemania sized event. With increasing capacities and more people returning to live events, I can’t see how this isn’t a good recovery play.I’m really considering buying an October Call on WWE. 👀"
2021-06-12 06:07:13,wallstreetbets,The one thing I took from this is that Stone Cold retired in 2003 and now I feel really old.
2021-06-12 09:31:38,wallstreetbets,Vince is sending wwe soon
2021-06-12 10:26:22,wallstreetbets,Aren’t ratings at an all time low?
2021-06-12 10:26:47,wallstreetbets,NBC gonna buy WWE and allow Vince to run it till he literally is being cared for by Stone Cold in a hospital bed.
2021-06-12 14:23:49,wallstreetbets,Any data to back this up?
2021-06-12 15:09:17,wallstreetbets,Wwe is a dying company.
2021-06-12 12:55:01,wallstreetbets,DOWN VOTE bad DD eh - let shit sink. UP VOTE good DD - let gold shine!
2021-06-12 01:00:43,wallstreetbets,No chance that’s what you got. lol
2021-06-12 06:48:31,wallstreetbets,"Also as a WWE fan the DD is bullshit. Becky Lynch is not why the share price dropped nor will her return make any difference.  Steve Austin wont be a regular on Tv for WWE.

Covid was good for the companys profits as they cut arena and travel cost. The deal with Peacock was very lucrative. The rise in the share price is due those reasons and also WWE cost cutting by releasing talent in the last couple if weeks.
AND very very early rumors or speculations that WWE will be sold in the future to a network or Disney possibly before Vince dies."
2021-06-12 00:48:10,wallstreetbets,The MEMEs!!
2021-06-12 09:10:45,wallstreetbets,"I agree, with Vince in charge of the company, I will not invest in WWE"
2021-06-12 01:52:33,wallstreetbets,I lol'd at this.
2021-06-12 03:01:55,wallstreetbets,"The product and cable TV viewership has climbed down the ladder in terms of priority since the company has expanded its market globally in the Middle Eastern, South and East Asian markets in recent years. They've been building facilities in those regions to recruit local stars to increase interest. However, with Vince remaining as Chairman, we won't see a big change stock wise; however if the rumors about a sale to Fox or Disney later in the year, that will surely make a noticeable difference. I'm expecting nothing until Wrestlemania though, which is around April or so."
2021-06-12 01:33:14,wallstreetbets,"WWE is big business, especially their WWE Network printing money for THEM. NBC clearly saw the value in WWE, since WWE WrestleMania is exclusive to Peacock as of this year. For those who dunno, WM is the biggest PPV for all of wrestling, trust me."
2021-06-12 16:22:13,wallstreetbets,AEW is WCW Lite.
2021-06-12 01:04:31,wallstreetbets,I hope AT&T buys them. That is another undervalued stock imo that will go parabolic eventually. AT&T are giants they are competing aggressively with Disney
2021-06-12 00:37:32,wallstreetbets,One beer!
2021-06-12 00:49:09,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-12 16:25:14,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why people are doubting WWE due to Vince. Vince was responsible for making pro wrestling a world wide spectacle in the 80s, Vince was also the reason why his company eventually won the war, buying out WCW and ECW."
2021-06-12 00:57:57,wallstreetbets,"To each their own. WWE is a money printer, it's at a discount right now imo. Come WrestleMania 38, you'd wish you picked up some calls or individual shares.

WWE is a global brand, appeals to millions AND millions of fans.

Assuming the Cena apology goes over by next April, a rumored Cena return will also help boost investor confidence."
2021-06-12 01:16:59,wallstreetbets,Does it though? By what metrics is mma (read UFC) bigger than WWE?
2021-06-12 00:34:52,wallstreetbets,Does the WWE put out regular financial statements that show what earnings were like before the pandemic shut things down?
2021-06-12 01:39:13,wallstreetbets,This is why you got a WWE can who can guide you to making money next year.
2021-06-12 00:55:21,wallstreetbets,"CLNE will be big by the end of this year. I'm just selling monthly OTM covered calls on this right now. But after June 18, I won't. I have a feeling this will peak at $22 to $25 sometime this year. Then it will likely fall back to like $13 to $24."
2021-06-12 04:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes, by October or rather near Survivor Series, I predict the stock will be around $70/share, and by December it will be even higher."
2021-06-12 17:02:19,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-06-12 17:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Lol, not in your lifetime"
2021-06-12 01:49:13,wallstreetbets,No chance in HELL!
2021-06-12 02:07:47,wallstreetbets,Enough is a enough and its for a change
2021-06-12 16:21:42,wallstreetbets,"WWE will go back to $80 very soon, and that's the bottom line!"
2021-06-12 03:03:52,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it will be AT&T.  Their venture into content didn’t go so well.  And WWE doesn’t fit well with warmer discovery. I think if anything, it would be Comcast given the addition of wwe streaming into peacock.  Put that with the fact that they have raw on nbc, it would be a good fit."
2021-06-12 01:12:04,wallstreetbets,"I’d be happy with at&t as a watcher of wwe. 

I’m hearing nbc or fox as well as Disney 

If it’s Disney wwe will never be cool again"
2021-06-12 11:58:28,wallstreetbets,WHAT ?
2021-06-12 00:49:48,wallstreetbets,Their coin will be the WEEEcoin.
2021-06-12 01:12:50,wallstreetbets,OP calling stock a 'money printer' is all I need to see to know it's gonna fucking bomb
2021-06-12 01:14:37,wallstreetbets,Banking your investment on apologies worries me
2021-06-12 01:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Exactly! MMA is kinda second place, right after boxing. No Conor, Ronda, Khabib, GSP, Tyrone Woodley is the current state of MMA. Boring and past it's popularity prime."
2021-06-12 00:59:26,wallstreetbets,They've been doing quarterlies for more than 20 years now. And other than a few spikes tied to TV deals the stock has always been pretty flat for more than 20 years now.
2021-06-12 11:58:00,wallstreetbets,Disney will turn it into some pansy social justice warrior bullshit. We need stone cold to take charge that drunken s.o.b would take this thing to the moon. Not to mention the amount of memes that could be made of that.
2021-06-12 01:26:36,wallstreetbets,"I like Disney, like their older stuff, but I hope Disney passes on WWE."
2021-06-12 11:59:00,wallstreetbets,Two beers!
2021-06-12 01:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you're upset. I call AMC and GME money printers too. Depends on what price you buy though. Right now or rather a week ago, was the best time to have bought WWE calls.

Triple H is an incredible mind, and him eventually succeeding Vince as owner is basically 99% as long as HHH wants to. HHH & Steph will take WWE to Jupiter, let alone the moon."
2021-06-12 01:27:19,wallstreetbets,Bomb in what way? lol
2021-06-12 01:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Who says I'm banking on apologies? I'm banking on 4 things;

1) Becky Lynch's return next year (she was the biggest draw from August 2018 to May 2020)
2) Stone Cold (biggest star in history, even more than The Rock and Hogan) will 99% show up at next year's WM
3) live weekly shows will return likely by January 2022, meaning lots of revenue via ticket sales. The gate for next year's WM will be INSANE.
4) Covid will be relatively unobtrusive. Why? Vaccines will keep up with new variants, AND the % of Americans being vaccinated will be over 75%. Possibly as high as high 80s to low 90s. Basically back to normal by April 3, 2022."
2021-06-12 03:54:12,wallstreetbets,"Lol and wwe isnt? Their product frankly sucks nowadays.  I dont even know what the company is going for.  Is it PG wrestling like the late 80s and early 90s?  Is it woke wrestling?  Who the fuck knows but it aint the attitude era.

People want Jerry Springer with wrasslin."
2021-06-12 12:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.

2021-06-12 16:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Here we go. Not sure why everyone is ragging on social justice warriors, lol. Stone Cold is the goat, and his appearance at WM 38 will help this stock go back to its previous high."
2021-06-12 02:27:42,wallstreetbets,OP saying his stock will go to the moon/beyond = never buy this fucking stock ever
2021-06-12 03:11:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm not too sure about that. The direction Triple H is heading towards in terms of star development and creative control does not seem to resonate all that well with the global market. It only caters to a small percentage of their fanbase. NXT is enough of an example for everyone to realize that. And only a select few of NXT graduates succeed in becoming big names while the majority of them tank once they're on the main show. That's mainly because of how Vince controls the creative aspects of the main shows of course but NXT isn't doing impressing numbers so it's extremely difficult to make a bargain on it right now, unfortunately. 

However if a sale is to occur either this year or early 2022, that's definitely gonna make an impact on the stock regardless of creative but only for a short while after the purchase. 

Also, we need to take in consideration the deal they have with the Saudi Sports Authority as that have caused them problems with investors during the event that happened in Turkey. That deal still exists and will be for the next 6 years at the very least."

2021-06-12 04:31:08,wallstreetbets,"If you haven't see NXT or a recent show like Mania 37, I implore you to check it out. still great fun with excellent matches. I grew up loving the Attitude Era stuff and WCW Nitro, so yes, this is new and different and ""PG"" but it's still good and not at all bad."

2021-06-12 16:26:18,wallstreetbets,"So anyone who says 'xyz' stock is going to the moon is wrong? Look at some of the stocks like BB, GME, TLRY, AMC, etc that went to the moon this year."
2021-06-12 16:28:09,wallstreetbets,"Huh, you're one of those people eh? You guys are at 40%+ right now. Soon, it will be 70+%"
2021-06-12 03:50:11,wallstreetbets,"I dont think 70% is unrealistic.  Look we all know 30% of the country is filled with fucking morons and thats not a right or left thing they both have their fair share of anti vaxxers.  Most of us just are sick of this shit and if the end game is a vaccine they will get it if they haven't already.  You also need to factor in schools are going to make it mandatory which is a huge swath of the country.  I mean what are these idiots going to do homeschool their kids?

But its all a moot point as for this guys DD hes weighting ticket sales far too much when TV and streaming is where the money is at and that is inevitably going to fall.  WWE has its viewers but the average person doesnt give 2 shits.  If he thinks Stone Cold just showing up is gonna be the new Renaissance hes nuts.  The dudes knees and back are shot he ain't gonna be wrestling either regularly or at all.  Now if the Rock decided he didnt want to be the biggest movie star on the planet and went back to wrestling full time then fuck yeah this is a no brainer."

2021-06-12 05:06:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah ive caught a show on tv here and there whenever I goto the inlaws because they love it.  But as someone who thought watching ecw at 1 in the morning on MSG network or whatever it was on was the pinnacle of wrestling.  This new shit is just a throwback to the early 90s without the racist characters.  Just way too vanilla.  If they arent having scaffolding matches and chanting holy shit I'm not interested.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"::RUMOR:: Keep an eye on $DISCA $T $MSFT; News started making rounds after market close that MSFT could be acquiring all/or parts of WB Interactive, announced tomorrow 6/12 at E3. Keep an eye on $DISCA $T $MSFT rumors are circulating that Microsoft could announce an acquisition at E3 tomorrow of some of WB Interactives' valuable assets (right now Rocksteady and NetherRealm are the leading candidates). AT&T had contemplated selling their gaming division last year but pulled back. This would relieve some valuable debt from the transaction between $DISCA $T and also provide $MSFT at least a couple of beloved studios that would boost GamePass and give them even more dominant IP in the gaming space. Right now these are **strong rumors** in the gaming community.

If this transaction is announced, expect volatility in all three tickers on Monday. I expect a run on $DISCA and possibly $T as the deal gets put back under the microscope by analysts and the sentiment turns positive.

Disclosure: I'm long $DISCA which is both oversold and the A class shares are being brutally shorted due to the upcoming merger which combines all classes - HF are shorting A class and buying into C class since all classes will combine at merger close by mid-2022.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BPMC is the biopharm rocket you can still get on Howdy to all bulls, bears, apes, bagholders, lambo owners, retards, and autists. Have you ever opened Stocktwits and seen a ticker you’ve never heard of trending because it mooned 400% in a day? Have you fantasized about how you could finally buy a lambo and move out of your wife’s boyfriend’s shed if you’d only gone all in on that company the day before? Chances are that company was a biotech or a biopharma company. This sector is truly the wild west of the stock market, filled with low cap, low float, low volume, high short interest stocks that can make outsized moves like mooning 400% or drilling 90% a day based on catalysts like FDA approvals/rejections and trial results. 

Now you read what I said about moving out of your wife’s boyfriend’s shed and said “Chad is a fucking douche, he always drinks all my mountain dew and won’t let me stay up past 8 o’clock” and you want out on a volatile biopharm rocket to Valhalla. Allow daddy u/Academic-Lake to introduce you to Blueprint Medicines Corporation (BPMC). 

BPMC is set to get FDA approval for a new drug called Ayvakit on June 16th, which is this Wednesday. Ayvakit will be used to treat Advanced Systemic mastocytosis (SM), which is a rare disease that can lead to organ damage and shorten life expectancies. Ayvakit is already approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but gaining approval for additional disease will broaden the scope of the drug significantly and increase sales. Analysts expect Ayvakit, if it is approved, to be a significant driver of the companies sales going forward. 

But how is the company going to make money on rare diseases? Well, the Ayvakit treatment is very pricey. A 30 day supply of tablets costs around $35,000, and the total cost of a treatment can be up to $250,000. There is no generic version of the drug available, so BPMC can effectively monopolize the treatments for these rare diseases. 

BPMC became profitable this year and has a PE ratio of 14.9, compared to the industry average of 22.4. The analyst consensus for forecasted annual earnings growth is 56.6%, compared to the industry average of 14.7%. **The average analyst consensus PT is $117.92, while I saw one site estimate a fair value of $763.57 per share.** This is a significant upside from the current price of 86.90. This FDA approval in particular will be a significant step towards achieving these targets, and BPMC also has a promising development pipeline of other drugs which I won’t cover for the sake of brevity. 

Now that we know about the catalyst that can fuel the next move up for BPMC, let’s talk institutional ownership and volume. Institutions own 99.11% of the company, and they have been buying heavily throughout Q1 and Q2. BPMC has an average 3 month volume of 401,428, and volume today was above average at slightly over 600,000. Regardless, if the catalyst of the FDA approval on June 16th throws significant buying pressure behind this stock, we could see an eye watering spike during the session. There is also a significant amount of open interest on 6/18 95c, so if they become ITM the spike could further be supercharged by MM gamma hedging.

So how do we play this? Well, we’re not exactly buying bonds here, and we’re a bunch of degenerates. In the spirit of this sub this is a true FD play. Options are surprisingly cheap on this stock, with 6/18 95c being 0.50c each as of market close Friday. If the stock spikes by just 15% on the FDA approval, the 6/18 95c will be TEN BAGGERS. And, as we’ve seen previously with some other biotech plays, these small cap biotechs can go significantly higher than just +15% on an FDA approval. 

**TL;DR**

**BPMC is significantly undervalued due to a variety of metrics, and the upcoming FDA decision on June 16th can be a catalyst to return to previous highs and above.**

This should go without saying but I am not a financial advisor and this is for entertainment only and not financial advice. Biotech plays are usually boom or bust so do not gamble any money you cannot afford to lose. I would appreciate feedback, including reasonable bear cases.

Edit: the SM treatment specifically will award the drug FDA break through status which means the company will get preferential treatment for patents and expedited review times. Breakthrough drugs cure deadly diseases. Bullish."

Looks like it held support near $91 until recently, but the news should buoy it back into that range.

One question, how’d you come about finding this ticker?"

2021-06-12 14:58:59,wallstreetbets,DD without links. My favorite.
2021-06-12 05:19:43,wallstreetbets,Any possibility that they don’t get the FDA approval and starts tanking?
2021-06-11 23:29:00,wallstreetbets,Those 6/18 95c are the easiest 10 bagger ever and potentially much mote
2021-06-11 23:57:31,wallstreetbets,Biotech and biopharm is truly the Wild West of the market. Paradise for someone with big balls and questionable ethics like ol cock slinger Shkreli

2021-06-12 09:01:00,wallstreetbets,Biotech plays are boom or bust and I wouldn’t bet any money you can’t afford to lose
2021-06-12 09:02:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your analysis, it may bust through that resistance on high volume after it’s not news halted anymore"
2021-06-12 09:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Not sure, I think any time until Tuesday close is good. Nobody knows exactly what time Wednesday this will be announced so I’d definitely want to have it before close on Tuesday"
2021-06-12 10:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the kind words! I was really intrigued by the biotech biopharm sector since those are really the ultimate event/catalyst plays. I used this calendar to find upcoming FDA approvals and did preliminary DD on a few, and this one made the most sense. https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/pdufa-calendar"
2021-06-11 23:42:57,wallstreetbets,"Although in Defense of the company, the economics of developing cures/treatments for extremely rare diseases basically dictate that the treatments must be expensive. So I don’t think that it’s motivated out of greed, like with shkreli."
2021-06-12 09:44:24,wallstreetbets,This is the ticket out of Chad’s shed!
2021-06-12 08:59:46,wallstreetbets,The FDA creates set dates way ahead of time where they meet to approve drugs. This particular one is scheduled for Wednesday.
2021-06-12 06:41:17,wallstreetbets,Well yes that’s why it’s a casino
2021-06-12 01:09:38,wallstreetbets,You sonofabitch i’m in
2021-06-11 23:58:48,wallstreetbets,I was watching a shkreli YouTube video yesterday’s about his pharma moves. Very ballsy guy and it is indeed the Wild West of the stonk market. It’s 1000% or 0%
2021-06-12 10:14:33,wallstreetbets,"That’s a surprisingly simple (and effective) method to playing the biopharm sector! 

I was just chatting it up with some buds on how it seems impossible to play the sector unless you have insider info. This at least puts you at a much better advantage.

Thanks for the link, btw! Do you do this with any other sector or just biopharm?"
2021-06-11 23:46:56,wallstreetbets,"Weird cause I have dopamine responsive Dystonia disorder which affects one in every 2 million people but this condition affects one in every 10,000 but is way higher in price to treat"
2021-06-12 14:17:47,wallstreetbets,Why doesn't the market do a better job of pricing this in? What's the actual risk of non approval? Is that what's holding the price down or are there other factors?
2021-06-12 06:44:42,wallstreetbets,Guess I’ll get a call and put. #WinningOptionTrading
2021-06-12 10:19:53,wallstreetbets,"I’ve only recently started looking at this sector. I mostly day trade and play short term things like earnings. But what I said in my intro wasn’t really a joke, I would always notice these random tickers mooning 300% and trending on Stocktwits and it was always biotech / biopharm so I decided that small bets on events in this sector could be really profitable and I could try getting into these before the catalyst and the FOMO.

Edit: that company also offers a subscription to their analysis and info which I think I will get if this play is successful"
2021-06-12 14:19:33,wallstreetbets,The market hasn’t priced this in as you say because of the uncertainty. The SP is down since the date of the FDA decision was announced in may. Risk is a total loss on options or probably a 20-30% decrease in shares as the company has other drugs and has other drugs in the pipeline.
2021-06-12 09:35:13,wallstreetbets,Lol there’s a reason the option chain is five strikes at a time 💡

BB - It could go well for them if they will start expressing to the public just what it is they are up to, now that the little black cellphones are no longer a hit."
2021-06-12 06:26:11,wallstreetbets,Puts are locked and loaded 🦍

Here are way too many users claiming they have taking ""profit"" (yes..... a loooooootttttttt of profit you have taken, like 5 times your investment....) and now want to talk the stock down in order to be able to buy in cheap again. It will never work this way. You cannot time the market, either hold or get out. It won't get any cheaper than now. Now is cheap."

2021-06-12 16:27:16,wallstreetbets,"if I lost 10k on a dumb yolo my wife would cut my balls off. BB is shite my dude. Better hang on for a loooooong time and pray they get their shit together. Most likely will go belly up tho bc their comeback phone is straight garbage. Do research bro, don’t trust these apes on here with your retirement fund and go all in on bullshit stocks. Use your brain. Blackberry does not adapt, never has, they constantly failed to heed consumer insight, and always had incredibly poor design. A lot of apes on here are going to be left holding the bag on this one"

Cybersecurity is such a huge deal right now and I think there’s massive growth potential in that area. I feel like the work they’re doing with automobile software will also be huge, but over a longer time horizon. I’ve made my bet, we’ll see what happens."

2021-06-12 17:20:13,wallstreetbets,Blackberry has no affiliation with the phones. The phone brand ‘Blackberry’ was licensed to TCL back in 2017. They are actually a cyber-security company and one of the best out there and struck a deal with Amazon. It is under valued IMO. Do sOmE rEseARcH?! Retard ape...BB to the MOON 🚀🚀🚀

**2. Option options:** Great option chain up to $30 call with options expiring this Friday (the 18th) and also options that go out until 2022.

TWNK has **grown in absolute and percent revenue annually** and is set to **make a new record in 2021.**

2021-06-12 16:46:59,wallstreetbets,"It's good you included the urban dictionary definition. Did not realize so few people have heard of the term TWNK.

On a more serious note - they have \~200m in cash. That is a good amount of dry powder to make acquisitions of healthier / more modern snacks as they did with voortmans. They have the distribution channels with every major retailer, and streamlined their operations, so acquisitions can be highly accretive. I would like to dig deeper on when they accumulated that, maybe it is indicative of something occurring soon."

2021-06-12 08:37:13,wallstreetbets,I manage a grocery store in a town of entirely fat fucks on welfare and we probably throw out a third of the hostess stock we have from it expiring (This may be a shock but twinkies dont really have shit for a shelf life)  Shit doesn't sell anymore.  Also you have to figure alot of their sales are subsidized by the government.  With the additional unemployment and expanded SNAP benefits running to an end this is going to hurt a company like Hostess alot more than say Heinz or Kraft.  They make snack foods and that's it.

2021-06-12 16:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of this is already baked in for TWNK...they have around 200m on hand and have been deploying that for acquisitions for healthier / more modern brands like voortmans. Many stores already phased out much of these hostess items, and it seems the company has already re-focused those product lines to places like gas stations and convenience stores - where folks are picking up one snacks as an impulse buy rather than boxes of the stuff."

2021-06-12 12:10:01,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t say it can’t go up. I’m merely pointing out the narrative of “Safe, reliable gains” is short-sighted at best considering the only time it has returned “safe, reliable gains” is in the time when you could’ve bought 1000’s of other stocks or even whole market etf’s and returned just as well or much better with similar drawdown. I pointed out that it’s at the top of the range because if you’re looking for a safe investment, you don’t typically dump a ton of money on something at the top.

2021-06-11 22:36:58,wallstreetbets,The best thing I ever did was learn that I didn’t have to make a trade everyday in order to make money. Once you do that you can make better decisions and not act in the heat of the moment. Also never buy at market open. You gotta give it some time to see what’s gonna happen. Trading at 9am is the quickest way to be a bag holder.

2021-06-11 23:28:49,wallstreetbets,I don't feel bad for you. That money was already taken. You owed it to someone else and you got greedy. I sure hope you don't have any dependants. There's no reason they should suffer from your stupidity.

2021-06-12 00:06:51,wallstreetbets,"I'd ask why you sold safer July calls for nearer expiry calls but I think we all know the answer. I hope you learned from this at least to buy farther expiry options, or in your case maybe never buy options since you're not sure how they work exactly. Buy shares instead because its safer."
2021-06-12 00:27:08,wallstreetbets,"This is why I dont mess with options. It is like a doin toss most of the time. I did it once and lost money. Tried once more and lost money, but only lost under $100 total. Future reference options isnt your game my good man.

Why would you put money into the market options and that my dude like I’m not even trying to clown on you I feel genuinely bad for you but at the same time you knew the risks. I’m pretty sure a lot of investors in this forum right now, only put money into the meme stocks from the profits they made off the meme stocks!! If you’re going to play options man or especially the stocks because it’s pretty much gambling it’s not even investing you have to realize and be prepared for if things don’t go your way for example I didn’t throw that much only about 2000 for 6/18, I bought nothing but call options with that money had I sold when WISH Was up over $14 for like a minute and a half I would’ve made a nice chunk of change but I got greedy and now I’m negative but I’m not going to sell so I hope you didn’t so either just have faith!! Don’t do that stupid shit again and you better start thinking about a Plan B just in case something doesn’t go your way"

Loss porn is funny when people lose their own money. You lost other people's money. Your upside was money in your pocket at the risk of cash made on the backs of the lower classes who inevitably cover the difference created by your uncollectible debt.

Haha, fuck you, go to hell you selfish pile of discarded pet station fecal packages."

2021-06-12 03:48:35,wallstreetbets,Need to clear your cache and restart. That's what I always do.
2021-06-12 04:02:54,wallstreetbets,"This is like peak WSB porn loss right here, losing your rent money on FD's."
2021-06-12 04:23:18,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly why you dont put in what you cant afford to loose, 
On a second note it's only a loss if you sell, it needs some time."
2021-06-12 04:34:32,wallstreetbets,You got fucked by hedge fund pump and dump
2021-06-12 04:34:41,wallstreetbets,Is your wife looking for a bf ?
2021-06-12 05:00:24,wallstreetbets,Eh. Low grade loss porn. Go do it again.
2021-06-12 05:14:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe Im the real retard but cant u just sell the calls you have. Some $$ better than no $$
2021-06-12 05:24:04,wallstreetbets,But you’re green after hours. Bullish sign.
2021-06-12 05:43:07,wallstreetbets,This will be a character building learning experience to not gamble money you can't afford to lose.
2021-06-12 05:46:28,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it
2021-06-12 06:18:09,wallstreetbets,You belong here
2021-06-12 06:23:34,wallstreetbets,You should stop while you’re woefully behind.
2021-06-12 06:24:47,wallstreetbets,Relax. You still have a spare kidney.
2021-06-12 06:33:07,wallstreetbets,Lol.
2021-06-12 06:40:55,wallstreetbets,Man look at the tuesday chart how it started. That is how dumping looks like. You remember next time you see an awful chart like that. I learned on gme when it crashed and i bought. Shit happens. I got out of wish with still a bit pluss sitting in a traffic jam.
2021-06-12 06:45:47,wallstreetbets,The retard is strong in this one.
2021-06-12 06:58:15,wallstreetbets,What kind of actual real life moron do you have to be to use your RENT MONEY TO GAMBLE. Hoping for the best for you but jeez dude make smarter choices.
2021-06-12 07:19:03,wallstreetbets,"1-800-522-4700 

  Dial that number and explain what happened."
2021-06-12 07:24:01,wallstreetbets,"first of all, stay away from distraction stocks. Go AMC or GME. second of all, don't invest something you cant lose. its like going to casino and betting your life savings. yes, there is a possibility you could retire at 20s, but its more likely you will lose all of it."
2021-06-12 07:29:50,wallstreetbets,that's truly retarded
2021-06-12 07:30:48,wallstreetbets,This is wish the dodgy shopping site yea? What inspired you to do this?
2021-06-12 07:30:54,wallstreetbets,Hope you are alright mate. Ppl here if u need to talk
2021-06-12 07:33:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe that “earn rewards” button there will clean it up?
2021-06-12 07:38:33,wallstreetbets,Switzerland is so expensive that BJs go for 100-200$. You can earn what you lost with some honest work in no time 🤡
2021-06-12 07:38:43,wallstreetbets,I WISH I may I WISH I mite get enough customers behind Wendy’s tonight.
2021-06-12 07:40:03,wallstreetbets,Serves you right for gambling money you couldn't afford to lose.
2021-06-12 07:42:05,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone.
2021-06-12 07:43:00,wallstreetbets,This is why the government says they need to “protect” retail side.
2021-06-12 07:56:57,wallstreetbets,Don't play with money you can't afford to lose!
2021-06-12 08:03:02,wallstreetbets,Live by the sword die by the sword
2021-06-12 08:04:40,wallstreetbets,"DO. NOT. FUCKING. BUY, unless you're ready to lose it all."
2021-06-12 08:15:19,wallstreetbets,Please post this in the ‘how not to invest’ thread please.
2021-06-12 08:17:25,wallstreetbets,"Since this is a casino, I’d tell you that you have a problem and time for you to contact GA.

Don’t bet the rent money you fucking knob."
2021-06-12 08:17:53,wallstreetbets,This is so retarded
2021-06-12 08:20:30,wallstreetbets,Have you ever bought off wish it's likes ordering a moon ticket and getting cheese 🧀
2021-06-12 08:23:11,wallstreetbets,And how exactly did you make it into the negatives?
2021-06-12 08:24:04,wallstreetbets,"damn your account is low and your battery life is low, whats next?"
2021-06-12 08:26:26,wallstreetbets,Just delete the app
2021-06-12 08:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Well, that was a poor life decision. Don't bet money you can't afford to lose. Especially with options. At least shares can be sold back at a loss to keep your fucking lights on. 

I hope you make it dude. I hope you.learned a good lesson. WISH was a big old pump and dump."
2021-06-12 08:47:06,wallstreetbets,"That amount can be a lot for most, but could be much much worse my brother. Stay strong and you'll get through things. You should take a leave from gambling and stock market"
2021-06-12 08:47:14,wallstreetbets,Maybe stop investing your rent money
2021-06-12 08:47:34,wallstreetbets,Lol retards gonna retard
2021-06-12 08:52:57,wallstreetbets,I really hope you didn’t sell though because if you didn’t sell at that point in time you were just down you didn’t technically lose you were just down by shit load because if by some miracle it took off like a rocket you could pay your rent times three but if you sold…..then you have a real problem
2021-06-12 09:09:14,wallstreetbets,"OP, if you ever need someone to talk to, you can PM me"
2021-06-12 09:14:27,wallstreetbets,Play stupid games win stupid prizes. How fucking dumb is it to play with the very thing that keeps the rain and cold off of you? I guess ape dumb is dumb enough. Lmfao
2021-06-12 09:20:59,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-12 09:34:45,wallstreetbets,This is why you get a margin account.  You always need backup money to get the rent check back.
2021-06-12 09:45:21,wallstreetbets,First time I’ve ever heard of someone rolling calls in
2021-06-12 09:50:32,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-12 10:08:11,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-06-12 10:12:45,wallstreetbets,Sorry :( this is a good lesson now for you to remember to not bite off more then you can chew. Always make sure your bills are paid and just use whatever you can afford to lose to play with. I’m a special Ed teacher so I make shit and only throw 50-100 bucks at something but I figure that’s what I would had spent on a night out anyway so I don’t fear losing it.
2021-06-12 10:13:03,wallstreetbets,you should have set aside basic living expenses.  that is rule 1. rule 2 is buy high sell low.
2021-06-12 10:17:52,wallstreetbets,Everybody blows up their account at some point OP. You’ll be OK.
2021-06-12 10:20:05,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately this is most people’s outcome after a day on WSB. 

Why invest your rent money?"
2021-06-12 10:53:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-12 10:55:20,wallstreetbets,There's always money in the banana stand
2021-06-12 10:57:26,wallstreetbets,This is not the way 🥴
2021-06-12 10:57:45,wallstreetbets,Just calmly and honestly explain your situation to the landlord they will understand and maybe even give you a break
2021-06-12 11:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Trading on margin, otm calls, on Robinhood, before paying your bills? Wow your parents must be so proud!"
2021-06-12 11:02:13,wallstreetbets,"You got lucky on some bot recommended meme stock. Now you got greedy, doubled down and ducked up."
2021-06-12 11:06:36,wallstreetbets,....and this is why you don't gamble money you can't afford to lose.
2021-06-12 11:13:40,wallstreetbets,Oh my god! My eyes! they burnnnn!
2021-06-12 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,When you don’t understand options at all but make decisions Solely on WSB posts.
2021-06-12 11:22:15,wallstreetbets,I love this shit
2021-06-12 11:27:56,wallstreetbets,Sell your semen
2021-06-12 11:37:27,wallstreetbets,That’s what you deserve for being a retard
2021-06-12 11:37:39,wallstreetbets,I don't know what's more ridiculous this morning: this post or the one about the AMC/GME merger. Fuck me dead
2021-06-12 11:40:17,wallstreetbets,“God Damn it Karen”
2021-06-12 11:54:04,wallstreetbets,Should have gone blackberry my guy
2021-06-12 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,I always take what I put in out after the gain.
2021-06-12 12:21:19,wallstreetbets,"It's bad enough you're on Robinhood still, but on margin?"
2021-06-12 12:22:06,wallstreetbets, A fool and his money shall soon part. Ancient wisdom still holds up today.
2021-06-12 12:35:29,wallstreetbets,"put credit spread? capture some premiums to cover that loss? Work on a theta strategy, maybe."
2021-06-12 12:36:27,wallstreetbets,If you don't know what you're doing buy fucking shares
2021-06-12 12:39:27,wallstreetbets,NO RENT MONEY ON YOLO…whatever the fucker you are…Next time find a place near Wendy’s before you YOLO.
2021-06-12 12:39:33,wallstreetbets,Congratulations. You will be homeless because you are irresponsible and stupid. In the future hopefully you will become an adult and learn to be responsible.
2021-06-12 12:44:30,wallstreetbets,Bro chill thats like 1 month salary
2021-06-12 12:46:21,wallstreetbets,The good part is you only have to learn a lesson once.
2021-06-12 12:57:10,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone bro 😅
2021-06-12 13:36:05,wallstreetbets,Quick! Better find an available space behind Wendy’s. They’re filling fast. Lots of other Wish bag holders need rent money.
2021-06-12 13:55:32,wallstreetbets,"Stop gambling, buy CLF on margin.

Survive on FoodStamps until december, pay rent next year."
2021-06-12 14:01:51,wallstreetbets,Did you crossed your fingers when you made that wish 🧞‍♂️
2021-06-12 15:31:24,wallstreetbets,"All the yolo plays and DD posts had me hopeful for wish. Now, I realized those posts were made by new accounts (bots). Does wish actually have legs, or did I fall for a pump and dump?"
2021-06-12 15:55:01,wallstreetbets,"Homeless people will have lots of time to think about dumb mistakes like YOLO bets on near-term expiry calls; most probably won't learn anything and will keep doing the same thing again and again, but some will learn and crawl out of their stupidity and not do it again.  
Your choice."
2021-06-12 16:08:12,wallstreetbets,How do you go to negative at least this will smooth your brain more young Ape

2021-06-12 16:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Classic rookie mistake. ONLY ROLL OUT ON IV SPIKES. 

Never roll to a closer date unless you do it BEFORE the IV spike."
2021-06-12 17:45:56,wallstreetbets,First off you are In robbing hood so that tells me one thing about your decision making skills.
2021-06-12 17:51:36,wallstreetbets,how are you negative tho
2021-06-12 17:59:30,wallstreetbets,The further I scroll down the comments and see how retarded op really is the funnier this gets 🤣🤣🤣

2021-06-12 12:53:44,wallstreetbets,Call up the stock market manager and ask for a refund.
2021-06-12 13:10:55,wallstreetbets,He belongs here
2021-06-11 22:49:45,wallstreetbets,What’s a couch soaked in semen and piss sell for?
2021-06-11 23:10:38,wallstreetbets,Actually check between the cushions for change first
2021-06-11 23:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Couch, TV, Computer, cellphone, all his furnishings. Gotta make enough to double down that loss."

2021-06-11 22:50:56,wallstreetbets,This. Seriously people.
2021-06-12 09:09:39,wallstreetbets,Well I mean rolling your options backwards is some real out of the box 96 chromosome shit.  I'm assuming he has no fucking clue about theta values or thinks he bought European style options or something.  I can't for the life of me wrap my head around any of those choices other than well I can get more contracts this way.
2021-06-11 22:57:55,wallstreetbets,This is a Wendy’s. Who are you talking to?
2021-06-12 01:19:00,wallstreetbets,You have to be pretty wealthy to have enough money that you can afford to lose any of it.  The majority of people in here are trying to get to achieve that through these means.
2021-06-12 08:26:59,wallstreetbets,"Especially options. You're taking an investment, which is already risky, and slapping an end date on it"
2021-06-12 10:28:52,wallstreetbets,Cant lose money if you homeless.
2021-06-12 02:45:30,wallstreetbets,Shut up pussy you can't hang
2021-06-12 00:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of my buddy and his brother winning big at a local casino. They fucking ran to the elevator, unable to stop talking about their win, jumping up and down, high fiving and shit, nearly crying.

They had already been celebrating in the moving elevator, when they noticed a lady crying because she YOLOd her rent money and lost it all, every penny she had. And she was just fucking bawling, makeup everywhere. Awkward.

Today, you are makeup lady. Hopefully tomorrow you'll be my fat retard friend.

This is a casino, sir."
2021-06-12 00:01:58,wallstreetbets,Double Down!
2021-06-12 01:22:05,wallstreetbets,Only if you buy options.
2021-06-12 03:04:21,wallstreetbets,Where the house always wins
2021-06-11 22:54:16,wallstreetbets,Just learned the hard way about the 9am bag holder thing a few days ago .... Appreciate the other tips!
2021-06-12 08:39:04,wallstreetbets,"Yep one of my cardinal rules is I don't trade the first hour or two of the market

I might occasionally miss some gains but I stopped losing money a lot faster


Many days I'll deliberately sleep in just so I'm not even able to fomo at the open"
2021-06-11 23:45:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed but opposite.....I generally always SELL at the open ......Cheers my brotha
2021-06-11 22:51:33,wallstreetbets,Facts. Let the stock breath a little.
2021-06-12 00:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Works when it moons like CLOV, not when you're a day or two late with WISH or CLNE lol. Pls turn around next week ;)"
2021-06-12 02:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Bingo. I learned to take my time. Time is your friend. Do your research before dumping money in. You don’t need to trade everyday. On the days you aren’t trading, study other stocks and their movements. Get to know their personality. And when the time is right. Strike. Money is precious. Learn to respect it and study the fuck out of every play you are going to execute on."
2021-06-11 23:47:59,wallstreetbets,So always sell covered calls at 9am? I bet I'm still gonna lose money.
2021-06-12 09:09:20,wallstreetbets,"fu*k yeah, only if I did not fall for the market open trap (more than once :d) and leaving the trade be is also a good point,"
2021-06-12 10:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Sell at 9, buy at 11"
2021-06-12 10:19:19,wallstreetbets,"limit sell orders popping at market open, only for the stock to drop right after is the sweetest."
2021-06-12 10:24:15,wallstreetbets,I've made some of.my best trades early.
2021-06-12 12:25:16,wallstreetbets,I like premarket into opening trades. Be quick and take profit early but those setups deliver more consistently imo. At least lately.
2021-06-11 23:05:23,wallstreetbets,But it IS retarded...
2021-06-12 08:49:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-06-12 08:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Nah, he should give up until he has money he’s able to lose."
2021-06-12 00:19:03,wallstreetbets,That's the way
2021-06-11 23:32:17,wallstreetbets,"If OP made more than the deposit and had sold before his ACH deposit bounced he would've kept the profit.

Robinhood would just take what was owed out  of his cash balance."

2021-06-12 02:19:24,wallstreetbets,"In his case, it was what Robinhood could afford to lose."
2021-06-12 12:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Ha, I've been kind of ignoring the wish posts, I didn't realize it was THAT wish. Somebody dropped half a million in that stock yesterday? Wild."
2021-06-11 23:21:33,wallstreetbets,I fuxkong knew that and did it anyway.  Only been at this just ober a month.  Lesson learned.
2021-06-11 22:43:17,wallstreetbets,Theres always money in the banana stand. Some of them are up ape asses though
2021-06-11 22:58:50,wallstreetbets,Or in Wendy's
2021-06-12 11:52:08,wallstreetbets,This is Definitely the way
2021-06-11 22:40:07,wallstreetbets,On the 15th
2021-06-11 22:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's just don't trade with money you can't lose and make sure you have enough money in the bank so that you don't end up on the line for instant buying power."
2021-06-11 23:15:56,wallstreetbets,I’m confused!  I thought with options you just lose the premium. Am I missing something?
2021-06-12 00:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Hey congrats, WSB is now a bunch of fucking pussies. Lets go back to 2019 please."
2021-06-11 22:36:56,wallstreetbets,Get off wsb then
2021-06-11 23:53:40,wallstreetbets,Option get you high returns fast
2021-06-11 22:41:26,wallstreetbets,He should be happy this isn’t a guh level yolo.
2021-06-11 22:45:27,wallstreetbets,"As shitty as this situation is, this doesn't even come close to guh."
2021-06-11 22:43:15,wallstreetbets,I'm starting to see hints of the old wsb now that the apes have discovered options
2021-06-11 22:44:17,wallstreetbets,Hoping man if not filing bankruptcy in 40k debt this was my $wish to get out of it
2021-06-11 23:14:10,wallstreetbets,"It's not trading against people to sell covered calls. You're taking a premium in return for limiting your upside and uninformed investors and degenerates are gambling. They wouldn't apologize to you if they bought your shares for a hundred bucks when they're trading at a thousand. Options were meant to limit risk for investors but if people want to use them for gambling, that's on them. Most of my money is in safe investments and I have a certain amount to gamble every week. If I buy your calls and lose, that's the game brother."
2021-06-11 23:30:06,wallstreetbets,"If it wasn't you some big institutional investor would've wrote it, so it's okay. At least someone is profiting off of OPs pain."
2021-06-12 06:03:44,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Whenever theres a risky investment remember this is a zero-sum game.
2021-06-12 00:30:43,wallstreetbets,He might need to if he cant pay the electric either
2021-06-12 00:30:40,wallstreetbets,Too late
2021-06-11 22:56:04,wallstreetbets,How did that happen?

2021-06-12 00:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Dooooood this is how I fucked up clov. Made 35% gain that day, more than ever before, then I bought more not aaafter it had crashed but fucking during it. Like it probably went up the slightest bit and was like TIME TO BUY.

Future me is going to just take a siesta and at 5 check what I want to buy. Lost 8k last week because I bought a bunch of calls on WISH and CLN when it opened. I knew better but I had shot up so quick I was like well what's the worst that can happen I go down to what I start at. Pulled the trigger while I was  still up 400% in the last two weeks. But jeez I need to learn.

2021-06-12 11:17:12,wallstreetbets,"It's OK to bet on meme stocks, but pick ones with good fundamentals and which haven't mooned recently.

Never hold long options into their last 2-3 weeks, sell or roll before that.

If you're >100% up, consider selling enough to make ""break even"" your worst case. 

My biggest long gains this year came from CLF and GME, but biggest short gains from WISH, AMC, NKLA, and one I can't name on this sub that sounds a bit like ""oxygen""."
2021-06-11 23:22:49,wallstreetbets,"Yup, but if you buy calls for all your money, losing the full premium means losing all your money.

Basically: If you buy options, it’s quite easy to lose close to the full amount you put in. It’s also quite easy to make a bag though (compared to shares)."
2021-06-11 23:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but premium is times 100 (options are 100 shares) and he has multiple contracts. If I am correct, he spent money on calls, then the calls lost value. So now he is down 3 grand."

He would be getting calls from Visa collectors drunk at 2pm asking them if they accept Mastercard for payment which he also maxed out. just to have company.  Ultimately they couldn't collect shit. It was a rough time this was in the 90s. I met him in 2016 he wanted to crash on my couch till he got his social security.  He drove Uber eats deliveries saved his money . all his debts eventually were marked as uncollectwble and his credit score is 0. He is 65 swiping away on bumble. getting more dates than me. Debt is hard . Bankruptcy and money problems are frustrating but when you're going threw hell the only way out is threw. 

You will be alright"
2021-06-11 23:38:03,wallstreetbets,Then might as well take whatever loans you can and roll the dice

2021-06-12 00:40:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a dumb ape.

My first few weeks I tried swinging my dick up on the bar... Lost money.

Then slowed down and worked on ""proof of concept"".

Watched PRPL get creamed after a earnings report a few months ago. Read some fin-news site say it wasn't a bad report and market overreacted.

So I bought 2 $35c and 2 $40c like 3 weeks out... For like $140 for all 4 contracts. I watched for 2 weeks as the stock price increased, watched the contract value rise. Learned a lot and it turned into a triple bagger.

At my most excitable I make the biggest mistakes.

When I saw DISCA get crushed I said, ""fuck, Discovery is a legit company, no way it stays crushed. Bought 20 contracts. It stayed crushed.

Then on day 2 of the MVIS hype I went in heavy and lost.

My only 2 major fuckups.

I do best when I have no emotional connection. I've made tons of money buying WMT options every time it drops by a buck or two. 80% of the time it's a 50% return in less than 2 days."

2021-06-12 12:28:04,wallstreetbets,Selling at open is good idea! I dunno wtf ppl are on about here. I can’t tell you how many times (sometimes every day like clockwork) a position will spike and then settle by 9:45. Yes sell these spikes.

Even in the worst case scenario, all OP would have to do is deposit $1k to release the funds if they wanted to give him a hard time.

From the article

GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson raised the price target on Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE: CLF) to $28.35 (from $22.09) while maintaining a Buy rating. 

The analyst commented, ""According to a new analysis we built that analyzes CLF's cash flows based on various benchmark HRC price scenarios and just a handful of static assumptions, at current spot quotes CLF is trading at <0.6x forward 2022 and 2023 EBITDA, indicating substantial upside potential when extrapolating today's prices onto a mid-cycle multiple of about 5x 

Johnson adds that that CLF’s shares could see +675% upside (above $180) should the market begin to extrapolate today’s HRC prices into the future at a mid-cycle EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.0x.

Top notch balance sheet, strong free cashflows of 1 Billion+ a year, 5% dividend, strong growth until at least late 2022 and a really cheap valuation.

The only risk that I see here is that they operate in Latin America, which is not the most safest country to operate in.

It's a trade-off and if you see the chart for yourself, they already traded around $40 when steel was much lower.

Every other steelmaker already rose a lot so they have a lot of catchup to do."
2021-06-12 10:30:14,wallstreetbets,"I'd recommend looking into:

US-  NUE, STLD, SCHN, CMC (earnings next week)

EU - MT

Mexico - TX

LATAM - SID, GGB"

2021-06-12 02:01:05,wallstreetbets,X is undervalued still even more
2021-06-12 03:46:54,wallstreetbets,"Baby steps.  You shouldn't try to be in the same game the experienced folks are doing.  It's like watching a BMX race while you just got training wheels.  I only sell covered calls, and stay away from margin.  I got really lucky with my CC this week; and happened to recognize that the underlying's price had shifted so much.  I decided to book the profit.  

But I also bought some FDs this morning and lost out on $150.  So, live and learn.

If you can't afford a play, leave it alone. There will always be another one coming along shortly."

2021-06-12 02:04:25,wallstreetbets,If unions continue gaining more strength then I imagine this will all have a snowball effect. It makes sense why American steel is making  a huge comeback with Trump and Biden both taking firm stances against China.
2021-06-12 03:54:47,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty much how I was thinking. I'm not even sure about the difference between a covered call and a regular one. I don't use margin because I'd rather not go in to debt. No clue about underlying price or booking profit either. 

FD's?

Great philosophy to follow. Very many thanks in advance."

Let's just call FDs ""Friday"" Delights.  These are weekly options that expire Fridays, end of day. Some of us buy them as a not-that-cheap thrill, hoping for a surprise ending that will be in the money by the end of the day.  Newsflash, if thy were likely to be in the money, they would be expensive, not cheap.  

Covered calls are where you sell a call to the market, based on you owning 100 shares of the underlying stock.  Naked calls are when you sell a call and you do not own the stock.

That was a joke though. I would not recommend selling that put"
2021-06-12 04:02:39,wallstreetbets,"This is going to hurt, come Friday.  This is an expensive tuition fee in price volatility of options! Check through the AMC predictions, here and elsewhere for what may happen on Monday, and plan an entry to sell one if applicable.  i.e prices usually go up the 1st 30 mins after open.  (Look $470x3 is better than nothing if it closes OTM on Friday.  You are into risk probabilities and mitigation here.)  Find a balance between being upset you sold too low (if the price goes up next week), or upset you didn't sell when it was worth something.  This is something you have to think about, no one else can make that decision for you.  Hopium is also an addictive drug.

You do realize what you did is called a FOMO right?  Recognize the feeling that made you press that buy button on Questrade. And smack that feeling down next time!  You bought a contract with not enough runway for it to land or takeoff as you want it to."
2021-06-12 00:30:17,wallstreetbets,"i bought 9 shares at 58.50 when it closed at like 68 last week, i almost bought those shares at 66 before i learned to wait till Monday when stocks was open, then as the market opened and saw the huge buy/sell in prices, i still didn't wait long enough and boom, 9 shares as i saw the price get higher......then within an hour of the market being opened.... lower and lower........now I'm just gonna hold. Movies are coming out this year so at some point i hope to recover. Hurts to lose even 20 a share."
2021-06-12 08:31:52,wallstreetbets,Just leave it alone and learn from it. AMC can go up and down so fast. The likelihood of getting burned again by doubling down is highly likely. Leave it alone and maybe Monday if it’s going up someone will buy them off you. Reduce your loss that way. Not by throwing more $ at it.

2021-06-12 04:21:31,wallstreetbets,Hey man I don’t know you but I will remember you and your advice! Thank you very much for the advice this is just what I’m looking for! :)
2021-06-12 14:30:47,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m actually looking for ways to at least minimize loss because I still have until Friday until the exp.
2021-06-11 23:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Just remember, be patient, and study. Do those two things and you'll be fine"
2021-06-11 23:36:05,wallstreetbets,"June 18 60p is showing $15.45 premium, so under 60$ and you’re (most likely) gonna get assigned. 


If the current price for the stock is 44.55 and you sold the assigned shares at that price then you receive 44.55 and 15.45 = 60 per share = you break even

Below 44.55 and you’re losing money. Between 44.55 and 60$ youre profiting 1$ per 1¢ because of the 100 shares in each contract. Say the price is 50$, then you buy for 60, but then you got 15.45 and 50 per share which = 5.45 profit per share


Robinhood actually has a decent visualization of what your profit/loss at expiration is, or you can use option profit calculator (website) 


Selling a put is a bullish tactic, so is buying a call. So doing both is just two bullish plays"
2021-06-11 23:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, appreciate your advice :)"
2021-06-11 23:52:15,wallstreetbets,"I think I get it. Selling the put increases the downside risk, at a time when hes dealing with too much downside risk.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $SENS makes sense sentimentally By now, you retards have likely seen that SENS has a solid short float (25.81%) and promising, long-term value.  If you haven't, just buy SENS.  Or don't... I don't really give a shit.  But please do one thing, though... Spare me the comments (and downvotes) that AMC and GME are the only true plays and/or that my account is new (been lurking Reddit without an account since most of you were a bunch of neckbeards).  As a Type 1 diabetic, I'm on some sentimental shit with SENS and why the shorts can get rekt. 


*  Diabetes is a serious, long-term condition with a major impact on the lives and well-being of around 500MM individuals globally
   *  This half a billion number is projected to increase by 25% in 2030 and 51% in 2045
* Diabetes is among the top 10 causes of death in adults, and it was estimated to have caused four million deaths globally in 2017 
* In 2019, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes -- 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose in 2012 

Here's the thing... Deaths and major complications caused by diabetes are 100% preventable with the right technology to help manage blood glucose levels.  Companies like SENS are literally saving lives with their technology.  I can personally say that continuous glucose monitoring significantly reduces the burden of living with diabetes and improves quality of life, and I'm grateful that diabetes technology has come so far. 

Even if you don't give a shit about the sentimental value of seeing SENS succeed, the market for its products is sizeable, given that this chronic illness affects nearly 500MM people. 

TLDR: Fuck Diabetes. Fuck the shorts. Buy $SENS. 

See you on the blood moon.  Gang, gang. 🩸🚀"

2021-06-11 23:24:34,wallstreetbets,SENS can definitely make a run up but they have a huge competitor in Abbott with Freestyle Libre and the Dexcom. Also the 180 day product has been available in europe for awhile now but the market share does not belong to them at all.... what makes you think it will be any different here in the us? Not to mention US healthcare system with private insurance formulary coverage is awful to navigate. Good luck finding a plan that will cover this product over the libre. Libre is barely even covered without a 75$ copay btw. MD visit required for eversense implantation too. Just a little skeptical. Best play for this company might be being bought out like another poster has said

2021-06-12 05:39:30,wallstreetbets,Just wondering if the possibility of glucose monitoring in the apple watch creates a threat to their long term viability?
2021-06-12 00:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Same, I got 1k shares at 2 bucks and now I'm regretting not going harder. 

Thinking about dropping 10k on Monday which for me is a full blown yolo."
2021-06-12 01:43:17,wallstreetbets,"I recommend you subscribe to Doctor Dean Medtech on YouTube. He does a lot of videos on the latest diabetes drugs and tech. This is not financial advice, but I personally like a stock he has covered called Humacyte. They are engineering blood vessels at the moment - building them in a lab on a collagen skeleton. They're then washed in a special solution to stop an immune reaction and remove the necessity for immunosuppressants. Early trials of these blood vessels look promising and they have more complex bio-structures in their long term pipeline, including a bio-vascular pancreas in 2026. Doctor Dean covers many other diabetes stocks too you may be interested in. All the best to your mum."
2021-06-12 00:36:50,wallstreetbets,"Not to kill your hope but all pancreas transplants failed so far.  Roughly, people get to live on immunodepresants for a year or two and then diabetes comes back. Kills those beta cells again. Because nobody knows what causes it yet. 

Beta cell transplants made through stem cell technology is a promising development. Vertex bought the company that can make stem cells on industrial scale. They have something in Phase 1/2 now."
2021-06-12 16:20:31,wallstreetbets,I hope you make gainz and can help your mom too bro. We're rooting for you
2021-06-12 01:20:23,wallstreetbets,Look up SENS pipeline. Look up the interview with Tim Goodnow on the Nerdabetic YouTube page. There's your answer.
2021-06-12 11:33:02,wallstreetbets,"As a diabetic using Dexcom, as soon as I found out about the everSENSe CGM, I got ahold of a rep for a benefits check to get their 90 day inserted after my next endo visit in a few weeks. I'm so tired of Dexcom sensors falling off, breaking, giving random errors, and being impossible to remove for a swim. Tired of the device restrictions, constant ""your sensor is about to expire"" notifications, and sick of the 2h warmups. I'd love to just swap sensors every endo visit and stop having days without CGM readings because my pharmacy doesn't carry transmitters without special order."
2021-06-12 06:11:53,wallstreetbets,"Dexcom blows but is probably the best available currently, The libre just recently began having the readings automatically transmit to a phone so they’re really behind tech wise"
2021-06-12 00:09:20,wallstreetbets,Roche has been doing shit marketing but their new partner Ascensia (Bayer) is much more committed
2021-06-12 01:28:03,wallstreetbets,"It's going to take time to build this brand. Medical practitioners have to be convinced of this relatively new tech and trained in how to perform the procedure and set up the device. Insurance companies have to be convinced that the added benefits are worth it and payback in terms of healthy customers. For anyone who is diabetic or knows diabetics, they can see this product is advantageous in terms of it's convenience. What's more, the 6 month version was many times better than the 3 month version and the 12 month version will be many times better than the 6 month version. Particularly when the Freedom system is released."
2021-06-12 11:46:49,wallstreetbets,"The cash price for their sensors is lower than Dexcom, even while they're locked to 90 days for us usage. When diabetics like myself find out about them, we want them. They just need promotion, and already work with large insurers like BCBS."
2021-06-11 22:44:27,wallstreetbets,It's a $5 company easy. Have you seen commercials for what's on the market now? Clunky boomer hockey pucks!
2021-06-11 23:49:56,wallstreetbets,Yes it is.
2021-06-11 22:41:50,wallstreetbets,I read it in Wilford Brimleys voice
2021-06-12 00:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Whom ""them"" ? SENS is making blood glucose meters (CGM). Not insulin pumps. Not insulin pens."
2021-06-12 12:16:23,wallstreetbets,"As an actual diabetic, insulin prices haven't changed for me since before Biden. Insulin was $25 at Walmart since before Obama left office. CGMs can benefit from spikes in insulin prices, as they make using the riskier (cheap) insulin safer, but companies other than WalMart charge every penny the market will withstand already, and will continue to do so until actual price caps are put into place rather than forcing local governments to subsidize some negligible percentage of type 1's living under the poverty line (and still not using healthcare.gov). I'm sure those 5 people are very sad."
2021-06-12 12:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Anything under Dexcom is a dip. They just need advertising, I  started the process to switch when I discovered them."
2021-06-12 11:49:11,wallstreetbets,"No, CGMs are good for all insulin users, and should be available for all diabetics. Constant glucose info keeps A1c lower and prevents lows"
2021-06-12 10:37:27,wallstreetbets,All these comments are reading like an ad.
2021-06-12 12:04:17,wallstreetbets,It was a pump and dump there in January too
2021-06-12 00:10:17,wallstreetbets,More reason to get on and dump when it doubles
2021-06-11 23:22:09,wallstreetbets,What part of life-saving technology is not exciting… 🥴
2021-06-12 07:07:26,wallstreetbets,Read about their project Gemini. It’s a few years out. 365 day sensor with no on-body transmitter. As close as a diabetic can get to “freedom.” Complete game changer.
2021-06-11 23:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Why? Let me hear it, ole 69."
2021-06-12 11:45:02,wallstreetbets,"It may.. but I suspect apple watch won't get medical device certified, i.e. communicate with an insulin pump to alter insulin needs. I think apple will be more like a fit bit with reading that are useful but not acceptable medically. That's my thoughts"
2021-06-12 06:46:16,wallstreetbets,Accuracy is critical for type 1s and frankly many of the CGMs on the market today that actually touch fluid under the skin are not accurate enough. A non invasive option on an Apple Watch is unlikely to have the accuracy needed for diabetics. Not to mention the Apple Watch would need fda approval. In reality Apple’s sensor will probably work perfectly fine for a healthy person wanting to measure their blood glucose to optimize their workouts — but it won’t be accurate enough for diabetics.
2021-06-12 00:27:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s always my biggest problem! I never go hard enough on one stock because in my head I’m trying to buy in on about 10 to 15. I’m pretty new to all of this so I’m still learning the game. Been tough. Lots of loses but that’s how you learn. Had a few good plays. Need to get some more into CLF too! 10k when it pumps would be nice!!!
2021-06-12 02:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man. I know the wsb community isn't that wholesome, but I really appreciate you being so down to earth and helpful! I'm subbed now!! Thank you so much :)"
2021-06-12 07:55:35,wallstreetbets,Love Dr Dean!
2021-06-12 01:24:31,wallstreetbets,"In 5 or so years when I (hopefully) have the money for it, I wouldn't doubt it'd be possible."
2021-06-12 07:39:49,wallstreetbets,"The CGM device for senseonics still requires a daily calibration, which requires finger pricks for blood samples.  

Dexcoms g7 device will last 14 days and will require no calibration. I think reducing the frequency that you have to poke your finger to bleed out is pretty important. 

I'd like to hear someone more knowledgeable than chime in."
2021-06-12 11:41:38,wallstreetbets,You said it!
2021-06-12 00:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Good point, but I just don’t know if better marketing can convince people to get a surgically implanted item versus a outer dermal slap on sensor"
2021-06-12 09:46:41,wallstreetbets,Who makes the freedom system?
2021-06-11 22:54:55,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Even if it’s a slow to catch on company it’s going to pay out and probably break $10 minimum being on Reddit radar. So gonna double your money somehow
2021-06-11 23:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Since it's #1 competitor trades at 400$ with a $39B Market Cap and their product sucks compared to SENS, I believe SENS will take a good share of that market soon. 5$ is waay undervalued IMO. Holding this shit longterm until FDA approval for sure."
2021-06-11 23:50:52,wallstreetbets,If you’re only in it for the money then cool dude.
2021-06-12 12:29:48,wallstreetbets,I’m glad you’re at least admitting it’s a pump and dump
2021-06-12 00:16:16,wallstreetbets,"It already did. It was under 2 at the end on May (2 weeks ago).

But don't let it stop you. Someone have to buy at the top."
2021-06-11 23:25:48,wallstreetbets,"Hell, what part of any CGM technology is not exciting? Especially in comparison to pricking your finger all day."
2021-06-12 08:23:35,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, thank you!"
2021-06-12 00:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Haha also been thinking about CLF, WKHS and some of the other top mentions around reddit. But my gut is that this company can be worth 50 bucks eventually if not way more considering DEXCOM trading at nearly 400 per share last I checked


Good luck and God speed, sir"
2021-06-12 03:14:34,wallstreetbets,"No worries. Another company he talked about in his Patreon is Sernova. Probably very speculative at this stage, but an exciting concept atleast. And Crisper Therapeutics are working on this too - they have a huge war chest - something like a billion dollars if I recall correctly. The good thing is that diabetes is so common (and increasing) that the financial incentive for these companies to cure it is HUGE. Things are definitely moving forward - even if it seems slow."
2021-06-12 11:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Dexcom G-6 sensors still require occasional calibration. One spent hours screaming at me that I was in the 40's while my sugar was actually high, and it kept rejecting my calibrations. Very frustrating to have to Fingerstick every 15 minutes just to hope it eventually believes me that I'm not in a coma"
2021-06-12 00:46:41,wallstreetbets,"I’d prefer it twice a year versus every 10 days with my CGM system, Dexcom. These Dexcom sensors aren’t just something you slap on, and there’s other negatives to having something that can be ripped off your body, but I do agree it’s entirely different than an implant. Pros and cons with each system."
2021-06-12 10:41:28,wallstreetbets,"Senseonics. Or they will, when it's released. I think it's due for completion in 2024."
2021-06-11 23:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol I’m taint deep in SENS, but Dexcom is by no means inferior.  Maybe in the future, but they earned that valuation."
2021-06-12 12:36:04,wallstreetbets,I’m not saying that it still is but it definitely was then
2021-06-12 00:29:08,wallstreetbets,I won’t be the last. It’s only being pushed now harder
2021-06-11 23:42:22,wallstreetbets,You need to do a finger prick daily to calibrate the eversense (sens product). Versus the libre which you slap on your arm every two weeks. Only a matter of time before a longer lasting libre hits the market
2021-06-12 00:39:45,wallstreetbets,Lol. Funny because I just got in on WKHS at around 800 shares but the minute I bought it dropped some more but I think it’s going to make a move. But def going to drop some more on SENS Monday
2021-06-12 10:45:17,wallstreetbets,Hope my 2023 January calls are OK. They might take longer than that to get FDA approved
2021-06-11 23:53:57,wallstreetbets,"Well depends on the needs I guess, but yes they do. But competition is always good either way and also variation for different needs. Many patients are just waiting for a palce and forget type of device for diabetes as sometimes the readings with Dexcom or Medtronic are not always accurate and the patient just has to finger prick again anyway. And 180 days duration and even their advertised year long one.. sign me up pls."
2021-06-12 11:41:42,wallstreetbets,"As a Dexcom user, when I discovered sens has a 90 day available, I started the process to switch."
2021-06-11 23:56:48,wallstreetbets,"I’ll bet on Senseonics eliminating the need for calibrations before a competitor brings a long-term sensor to the market. You also have to manually scan the Libre every time you want a reading… All CGM systems are great, but Libre is the least appealing tech."
2021-06-11 23:56:55,wallstreetbets,Agree
2021-06-12 12:57:46,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-06-12 00:26:06,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you lost your bet already.

Dexcom CGM G6 doesn't require calibration by pricking the finger. It calibrates itself. Sensor lasts 10 days . It can actually do more but there is a risk of inflammation so they intentionally limited it . Although there are ways to trick it and restart . Don't ask how I know."
2021-06-12 00:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Libre is definitely the least “advanced” but the benefit is the lower cost compared to the other two. When you consider the fact that diabetes is more correlated with people of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, they are less likely to have the higher premium insurance plans that might cover eversense. The eversense is actually superior tech but it will be in an niche market. I just have a hard time seeing insurances having this on the formulary when cheaper effective product exists"
2021-06-12 00:32:46,wallstreetbets,"Nah. If you consider 10 days long-term, especially in comparison to 180 days, then you’re a true retard. There’s a Dexcom on the back of my arm right now…. Been rocking them for 2 years with my Tandem pump, so I know the “tricks.”  Solid attempt at catching me slipping 🥴"
2021-06-12 00:57:55,wallstreetbets,I don’t disagree. Senseonics is addressing costs with their new partnership with Ascensia. We’ll see. Cheers🩸🚀
2021-06-12 12:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Right, Tandem+Dexcom is current best combination. MDT is probably second and Libre is the last . I don't know if they combine it with any pump manufacturer.   
But here is the thing. Saying politely, I am not convinced that DXCM limiting sensor to 10 days is only care about diabetics . That's how they make money. Libre is targeting Type 2 people in long-term care so nurse can walk by , do a scan and make a record in the log. So ABT (Libre manufacture) makes money from Medicare . And MDT with its fake 'artificial pancreas'  makes money on selling combination pump+CGM and supplies to both. 

So making sensor lasting 180 days is good for kids like you but not good for business. Especially when you need a doctor office visit for implantation - that limits the target consumer base.

My bet is that SENS is going to get bought out by someone like LLY ."
2021-06-12 08:08:21,wallstreetbets,"That being said, sens is undervalued. Still a good idea to get in to this company but I would do leaps or buy shares instead of short date calls"
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Porn gain . Ready for next week to come. WKHS!!

# TA Notes for 7/6

In the last month CAT has a been trading in the 220.03 - 246.69 range, which is quite wide. It is currently trading near the lows of this range.

Volume is considerably higher in the last couple of days. In combination with the strong move down this is a bad signal.

* Broke 5-touch support and retested as new resistance
* Looking for a 229 rejection or 220.03ish on day timeframe break for bearish price targets
* Bearish targets: 213.42 - 205.52 - 198.81 - 194.02
* Looking to take profit at around 213-205

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All eyes on Jerome in the next FOMC meeting (expect volatility) If the 10Y keeps dropping, which I think it will, the yield curve would flatten. This could be interpreted in a lot of ways - but it almost always leads to pushing good money into riskier and riskier assets. Also, it could make banks more skeptical about lending money, since their is no incentive to take the risk to lend money, when the credit spread is narrowing. Less lending activity in the economy = less economic activity = disinflationary.

Now the 'mainstream' narrative is 10Y is falling because of low inflation expectations. But there are bigger factors at play. The large amount of money sloshing around is stressing the banks. They can't accept any more cash as deposits. They are already full. That's why reverse repo exchanges are skyrocketing recently @ 0% rate. They just want to park at cash with Fed, even if it yields nothing.

Negative rates in short duration bonds is forcing the banks (GSIBs) into buying long duration treasury bonds. No surprise we are seeing a bond rally right now, and it may only be beginning.

The banks, the bond market, most likely wants Fed to taper. It will make the things normal again and take off the stress from banks. But will Fed do it? The next FOMC meeting next week is going to be interesting.

Two outcomes:

1) If Fed tapers

The short duration yield will most likely rise and that will lift the long duration bond yield as well. Dollar will rally and commodities and stonks will experience a correction (highly likely)

2) If Fed doesn't taper

Status quo remains intact. The 10Y will keep falling until banks (GSIBs) run out of money and Fed is forced to taper abruptly. Narrowing credit spreads will dampen economic activity. Meaning no extravagant earnings growth = forward PE doesn't expand and maybe even shrinks. Money continues to flow into riskier and riskier assets: like junk bonds, meme stocks, conventional stocks. Blackrock will probably buy even more real estate as we continue down this path. This boom will be euphoric most likely - only for things to fall off a cliff when the music stops."

This is not true, the participants in the ON RRP programme are MMFs. Banks have access to IOER which has positive return. No one knows the reason why 10Y is low yet breakeven is historical high. One theory is the recovery isn't going quite as swimmingly as expected to future rate expectations are fairly low."

However, on a very simple DD, I feel the risk/reward is great on a big TBT bet.  Shares and 6/2022 leaps.  The fed is aiming for 2+% yields and expect to run a little hot.  Feel like TBT would be sitting at 40 unless something drastic happens to the economy.  If inflation becomes a 'non-transitory' concern, i think TBT could significantly overshoot 40.  Not too much downside here without an economic issue.  Am I missing something?

I am still not confident in how this situation plays out. Just the fact that companies are reluctant in re-investing their cash in profit generating ventures - and are instead doing buybacks and so - makes me think the economic outlook ahead is not exactly as rosey as news outlets are making it to be. The economy might be already past peak growth, coming out of the recession, especially with the possibility that the stimulus checks might stop"

2021-06-12 13:58:11,wallstreetbets,"To your point, I read another article that said a lot of small businesses that took the PPP loans were really apprehensive about future economic (and political) conditions. Because of that fear, and because they don’t have stock to buy back, they took the PPP loans from their banks and turned around and parked the funds right back in their bank accounts at the same banks. A large portion of retail customers were also nervous about future employment prospects, so those who didn’t have immediate financial needs just deposited their stimulus money right back in their savings accounts. My dad lost his job last year and it really shook my parents. He found another job, but they’ve been extremely frugal during the pandemic. 

Interesting times we live in."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A beautiful Partnership between Gamestop and Corsair (GME + CRSR) We should get this movement started and the idea out there. Gamestop has had talks of getting more into the PC gaming and streaming market. Who would be great for that? Corsair (CRSR). This would be absolutely huge and I could see something like this potentially happening in the future as Gamestop looks for new ways to innovate itself. It would be awesome to see Gamestop introduce more PC gaming into its lineup of products along with the streaming side of things in retail stores and its website. Currently Corsair is one of the leading PC component, gaming and streaming suppliers. A partnership between these two to offer all of its product lineup would not only help both of their stock prices but would increase revenues and growth for both companies. It almost seems like a no brainer and I'm surprised something like this has not happened yet. I say we get this trending! I am currently invested in both and probably will be YOLOing a shitload more into CRSR and GME this next week and going into the end of the month. I also will tag Ryan Cohen, Gamestop and Corsair across different platforms to see if they would respond and be open to the idea. If enough people push the concept maybe they will listen after all alot of us are shareholders.

CRSR currently sits undervalued and unoticed at 32.76 a share. Has not even hit the lowest analyst price target, has a very small float and the potential for a major surge as more investors and traders jump on board and buy up the float. Current market Cap is 2.97B, Revenues are increasing substantially year over year and new products rolling off the line steadily. This will catch up with Logitech in no time in my opinion.

GME currently sitting at 237.10 a share with a slightly larger but small float aswell. Possibly going into the Russell 1000 will be a big catalyst. Add these two together and you have Magic and a beautiful catalyst for both. Then the Wallst junkie analyst can tune back their tone in saying WhAtS GaMeStoP gOiNg tO dO tO ExPanD AnD gRoW iTs ReVeNuE, ItS OveRvAluEd.

Anyone with me on this idea? I think it would be great for both companies and would be awesome to see Gamestop finally enter the PC and streaming world fully at all its locations and website. It would be nice to have them as a one stop shop at brick and mortar for all the essentials."

2021-06-12 09:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is already sold on Amazon and Newegg. Plus they have their own storefront on the website. What incentive would there be for Corsair to consider a partnership?

Signing any kind of an exclusive dealership would effectively pull back their market reach. GME is a great company don't get me wrong, but PC peripherals is a much, much larger market. The only real way to make it a GME paradigm would be to make companies and products exclusive to Gamestop. It would be great for Gamestop, but would hurt the PC retailers. I don't think they want to piss off Bezos."

At least the gamestop locations I have been to I have not seen this yet. I could see them competing alongside of best buy or similar retail chains but being better in the gaming world.

2021-06-11 21:30:59,wallstreetbets,I'm all in. Strictly on the fact that I used to swallow marbles as a kid.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"You're fighting Greed with Greed. So I've been around here long enough to know that if you sack a 10-bagger on your first options play, the ""first one's free"". They don't all work out like that. For some of you none of them do, because you're literal apes. And apes don't know the difference between green and red. 

Everybody in here talks about taking down Hedge Funds because they're ""Too Greedy"" and hate the system. So you buy stocks that are shorted, thinking you've got a lottery ticket, and sometimes (most, lately, with 10 mil of you cucks), they fly for a day or two. 2000% options gains. 75%+ stocks gains. In a single day. Absolute madness, and life changing. 

So what do you do? You ""HoLd"", like true cult followers not knowing you've already got a golden ticket in your hand. Because that $5k gain isn't enough. You want a house. Red lambo. Vrmm baby, yeah you're going to turn that $547 into $500k or something is wrong with the system! $25k isn't enough. 

Does nobody else think that half of you retards buying and holding past unbelievable profits in incredibly short amounts of time, makes you no different than the HF's you hate? And then when the rug gets inevitably pulled, you think the system isn't fair? Surely there are crooked people and flaws in the system, but even if there weren't you'd still be Greedy.

**TLDR:** Take some fucking profits, you aren't changing anything."

2021-06-12 04:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Haha! You called it. I did sack a 10x on one of my first options plays! AMC $5 LEAPS. I knew it wasn't normal, though, mostly luck, and, I trailed stops up about 5%-10% behind peak price, that's how I caught it at 10x. And, yeah, it's actually still up there, it might go higher, but you know what? I now have 0% risk. Everybody forgets that part. I am happy with 10x ROI and 0% risk, that's *totally fine*. If some of you get a 20x or 50x, god love you, but I'm content.

At some point there'll be another entry, or some options to buy or sell at a strike that lets me still sleep nights, or something. Whatever, when it happens I'll get back in.

2021-06-11 22:24:06,wallstreetbets,"

I don't need a third party to tell when to sell especially with regards to GME.

 Unless you have had access to the next level research and game distribution models that GME  will use on the blockchain please shut up.  The plan is to distribute games, track publishers royalty payments, allow for third party resellers to profit, and of course, game directly off the blockchain.

Why did they hired all that talent from Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Just to have a $50.00 stock price?

GME is going to have a ""blockchain based"" subscription and distribution model. It will be worth $300 billion dollars (if they sign up hundreds of publisher's similar to the Netflix model used in film distribution).

I will sell at $3,000 a share. Just saying. And the hedge funds? It's simple extinction and death."

Ironically, if they ever broke the system, the level of coordination/manipulation in that sub, on twitter and other social media is enough to block most of them from getting any money in the long run.  SEC already warned them they watching.  All their accounts, posts, thumbs up will be tied to thier purchases and poof, busted.  So, the only way they can win is by taking profits.  But they won't because the greed too high.

Its like dog coin sub but the people are even more smooth brained.  Spectacular psychological study to watch in realtime.

Just think if you made 20 trades at $2,000 a pop. That ain’t a bad profit at all.

2021-06-11 22:37:43,wallstreetbets,"any investor, especially a hedge fund would not want their position made public. not from fear of manipulation but because it makes them a target. Especially for other big hedge funds.

Every investor makes their own choices. if you were a hedge fund building a long position on gamestop, would you want other hedge funds to know about that? I certainly  wouldnt."
2021-06-11 23:00:49,wallstreetbets,"In response to your comment that was deleted for the forbidden currency reference: 

Seems like a whole lot of assumptions. Even if these game derivatives you refer to do come out and get popular, what makes you think Gamestop will for sure be the biggest source for those or that even if they are that it will dramatically increase their share price? Look at the share prices for other companies that you think currently fulfill the sort of spot you imagine Gamestop eventually might own. Anything you see anywhere near 3k per share?

And that’s assuming that Gamestop even becomes the main vendor of whatever these derivatives you’re referring to are. Plenty of people who knew cell phones were gonna be the next big thing went broke going all in on the wrong cell phone company in the 90’s. You never know how things are really gonna turn out, and right now your expectations seem extremely unrealistic from where I’m sitting."
2021-06-11 22:46:43,wallstreetbets,"You’re never gonna sell at 3k. You’re either going to hold that position indefinitely, or, more likely you’ll sell after it’s been at $25 for six months and you finally realize everyone who tried to tell you to take profits was right."
2021-06-11 22:37:14,wallstreetbets,"This is... Unrelated? Certainly we're causing waves. But I'm mostly talking about people being too greedy to ever sell. Which imo is just a stupid mindset. If a stock is up 150% from when the shorts placed their positions, it still hurts them to buy back at outrageous prices. Holding forever or ""500k a share"" is literally retarded. It's not even fathomable."
2021-06-12 00:48:08,wallstreetbets,Till it causes a tragedy of the commons.

2021-06-11 22:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Wanting to retire instead of working overtime for table scraps is not greed. Helping to expose/bankrupt corruption is bonus. If it crashes a corrupt system and I lose ‘everything’ that’s ok too. I’m familiar with poor it’s cool. J don’t want a mansion. But a little space for myself and time to explore new racetracks would be cool, buying a house for my mom would be cool."
2021-06-12 01:34:58,wallstreetbets,But it wouldn't go back to those it was stolen from so it is greed...

We've been working since 2008 and our taxes funded big corporate bailouts.

2021-06-11 23:22:37,wallstreetbets,"To that point, if you’re looking at GME’s legacy model, then I would agree they are overvalued. But with what they are doing now and reinventing themselves into e-commerce amongst other things. Add in an all star team, I’m convinced they will come out much more valuable than they are today.

Plus the financials are great, no debt and huge piles of cash to expand their business."

2021-06-12 00:00:58,wallstreetbets,"Nope. The cost structure of running a hedge fund is tremendous. Hedge funds really beat the S&P 500 ( 93% don't do it).

They make their money a fees. Management fees,  percentage of profit fees, plus garbage fees of every conceivable shape and form.

They have a real problem because the easy ""hustle"" is over. I have seen due diligence here at WSB that rivals anything on Wall Street.

So what competence advantage is going to allow them to take on risk without getting squashed? You can't take hundred million dollars loses when you are tasked with beating the simple S&P 500.

Love it. Great fun."

 BEAR THESIS on   LORDSTOWN MOTORS (4RIDE)

1) Lordstown Motors ability to continue as a company is a going concern. The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, “funding secured”, this stock will triple.

2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**

3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.

4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can’t be underestimated and understated.

· Niche category. They are selling to FLEETS. The automotive space is big enough for everyone, and with their interests focused on the fleet industry, and with first mover advantage, they could hit the ground running and become profitable sooner than expected.

· Billion’s worth of assets (3rd largest automotive facility in the US, vertically integrated factory with the 2nd biggest battery assembly and propulsion center being built out)

· No debt: looking to get $200m ATVM loan from the Dept of Energy by end of June and/or a strategic investor (GM, Camping World come to mind)

· Lordstown Week: huge catalyst 6/21-6/25 and retail investors will get a live glimpse at the facility and a test drive of the Endurance truck on Friday 6/25. 

· During Lordstown Week, they will be revealing the Lordstown “family of vehicles” - meaning likely Endurance, Electric RV, and another electric van. The ERV is being built in conjunction with Camping World.

· Addition to the Russell 2000 index

· [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021.

· [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.

· Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

\*\* I am long $RIDE because of what Lordstown means to the community it serves. I believe wholeheartedly that a startup can succeed in a field of titans. Lordstown represents the underdog, it's David vs the Goliaths. Together, we can SAVE LORDSTOWN MOTORS. We can help David against the Goliaths."

2021-06-11 21:54:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm long on RIDE. 
I believe in the company. 
I think the medias been shit on them. 
I think Hindenburg is fucking slime.
I think Adam Jonas is a fucking joke with his ""you have to change the motor everytime you change a tire"".
I think Jim Cramer is a fucking liar and a hypocrite.

But.

This isn't fucking charity.  We're not the fucking Justice League. We didn't come to save the orphanage from the big bad developers. We are the big bad developers. We're greedy.  We're capitalists.

Don't come here with the tag ""Save Lordstown"".   Ask   us apes, do we really think that a company with a 3 billion dollar factory, 30k orders, and no debt is really not gonna get a capital injection?  Do you really think there isn't any room in the fleet vehicle market just because Ford is making an electric truck?  Hell, with what looks like a tight senate race coming up in Ohio, do you really think that there won't be some sweet government DOE loan money coming for politicians to take credit for?  And when that loan money hits, and an investor week with another fleet vehicle coming out, and 30+% short interest, and inclusion in the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 all happening in about a 3 week span, ask us apes if you think this fuckers gonna fly.  Because I think it's a rocket and its gonna take us all the way to the moon.  We're gonna be the apes getting handies behind the Wendy's instead of giving them. We're gonna be the boyfriends fucking Jim Cramer's wife. We're gonna be fucking rich.  Not because we saved a factory.  Because we were fucking greedy."
2021-06-12 11:40:23,wallstreetbets,Won’t die. Will RIDE. Lordstown Week and Sept production around the corner. Not here to save company. They don’t need saving. 2.5K shares and 10 calls.

2021-06-12 13:08:03,wallstreetbets,I'm from Ohio I will buy some shares. Ohio should go to the moon!!
2021-06-11 21:28:28,wallstreetbets,Sorry buddy. But I think you might need to cut your losses. With ford working on the lightning and the commercial option starting out at such a competitive price. I don't think there's much room for lordstown to grow.
2021-06-11 21:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Im from that area of ohio. Its economically depressed with few people.
No one is investing in that area or the businesses there. This stock is toast."
2021-06-11 21:32:45,wallstreetbets,Bad CEO. If the stock goes up insiders will started to cash out. No working models. Ford and others coming with working prototype. Bleeding shareholders money. They will go down anyways. Matter of time.

2021-06-11 23:11:49,wallstreetbets,Selling to fleets is a bad niche. Fleet guys buy 27k strippers. With crank windows. Rivian is gonna cost 60k if it ever hit the market. Would have been better off trying for a luxury speed truck for the golf crowd. Thats where the majority of truck sales go every year.  And once Rivian trucks start hitting the road next month. Funding is gonna be tough to come by.

2021-06-12 13:10:04,wallstreetbets,Yes but AMC GME are not good companies. GME was/is a great opportunity because of shorts not because it was a good company. AMC is similar and it was the poorest run of its movie theater competition
2021-06-12 13:23:32,wallstreetbets,"GameStop- good company, does not compute..... it was all about the shorts."
2021-06-11 22:02:52,wallstreetbets,I’m a south side guy myself.  Those of from Youngstown are different just a different breed with an unhealthy loyalty to each other.   For those not from the area (which is probably all  of you besides this dude and myself) read up on the infamous ChillCan.  Another epic story of business deceit and failure.

2021-06-11 22:10:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that Chillcan shit was F'cked up. I left the Yo that year and moved from Campbell to Orlando, Fl.
I used to kick it on the southside a lot back in the day (Evergreen, St.Louis, Ravenwood). I was a Boys Club fool  (back when it was an old church and not that new shit they built). I do miss home but not enough to move back🤣
You are right we folks in Youngstown do have a loyalty to each other that i havent found anywhere else."

2021-06-11 22:35:14,wallstreetbets,I grew up on the south side as well near Handel’s and I worked at northside and Borts pools through HS.   I moved from the Yo on 2001 but I’m back in NEO.   Whenever I’m in a conversation about where I’m from I always end talking about Youngstown like someone talks about being vegan…you just wouldn’t understand unless you were from there.
2021-06-11 22:48:11,wallstreetbets,Huh? I’m not shorting it
2021-06-11 22:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Handles had the best ice cream. Borts was my spot back in the day. So was millcreek. When I was boxing i put a lot of miles through that park.
You are right, when it comes to Youngstown, i tell people, if i had to explain it to you, you'll never know. We are just a tough kinda people. Hard times dont make us flinch.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $SENS is gonna 10x 🚀🌙 As it's happened many times, the market lumps everything together and dumps the baby with the bathwater. At first sight you might think $SENS has the makings of a meme stock with no intrinsic value. It was trading as low as 0.4 just three months ago before multiplying more than 10x in just 2 months. Besides, it had only $4.9 in revenues last year a drop of 80% in revenues from the year before! Normally, after reading these two data points I would stop researching any company, but there is more than meets the eye to this story so hang on. The situation for Senseonics was not always like that. This company has been public since 2015 and it is not a newly founded company, Senseonics was founded in 1996 and has invested all this time developing their technology and getting patents and authorizations. It has 519 issued patents and pending patent applications related to their CGM system and has burned through $648 MM since its inception just to get to where we are now. The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale. Therefore, there's a lot of upside for SENS including a potential short squeeze which may happen as the short interest is more than 25%.

TL;DR: your wife's boyfriend said if you buy SENS you get to leave the basement"

2021-06-12 06:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Because it got pumped to fuck.

If SENS gets to 6$, im going to buy puts"
2021-06-11 23:58:46,wallstreetbets,"SENS does it was on a rise woth a previous high of 5.65 amd was rising fast. Only things that changed were COVID and maybe possibly poor marketing which there is news about then restructuring. Everything I look up is only praising the product. This stock is very undervalued. I know they sold shares to help with the freeze COVID caused cause of how the product requires a doctor to check you before the implant in which case all were tied up and you cant push a product if your vendor has no time or customers are quarantined. Besides that no other negative blemishes in sight. They are worth a ton everything says you dont get an opportunity like this in a lifetime. The wait for FDA is for the 180 day implant they got approved for the 90 day a while back this is the XL version they have 2 more products in the pipeline also do your DD. It will boom, shorts were just greedy hedges wanting to get in dirt cheap to have full control.



Im doing it all I need the product and I have have long call options for a bit and I have a 200 shares which I will never get rid of this company has big promise with this product."
2021-06-11 23:09:18,wallstreetbets,Has it been successful ? Sales look good ?
2021-06-11 22:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Have you never traded biotech before? They’re usually range bound until news about trials drops. Senseonics just released a PR statement about their 180 day CGM which yielded better than expected results. Plus, they’re also presenting at the American Diabetes association virtual conference this month, and are releasing their FDA trial results any time now. 

Biotech moves extremely volatile on news releases. This one is no different. I’m in for 1750 shares and 5 calls for $4 6/18 exp. looking for a short term price target of $6 on fda approval at which point I will start selling covered calls to lower my cost basis, wait for a drop and load up more. This company is easily $10-$15 by the end of 2022. Just do yourself a favor and look into their board. Heavy fucking hitters in the diabetes space who all have exceptional experience, mostly at Medtronic. Their Chief medical officer is also the attending at LA’s biggest hospital and has built her career off diabetes research."
2021-06-11 21:28:06,wallstreetbets,"Apologies, I am not so much saying that it's stable now, but more looking at the last 5years of values it's never seen past $5. The current price is the highest it can reasonably be expected to go in most circumstances. Especially since there is fuck all reason for it to be up other than it being down more than usual."
2021-06-12 00:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Oh I've done my DD check my posts :)

Agreed with everything, I just dont want people to hype it too much and get burned if ever it doesn't 10x moon"
2021-06-12 15:18:23,wallstreetbets,Senseonics has been making good. They had a forecast to double their revenue in 2020 but we all what what happened. They also partnered with Ascensia Diabetes Care which will help with their poor marketing and sales activities.....gold cant sell itself but a lot of these changes for the better came in 2020. Its the better CGM go look at the market cap of the others they just werent exposing their product right it can make them way morw than what they have been making. Hopefully the Ascensia partnership shines once they kick the 180day implant into gear FDA will approve 90day passed its a no brainer.
2021-06-11 23:27:05,wallstreetbets,"What he's saying is he thinks SENS is a pnd (pump n dump) because he has no understanding of BIOtech companies and how their stock moves. He thinks it's just a small cap pump n dump based on the revenues and market cap  


Also SENS did trade past 5$ for a bit"
2021-06-12 00:08:51,wallstreetbets,Yea I have been deep in it been looking at Precigen also I have type 2 Diabetes so its still mild but my entire family line are diabetic. Diabetes is rampant so im always looking into new and better medical discoveries mostly a cure...it just sucks. But not to go sideways its just odd it has high short interest like nothing shows a need for it to be shorted besides the money woes mostly cause of covid and maybe bad marketing (cant let gold sell itself) just odd only reasonable reason is to setup for a takeover. I would If i had billions lol buy the whole thing it has value.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HIMS - Erection to the moon or will it leave you limp? Hey folks,

I've been eyeing HIMS for a minute. Trending down today by about 5% and wondering about buying the dip. Wanted to get some opinions. 

I know things are starting to stabilize with people returning to the new normal, but telemedicine appears to be continuing to tend up regardless. 

I've seen the UI and how turnkey Hims and Hers is setup. For those new to the company, they are a startup, but they are definitely a disruptor to the healthcare industry. 24/7, quick access to doctors and medical pros, pharmacy is turnkey, pricing is relatively simple and automated. Also OTC health products part of the model, which is definitely a differentiator. 

For those attracted to the title of this thread, one of their big draws is erectile dysfunction. And yes, probably less banging at home as pandemic restrictions lift, but the sexual second coming is literally coming! Outside of this though, they do have plans for treating diabetes and patients with high cholesterol. 

Some figures I found about their actual results:

Q1-2021 - 687,000 orders - growth of 25.8% in the past year. Revenue increased 75% to $53 million.

What do you think apes? I'm looking to buy the dip and ride this one like I'm hoping to be ridden after taking some of the Hims products that come to my door.

P.s. I may have low karma as I am a newb here, but I'm no damn bot.  Let's start an actual discussion.

$MU had a ER ramp up on 3/31 earnings til 4/9 when it peaked to $96.96 and now it's currently sitting at $79.34

Inflation aside, seeing NASDAQ retesting ATH + Upcoming ER on June 30, isn't this free money? 7/18 85C is only 1.70 per contract. it was around 4.35 on Monday, CURRENT IV is at 37%. Thoughts? What could possibly happen to tank semiconductor sector in 1 month?

Who's the-
FUCK OFF!"
2021-06-12 00:02:07,wallstreetbets,"100% agreed. All of the characters had their arcs complete and there was a great ending. Instead, in season 8, you fast forward 7 years to these older guys still with the same problems, and nothing from season 7 seems to have stuck. Lahey went full Flanderization and so did the rest of the characters honestly. Still a great show. Love season 1-7 - maybe my favorite show of all time."
2021-06-11 23:53:31,wallstreetbets,"Nah. I totally understand your point of view, but there are still some great episodes after season 7. The show does take a major nose dive, but it's still worth watching."

It just seems like once the boys bought the rights to the show its just flanderized. Ricky is dumber than ever, julian is a greedy selfish fuck always scheming... And bubbles just seems ""different"".

This weekend has multiple low tier boxing fights, a large UFC 263 , weekend and WWE PPV. This is a no brainer play to have both options and shares. Options on the 7th were up 1-2 hundred percent for such a move. This type of move is important as DKNG is gapping up back to 70. Also of significance is DKONG. The ticker brings us memories of the most important ape of our childhood. Donkey Kong. Less so about draft kings and more about donkey Kong we have this as a mascot as we have yet to have a proper APE ticker. Rather we must use D KONG."

2021-06-11 20:16:12,wallstreetbets,"Bro, we've had a rug pull happened three times as Gamestop neared $350. It's the man behind the curtain. Once it breaks $350 the curtain comes down and we see that the hedge funds wear no clothes (aka: they naked shorted the shit out of Gamestop from $490 to $350 and they'll do everything they can to stop that magic $350 from appearing.)

How does a hedge fund that needs to be bailed out a couple billion walk away with only half their cash gone? You know what happens when my ass gets blown the fuck out of the water on a bad trade? It goes to 0%, not 50%. Sure they're probably not all in... But I bet they had to liquidate more than half their positions to cover where they could. The only way they could have made some money is if they were able to arrange to come out on top after a massive $350+ slide was to be shorting it from the top... And of course we know they didn't learn from their hubris: there's naked shorts all the way from $350 to infinity

To be clear: I personally think the hedge funds actually had naked shorts running from 490 to 150 (100?) at the end of January. They had assumed there would be a sell off, and that would be that no covering needed when their short average was (cough) $350. 

These run ups we keep seeing? It's the shorts trying to cover and kick. Cover until it needs to get kicked. 

Because, once again... Didn't we also see an article that said Melvin capital was UP in April??? Considering everything has seemed to recover from the rather shitty month of April... Totally makes sense that they're down!"
2021-06-11 22:29:45,wallstreetbets,"How much $$ these guys got that they can lose billions every day? And if they go under before they cover, will the banks start shorting us too so they dont have to pay up?"

2021-06-12 09:52:09,wallstreetbets,No pity for those who manipulated the stock market. I don't believe the article when it said Melvin has exited its position on GME. I think they still have exposure which is why they are reporting losses.
2021-06-12 10:10:09,wallstreetbets,Ha sounds like people can stay retarded longer than Melvin can stay solvent. I wonder how his wife’s boyfriend feels about that.

2021-06-12 10:21:22,wallstreetbets,"Adding to winning positions, and taking from losing positions. 

Non-recourse leverage is god tier, and FDs present asymmetry protecting you from extreme downside risk. I don’t margin stock, not enough asymmetry. 

Pair that with position sizing (max portfolio loss 10% on a single stock, 2% on FDs, 5% spreads). Keep in mind highly correlated assets or you can still get wrecked here. 

Don’t chase. Don’t bag hold. Take the time to understand how your broker handles situations in regards to spreads if you use them. Understand the risks associated with a trade BEFORE you open it (rip 1r0neyman)."

2021-06-11 23:21:36,wallstreetbets,"They can't let the price go up too much, so they borrow shares + do naked shorting to get the price down and make some small profits to prepare for the eventuality of having to cover those shorts they made for one digit prices in both stock. The fact that they keep doing this just proves they really are stuck, no sane hedgefund would touch this stocks as they stand."
2021-06-12 08:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Because when you naked short a stock at 3 dollars, for 4 years, you can't cover, and they never planned on covering.This is not uncommon with naked shorted stocks, as the strategy was to bankrupt Gamestop and take all the cash from the shorting as tax free cash. 

And because GME would have gone bankrupt, there would have been no naked shorts to cover.

There is still a ticking time bomb hidden on GME, be it the FTDs, the deep OTM puts, like on July 16th having 405,173 OTM puts, which is 40,517,300 theoretical shares."
2021-06-11 20:22:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe it’ll go tits up
2021-06-12 09:08:01,wallstreetbets,"When someone casually does something incredibly stupid, it is more than likely because they have done it many times before with zero consequences.

They have done this shit successfully for decades. This is the first time their tricks haven't worked against retail."
2021-06-12 11:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say you shorted a half billion dollars worth of GME at an average of 4$ a share over months. GME is now 200 (rounding down to keep it simple). If Melvin capital wanted to close their position today, they would have to pay 25 BILLION dollars to do so at the current price. They don’t have that kind of cash (remember they got a 3 billion dollar lifeline in January from shitadel? That was likely to stave off a margin call which would have had a domino effect on the entire market since it would have rocketed GME to the thousands thereby also fucking other big players who shorted GME). So what choice does Melvin capital have? They just keep kicking the can down the road by paying the borrowing fee for the shares (currently 1% which I think is bullshit and is being manipulated by the lenders to help their buddies out). As GME continues to slowly rise in price, eventually (days? Months? Years?) the borrowing fee will be too much for them to handle and they will have to close out their position. 

The awesome part is that it is costing us exactly 0 dollars to break these guys. They are paying millions in borrowing fees (which is now a survival fee basically) each day while all we are doing is holding and buying the dips. 

They’re fucked, they know it, it’s just a matter of when at this point.

Side note: I truly believe GameStop can trigger the MOASS at any point (crypto dividend would force the shorts to cover just like what happened to overstock). Extra Tinfoil hat time: either GameStop is waiting for a green light from the government to wreck these guys or they just need more time to enable the infrastructure to support a crypto dividend. 

Side-side note: GameStop hired 2 Amazon execs to lead their company. Why the fuck would these guys leave AMAZON (their stock is 3300 a share and a lot of their compensation comes from stock options) and come to GameStop? I think they know their shares will eventually be worth 10-10000 their current worth."

What have they lost on short interest this year? 5% or so? They can kick the can near indefinitely while GME is under ~300 and AMC under ~60, it just sacrifices their funds gains. But their position is delicate, a market disturbance could quickly tip it out of balance.

Also, there are other major hedge funds with significant short positions, but I haven’t looked into them. A weaker hedge fund folding early might just burn it up for the lot of them."

I know there is a lot of shit posts and memes, but if you look...there IS some substantial and very solid DD among it all and some very clever guys. 

The manipulation in the markets right now is very real in a lot of tickers, it seems naked shorting is popular. A blind man could see it watching some of the tickers. The FTD cycle has proved right time and time again is just one example. 

It's not my only play and I'm not a cultist, but I do hold GME shares. Bottom line is they haven't covered and can't....hence all the can kicking. The one thing that they didn't bank on and can't change is people holding. The fact that Gamestop is not going bankrupt and actually is turning the company around. Company turnaround + people holding will be their downfall."
2021-06-12 07:18:27,wallstreetbets,Beyond $350  the value of gme would be greater than the value of money itself. Money would lose all meaning and all future purchases would be made in fractional gme shares. Essentially a singularity would be reached where one gme share can only be bought for a price of one gme share and economics as we know it would cease to function.

2021-06-12 10:55:05,wallstreetbets,"That's fine, I actually don't believe it's hurting much because your shares are likely going to longs and not shorts. That said, one of these days, soon, you are going to sell half at 300 and it's not going to go back down and you are going to miss out on massive potential gains. But if you still have a substantial position, maybe that's worth the risk. Just know that the likelihood of us getting rejected at $300/$350 reduces each occurrence imo."
2021-06-12 06:22:02,wallstreetbets,You're gonna miss the true rocket for a couple thousand dollars. Good for you
2021-06-12 01:49:04,wallstreetbets,"Lol understandable, but fucking terrible. Don't encourage it!"
2021-06-12 08:10:48,wallstreetbets,Feel free to do that to every other meme stock Citadel and Melvin are bot-spamming here.  Just not that one.
2021-06-11 22:33:11,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. I have enough shares to take that bet and sell CCs 2 weeks out. TDA makes me call the broker to run CCs on GME and say I understand the risks.
2021-06-12 00:17:50,wallstreetbets,"lol love how salty these fucks are who never got in 3 times in a row, and they bitch and moan every time everyone else wins and they act like a stubborn baby and never buy into the meme. good luck with your boomer stocks retard."

2021-06-12 02:13:18,wallstreetbets,"What do they do anyways? Besides facilitate ctiminal transactions and take their cut [fining hedge funds micro pennies for countless fraud and manipulation, and even paying the whistleblowers bank.... yet no action EVER]"
2021-06-12 09:20:02,wallstreetbets,Do you get the feeling the SEC is really part of La Cosa Nostra and all the hedges are just kicking up?
2021-06-12 06:04:02,wallstreetbets,That's kind of funny. Sick. But funny.

2021-06-11 21:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Yea dont fall for what Bloomberg and WSJ published in regards to their losses. If anything these Hedges came out to say so on purpose Hedges operate in the shadow they are nothing buy schemers killing the economy for gains. They know the recent retail surge is fueled by hate for Hedge Funds...even the SEC hates them yet they do nothing. But this is just their plot to put everyones guard down

""Yea we give up we wont touch similar stonks"" then turn around and execute order 66 on new short positions while they were buying up stock to help them short and make a ton more in the process."

2021-06-12 12:33:19,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
2021-06-12 05:32:17,wallstreetbets,"Those “distractions“ have made me money... you can hold more than one stock at a time. Especially when one is providing no real means of instant value because you essentially have to buy it and hold it. However I have bought puts on GME two days before earning each time and made money that way too. If you aren’t delta hedging, doing strangles, and put ratio back spreads you’re a fucking idiot.  


When people call other stocks a distraction all it makes me realize is that they’re morons that just got in to stock trading post Jan GME or they’re just serious idiots."
2021-06-11 22:54:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we're in this together!! no more distractions! Umm can i have some money to buy gme so i don't fall for more affordable prices? You got me right?

Surely this is not about just you making money, right?"
2021-06-12 01:55:47,wallstreetbets,I just sold her ring for 5 more shares monday at 4 am EST 🤷😁💎🙌🦍🚀🌚
2021-06-12 10:12:51,wallstreetbets,if GME reaches 1000$ guess those hedges will rather declare bankruptcy.
2021-06-12 02:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I know all the retard speak is strong on this sub, but honest question:

Why does everyone thing 100k/share is possible? Is it mathematically possible or are people just bein dumb sayin this?"
2021-06-11 21:57:45,wallstreetbets,Same logic Mudrick had with their AMC naked calls. Now they lost $40 million in true WSB fashion
2021-06-12 09:07:08,wallstreetbets,if it’s only worth $10 then why does it crash at $350 specifically and not at any other price over $10?
2021-06-12 10:38:07,wallstreetbets,"It happens one of two ways. Margin call that they can't meet or forced liquidation. Either way....I reckon once the collateral that was posted dries up closing all the short postions,  all other postions will be liquidated to cover their shorts. Once there is nothing left to liquidate, assuming there are still postions that need covering....The governing bodies...ie DTC etc have to step in and pick up the tab to finish closing their postions for them."
2021-06-12 11:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Shorting: You borrow a friends car and sell it for $1000. The car's value changes and you can either buy it back for less and return it to your friend, or it shoots up and you have to buy it back before the price gets too high.

Naked shorting: you're not sure if there is even a car to borrow, but you're going to ""borrow"" one and sell it

Can think of shorting as negative shares. You sell first, buy later"
2021-06-12 17:11:12,wallstreetbets,"Well the shareholder’s vote proved that there are more shares in the market than there are supposed to be. We found out that the vote is trimmed to fit the outstanding shares that are SUPPOSED to be there. Vote came in at 55 million, aka the maximum possible number. This indicates there were actually more votes than there are shares and they trimmed it down. The question now is HOW MANY more shares are there? 100k? 100mil? No way to know yet."
2021-06-11 23:05:14,wallstreetbets,Then they'll go ass over tea kettle
2021-06-12 14:08:26,wallstreetbets,"No, they'd be losing a lot of very powerful people a lot of money, and they don't want to do that."
2021-06-11 22:35:10,wallstreetbets,The SEC would love to be able to brush this under the carpet. The only thing that stops that from happening in some form of fuckery is the fact it's starting to gain a LOT of attention.
2021-06-12 01:46:42,wallstreetbets,"There are literally hundreds of thousands of shares bought around the world. They can't put an 'unfair' stop to this without massive international trouble. 

Its the vaunted free market of the US of A. They better let this happen organically"
2021-06-12 13:00:53,wallstreetbets,"SEC is historically corrupt at worst and ineffective and slow at best.  

The most you can possibly expect is for them to fine the bad guys $1000 in 5 years.  The only way they would do any more than that is if the whole situation blows up without them, and they are forced to move faster, arrest someone, and act like they serve a purpose in the aftermath.  

Probably the biggest crook the SEC put in prison was Bernie Madoff, and they ""investigated""  him for a decade before they actually did anything."
2021-06-12 16:09:28,wallstreetbets,No but you'll know when it does actually happen

2021-06-12 07:06:03,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows at this point GME is not going bankrupt when it is raising capitals with this stock price. It's just a figure of speech.
2021-06-12 01:11:58,wallstreetbets,But i wouldnt be broke though. 👍 Its pathetic if all your net worth is in a single stock. Diversify
2021-06-12 09:36:18,wallstreetbets,Most retarded fucking thing ever*
2021-06-12 05:35:48,wallstreetbets,"In the boats scene with The Joker and Batman a similar dynamic happens. The passengers have seen that both haven't blown each other up, so they both don't pull the trigger. 

The GME situation is the same except those without diamond hands fall off the boat. At some point you only have diamond hands left.

I think many people questioned whether the market was fraudulent. Apparently, it is."
2021-06-12 06:08:10,wallstreetbets,"I like the company and I like the stock.  Happy to hold GME bags.  Reminds me of walking through the mall with a whack of generic clothes but a single great item from the best brand at the time when I was a kid and had that back to school shopping swagger.

See you at the food court I'll buy you a chili dog and some fries.  Love these GME bags."
2021-06-12 01:55:28,wallstreetbets,Yes let’s not encourage taking profit. Fuck outta here lmao
2021-06-12 08:24:19,wallstreetbets,"Why?

I have more shares than I started with and still holding at least half of them (more than I started with) 

Doesn’t that help more than only holding? If not please explain instead of all the short answers that say “ just don’t “"

2021-06-12 09:05:52,wallstreetbets,It starts with GME and it ends with the collapse of the Hege funds then the markets as a whole and finally the collapse of western civilization.  Of all the ways this house of cards finally fails this one was the absolute least likely.  Far far behind an AI uprising or Alien Invasion.
2021-06-12 04:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I think it's very evident at this stage that it's far from over. It definitely will end at some point and it does seem that they keep digging a deeper hole.  All the attention that naked shorting is getting right now can only be a good thing. The world is watching, thus putting immense pressure on the hierarchy."

2021-06-12 03:06:18,wallstreetbets,"More affordable. Holding 1 share of GME and it moves 50%, is the same as holding the same value in another stock. Whether it’s 10 bucks or 10k, you’re making 50% back."
2021-06-12 03:13:12,wallstreetbets,"There are people who truly believe it will hit 100k which is insane. 1-2k a share is definitely doable and would have in January if it wasn’t for the whole market maker situation.

It’s sort of like buying a lotto ticket and being euphoric, or being part of a pyramid scheme and having a support group the whole way."

I bought my tickets and I want to see this play out and have learned so much about securities, markets, media, and public/reddit sentiment which was definitely worth the cost of admission.  Not mad wherever the ride goes and really want to see a company proudly invested in turn things around as a proof of concept that investment is change."
2021-06-12 02:04:00,wallstreetbets,"Haha No, you are correct. This is wsb, we know how it is around here. Forgive me im just a bit emotionally invested as I see now much fuckery they do, stomping over the heads of us regular joes and our fam for a penny. So its more than just money to me now.

It's always a possibility, which is why no one should put in more than they can afford to lose.

If the US government did allow that to happen though, I can't see it being good for the health of the US markets. You'd see a lot of international (and domestic) money get out of the US market and and move to other markets. No point in investing in a system so corrupt they delist stocks instead of paying debts."

2021-06-12 10:30:31,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention the impact to the US market as a whole, other countries going apeshit and perhaps pulling out of the US market."
2021-06-12 11:20:44,wallstreetbets,"Yup, it would end up in courts and they'd pay a fine. Just like the manipulation they got away with in January when they pulled the plug illegally. What Apes need to realize is that they will do anything, including risking prison time to avoid losing."
2021-06-12 17:18:30,wallstreetbets,It would basically mean the death of th US market.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO ape here. Some fast fact DD for you all. I am an ape. I have been an AMC and BB ape (although I have sold those positions... for a profit) and I recently made +2000% on WEN calls I bought just before they became a little meme.

Now I like $ASO. I've seen it getting a little action here so let's talk about it. Note: I am not telling you to sell AMC, BB, or anything else. Keep those if you want to.

$ASO: Academy Sports and Outdoors - a great southern sports retailer. They IPO'd last fall and have sustained steady growth since. $ASO is looking like a fantastic long term stock, as well as showing potential for some memery. Here are some DD fast facts:

Institutional ownership = high, at 89%.

Insiders = buying recently.

Earnings? Over $5 per share and outperforming all estimates.

P/E? Under 10.

SMAs? Looking beautiful, staying on the upper end short term relative to long.

Shorts? Over 23% of float right now, with 4 days-to-cover.

What this mean to this ape? This mean I like the stonk. What do you think?

My ancestors are apes and so am I.

This is not financial advice."

2021-06-12 18:59:48,wallstreetbets,"DTC is calculated by taking the number of shares short and dividing by the average daily trading volume. This estimates how long it would take a short position to close out if they were trading at the same rate as normal and buying up all of the shares. Of course this should be taken with a grain of salt, as volumes can and do change. However, if enough apes buy and hold, I wouldn't be too worried about the volume going up and reducing that a lot."

2021-06-11 21:14:30,wallstreetbets,One thing I haven't been able to figure out is who would short a stock that looks this healthy. Any thoughts there? Why is it so shorted?
2021-06-11 23:32:31,wallstreetbets,Hopium is a helluva drug
2021-06-11 23:30:46,wallstreetbets,"No. We just like it. But here’s the thing. If you rob a consignment store in March and I place my goods in there to sell in may, safe to say you didn’t get my goods, nor the money they made when they finally sold in June"
2021-06-11 21:57:06,wallstreetbets,"It's just frustrating.  Good DD has been written on ASO but it gets ignored. The only thing that resonates with apes is telling them something is highly shorted which, as I just explained, I don't think ASO really is.  But ultimately if people flood this thing with buying they would actually make money.   We went up 10% this week, like we said we would, while most people fucked around with stupid memes and managed to lose money.  Can't convince people to do smart things by giving them good reasons, you have to tell them it's a short squeeze."
2021-06-11 21:43:12,wallstreetbets,"The short thesis is dumb as fuck but I'll do my best..  

The business wasn't that strong prior to the pandemic and it has pretty bad financials when compared to peers.  I'll come back to this. 

KKR is the money-grubbingest PE firm there is, and there was a lot of thought that they just decided to sell their ownership in the company at just the right moment, before the two best quarters the company had ever had, or would ever have.  The pandemic led to all-time high buying in weight lifting systems, treadmills, canoes, trampolines, basketball systems, guns and ammo, etc.  I.e. the highest margin items that a sporting goods store can sell.  So the results were going to be record breaking...that was sorta obvious back in the summer of 2020.  When the pandemic was over, the assumption was those sales would disappear.

The IPO was pretty disappointing.  They were expecting it to sell around 16-18 but ended up only selling at 12-13.  It also was a pretty long hold by KKR, they bought in like 2011 iirc and didn't sell til 2020, which is a long time in private equity.  Which suggested it didn't go as well as planned.

So anyway, the price was rising after December and many thought it would fall back down...then at some point in January the price spiked to 27...look at the chart on January 27-28.  Two things happened...there were probably some shorts that needed to liquidate so they covered, and there was a spike.  KKR then announced that they'd be selling shares on the spike (non-dilutive obviously), and the stock got shorted down to 20 the next day.

The first time ASO showed up on the short list was in mid-feb, reflective of January 31 figures.

Anyway, the short thesis is still that the stock is too high because they're idiots.  Despite reducing debt from $1b to $300MM and improving margins, the shorts apparently still believe that Academy will return to the humdrum operating results pre-pandemic.  And despite the improvements, other firms have improved more rapidly.  All their peers have a better current ratio, leverage ratio, ROA, etc.  Big Five was a huge piece of shit pre-pandemic and they used this time to erase their debt entirely.  Dick's is absolutely on fire.  Academy is still lagging in the financials.

Anyway, there's not that much short interest anyway.  The institutional ownership is overexaggerated everywhere because the numbers are stale, which means the float is larger than reported, and ASO (along with corroboration from big five) has proven the success is continuing, so the shorts have likely been covering.

I'll just add from my perspective, I haven't seen the stock act anywhere near as annoying as it did from Feb to April, when I lost money on calls because somebody kept knocking it back down, and volume was too low to push through.  It's moving forward pretty steadily since then.  So, I'm not convinced there's anything to squeeze."
2021-06-11 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Okay first of all, that’s practically unreadable.
Secondly, the AMC CEO took gains from you for their own bonus and you’re clearly having a hard time accepting that.

Chart Analysis:

Adobe has been consolidating for many many months, and just broke out of the key trading range. This is the best possible time to buy  with an incredible upcoming catalyst: earnings on Thursday. The chart is clearly indicating a massive breakout and I really think we will see 575 in the next two weeks.

Positions:

10 x 555 6/18 C

Big fed meetings next week but expecting the same reaction as the CPI from this week. The fed is right and wallstreet knows it.

2021-06-12 09:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Just buy the stock or 2022/23 options and hold until natural 50 or a random spike to 30 or some shit. The good thing about BB is that it actually has a bright future and a leader in an emerging market. 

This is the easier, less stressful, and more profitable way to make money than trying to flip every day. You’re more likely to stick with your price target and execute because you actually believe in the company.

BB is a $50 stock by 2023/2024. But I 100% guarantee we will have multiple meme moments/crazy spike in between. So buy when people stop believing and hold till everyone starts FOMOing and sell on the spike. Buy back in after a new floor is established.

I do believe we will try to hit 20 again in the next few months tho just based on TA (maybe even a run up into earnings) BB Might retrace to high 12s but I don’t expect it to go sub 10 again. Unless earnings is complete dog which it very well could be. The next big catalyst is going to be the patent sale (probably FB) and when huawei patents will be reflected in earnings. Once these things are shown in earnings there will easily a spike to 20 and above again. 

Just make sure you get in before. BB 2021 is basically AMD of 2017. Just hold for a couple years and there will be exponential growth"

2021-06-12 02:18:45,wallstreetbets,Fuckin stoploss hit on bb so now i have 17 avg cost instead of 12.50.  Ready to fly to so i can forget this mistake.
2021-06-12 02:19:57,wallstreetbets,I got to say that I initially didn’t think BB would do anything but now I’m mad I didn’t get in before the fueling station. Hopefully it doesn’t gap up too far on Monday so I can get in.
2021-06-12 08:30:47,wallstreetbets,"Good average on BB. I bought higher but holding.

2021-06-11 22:21:16,wallstreetbets,You’re up 9K man take profits and walk away. That’s a big gain.
2021-06-12 00:42:08,wallstreetbets,Maybe we should invest in companies with valid products and real market value? Goys?
2021-06-12 06:38:45,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain why this keeps coming up? Isn't BB done for this run? Bought at $10.99, sold at $19.46. Why did no one else do the same?

The fuck happened to profit taking instead of ""Apes hold strong"" etc?"
2021-06-11 23:58:28,wallstreetbets,I sold $80K at $17 from a $10.75 price. If it goes below $9 in the next month then I'm going all in again. I think the company will definitely make a rebound.

2021-06-12 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,Good luck to you BBs bag holders.  As for me I like the amc stonk.  This is the way.
2021-06-12 12:51:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm thinking in one day not 1440 minutes.

2021-06-12 02:28:16,wallstreetbets,I like the stock as well but is there any sort of a catalyst in sight?

2021-06-11 20:10:27,wallstreetbets,Hmmm what is the ticket symbol?
2021-06-11 22:10:20,wallstreetbets,That’s what they said about amc (fortune favors the Retarded)
2021-06-11 21:23:06,wallstreetbets,You have to remember how long AMC took to jump then it doubled in just that one day. When that happens for BB everyone will regret not being on this train earlier
2021-06-12 03:05:48,wallstreetbets,Obviously retarded apes are putting their money elsewhere.
2021-06-11 22:35:50,wallstreetbets,The real retards are always in Robinhood

2021-06-11 21:21:43,wallstreetbets,Why so?  I’m in but wondering why it hasn’t already
2021-06-11 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I kept hearing about last week.

I’m thinking about activating my ejection seat!"
2021-06-11 21:23:48,wallstreetbets,Let’s get that money!
2021-06-12 17:00:55,wallstreetbets,Is that the target? I bought BB in January at just under the ATH. Lol. They got me!
2021-06-11 21:13:11,wallstreetbets,I haven’t sold yet even when it was over $17 this week I believe it has more room to rise in the coming months
2021-06-12 14:31:31,wallstreetbets,Its not too late to book your ticket to the moon! 🚀🌙
2021-06-12 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about doing something like that but I’ve never sold call options. I started to Google it last night but will look more into this week as I’m very new to options. Thanks for the advice
2021-06-12 18:33:28,wallstreetbets,I am effective this coming Thursday lol
2021-06-11 22:48:14,wallstreetbets,"You’re new around here, aren’t you?"
2021-06-12 02:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Fellow 💸 handed brother. Our powers are no use here. The Autists are religious fanatics, that worship 🍗 Tendies, and believe in the Almighty 💎🤲. To put it simply, they're retarded."
2021-06-11 22:48:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah not yet,  I was up more earlier in the week but didn’t sell. I believe it will rise more this coming week"
2021-06-12 03:20:14,wallstreetbets,you’re a dope.
2021-06-11 22:48:49,wallstreetbets,It’s Robinhood. I’m switching over to Webull this coming week though
2021-06-12 18:31:13,wallstreetbets,I haven’t sold. I was up a lot more than this last week. Transferring the shares to WeBull in progress though
2021-06-11 22:41:23,wallstreetbets,virgin
2021-06-12 03:18:14,wallstreetbets,There are multiple but they will come as a surprise. I also have a sneaking suspicion Earnings are going to be well received
2021-06-11 20:11:03,wallstreetbets,Is that not what we’ve been buying?
2021-06-11 21:25:48,wallstreetbets,It’s already up 73% the past month which is pretty darn good
2021-06-11 21:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Do you think BB will stay at it's ""moon"" price, or fall back down as quickly as the last time?"
2021-06-11 23:18:30,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna be off there after this coming weeks minus the options I have which couldn’t be transferred

It’s not going to explode and it was obviously done meme running a week ago"
2021-06-11 22:08:14,wallstreetbets,Well on June 8 it was $17 a share on a steady rise AMC was near $60 a share and conveniently CLOV and these other hedge fund pump & dumps took the volume away from both stocks the rest of the week
2021-06-11 21:49:43,wallstreetbets,"If you're lucky, you have low ceilings and hit your head faster on the way up!"
2021-06-12 19:52:18,wallstreetbets,I hope so that would be dope
2021-06-11 22:59:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m pretty new. I got on here after I the first time GME went to the moon. I’ve tried to learn off other peoples posts since I haven’t been investing too long myself. It’s a lot more fun than having money just sitting in savings account drawing very little interest
2021-06-11 22:57:03,wallstreetbets,I use vanguard it's a non profit but I use yahoo finance to track things easier
2021-06-12 11:00:04,wallstreetbets,Haha says the dude with the 3 year old Reddit account fuck off g
2021-06-11 20:13:23,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah I gotcha. I was thinking you were referring to the shoes
2021-06-12 03:17:31,wallstreetbets,“Is that not what we been buying“ killed me.
2021-06-12 04:32:18,wallstreetbets,Agree! Patience young grasshoppers.  You also don't want too much scrutiny.  Slow and steady also wins the race
2021-06-11 21:37:04,wallstreetbets,I’m talking about 1000% + gains
2021-06-11 21:52:15,wallstreetbets,From what I’ve been reading the price should go up especially if the earnings report later this month is good news
2021-06-12 11:42:21,wallstreetbets,How do you have options that can't be transferred?
2021-06-12 01:50:31,wallstreetbets,So much this. It's like the retard leading the retarded.
2021-06-12 05:11:53,wallstreetbets,"Awwww poor baby, who hurt you? It's going to the moon with or without you."
2021-06-12 04:59:19,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias?
2021-06-11 22:31:51,wallstreetbets,Dunno if that’s the best conclusion to draw.
2021-06-11 20:14:06,wallstreetbets,It was my attempt at being ironic. I would certainly never invest in anything the Ball family is involved in lol
2021-06-11 21:46:22,wallstreetbets,Blackberry seems to have the best business model going forward more so than AMC or GME. I have some AMC as well but not that much right now
2021-06-12 00:09:41,wallstreetbets,If the earnings report is good it will drop 30% into the red like every other good news event for BB
2021-06-11 22:04:37,wallstreetbets,🤞
2021-06-12 16:52:56,wallstreetbets,So what’s the broker of choice?
2021-06-12 18:26:31,wallstreetbets,"Some of mine expire the end of this coming week, I don’t think they could be transferred because my stocks won’t be until Thursday it says. The BB options I have could be transferred but I just kept them all in RH for now and will close the account after they expire."
2021-06-12 05:48:39,wallstreetbets,I’m sure
2021-06-12 02:14:39,wallstreetbets,Lamelo Ball rookie cards are the way .
2021-06-11 20:17:26,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly stay away from investing in the Ball family. Hopefully next week we can get to $20 a share or so
2021-06-12 00:42:42,wallstreetbets,Haha that’s the way it’s been seeming to go for some reason. Hopefully that changes soon
2021-06-12 17:29:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if you're asking me or OP, but any brokerage should be able to transfer options using ACATS. I've used Etrade, Interactive Brokers, Tasty, and TD Ameritrade. So far as I know all can and do make ACATS transfers that include options.

Here's a Finra link for reference: [https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/brokerage-accounts/understanding-brokerage-account-transfer-process#:\~:text=Transfers%20involving%20the%20most%20common,are%20readily%20transferable%20through%20ACATS](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/brokerage-accounts/understanding-brokerage-account-transfer-process#:~:text=Transfers%20involving%20the%20most%20common,are%20readily%20transferable%20through%20ACATS).

The one exception I can think of would be if you transferred only part of your account and left short options without the means to cover them. That probably wouldn't be allowed."
2021-06-12 18:59:30,wallstreetbets,I see - that makes sense. The important part is that you're leaving RH for a real brokerage.
2021-06-12 13:13:59,wallstreetbets,🤡
2021-06-11 22:05:01,wallstreetbets,Lameloball.io is the latest from the ball family
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The most important thing I have learned is not trust the retards on this sub who try and justify why you should hold If you are going to make a profit there is no shame in selling. The amount of circle jerk around these meme stocks has taught me that no one knows what the fuck they are talking about and all the upvotes and comments are a bunch of insecure monkeys who are trying to feel better about being 80% in the red. 
Just last week I saw a post with thousands of upvotes saying how amc has a new floor and everyone should hold after it hit fuckin 70 dollars a share. All the retards rode that train saying amc will easily hit 100. Well I sold my shares when it hit 60 and had some serious fomo when I read that post later that week. Now a week later amc closed at 44 dollars a share and I guarantee there are even more retards saying “good job holding the line amc to 100.” No one knows shit, don’t be afraid to sell."

2021-06-11 20:51:55,wallstreetbets,Hear hear.  I'm kicking myself for not dumping my BB when it hit 20 earlier this week.    Could have reinvested for more shares at the same purchase price.

If my options are green, I don’t necessarily wait for them to go ITM. I’ll sell enough to cover my original investment, then anything else is a bonus. Sure I miss out on the big pay day, but I never take a big loss."

2021-06-12 12:18:19,wallstreetbets,You mad bro?
2021-06-11 23:01:14,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.

There was a post last week where someone was saying that they could be debt free (including house cars and student loans) if they sold right now. But they were going to hold and suggested others do as well. This is absolute shit advice. If you ever have an opportunity to be debt free in that way, especially at a young age, you should take it."

2021-06-12 06:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah buy and hold was only for gme because wsb OGs that one time realised that shares and not options was the play, but wsb is about gambling with options.

 I remember once I posted a 10k gain with shares and was almost laughed out of the room. I mention this because I held on to those shares and promptly lost all the gains (this was during the airline bubble last summer). Fuck holding, options have expiry dates for a reason."
2021-06-12 11:16:10,wallstreetbets,Those retards like myself believe the majority of the shorts have not covered. Meaning there is the potential for more upwards price action. Consolidation for more than 2 weeks being 250% up is bullish AF IMO. Believe it or not stocks don't just go straight up. !remindme 2 months. We will see who is unironically retarded.
2021-06-12 11:20:48,wallstreetbets,This sounds like financial advice. Are you a financial advisor or do you have any conflict of interest in this case?

No, sell you retard and make a shit ton of profit. You don't buy shares to 'stick it' to the man, you buy them to later sell them for profit. The memes are funny but don't lose sight of this fact."
2021-06-11 21:57:11,wallstreetbets,The retail/apes premise is buy and hold…and it has worked for a lot of people but a lot of people have lost their asses.  The fundamentals on AMC and GME are crap at these levels… but they are also for Tesla and they definitely were 20 years ago with Amazon…. That stock made no money and was selling stock to fund its operations and we know how it ended.   So there are legitimate cases where buy and hold works and has worked.  But buying a stock with no clear thought on when you want to sell is like buying a lottery ticket

2021-06-12 03:25:37,wallstreetbets,"You say ""nobody knows shit"" and that's exactly why people are holding and seeing if they're ideas work and others like yourself are bailing out of it for your reasons.
It doesn't matter if groups of people have their goals and ideas , just leave them alone, they can do what they want with their own money and time.... its just a waiting game.
Personally I'm still in profit in AMC so I'll hold for the sole purpose of seeing what it does and the intent on selling when I'm in the red , so I'm pleased people are shouting to hold, it suits me, but that doesn't mean I'm getting irate over people that claim its wise to sell. 

Who gives a shit what groups of people say and do with their money and posts. If someone is so stupid as to go against their urge to sell because a small group on redit tells them not to with silly ape emojis and child-like speeches,  then they REALLY shouldn't be in the markets and this will turn out to be a lesson in life, so either way there is value lol."

Then usually buy back on a dip for the same price I bought in and ride it out. Also meme stocks I do not hold forever.

1.) the lurkers. They never have the balls to commit, but they cheer on everyone else. They also watch in the closet and jack off while someone screws their wife.

2.) the bros. These guys are in it for the sense of camaraderie and will lose every penny but it’s worth it for them to feel like they are shoulder to shoulder with someone holding the line.

3.) the FOMO Ho’s. They can’t commit until the rocket has already launched, they buy the peak every time. In shame they sell and take the loss. 

4.) the bag holders. They bought all in because of someone’s made up DD and now they have their life savings in on a garbage stock. A few of these will continue to post DD about how tomorrow is the day. Tomorrow is always the day for these guys. The only real diamond hands involved are the fists up these guy’s ass

5.) the dabblers. These guys usually have a little money to invest, but only put in a little at a time into wsb nonsense, every time they lose out, so they are never willing to commit much."

Buy and hold, all that matters. If you sell, the day traders win and take your money, or someone else's.

It was over 300 for a few days straight, and closed for the weekend at 237 after a pretty big slide but still higher than I would have guessed in February.

2021-06-12 06:45:13,wallstreetbets,"In the beginning was the Meme and it was Gamestop (wasn't it?)

Redditors banded together to skyrocket the value of GameStop stock at the expense of hedge funds who had bet on it falling.

That last bit of the sentence is the important bit.

It was in fact **the HF who bet on it falling** and it was in fact **the HF who skyrocketed the price** because they HAD TO buy from freakz who would not sell.. Hence ""diamond hands"". There was **a point to holding** in that situation. It was pretty well documented, IMO.

But diamond hands is only a good thing if someone is desperately bidding for those shares. Just holding them when no one particularly wants them won't do anyone any special good - the only people who want to buy are other meme-freaks who have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. No one is interested in the shares except the meme freaks. They are interested because ""it's a meme"". They bid against each other and when one of them wins the others lose. The hedge funds probably laugh about that. Why should they care unless they were caught with their dick trapped in the door?

So - that definitely is not an attack on the roots of privileged and insider trading, there is no special situation, and it **is NOT** the retailers getting rich off the booty of the Hedge Funds. Unless there is ATM a sound DD reason for it, don't go there. Without that concrete base a ""meme frenzy"" is just a mob excitement where some retailers win and a lot of retailers don't win.

Bottom line - It's the **meme-freak fantasy** under the sheets dream : **For 100 dollars you buy an electric guitar and then you become the guitar hero of the generation** \- **right?**

.. ? ..

You dont have to understand what the fucks going on, you just have to shout the same shout as everyone else and throw in your money. Except by the time you hear where to throw, you probably too late & already lost. Smarter or faster folk got there first. You push the price up, they sell for a profit.

So forget the diamond hands and the hodl - NO stock is special, and nothing is going to the moon. Only get involved in a meme if you have solid DD on the situation and YOU TRUST IT, because for a while now there is a lot of crap being talked in all directions. TRUST your sources and understand WHY you trust them or dont get involved.

Tendies got invested in to an online accounting firm whose returns are living up to the company's name. 🤔"
2021-06-11 22:31:57,wallstreetbets,Can't become a millionaire if you sell at 60.....
2021-06-11 22:36:43,wallstreetbets,"It can cut both ways. You never know where these meme stocks are going and sometimes it's wise to take profit out on the way up. Of course, sometimes having balls of steel pays off. 

The most important thing I've learned is to avoid buying at all time highs. Don't be among the first to pay $300 for GME or $70 for AMC, lol. If it jumps up 50% and drops back, and you want to risk it, ok at least you know it can hit that high. But don't be the first."

2021-06-11 22:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes selling isn't bad. This stock goes up and down. I bought a hand full at 40 at the first tank. Sold at 200. Bought more when it dipped. I did t have a lot to invest, but this last sell I had 21 shares.  Now I'm waiting for a good tanking to load up. If I hit my. Buy target, I'll have 42 shares. I just don't panic. If it low, hold. If it's $260+..... I'll buy more shares later"
2021-06-11 22:48:55,wallstreetbets,Seems like all the new investors are finally learning. It’s a beautiful sight. But a horrifying reality to those that deep in the red lol this is why you don’t listen to strangers on the internet with what to do with your own money
2021-06-11 22:54:55,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing, took profit on all of the memes, got into BB and WKHS super early, flipped a few AMC shares and also flipped WISH. Best week on the market I’ve had for the past few months"

2021-06-12 00:27:38,wallstreetbets,I sold enough AMC shares to make 50% on all my shares at 51 on the down from 70. I sold the rest today. I made 450% and 300% profit. I only had 10 shares.
2021-06-12 00:32:01,wallstreetbets,Also wsb mods delete a ton of posts with good dds(some wkhs ones)

2021-06-12 01:10:59,wallstreetbets,How do you sell? I opened up my trust wallet and went to pancake swap then copied the address but I’m stuck there
2021-06-12 01:12:25,wallstreetbets,its a ponzi scheme people will come up with some ridiculous figure like gme 1000 so they can sell at 300 and idiots buy their shares read the room no one here can guess these things they just want to get in and out with a profit
2021-06-12 01:19:13,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell never

2021-06-12 02:55:00,wallstreetbets,What is sell? Can you show me with crayons?
2021-06-12 03:04:36,wallstreetbets,Half the dd are bias asf and its probably to support their gambling addiction of options.
2021-06-12 03:08:15,wallstreetbets,Aren't we supposed to buy high and sell low? This what I have been doing bought at 11 and 19 then sold at 6. I believe I did pretty good
2021-06-12 03:14:06,wallstreetbets,"Hilarious that some apes in here think no one in here sold and these downturns are only from those not on here.
Chuckles"
2021-06-12 03:20:41,wallstreetbets,"I think there is a difference in why ppl r holding. Some r going for a moon shot w play $$, some r trying to make a quick buck, some r here to stick it to the man, some just want to b a part of something big, some r really into the stock, some just crossed their fingers / went for it, some have done some serious dd & some r just eating crayons to c what colors their poop comes out. I don’t fault any of those reasons. I do know that they all want the same thing & that’s what makes it all special."
2021-06-12 03:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low. Got it!"
2021-06-12 03:24:07,wallstreetbets,"I thought about it and realized that I'd be thousands of dollars richer this year if I hadn't ever sold anything.

I mostly do meme and other WSB stocks and some crypt toe too.

Now I just try to hold everything if I can. I'm out of money though"
2021-06-12 03:24:07,wallstreetbets,"Sell? Pffh, you probably walk away from gambling after 30 mins and up $50."
2021-06-12 03:25:42,wallstreetbets,Wow you figured out the secret
2021-06-12 03:33:12,wallstreetbets,I sold 6 shares of AMC to secure profit. But I haven't told anyone! My gf is the only one that knows.
2021-06-12 03:34:19,wallstreetbets,Yup been seeing a lot of bag holders cry on this sub because they lost everything.
2021-06-12 03:34:35,wallstreetbets,Good for you!
2021-06-12 03:35:46,wallstreetbets,What’s a “sell”?
2021-06-12 03:37:05,wallstreetbets,"you should hold for the tendies... I purchased GME for $2 and sold at $50... I purchased SQ at $12 and sold at $100... MDB $30 => $150... FCX $5 => $30... TSLA $200 => $1000... AMC $9 => $15...  Every single one of those stocks, I could have at least doubled my money if I held in there.

If you sell, you don't get to play the game anymore.  No matter how much you make, you will make, you can make more if you stay in the game.

If you are down, just hold.  You (almost) can't lose money if you don't sell.  I know some companies actually go under and the shares become worthless, but that is fairly rare.  Even my biggest losers still end up producing gains after a few years.  Just keep buying more until you dollar cost average your way out of the hole."
2021-06-12 03:53:14,wallstreetbets,"yea, the amount of people trying to shame people for selling because ""you idiot, it cant go to $100,000/share if you sell!"" is just stupid. like people are out here trying to get some money for their future and then you got people simply who want to do dumb stuff to post on reddit."
2021-06-12 03:56:37,wallstreetbets,You realized this now?
2021-06-12 03:59:10,wallstreetbets,"If it took you time to find out nobody here knows what they're doing, I'm afraid you're just as retarded as the rest of us."
2021-06-12 04:06:48,wallstreetbets,Who the fook ask
2021-06-12 04:19:15,wallstreetbets,Lol 80% in red. More like 1000%.
2021-06-12 04:26:59,wallstreetbets,The goal is to make money using whatever retarded strategy you can employ. People saying hold don't know how the game is played.
2021-06-12 04:27:57,wallstreetbets,i thought if you hold you make tendies?
2021-06-12 04:28:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, a retard gained some sentience. Good job, OP."

2021-06-12 04:57:08,wallstreetbets,"I do think AMC is shorted though and if we all hold til at least around 75 we can see what happens. It’s back up at 50 again. If GME can, so can AMC. Short sellers are still fucked on these stocks compared to the other shit people are just spamming"
2021-06-12 05:02:35,wallstreetbets,"if you see someone like that, call them out as the bag-holder they are"
2021-06-12 05:03:14,wallstreetbets,You a beetch ass nicca yo!
2021-06-12 05:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Same thing with GME, I’ve been holding that shit for months and I finally sold at 315 and now it’s around 230 even though 90% of retards here swore that the ‘sqeeze’ is finally happening and that it’s going into thousands. I’ll probably buy it again but only after it drops below 150 and I certainly won’t wait as long to sell it the next time."
2021-06-12 05:07:21,wallstreetbets,AMC would have easily hit 100 and more if  it wasn't for the company making negative public comments and diluting the shares.
2021-06-12 05:10:50,wallstreetbets,"You got lucky with 60 and now you are acting like it was obvious that it was right time to sell.  Lots of people on here were saying to sell at 20, too."
2021-06-12 05:14:49,wallstreetbets,"If you DYOR (on the sentiment and popularity), plan it out properly and have exit plans i.e. prepare stop losses, instead of just blindly diving into every stock you see on this sub, you'd see that there's actually some decent dds and reasons why you should hold in this reddit."
2021-06-12 05:21:56,wallstreetbets,you realize this whole sub is for memes and joking? half the people are probably just playing on demo accounts lmao
2021-06-12 05:24:13,wallstreetbets,Proof your sold stocks at 60 👀
2021-06-12 05:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. And even if you do buy back in, you can have a much lower buy back (to lose more as it goes back to the mean price oh fuck, I’m talking to myself)"
2021-06-12 05:30:15,wallstreetbets,I'm buying and holding for the long run. I staked all of mine to my Guardian Node. It pays very well. You should try it.

2021-06-12 06:11:17,wallstreetbets,"It is amazing to watch these people hold regardless of consequence. I'm not saying AMC couldn't go higher but some of these idiots have sunk everything in AMC with a lot of personal risk. I never play with money I care if I lose and when I'm way up on a risky bet I'm fucking out with a smile. Let's face it,  AMC is a no Amazon."
2021-06-12 06:14:28,wallstreetbets,Somebody knows what meaning sell?
2021-06-12 06:17:30,wallstreetbets,That's because they are all pump and dumps. GME on the other hand is going to moon like mad pretty soon because it's over 100% shorted still

2021-06-12 07:03:32,wallstreetbets,"If some stock is very volatile and can go either way - put stop losses for the % of the amount you are willing to lose.

2021-06-12 07:22:02,wallstreetbets,A week? You think a week gives you enough data to determine where a stock is going?
2021-06-12 07:34:15,wallstreetbets,"In their defense, the whole reason you even got to sell at $60 and make profit was people holding. Is that not a legit strategy for a stock detached from fundamentals?"
2021-06-12 08:10:06,wallstreetbets,People might not actually be telling their true thoughts on here.
2021-06-12 08:14:06,wallstreetbets,Some theories have been proven. But retail is just the bag holder that's for sure until the big boys come around.

2021-06-12 09:53:32,wallstreetbets,You should definitely take profit if you have too. Just sell on the way up instead of selling all at once which messes up the stock price. This AMC thing is bigger than money at this point its about revenge and what the people deserve from the headgies raping us for decades! It's time we turn the tables on them and make them lose billions until they're all out of business!!
2021-06-12 09:54:06,wallstreetbets,Hold the gd line
2021-06-12 10:02:17,wallstreetbets,"Wait a second, you're not a retard"
2021-06-12 10:09:51,wallstreetbets,Always take out your profits and just keep the initial investment in.
2021-06-12 10:11:54,wallstreetbets,I thought our target price was $69.42?
2021-06-12 10:17:47,wallstreetbets,"I sold my AMC this past week at over 10x investment. No regerts (yet, anyway)."
2021-06-12 10:21:36,wallstreetbets,No shame in cashing out for profit. You can always jump back into the same stock later after the plummet if you want. The diamond hands pride here baffles me. I just don't get it. They are leaving a lot of money on the table.
2021-06-12 10:24:39,wallstreetbets,Finally someone said it lol.
2021-06-12 10:34:27,wallstreetbets,"I really have no clue what I’m doing. I also don’t mess around with options, just shares. When you’re up 400% on a single position I think it’s foolish not to lock in some gains and spread money around elsewhere. I can appreciate what the holders are doing. But I’m no ape. I’m in it to make money."
2021-06-12 10:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Anytime you check the daily thread and all you see is people posting HOLD THE LINE and REFUELING FOR TRIP TO MOON, its a good time to sell"
2021-06-12 10:40:43,wallstreetbets,Amen
2021-06-12 10:47:03,wallstreetbets,You lost me at “If you are going to make a profit...”
2021-06-12 10:53:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm only putting a few hundred dollars into AMC.  I still have the same amount of shares as when I started a couple weeks ago, but now I have them at a lower price, and I've made about $100 off of it."
2021-06-12 10:54:11,wallstreetbets,"I never really understood why people didn't sell at 70 and then buy again when it dropped down to 30. You could almost double your number of shares and if it goes above 100 you just turned 4,000 bucks into almost 70k."
2021-06-12 11:06:49,wallstreetbets,"I sold early, like wayyyy early, and made $1.3K. Nothing crazy but I was happy with it. Seeing all the crap around AMC now? Not even gonna touch it."
2021-06-12 11:11:36,wallstreetbets,Lol don't tell them
2021-06-12 11:13:52,wallstreetbets,NOT A TEAM SPORT
2021-06-12 11:14:46,wallstreetbets,It’s all “Apes to together strong” when it comes to buying.  It’s Everyman for himself when it comes to selling.  I’ve done well on meme sticks but I just assume everything is a pump and dump and sell as soon as I see a good profit.
2021-06-12 11:27:56,wallstreetbets,Alternatively it’s not all or nothing… you don’t have to fully sell or fully be in. If a meme stock goes up 100% at the very leeast take your principal out
2021-06-12 11:38:39,wallstreetbets,What ticker is this???
2021-06-12 11:45:47,wallstreetbets,Bought @ 14 sold @ 70. The math checks out well. Not sure if I will re-buy at next rally or instead buy a new boat with the profits.
2021-06-12 11:53:57,wallstreetbets,"This. 

The only thing that matters is making profits so you can eat. The longer you stay at the casino, the more likely you are going to lose. That's why I buy options. The second they are green, I try and make my target percent profit, and sell. You are here to make money."
2021-06-12 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,"If we are all being real, when do you all think is the time to sell AMC?"
2021-06-12 12:22:54,wallstreetbets,Profit  < 🦍
2021-06-12 12:34:58,wallstreetbets,Couldnt agree more got in at 35 and sold at 55. Had serious fomo but seeing how it all panned out there is no shame in taking a 70% gain. Its about making money period.. A win is a win
2021-06-12 13:16:49,wallstreetbets,This sub confuses me so much. So many wild loss porn posts. “I just lost 100k and bought 50k more on the dip!” Do people get off on losing or what?
2021-06-12 13:17:26,wallstreetbets,I thought these were per use products?!
2021-06-12 13:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Ooh another basher pg

Hilarious!"
2021-06-12 13:24:47,wallstreetbets,See you over 100 next week.
2021-06-12 13:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Now, all reddit is is a bunch of kids or old newbies that just opened up a robinhood account and SPAM PUMP these boards all over 24-7 saying to BUY BUY BUY, HOLD, DON'T SELL.....

They want YOU to pump the stock up so they can sell the JUNK stock at higher prices and BEFORE YOU DO. Watch how bad WKHS crashes next week."
2021-06-12 13:47:22,wallstreetbets,Lots of 135 day accounts being upvoted. Oddly enough.
2021-06-12 13:51:40,wallstreetbets,"what you have to do is push this week amc so that the funds buy like crazy and skyrocket the price, this is our last train to be more than millionaires"
2021-06-12 14:05:15,wallstreetbets,"OP is smart just like me... I bought AMC at $9 in March 2021. I told myself I'll sell it all when it reaches $100. Few months later crazy price actions occurred and my instincts told me that I needed to change my strat and secure big profit. I too sold at $60.

No regrets. Now many tards that fomo'ed and bought top are stuck in negatives.

Good luck lmao"

2021-06-12 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,"My sell button was removed long ago on my app and it never came back. Had to google what “sell” meant.

Like the game of flappybirds…the bird only went up when i buy. when i dont, the bird falls. this “sell” you speak of would just make the bird crash into the bottom rocks…yeahhhhh no thanks"
2021-06-12 15:21:35,wallstreetbets,keep you're eye on the crayons
2021-06-12 15:24:47,wallstreetbets,You seem like the same guy who couldn't hold for his group in League of Legends and they all ded now.... Leeeeeeroy Jeeeeenkins!
2021-06-12 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying, but I will be laughing at this post by the end of the month"
2021-06-12 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,I have AMC and GM and I will continue holding until I want and the pressure rises more.
2021-06-12 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,I couldnt agree more.
2021-06-12 17:52:52,wallstreetbets,Can't wait to see the post after AMC hits $100 in the next 2 weeks.
2021-06-12 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,I sold and then found a winner.  Got in on dip and it went back up afterwards.  Couldn't have done that just holding still.
2021-06-12 19:25:30,wallstreetbets,😆
2021-06-12 06:00:55,wallstreetbets,"I voted this post down because it’s one of the stupidest posts I’ve read, even we’re all apes and our standards are not even that high."
2021-06-11 21:52:43,wallstreetbets,Thank God for someone making a sensible post. I wish many tendies and my wife upon you.
2021-06-11 23:01:42,wallstreetbets,i holding amc to 500. yolo
2021-06-11 23:09:46,wallstreetbets,"What you don't seem to understand is that shorting the stock within the current framework dilutes the float of shares and sends the price down as the shorted shares are then sold. This is literally wall street and the media's defense of shorts - it's the only way to bring the price down lol, relax these prices are absolutely possible and it's ok if you paperhand, just be better prepared if you venture into the AMC/GME waters. 

There are a lot more apes willing to diamond hand this, whether you actually held shares and sold them, the HF have over played their hand, the bluff has been called"
2021-06-11 23:46:21,wallstreetbets,"This is stupid. Not retarded, but fuckin stupid. I’ll see you when we break $100.00 moron."
2021-06-11 23:47:04,wallstreetbets,Why do I keep seeing posts like this? Yeah no shit dont listen to morons on the internet about what to do with your money and investments.  You probably shouldn't be investing if this isn't blatantly obvious to you.
2021-06-11 23:47:27,wallstreetbets,You're 80% in the red?
2021-06-11 23:58:23,wallstreetbets,"See you later, alligator."
2021-06-12 00:39:35,wallstreetbets,Can you guys believe this dumbass sold at 60
2021-06-11 21:59:04,wallstreetbets,Buncha retards!
2021-06-11 22:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Just triple down and wait it out a year. There is a consistent support level on a lot of wsb stocks. It's not the old folks home it's the YMCA at 3 pm. But yeah I agree with you that , if you can't afford to hold the don't be holding stocks invest in something less volatile if you can't afford rent or food."
2021-06-11 22:32:13,wallstreetbets,This Ape for one wants more bananas and I can only do that by jumping from stock to stock.
2021-06-11 22:48:35,wallstreetbets,I have no sell button!! Either we all go to the moon together or bust.  I'm tired of working.
2021-06-11 23:01:21,wallstreetbets,Buy support. Stop. Loss. Sell profits. BREAK EVEN.
2021-06-11 23:01:30,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?
2021-06-11 23:04:49,wallstreetbets,Go with long-term investing. This is hands down the best tool I've found for finding great companies: https://www.easyfinancialcharts.com/c/dashboard/tsla
2021-06-11 23:15:54,wallstreetbets,This is why you should invest in the long term. This is the best tool I am using for analyzing company fundamentals and financials: https://www.easyfinancialcharts.com/c/dashboard/tsla
2021-06-11 23:45:34,wallstreetbets,Don’t trust anyone over 30
2021-06-11 23:57:07,wallstreetbets,You thinking holding is good. Those that actually profit are secretly laughing at you guys (me). Thanks for the liquidity and dumb money WSB!!
2021-06-12 02:27:35,wallstreetbets,You can never go wrong taking profit
2021-06-12 02:34:06,wallstreetbets,">No one knows shit, don't be afraid to sell.

Fucking legendary."
2021-06-12 03:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Your biggest mistake was buying AMC, why would you hold AMC"
2021-06-12 06:30:36,wallstreetbets,This sub has been ruined by idiots who think they can outsmart big money.  Good luck!
2021-06-12 09:16:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm taking my AMC profits Monday. They rarely go up straight for more than 3 days in a row. No shame in selling! 👍
2021-06-12 11:24:19,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis - don't be afraid to buy and sell and buy and sell just like people in the stock market do! Right now I see great possibilities in AVO (Mission Produce). Avocado consumption is surging among apes who demand avocado toast with sardines.

disclaimer: Not a financial analyst; only know things from wallstreetbets and less reliable sources"
2021-06-12 11:40:11,wallstreetbets,"The sub has drastically changed. Years ago it was about people making risky high level investments hoping to gain money, which means you MUST sell at one point. You can’t buy a lambo without that money getting to your bank account. Now, these idiots are mostly left bagholding useless crap when they could have sold and made money. You hold boomer stocks, not sundial. Lol"
2021-06-12 12:12:07,wallstreetbets,"Apes kill each other to prove they are dominant, don't trust these people."
2021-06-11 21:50:31,wallstreetbets,I thought we were all just competing to see who could buy the highest
2021-06-11 22:01:28,wallstreetbets,You can only sell when it's in the red though. Thats like markets 101
2021-06-11 20:37:14,wallstreetbets,Harder than it sounds
2021-06-11 21:57:41,wallstreetbets,"No you can’t, the point of AMC is to keep it up and running so that we can all date our wife’s boyfriends sister."
2021-06-11 20:12:04,wallstreetbets,Apes buy shit. It what we do.
2021-06-11 21:18:47,wallstreetbets,If you sell you no ape anymore
2021-06-11 20:51:31,wallstreetbets,All of them but GME. That shit is with you FOR LIFE

2021-06-11 22:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but only for less than you paid for it.

Buy high, sell low.  This is the way."
2021-06-11 22:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Wait, we're supposed to be making money?"
2021-06-11 23:35:13,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-06-12 01:57:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah but for a lower price then what you bought it for.
2021-06-12 03:15:19,wallstreetbets,Yea. But you can only sell for a loss
2021-06-12 06:50:35,wallstreetbets,No.  You're suppose to wait for expiration....no wait.
2021-06-12 07:09:53,wallstreetbets,My platform doesn’t have the sell button.
2021-06-12 07:14:33,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-12 08:49:30,wallstreetbets,This question perplexes my smooth brain.
2021-06-11 23:25:32,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-06-11 23:10:27,wallstreetbets,I am glad you said that because I am having super FOMO after selling AMC months ago because i thought the fundamentals were bad and it took to long to go higher.
2021-06-12 09:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes, I lost $6 on CLOV and was ecstatic it was only that much.  I fell for that one hard."
2021-06-12 12:11:06,wallstreetbets,No way it's better to lose than miss a chance at a gain
2021-06-12 13:24:02,wallstreetbets,Its been a very painful lesson to learn.
2021-06-12 00:14:25,wallstreetbets,Unless youre playing options in which you lose either way.
2021-06-12 02:13:01,wallstreetbets,Exit plan!?
2021-06-12 00:20:42,wallstreetbets,Whats an exit plan?
2021-06-12 02:02:04,wallstreetbets,When I first got in to options I had five times where I was early and got up a few thousand percent but never sold until I was up only 50-100% because I got greedy. Now when I have an option hit 100-200% I sell unless there is serious momentum. Fuck all the morons that call for people to hold options until they expire. Idiots.
2021-06-12 02:01:34,wallstreetbets,This.  You deserve it in the butt if you don't have an exit strategy.
2021-06-11 23:40:42,wallstreetbets,And stick to it.
2021-06-12 13:31:43,wallstreetbets,You do lose even if you dont sell.
2021-06-11 22:19:21,wallstreetbets,Ol’ Dicky Wyckoff with the bars
2021-06-12 08:55:25,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah.
2021-06-12 12:34:35,wallstreetbets,you cant trust someone else giving you the numbers people here just make up numbers to justify you pumping whatever bad trade theyve made so they can get out

2021-06-12 01:14:41,wallstreetbets,$40K can buy a lot of a$$
2021-06-12 01:20:41,wallstreetbets,My dick says...... It's going up
2021-06-12 02:09:12,wallstreetbets,"So the best decision is as always, do nothing"
2021-06-12 02:32:32,wallstreetbets,"That's really the tough part, the FOMO. If you watch the stocks and then buy when they get low you won't be afraid of holding when it jumps 100%. But even if you do it's a bonus, you made double the money. But if you end up holding the bag there really isn't anything you can do but hold. I had to hold when I bought GME when it dropped from $250 to $50 a share, but was able to pull out when it climbed. I wasn't gonna pull out until it climbed back up though."
2021-06-12 02:58:15,wallstreetbets,"I interpret this as you buying into a momentum stock after it has already gone up 200%. Then paper handing and selling, and another time diamond hand and selling. You essentially did the same thing both times, you sold after bought in at a bad spot."

2021-06-12 10:35:39,wallstreetbets,"Hey dont worry! i started with 38k > 120k peak GME >5K
then i sat for like 4 months, and made a move on CLOV. back up to 48k$"
2021-06-12 11:40:42,wallstreetbets,These are the stories I don't understand. Why would you all in with 50k when you have no experience? Why not just dollar cost average into good stocks you have conviction for and grow a account first?
2021-06-12 11:56:09,wallstreetbets,"I buy options. When they are 20% green, I sell. I also only buy options with a MINUMUM of two Mondays left in them (so min two weeks). I have personally found that new people buy stocks going up (which is mondays) and then on Fridays when it's in the toilet, panic sell). Trick is to buy on Fridays in the toilet, and then sell on Mondays/Tuesdays at the top. Get your 20% and get out. Yes, you could be leaving money on the table. But you could also quickly get burned. Better to have 20% than no percent. This is not financial advice, only what I personally do, and each person should do their own DD and learn their own ways."

2021-06-12 09:30:20,wallstreetbets,"I sold half at $17 on the way up 

It flew up, I was kicking myself then started falling hard, I panicked at $17 again and sold the rest.  Then it skyrocketed to $25 in the next 30 min.

I hated myself, was so pissed at how much I fucked up.

Never been so mad at myself for making money"
2021-06-12 06:34:45,wallstreetbets,At least you have cash you can dry those shame tears with.
2021-06-12 07:24:49,wallstreetbets,Also You can buy more CLOV at $14 instead of $21.
2021-06-12 10:23:47,wallstreetbets,I got out of CLOV in the low $27 range. No shame in taking a profit and walking away IMO.
2021-06-12 12:36:02,wallstreetbets,"It was a pump and dump, you got it clean a lot of others cant say the same, dont kick yourself about selling before peak because odds are if you tried you wouldnt have gotten out in time anyways"
2021-06-12 10:02:30,wallstreetbets,"this is why you guys are all fucking up. the fact that you feel ""shame"" about taking profits is the dumbest shit i will ever read here and tells you how many ""diamond handers"" are going to miss out on maximizing profits. because of what...shame? from who? random morons who don't know what they're doing here on the internet? you should feel shame for posting this shit, not taking the money. wake the fuck up people"
2021-06-12 11:07:03,wallstreetbets,I sold all my calls at 18$ wasn't going to risk 20k in profit. I wanted to keep 4 and let them run but I got greedy. Next time I'll follow through.
2021-06-12 11:28:48,wallstreetbets,Bought at 14 sold 3 hrs later for 22. 50% gains before breakfast is cool
2021-06-12 12:32:52,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 8 and sold at 10 along with some calls I’m happy. No fomo here because had I chased it I would have been fucked

2021-06-11 21:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Still remember that faithful morning. CLOV hit 27 then started to dip immediately. Without a second thought and anther precious dollar I hit sell, clicked my phone off and walked away to never look again."
2021-06-11 20:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Between my shares and options, I increased my trading account 900% bc of CLOV running. You bet I sold the shit out of that and took my money and ran"
2021-06-11 21:21:27,wallstreetbets,1400% profit on CLOV checking in
2021-06-12 08:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Could have sold at 180% profit but I held till 120%.

Makes it a bit hard to be happy about it but happy I am."
2021-06-11 20:13:09,wallstreetbets,I sold at 200% 😂 lucky call.
2021-06-12 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,"Timing the lowest dip and absolute tip is impossible. You made money, be happy. I beat myself up sometimes with ""what ifs"" and ""I shoulda done this and shoulda done that move then I woulda had xx.xxx amount of tendies."""
2021-06-12 01:42:10,wallstreetbets,Yep I sold my amc at just under 300% gains. 0 regrets

2021-06-11 21:13:57,wallstreetbets,but that 1%...
2021-06-12 02:27:54,wallstreetbets,Recently? Been filled with nonsense since January
2021-06-12 04:52:42,wallstreetbets,Literally this
2021-06-12 19:01:09,wallstreetbets,I know jack shit and was hoping to learn something along the way whilste jumping on the GME rocket. But literally 99% of the posts and comments are trash now.
2021-06-12 08:06:52,wallstreetbets,Workhorse and Lordstown are great companies getting killed by the shorts though!
2021-06-12 02:59:10,wallstreetbets,But we’re part of a movement to stick it to the hedge funds. Too the moon! This can go up to 1000! /s
2021-06-12 11:19:09,wallstreetbets,I learned to take at least 20% profit and ride the rest.

2021-06-11 20:19:53,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Make decisions based on your personal situation.
2021-06-11 20:34:49,wallstreetbets,Technically by hyping things up together it’s both. It’s like increasing your odds of winning one particular type of casino game by encouraging other people to play it
2021-06-11 20:42:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. We're here to play, win or lose."
2021-06-12 08:58:43,wallstreetbets,Lol it used to be. This place is basically 'r/investing with more vulgar language' now.

2021-06-12 04:49:14,wallstreetbets,"I got greedy trying to sell and rebuy the dips to churn BB.

I got caught with some at 12.20 when it fell through the floor.

When I checked and it was 15.60, I snap sold. No regrets. Still made a big chunk, was playing with house money anyway, and I already missed 1 peak when I tried to greed anyway"
2021-06-12 00:37:12,wallstreetbets,As a 20 bag holder . . .
2021-06-11 21:57:56,wallstreetbets,"I sold at 20.50 feels good, thinking about getting back in. Maybe next week around 15"

2021-06-12 07:23:54,wallstreetbets,Ultimately with investing there is very rarely a time when you’re going to get a life changing amount in one fell swoop. That shit takes time.

2021-06-11 22:37:45,wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of folks who sold at 14, didn't buy back at 10, and watched it go to 70. This is not the way."
2021-06-11 22:28:36,wallstreetbets,"You're only wrong if it never comes back down.  A lot of people here truly believed it never would.  


This guy is totally right tho with all these posts and bad info, I don't know how many times I saw ""new floor"" posts on AMC and BB this last week, with stats that meant nothing presented as if they were fact.  


WTF happened to those floors guys?  Glad I sold too."
2021-06-12 03:52:13,wallstreetbets,"That is some newbie thinking bullshit, you're assuming you're lucky enough to call both top and bottom, and you have the balls to buy back in during the dip and not have pussy hands.

GTFO with your 3 months of trading experience."
2021-06-11 22:37:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah I did that with Tesla around 500 thinking I’d buy back in before it went up to 4k pre split…
2021-06-12 05:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Because actually trying to time the market is very difficult. Investing is easy, trading is hard, so if you truly believe how high these stocks will go it's easier to hold than to try and dip in and out."

2021-06-12 11:31:27,wallstreetbets,Guilty but learned my lesson

2021-06-12 07:38:12,wallstreetbets,Amen
2021-06-11 21:13:13,wallstreetbets,Maybe because what was explained is a steaming pile of bullshit? There is always that possibility.
2021-06-11 20:42:40,wallstreetbets,"I mean I don’t know shit but the stock market is all psychology anyways so it’s probably because people just don’t want to mess with a gamble. Sure you could look at the numbers and shorts. You could also look at AMC being a movie theatre company in a pandemic when streaming is at its highest currently. Also the people who do come in, might just look for a free 10-20% and get out. Either way, yolo baby."
2021-06-11 20:51:42,wallstreetbets,We all want to believe in God. But he keeps punishing the poor. That’s why you have empty churches.
2021-06-11 22:38:06,wallstreetbets,I treat every purchase as a lottery ticket. If I don’t win today leave it in there til it does. You can’t win on an old scratch off but an old stock comes around

2021-06-11 20:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Next week when it breaks $75 you’ll feel smart again. Huge bull pendant forming from this week, and they stopped suppressing for a week and we went from 15 to 70…they short attacked it hard to save face another week to shake paper hand bitches like this dude. His smart play if he thought 75 was the top was sell there, and then he coulda came back this week and basically doubled his position free at 40…but to think amc peak was $75 is foolish…it’s not over…have we’ve been watching the same market??? This is a desperate stall attempt from dying animal looking at its pending doom. They’ve got nothing left to lose Bc if they cant stop it, they’re done…so why not pour millions in and try to shake ppl like this guy? They still haven’t covered, and it seems they’ve atleast shorted the whole float at around $10-15 in April n may…margin calls will come once we hold above $75 and then we get a few sling shots"
2021-06-12 07:06:11,wallstreetbets,Fuck amc

2021-06-11 20:10:56,wallstreetbets,No. He has as many shares as Shitadel.
2021-06-12 09:56:14,wallstreetbets,A true OG would sell those shares and buy calls
2021-06-12 09:55:44,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-06-11 22:12:09,wallstreetbets,I dont believe in profits personally
2021-06-11 23:20:07,wallstreetbets,This guy is definitely talking about himself 😂
2021-06-11 22:55:42,wallstreetbets,"Haha haha haha amc closed over $49 today
Muuuhahaha it was $12 just  3 weeks ago

Your hedgefund friends are getting their throats slit open. Die slowly, painfully you paper handed maggot

2021-06-12 12:18:54,wallstreetbets,"This post is OP saying he’s relieved he took profits. He made a bunch of money by selling at 60. Right now it’s almost at 40, if he wants back in he can buy back in and make another 50% if it goes back up to 60. Anybody that held through and rode the ticker back down has just missed out on a ton of potential profit. 

If it goes from 40 to 60 five times and you just hold the entire time, you make 50%. If it goes from 40 to 60 five times and you sell near the top and buy back in near the bottom every time you make closer to 250%. I don’t care what you do with your shit, it’s your life, but OP has zero reason to need to “feel better” if he sold near the top and now the stock is way fuckin lower"
2021-06-11 20:14:02,wallstreetbets,You a chimp not an Ape 🦍 get out of our jungle.
2021-06-12 08:14:39,wallstreetbets,"lol should be a fucking penny stock on fundamentals and GME should be out of business. But they aint and here we are.

And i think you explained the entire reasoning for not holding.  You are betting your own money on people investing in the fucking stock market not being greedy.  Good luck with that."
2021-06-11 22:53:31,wallstreetbets,"And if it magically hit $100, would you be ok with people selling then? Or would you be saying “it would be $150 if they hadn’t sold?” At some point you need to realize your gains or you’ll be left as the bag holder because things like AMC and GME, as businesses, don’t justify these outrageous market caps. They won’t just magically go up forever, this guy did the right thing and realized his profits rather than sticking around to be the bag holder."
2021-06-12 09:21:33,wallstreetbets,Cry some more. I’ll take profits over some dumbass fucking movement regarding taking down hedge funds
2021-06-11 22:53:15,wallstreetbets,"I would rather sell AMC at 70 then hold out for the potential of 100. And guess what. If he does decide it will go to 100, he can buy back in and have locked in some gains."

If you hold, they've got no way of artificially lowering the price other than to ""short"" which unlike a ""long"" costs money to hold. In the case of holding, the rich shorts and paper handed sellers take only from themselves, which is a justice level stock market.

As you said: Hold on."
2021-06-12 11:05:50,wallstreetbets,I meant you.

2021-06-12 11:51:09,wallstreetbets,Depends on if you believed it was crashing for real. GME in its prime day fell from 350 to 50. Hindsight 20/20 when you want to perfectly predict the top and bottom.
2021-06-12 12:24:54,wallstreetbets,Arent options in fact more risky?
2021-06-12 15:10:53,wallstreetbets,"The only reason short interest was able to build on wkhs to highest of any stock is because so many longs have held due to it’s a great company. For months the HFS kept laying on more and more synthetic downward pressure to force people out of their positions and it drove the price down but they couldn’t get enough people to sell without reaching an astounding 50+% short interest and now it’s biting them. This company is poised to own last mile truck and drone delivery, is now rapidly ramping production, and continues to forge exciting partnerships with industry leaders like eavx. Just go read about that and how it likely ties into usps. Big potential catalysts stacked on top of powder keg short interest and it’s a solid innovative and growing company. There’s a reason the stock twits page gained thousands of new watchers just last week alone."

Are you upset that he sold or that he sold before you?


If you are upset that he sold do you intend to hold it for a century?


If you are upset that he sold before you, congrats that’s what a hypocrite looks like.


There’s a reason it’s good to say congrats and F you.  It’s what you say because you are legitimately happy that they came out positive on a trade but are upset it’s not you.


Pretending that we are all in this together is a lie.  We are strangers on the internet trying to make money.  And your hypocrisy proves that you yourself don’t believe in holding."

So you are forced to do more due dilligence, and you are also forced to take profits when you can because they expire. Stocks, you hold forever so if it dips to 50% you just wait a few months. If you bought at the peak and it never recovers, well, you are in trouble then for not doing your due dilligence. That's why this is not financial advice, as nobody can predict the market. It's better to make and take profits when you can."

Edit: Am I getting down voted because I'm wrong, or because I'm being boring and pedantic or something?

Edit 2: I had another thought about how to look at it. It stock trading was entirely a zero sum game, then there would be a fixed amount on money in the market, right? If one person winning is always proportional to another person losing, why would the entire market ever go up or down? It would just be flat.

Edit 3: I guess what I'm saying is, if it's zero-sum, then why is the sum not zero? 😅"

2021-06-12 13:46:54,wallstreetbets,Didn't know selling was part of the strategy
2021-06-11 21:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Right. So company insiders know it’s not worth what you think it is, and know you’re dumb enough to buy it from them. Thanks for confirming"
2021-06-11 21:02:11,wallstreetbets,Read the linked comment
2021-06-12 12:51:20,wallstreetbets,"Retail can't pump the price up this much, Institutions bought it up. The fact that they sold all the shares to retail after the fact is ... Irrelevant"
2021-06-12 00:17:37,wallstreetbets,"52 week low to high percentage increases by stock.  TSLA-959% AMC-3,682% GME-12,711% 🤡🤡🤡🤡"
2021-06-12 16:29:31,wallstreetbets,Stocks are not a zero sum game but options are. Stocks are not because of inflation and options are because fixed contracts.
2021-06-12 09:39:30,wallstreetbets,"It's a total waste of time, because they're *experts* on law just like they're *experts* on investing, so they're completely sure that they can't be liable for anything they say or do on the internet.  LOL!  Burn, bitches."
2021-06-12 10:21:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol uh… what’s FO and MO?

Yeah that’s been extremely frustrating the past two weeks. All the ups and downs in such a short time frame. It’s really been bad, for example, when I was up 72000% on a call and didn’t see it in time and missed selling over the span of maybe an hour of not checking. It’s still up 300%, but I can’t get myself to sell because I’m convinced it will bounce back"
2021-06-11 22:03:26,wallstreetbets,No I really mean within next few weeks it will become clear. Not trying to scare you or anything.
2021-06-12 15:04:37,wallstreetbets,Except it already fell from 70 to 44…so he already made the right choice
2021-06-11 20:34:26,wallstreetbets,It’s a blast. Given these comments.
2021-06-12 10:34:52,wallstreetbets,"Wait I don’t get it, the $100 was a fake?"
2021-06-12 02:25:37,wallstreetbets,"It's  a market's decision how much a company worth,, not insider's..."
2021-06-11 21:41:49,wallstreetbets,My pleasure. But we own over 100% of the float. So it’s worth what we say it is.
2021-06-12 12:07:45,wallstreetbets,Who cares what its actually worth? No one is playing that game
2021-06-12 07:24:39,wallstreetbets,Company insiders cant Trade during a sqeeze. That is why they have to do it now. Fuxking idiot.
2021-06-11 21:03:17,wallstreetbets,Too many words.
2021-06-12 12:58:24,wallstreetbets,"thats your assumption (and its wrong)

You’re ignoring hard numbers to go off your emotional conclusion that retail cant move money, youve seen how many millions of dollars are in some of the accounts on here, either you havent been here long or you havent been here often."
2021-06-12 09:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Well of course *you* would say that; you're a secret agent hired by the hedge funds, right?  That's what's happening...right?"
2021-06-12 18:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so GME was more than amc, but you agree both are more than TSLA? That was more my point"
2021-06-12 15:06:23,wallstreetbets,For now
2021-06-12 12:30:26,wallstreetbets,"No the joke is they bought the tie to spend the money, not for the sake of getting the tie"
2021-06-12 06:43:18,wallstreetbets,"You don't own over 100% of the float you dumb fuck 

You've been selling it to one another."
2021-06-12 08:51:04,wallstreetbets,It's worth exactly as much as a nonretard will pay for it when this is all over.
2021-06-11 21:52:24,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-06-12 07:22:58,wallstreetbets,And this mentality here is why meme stocks will win short term and why fundamentals in trading currently don't matter.
2021-06-11 22:09:17,wallstreetbets,"You own more than 100 percent of the float? Ha 
Even if you did own 100 percent (you don’t), it’s only worth what someone else is willing to buy it for. And as we’ve seen, if insiders are willing to sell, then owning the float doesn’t even help you against whatever imaginary number of shorts you claim there are."
2021-06-11 21:03:40,wallstreetbets,“You're literally getting dumped on by the founders cashing out. I don't understand the mental gymnastics of people buying calls or shares oof this company.”
2021-06-12 12:55:50,wallstreetbets,Shhhhhhh
2021-06-12 12:56:10,wallstreetbets,"“Real name, no gimmicks”"
2021-06-12 19:12:41,wallstreetbets,I totally agree that was your point.  Especially when you said “AMC did go up more than GME”.
2021-06-12 11:14:11,wallstreetbets,These clueless noobs are good for running up a price and setting up nice puts though! I decided to stop fighting them and go citadel on their asses.
2021-06-12 09:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Dude, they just don’t get it. I banged my head against that wall for too long. It was futile."
2021-06-12 06:52:05,wallstreetbets,We don’t sell.... apes buy and hold.
2021-06-11 22:07:19,wallstreetbets,They have the turd market cornered cuz they hold all the turds! Why didn't I think of that instead of flipping these turds for fat Tendies.
2021-06-11 22:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Casino! 

It’s like when you're playing blackjack and other players tell you to hit but you don't really want another card."
2021-06-11 23:37:34,wallstreetbets,You don’t understand it’s ok
2021-06-11 21:06:48,wallstreetbets,How am I getting dumped by anyone when I bought in at $12 a share.
2021-06-11 21:15:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m Welsh. We make jokes of ourselves every day of our lives. This movement isn’t a joke. If the short sellers keep on selling then we will keep on buying. This house of cards is going to fall. And just to make it sweeter. My American wife is asleep on my lap right now, and next week we will be banking her $1400 stimulus check for us to buy more shares."
2021-06-12 19:14:47,wallstreetbets,Ok lol
2021-06-12 11:27:10,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me
2021-06-11 23:46:25,wallstreetbets,Conversely when you hit and bust and the guy legitimately gets mad at you for taking his card. I hate that guy.
2021-06-11 21:07:23,wallstreetbets,"Yup, you don’t understand a joke.  Why am I surprised."
2021-06-11 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"You should make your own choices, but in my opinion, if you know a lot about the market, through actual research not through reddit, then you can choose what you think is best.  If you don’t know a lot about the market, which I suspect is the case, I would read up on investopedia, read about fundamental analysis technical analysis, options etc.  If you’re not in it for a profit, you shouldn’t be in the market, because otherwise you’re not going to do anything except for harm your own wallet— which is not good, and you’re more susceptible to people trying to mislead you.  Be especially weary of anyone who tells you not to take criticism or ever take a profit or ever listen to an opposing opinion, listening to opposing opinions is how you strengthen an investment thesis, adjust it, or abandon it all together in order to come up with the bets investment strategy.  

Sorry for the ADHD rant but I felt it had to be said."
2021-06-11 21:16:29,wallstreetbets,This isn’t a movement.  Trading is not a team sport.  Anyone here is looking out for number 1.  Be careful nobody is trying to mislead you into holding their bags for them.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Tesla is using a new 12V Lithium-ion battery in the Model S Plaid 
2021-06-11 20:43:39,wallstreetbets,"Could of bought CLOV with that money, just saying"
2021-06-11 20:07:03,wallstreetbets,Really sorry folks but I have owed two Tesla's and there where both  totally crap. I will never buy another. I now have a Jaguar  I Pace a far better car. Use your wallets wisely folkes.
2021-06-11 20:03:14,wallstreetbets,Lithium-ion battery are more prone to fires just saying.
2021-06-12 16:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Does anybody know why they can’t use a battery model?! I don’t understand the obsession with making charging faster when we could just drive through and have an automated system drop out a battery and insert a fresh one. 

Emphasis would be on speed as theoretically this could take less than a minute and would give full charge. 

The #1 complaint about electric cars is charge time and this would completely collapse that issue."
2021-06-11 22:10:46,wallstreetbets,And buy 10 Tesla’s instead or one mini yacht
2021-06-11 21:16:19,wallstreetbets,Tesla quality ain't great but its hilarious to me that you bought a Jaguar of all things to replace it.
2021-06-11 21:45:23,wallstreetbets,Jaguar and quality 🤡. Depreciating asset good choice ape 😂
2021-06-11 20:34:57,wallstreetbets,Could of bought stonks with that money....
2021-06-11 20:56:55,wallstreetbets,"that was the Plaid+, they started deliveries of the new Plaid Model S last night and it is an absolute beast."
2021-06-11 20:34:21,wallstreetbets,So are forests in Cali and Colo.... just saying.
2021-06-12 16:21:54,wallstreetbets,"It comes down to very simple economics.

Who is going to invest god knows how many billions into building and maintaining this? Locations at so many different locations, in towns, cities, villages, motorway/ freeways etc.

Where will they store all these batteries?

How will they ensure batteries are fully charged for the next person? 

Batteries deteriorate over time who will be responsible for that?"
2021-06-11 21:50:22,wallstreetbets,"0-60 in 1.99 seconds… 🤤 I want this car so bad. $135,990 for the build I want."
2021-06-12 08:40:07,wallstreetbets,"They’re built by Magna so the build quality in the I-Pace and E-Pace is excellent. Magna Steyr also builds the Mercedes-Benz G Class, the BMW 5 series, BMW Z4, and the Toyota Supra."
2021-06-12 17:56:04,wallstreetbets,The quality of Jaguars as improved massively in recent years. The one I am driving now as been perfect so far and considerably better than the Tesla it replaced. But each to there own.
2021-06-12 15:03:51,wallstreetbets,Have you actually owed a Tesla or a modern day Jaguar ? I am guessing by your comment that you have not.
2021-06-11 20:57:53,wallstreetbets,Ahhh ok gotchya
2021-06-12 16:30:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think battery swapping is a ridiculously stupid idea
2021-06-12 14:22:32,wallstreetbets,It's a rolling start.  Not quite a sub 2 second car
2021-06-12 19:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Ah, no. Lots of lemon buy backs on the I-Pace."
2021-06-12 19:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Oh good point. I’ll just go get a civic instead, then."
2021-06-12 19:39:50,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you are s lemon
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vietnamese dong? So my exwife texted me a picture stating that some customers came in her restaurant and left her a tip of 300,000 Vietnamese dong. I understand that inflation seems to be on the horizon, but why would they tell her it could spike soon. Both of them were in their 70’s and I don’t know if they are just mad bag holders or what. I know you guys will be trying to give gme shares away at 70 saying it’ll spike soon, but is there something specifically unique about the Vietnamese dong that isn’t relatively public or even known about?

I may yolo all of my money into Vietnamese dong. A guy not to far from me did the same with ornamental gourds!!

Here is some more random bullshit so the mods won’t delete for it being too short. Bee doo bee doo GME, AMC, CLOV, WKHS, SAVA, BB."
2021-06-11 20:26:08,wallstreetbets,"So your upset some guys gave your wife a bunch of dong?

My wife’s boyfriends do it all the time."
2021-06-11 20:33:14,wallstreetbets,"I know you have got a bunch of hilarious responses, I figured I would give you a real one. My lady was born and raised in Vietnam (Can Tho) and she said that those old ladies were just cheap bitches. Their currency isn’t going anywhere. Congrats on her $13 and her having to go to an exchange to get it changed out."
2021-06-11 20:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Two bouqou, me love you long time!"
2021-06-11 20:46:23,wallstreetbets,Bet they left it all in 1’s
2021-06-11 20:48:05,wallstreetbets,Get some sleep dude
2021-06-11 20:48:49,wallstreetbets,What they were trying to tell her is that inflation will cause the dong to swell in value.
2021-06-11 20:57:47,wallstreetbets,Best post today🥇
2021-06-11 22:41:46,wallstreetbets,I've had 500k dong for the last several years. I would love to see it worth something but my guess-you're better off waiting for the second coming and cashing in on golden streets and pearl gates.
2021-06-11 20:33:20,wallstreetbets,"I am a proponent of giving dong to Vietnamese, especially the cute ones. I have noticed when they sit on my lap they get a plentiful amount of dong, I think more than some can handle. 
I do believe with the proper conditions the dong will really grow and even explode 🚀🚀... so let's not ever forget about the dong it will swell and explode on the market soon...."

2021-06-11 21:17:07,wallstreetbets,Did she at least say thank you for the dong ?

2021-06-11 21:41:48,wallstreetbets,Theyll probably delete it for mentioning WKHS lol

2021-06-11 21:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Only if you’re trading in the dark pools, or engaging in some shady fuckery. In all LEGIT and LEGAL methods, the dong is either bought or sold."
2021-06-11 20:29:11,wallstreetbets,This is also racist.
2021-06-12 07:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah “everywhere” on one thread pointing out blatant racism against Asians because (1) it’s AAPI Heritage Month and (2) you privileged White devils think racism against Asians is acceptable because somehow you’ve convinced yourselves it’s okay so long as you decry the N-word and you believe your racist stereotypes for the “model minority” are not harmful (because who wouldn’t want to be called a nerd with a small penis).

I was down for a while but decided to double down the day before earnings because I was expecting them to have a beat on earnings. Some of the calls I bought were some FD $40 calls expiring in two weeks for $2.5k when the stock was around $24. Day of earnings they absolutely outperformed the expected EPS and the stock was up almost 10% but my calls were worth about half of what I paid for them ($1.5k) due to IV crush. I decided that IV had to go up eventually and I was basically getting a fat discount so I went all in and bought $15k worth of the same calls. Over the next several days the stock continued climbing up to about $33 and eventually IV went back up and I basically 10x my position and cashed out. I don’t necessarily recommend this strat tho lol, it was very risky and I got pretty lucky that IV picked back up within the two week period I had before my calls expired."

They bought the stock for $27.12 , sold them for $32.04 and then started claiming the stock is overvalued.  Why buy the stock at $27 when you think the stock is overvalued?  They probably sold calls after selling the stock and hoped that their fire dump sale would drag AMC down.   The Apes here have other ideas though with the AMC stock.   If this isn't market manipulation by a hedge fund,  I don't know what is."

Well, this person has no fucking knowledge of the matter. If the HF sold calls to hedge exposure to the stock (aka Covered Calls), then they couldn't have had a loss on the recent rally, but rather they would have simply capped their gains, which would still be enormous if the calls were in the 40s."

2021-06-11 21:02:52,wallstreetbets,I think they sold their shares cheaper but for a gain then sold naked calls and ended up losin big on those
2021-06-11 23:55:18,wallstreetbets,🤣💀🤷
2021-06-12 06:34:51,wallstreetbets,I think those were naked calls. Bout the only way I see them taking a 5% loss.

2021-06-12 00:01:28,wallstreetbets,"He probably meant, calling shares overvalued and selling calls against them."
2021-06-12 12:30:05,wallstreetbets,"It’s unrealized gains, I just like seeing the high number in my trading account."

2021-06-11 21:04:59,wallstreetbets,I wish I could manage other people’s money so I could fuck up and not care too much
2021-06-12 10:10:17,wallstreetbets,The quote I heard about it was that they didn’t stab AMC in the back as much as they shot themselves in the foot.
2021-06-12 16:43:26,wallstreetbets,"They sold the calls to hedge their shares which is the safest way to play it. What was retarded is that when they sold the shares they kept their calls open which became naked, when they could have easily just bought to close which would just eat into their gains a bit. So yeah essentially they got a bit greedy at the worst possible time. But tbf I don’t think many normal investors expected a bankrupt theater chain to go on a 200% weekly run immediately after issuing a shit load of shares lol"
2021-06-12 16:47:31,wallstreetbets,"They were covered calls, but then they flipped the shares and kept the calls open which became naked"
2021-06-11 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,Its called hedging.
2021-06-11 23:10:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming you've never heard of a straddle or strangle then?

...or even the basic concept of *hedging*?"
2021-06-11 22:51:27,wallstreetbets,Not really. Buying an atm put and call when you expect high volatility is a common strat. And if iv goes up a lot after a big move in one direction you could be up like crazy on one leg and the increased IV could make you barely lose or even break even on the other leg
2021-06-12 00:41:35,wallstreetbets,"The straddle is a real thing… you do it on a stock that could go one way over the other, then sell the leg that is proving to be wrong while capitalizing on the opposite side… it’s a wise strategy."
2021-06-12 08:29:07,wallstreetbets,Selling calls is an appropriate strategy if shares are overvalued. It’s about as much market manipulation as if someone just bought the stock and said I think it’s going higher.
2021-06-12 08:15:18,wallstreetbets,This is hilariously backwards thinking.
2021-06-12 07:23:45,wallstreetbets,Fine. I’ll have a burger with a side of popcorn please.

2021-06-11 23:17:24,wallstreetbets,Does that strategy work in reverse when IV is high?
2021-06-12 10:43:24,wallstreetbets,"it was the way they did it imo.  announced a block purchase was made, 0930 comes, stock is on a monster run, giant red candle appears, 45 mins later, its reported they sold it cuz it was overvalued(tho no one could be quoted for saying that but media ran it), after they tried to time the peak for the dump and selling their calls. stock doubled and then some the day after lol"
2021-06-12 13:09:03,wallstreetbets,They put out that press release to try to drive the stock down. Give me a break. Just because they didn’t “short” the stock doesn’t mean their intention wasn’t to manipulate the stock in their favor and they sold calls to take a bearish position after their little circus act. Some people are willing to defend wallstreet scum for zero reason.
2021-06-12 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,lol it's not about selling calls. It's about ANNOUNCING that stock is overvalued AFTER you have sold calls and dumped your shares.
2021-06-12 12:48:38,wallstreetbets,The studio. Theaters make very little on ticket sales.

2021-06-12 08:49:56,wallstreetbets,I don't believe you.
2021-06-12 01:12:32,wallstreetbets,It absolutely works the other way. I prefer strangles though (sell a 20 delta put and a 20 delta call). If the stock takes off in one direction you can always roll up the untested side to collect more premium and readjust your overall delta.
2021-06-11 23:21:02,wallstreetbets,No cause then you have capped Earnings with unlimited risk so if it moves enough away from your strike you could get fucked. I’m assuming you me sell an atm call and put as the reverse but if you meant something else lmk
2021-06-12 14:26:15,wallstreetbets,"Idk what the issue is. Should all high level investors be silent when they make an investment, or is it al just manipulation. Nobody ever seems to care when a hedge fund announces they are long a position, but when it is short (in this case via short calls), many cry about market manipulation. That might be what happened, but there are plenty of reasons to go short AMC (not that it’s wise to bet against a meme stock in the short term), and I don’t think announcing they think the stock is overvalued is gross manipulation. A conflict of interest, maybe, but they’re a fund not a news paper, so what would you expect? That’s literally what a fund is supposed to do. 

Shorting or any functional equivalent isn’t scum. It’s an important set of mechanics in a well functioning financial market. A fund providing its rationale for utilizing these mechanics on a particular security is a useful resource to be considered by other investors (to challenge/support their thesis on said security). I’ll defend that any day."
2021-06-12 17:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I get that but don’t see the problem there. How is that different than announcing that you think the stock is undervalued after buying shares. Selling stock (at a 20% gain) then calls in a company is perfectly valid if you think the company is overvalued. It’s a hedge fund. They’re not paid to be unbiased, so the ANNOUNCEMENT is valid in my view."

2021-06-12 01:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Cool. Also, if you don't mind my asking, what's the best when IV is low and you're comfy with the direction?"
2021-06-11 23:23:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's what I was meaning. Thanks."
2021-06-12 14:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree with anything you said. I just happen to think they bought the stock and immediately dumped it following up with a bearish press release in an attempt to manipulate the stock in their favor, which failed miserably. That’s scummy to me but ultimately we don’t know what their true intentions were. Just my opinion."
2021-06-12 14:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Haha that’s fair. There are certainly some scummy guys in hedge funds, so that could absolutely be the case here."

Baystreet.ca - Baystreet - Fri Jun 4, 9:09AM CDT

""Palantir’s latest investment was announced on Thursday, when Babylon Health said it would be going public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). A group of investors, including Palantir, committed to invest a combined $230 million into the Babylon transaction...

...By participating in the PIPE, or private investment in public equity, Palantir is guaranteed ownership of a certain amount of stock once the transaction closes and the shares in the operating company start trading.

While many tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have large venture groups that back start-ups at various stages, Palantir’s focus on SPACs is unique among strategic investors. It means Palantir is betting on more mature companies that are often already valued in the billions of dollars.""

The stock has been overly shorted and oversold over worries of the lockout period ending 6/14. I’ll continue to by calls based around previous highs and lows. My PT for 5/11 was $140. I’ve been comfortably trading in and out of calls since. I expect continued choppiness until the next earnings report. My PT for the year is $200. 
Listen to thee previous earnings calls and read their reports. It’s easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR TA - Fantastic Setup 7 Months In The Making ***TL;DR -*** Falling Wedge on the daily chart

Breaks out above **35.03** \- using that as support going forward

Price target: **70**

Resistances above the breakout: **40.92 --> 44.89 --> 48.28 --> 50.00 --> 52.50 --> 55.00 --> 60.00 --> 65.00**

Plays out over the course of 1-3 months so look for each of those resistances to become support

\---

Been watching this stock since it IPO'd - and this setup itself for a few months. Saw it was trending recently - so I figured I'd share what I've been seeing:

[$CRSR 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/pqbkepqmmp471.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=b92e9884b1b5539ffcbfb25c64f5eaf550eda674)

Since just after that post-IPO peak - we've just been consolidating downwards - building out an incredible falling wedge. The company is **solid fundamentally** \- so I don't see a reason why a setup like this wouldn't break to the upside. When fundamentals and technicals collide - you usually get some amazing trades.

Currently we are stuck between this **35.03 - 29.47** range. If you are one of the ones who frontran - look at **29.47** for support. If that breaks down, it's likely we retest **26.64.** This wouldn't be a bad thing at all - we want to build out volume in every price range so that we don't have to revisit them in the future - just watch out of if you are in short dated options.

That being said - this thing hasn't done much in a while - **I wouldn't frontrun here**. The entry for this setup is **on a daily close above 35.03.** From there, full speed ahead to those price targets.

I posted some conservative estimates above - with resistances to trail your stop losses to - but a setup of this magnitude could honestly go as far as **70.00.**

Really looking forward to this one. With retail finally paying attention - maybe we actually see a move next week. The wedge is getting really tight. **We either have to break out, or drop into the lower range by next month.**

The market sure seems to think that there is serious upward momentum ahead - $45 as an option tier for July 16th.

It doesn’t look good after these last two days - but next week will be very interesting. 

The stock went from closing at low $8s to closing at $10 in one week. And went up almost $7 in one day this week. 

More importantly, it broke out of the bearish channel with a bullish reversal. Momentum, volume and sentiment has never been higher. 

CLOV went from $9 to $28 in two days - that looks far more like a pump and dump in comparison. Short borrowing fees are rising and this is a dangerous area to be a bear. 

You could try to roll your options to July - but next week might surprise a lot of people."

All the money all 14 trillion came from reclassification of banks switching 14 trillion from M2 to M1.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=21&eid=1217588&od=#

Actual change in the money supply was only ~25% this year which still is a massive figure to have pumped into the economy. The actual additional money in circulation is only ~400 billion.

Mined you we have just pumped ~100 billion into the economy every year for the last 11 years which has also driven down the velocity but so far inflation hasn't actually kicked in because partially there is still more transactions occurring than there is cash but nothing is pointing to increased demand or more transactions happening. 

Actual increase in M2 is 4 trillion but the Fed has had them increase requirements on banks...

Now the decrease in velocity with increasing money supply some figure would mean inflation but so far we still haven't crossed the point of Velocity dropping below 1 to 1 ratio IE more money than what is being used in transactions.



~~O look the M1.~~

~~4 trillion and watch the FED spread a little bit of Magic and ops they spilled the entire thing. M1 is now at 18 trillion....~~


~~We went from 4 trillion to 18 trillion in the money supply in a fucking year.~~

~~everyone should have gotten an extra 40K this year from the Fed.....~~

~~https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL~~


~~now what is really fucking funny but not surprisingly the velocity of money crashed and hit 1 to 1 ratio.~~ 


https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


~~we are in uncharted territory.~~

~~So the question is were the fuck did all the money go and were is it being parked in the economy. a lower V means less demand. If V was increasing with a higher M1 you have a inflation issue. So were is the extra 14 trillion dollars at?~~"

Deflation encourages people to stick their money under the couch, and with less money being passed around, people have less money to play around with, thus wages fall, alongside prices. Straight from Wikipedia:

""inflation encourages short term consumption and can similarly over-stimulate investment in projects that may not be worthwhile in real terms (for example the housing or Dot-com bubbles), while deflation retards investment even when there is a real-world demand not being met""

Another commenter stated perfectly, that if inflation is low or zero, money just gets thrown under the mattress (saved), instead of investing. When you have 3 or 4 percent inflation, people invest their money to get a 4 or 5 percent return, so their money doesnt lose value.

That investment boosts economic growth."

Deflation is bad arguments ignore the time value of money, which is the basis of all finance!

Inflation and deflation only have an effect on the RISK of investments chosen, not the propensity to invest. This is also something you learn in the first paragraph of any finance textbook. 

Also history shows otherwise, in the 19th century there was slight deflation (because that's what growth does) and it was also the highest growth period as well as had the most investment."

Inflation in a broad based, and sustained increase in prices and wages across ALL categories. Steel is up 300% from the bottom pits of the COVID lockdowns, and still well cheaper than it was in 2018. What has been going on, is oil prices have gone way up, because production/supply got jacked up in covid. Massive and complex supply chains shut down, and take a long time to restart. A very complex issue with chips, that is causing a global supply shortage. A complex problem with lumber that caused skyrocketing prices. A frenzy of shifted demand for good over services, cause everyone was stuck at home, that also compounded a massive shipping contained and worker shortage.

Literally everything that is causing ""inflation"" are just things that will work out, as production scales back up, people get back to working, services start to compete for dollars, stimulus checks end, and so on. Real Inflation is NOT coming."

I will call Scion Capital Management on Monday.  Micheal said ""I wanted to warn people"". So I will give him the opportunity to warn me personally.

I am interested in his expiration dates for the ETFS. I see no reason why he wouldn't share that information.

You concerns are valid. The Federal Reseve and the Treasury could play this game another 5 years. However, I don't see this lasting another 6 months (before the M2 money supply becomes dysfunctional).

I will be placing a five figure trade mimicking Micheal trade thesis. Plus out of the money puts on the OEX 100 as well as a spread on the FANGS stocks. I watched the large sovereigns (Finland, Demark, and the large institutions) dump these last March 2020.

Finally, I will be ready to trade short term as the market start to swing wildly as it did in 2008, 2019, and 2020 as the algorithms go haywire with conflicting metrics.

Be prepared to go long and short with quick in and out calls/puts on stocks like; Home Depot, American Airlines, Yum Brands, and some of the major bank stocks.

We are at 34,000 in the Dow Jones and a quick move down to 15,000 will not be out of the ordinary in the next 6 months.

You do not need a lot of money. Just small bets on the momentum of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. This is going to be a quick move down. I have counted at least 20 financial analysts who say this crash will be within the next few months. But of course nobody knows the ""black swan"" event that will set this off.

Again the Federal Givernment will come in with another bail out after this next crash.

I don't have a clear picture after that move."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC price to sales is 47.8 - too high According to Reuters, the price to sales ratio of AMC is now 47.8.

The book ""What Works on Wallstreet"" analyzed 40 years of stock market data.  It determined that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  It also determined this was the most important ratio to use in valuing a stock.

I disclose I am short 120 shares of AMC, starting two days ago.

2019 their sales were 5.47 billion.  Now they are 1.24 billion

(1.24/5.47) x 47.8 = 10.84

So when things return to normal and their sales go back to normal, the price to sales would be 10.84  assuming the stock stayed flat.

This 10.84 is a high level.  This level of high price to sales is where Microsoft lives; at 12.1 currently.

As fascinating as it is that this movie theater company has been able to raise a great amount of cash through the Reddit craze, AMC is no Microsoft."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on Cleveland Cliffs(CLF) - A WSB favourite that is not just a ""meme"" stock First of all , let's take a look at steel prices. They are at record highs right now, but there is no reason to believe that they will experience a significant drop in the future, actually the opposite is more probable. The big surge in steel prices started in the middle of last year, cuz companies that work  in the automobile industry,infrastructure, manufacturing etc. managed to start operating at full capacity, way faster than most material producers( steel included). However, this trend should continue in the future, cuz demand is simply outpacing the supply due to several macroeconomic factors. We are witnessing a manufacturing and infrastructure boom in the whole world, especially in Asia where governments are spending huge money for infrastructure projects and with Biden's 3 trillion plan it seems that America is trying to catch up. Also, the largest steel manufacturer in the world China is trying everything it can to suppress steel exports ( on May 1st they removed the tax rebate on steel exports) due to the large domestic demand. Furthermore, China is trying to become a more environmentally friendly country and may be forced to close some steel plants( chinese and indian steel plants are technologically behind U.S ones and pollute way more) especially with the 2022 Olympics knocking on the door. When it comes to the U.S, the situation is not very different and it does not look like Biden will remove the tariffs on steel imports imposed by Trump any time soon. I mean we need to protect( get the votes of) the rust belt workers, right?

Another reason why steel prices might continue to surge is simply due to the consolidation in the steel industries in Europe and U.S . After CLF bought the Arcellor Mittal steel business in the U.S, the four  biggest steel manufacturers are responsible for more than 80 percent of the steel production in America. When there are less players in an industry they have more control of the price. Also, they have the ability to operate only their newest plants, which are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.  Shipping costs are also through the roof this year, so if you are an american company it is probably better to buy domestic.

&#x200B;

Why CLF is a good bet? CLF is a fully vertically integrated primary steel producer. They not only produce the steel, but they also mine the Iron Ore needed to create steel. That means that they have better margins that most competitors and with the sky-high steel prices they are literally printing money. They have a large portfolio of different steel products and even sell to other steel manufacturers. Also their plants are very high-tech ( faster production, lower cost, less emissions).  

Now let's take a look at the company's financials.  In the last quarter they reported revenue of 4 billion, compared to 359 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 513 million compared to 23 million. Yes, Covid definitely affected the performance in 2020, but even compared to 2019 the results are monstrous. CLF also has forward P/E ratio of 3.51 which is lower than the industry average and PEG ratio of 0.18 ( I have never seen a company with so low PEG) . Their debt to equity ratio is bigger than the industry average for now , but that is not  necessarily a bad thing. In finance class they teach you that if your  internal rate of return is higher than the interest rate then you are good. CLF probably bought the AM steel business at the best time and it comes as no surprise  that they plan to payback debt aggressively this year. I also think that some investors undervalue the company and do not see its true potential due to the fact that it became a vertically integrated steel producer pretty soon. The CEO-Goncalves had something to say about that in the last earnings call:  

“Q1 was just the first full quarter for Cleveland-Cliffs as a fully transformed business, and we have already accomplished a lot. This being said, and with all the operational and commercial actions we have been implementing, the best will come through during the balance of 2021.""

Mr. Goncalves added: “As the year progresses, it will become abundantly clear that the pricing environment we are in - and will continue to benefit from going forward - is not a consequence of luck. Our expectation of $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year is predicated on conservative pricing expectations relative to today’s pricing and the current forward curve. This will allow us to generate record levels of free cash flow and pay down a substantial amount of debt, allowing us to reach leverage of less than 1x by the end of the year."""

2021-06-12 16:28:45,wallstreetbets,"Some things that make $CLF CEO Lourenco C. Goncalves (aka LG) stand apart from many other CEOs and why I like him so much:

- knows his industry better than anyone on the planet

- invests his personal money in the company

- speaks openly and honestly and does not suffer fools

- had the guts to remake a 174 year old company at a risky time which turned out to be exactly the right time

- did it at an absolute bargain price

- tells the truth about China

- does not spend investor airtime on woke dogma

- seems to have NO PROBLEM finding labor while others are whining

- loves the USA and its workers and makes a point of saying it right into the camera every time he speaks...in his second language no less... when so many won't say it in their first!"

Im sure most know of NVAX its a sure bet for next week on its best vaccine about to receive approval from FDA. Also its being shorted making it a unique Rocket ship heres why: Nvax vaccine :  
\-Has proven best in class results against strains.   


\-Is stable at normal cold temperatures giving it an edge distribution wise against pfizer and modernas that require ultra cold, making it the best option to reach the 90% of world population still not vaccinated. (third World and country areas in first world)   


\-It can be used as a booster for second shot on pfizer and modernas vaccine.   


\-Its adjuvant tech has been proven to boost even other vaccine diseases making it profitable outside covid mkt.   


\-Modernas vaccine is under suspicion of causing heart problems like Miocarditis on 16-24 population

\-Has already setup colaboration agreements with experienced vaccine makers all over the world including glaxosmithkline   


\- Its still in the small mid cap range so it will grow share value pretty quick.  


\-It recently added key experienced players in the industry including a guy from the cdc   


Huge upside plus a chance to vaccinate the shorters in the ass foreva  . Next huge catalyst coming up as soon as next week when results from us trials are announced .   


Can anyone read the charts i found in SHORTSIGHT website that i uploaded here ?   


I hope this will help some of you out there load up on this rocket cause its going to go round all the f moons in this milky way and the next ... Cheers amigos"

I post shitty memes and argue with visual bot for removing them as if they’re actually not shitty or something. And I never follow WSB for my picks because I’ve been around long enough to know “inverse WSB” is the most successful strategy on this board with the exception of DFV. 


With that said, I’ve been in the former dumpster fire, formally known as Gee Hache IV for months. Watching a decent amount of my portfolio slowly burn as I lost even more money on retarded FDs. I’m currently typing this from a cardboard box behind a Starbucks. The employees trade me coffee and WiFi for handy J’s on their breaks. 

When I first bought UWMC I thought $23 would be fair market value based on absolutely no DD at all. But between the SPAC FUD from the SEC, inflation fears and massive sell offs UWMC took a beating worse than my wife gets from her boyfriend during intercourse. 

Mat Ishbia, the cocaine bro, has shown Wall Street the way. He said inclusion is coming and it came, he said he’s sharing profits and he has. Shorts will be forced to cover as the $300 million buyback and Russel inclusion will absolutely crush them if they don’t.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"LRCX is the semiconductor play for 2021-2022 **tl;dr:** LRCX will benefit tremendously from the US push to produce semiconductors. Buy shares and LEAPS. 

**Position:** 103x LRCX shares with DRIP (dividend reinvestment) and 1x 1/2023 $500c.

**The DD:** 

* The push within the US to produce semiconductors (microchips) inside American borders has encouraged companies like INTC, TSMC, and Samsung to commit to building multi-million dollar fab plants (semiconductor factories). 
* The semiconductor shortage in general indicates there is demand for more semis.
* The 5G and IoT rollouts means semiconductor demand will remain high and manufactories are likely to expand further.

LRCX is well-positioned to make money off this. LRCX builds the machines and does the research that these other companies need to make microchips. Without LRCX, there are no manufactories. And after the fab plants are built, the machines need maintenance. LRCX provides this maintenance at 30%+ margins.

**Fundamentals:**

&#x200B;

[Beats Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/t67m821yap471.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=37ee8d9b94a3a0f5bfcb12d1fb6317bb5747c0fa)

LRCX has beat earnings 4/4 of the last quarters. It has the growth potential to continue beating earnings.

At a 27 P/E ratio, its valuation is average in its industry and has room to climb.

**Technicals:** 

&#x200B;

[Up and to the right](https://preview.redd.it/xwr8epatap471.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc38dae385b63dcd764d4509061508a2cf9206ed)

LRCX goes up and to the right. It has the fundamental backing to continue. Demand for shares increases as the stock gets down to $600.

&#x200B;

[RSI, MACD, Moving Averages](https://preview.redd.it/85xb9jk9bp471.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=e471b714290c3175f09ac20a21b391f4e2ea7b88)

MACD looks like shit, but RSI is positive and LRCX travels along its 50-DMA pretty well. Look to start DCAing into shares around this level and buy more shares or LEAPS as we approach $600.

**Competition:**

AMAT competes with LRCX in most industry segments. However LRCX stands out as the best wafer developer. If you cannot afford LRCX at $600, AMAT is $136. AMAT is also more diversified and is a good alternative choice.

There are some others including a Dutch company, but AMAT and LRCX are the main competitors in this industry, and they both have a wide moat."

2021-06-12 01:26:19,wallstreetbets,"seems like wrong ppl have money. Looks like he is rich but tries to become poor😂

Its actually quite easy to make money when you have so much capital but this guy is either greedy stupid or he is so rich that he just plays here as he would in a casino."

2021-06-11 21:12:06,wallstreetbets,"What is the reasoning behind this? Honestly. As someone who just sold their entire $135k position in GME before earnings, I don’t see any upside to it so I’m curious what you’re hoping for?"

2021-06-11 20:02:26,wallstreetbets,"There's a market and there are market makers for options. There's 3,671 in open interest. I also have 70 more in my other account ... so 210 calls ... so I own about 5.8% of the Nov 800s."
2021-06-11 22:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Huh? Do you know how options work. If IV goes up, and the price increases he’ll likely make money, even if they are still way OTM"
2021-06-11 22:12:34,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Earnings have literally nothing to do with this. 
GMEs price has literally nothing to do with fundamentals. Good or bad earnings don’t have anything to do with the price. Just look at their last earnings call."
2021-06-12 01:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Iam actually trying to get to 10k to pay back my student loan😅

Iam happy for you but it makes me frustrated when i sometimes see ppl like that. You could make money in a more safely way, no need to risk everything on the table. 

One question because iam new to option. You bought calls for 800$ (~600€) right? Lets say the stock is at 230$(200€) right now, will you be selling when its at around 300$(250€). In other words, as of i understand options, you would make a big profit at that point aswell right? You wouldnt need to wait for 600$!?"
2021-06-11 20:12:22,wallstreetbets,Do you genuinely hate money ?
2021-06-11 23:30:09,wallstreetbets,How much organic ornamental gourds are we talking about here?

2021-06-12 09:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Love that 91 contracts sweep at $50 before earnings. Anyways next 2 weeks should be exciting with T+21 FTDs, Russell 1000, $1.2b cash raise, E3 news."
2021-06-11 20:54:57,wallstreetbets,Was it worth it? 🤔
2021-06-12 01:36:39,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry needs an anime redemption arc ASAP. Or a training montage. Or a secret technique. Or something.

This is an underdog story without any payoff it seems"
2021-06-11 22:17:09,wallstreetbets,"I have much to learn about options, no doubt. I understand that the calls will go up to IV spike, and that strikes along the entire chain can increase, but at the end of the day, doesn't there have to be someone willing to buy what you're selling? How liquid is the 800 strike? Wouldn't they be difficult to unload?"
2021-06-11 23:35:41,wallstreetbets,"He could try to sell em when they go up, but he's still gonna need someone to buy em. You do know just because you press that sell button it doesn't mean they are sold."

2021-06-11 23:02:36,wallstreetbets,There was 147 vol today soooooo
2021-06-12 00:03:55,wallstreetbets,Do you know what a market maker is?
2021-06-11 23:46:14,wallstreetbets,But there is volume on the 800cs. That’s just what the market is doing. You may not understand why. But way OTM GME calls have a market and have had that market for months. That’s just the way it is. And volume for them has only increase as volitility increases. I have a theory as to why but that’s beside the point. The  point is just that the market has shown us there are buyers. He’s not gonna have an issue selling them.
2021-06-11 23:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Right and the past 5 months has shown us there is a market for way OtM GME calls. So point stands. It’s volatility play. As long as IV shoots up, price will shoot up, as will options volume (which already has enough volume for him not to be worried about finding a buyer)."
2021-06-11 20:27:44,wallstreetbets,Love this philosophy. Would be horrible to find out one day that it doesn’t love you back
2021-06-12 01:43:46,wallstreetbets,My April $800 GME calls did not swipe right that’s for sure.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,LOSS update to my AMC YOLO posted yesterday! Smooth brain like myself can’t figure out how to comment the picture and people keep messaging me/commenting on last post. 
2021-06-11 21:17:13,wallstreetbets,"AMC started its upward trend today, Tuesday shorts get reported to the SEC, betting they try to get out Monday."

2021-06-12 12:41:19,wallstreetbets,Buy the stock bro. If you buying call options make sure they are at least 2-3 months out
2021-06-11 21:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Don't keep us in suspense, how did the calls turn out?"
2021-06-12 10:36:52,wallstreetbets,You don’t understand options very well do you
2021-06-12 11:18:46,wallstreetbets,Yea which was my entire account and as you see my account is at 110k now. I didn’t screenshot all the options just this one because it was one I added to but I did buy more and sell them throughout the day. At the end of the day half prob expired OTM but yea you’re right I had 120k in.
2021-06-11 20:25:05,wallstreetbets,My wife’s boyfriend? I am all the other apes wife’s boyfriends😜
2021-06-12 14:40:06,wallstreetbets,"2-3 months out is to far out you think? Premiums are so high and I keep seeing people getting crushed with far out options. Only way I made money was buying like max 2 weeks out but usually same week. Was able to 20x my account during this last run up. Gave back like 75% of it though in the last 2 weeks. Hopefully this is the turning point since it just broke upwards out of the descending triangle on the hourly from 6/2-6/11..

But yea I dropped like half my account on stocks yesterday and the rest on options"
2021-06-11 22:36:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure it expired worthless when the expiration date ended, which was about 6 hour and 36 minutes ago."
2021-06-12 10:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol no i dont obviously, missed the date haha"
2021-06-12 11:32:11,wallstreetbets,Damn man thats devastating yolo. If it makes you feel better I bought amc at 11 and at 19 then sold at 5 lol had 2900 shares
2021-06-12 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,"I did what you just said but in GME lol got in at like 350 and sold at 100. 

If you didn’t buy back in at $70+ and sell at less than $40 you are doing it wrong. Hope you follow the ways of a true retard like myself lol"

2021-06-12 18:05:34,wallstreetbets,No solid DD aka you didn’t read any DD. This is by far a better stock than GME and AMC right now.
2021-06-12 18:04:52,wallstreetbets,You’re pathetic
2021-06-12 02:49:18,wallstreetbets,there is a separate agenda for each stonk
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Steel and metals Just wanted to give people in here a heads up. I work with alot of manufacturers and lead times are started to get insane because supply of all metals are hard to get. Talking with one of the largest manufacturer in my area they said they and many others are going to start placing orders for bulk 1-2 years in advance. What would typically be 1-2weeks at a time. This is not a local problem as I have heard similar stories with my colleagues in different regions. I'm expecting Steel and other metals and manufacturing in general are going to rocket over the summer probably into the new year. Do with this information what you will and good luck at the casino.
2021-06-12 00:13:25,wallstreetbets,So whats a good option play on CLF bout to jump in
2021-06-12 16:03:05,wallstreetbets,"Steel Gang finally getting some love. Obviously CLF here on WSB but STLD, NUE, X, MT and TX are all solid plays"
2021-06-11 20:37:14,wallstreetbets,CNIKF ( Canada Nickel Co ) gunna be supplying lots for EV and Stainless industry once they get fired up!
2021-06-12 13:01:28,wallstreetbets,Can confirm.  The manufacturing company I intern at just re did their cost structure to compensate for the increased price of steel.
2021-06-11 22:14:09,wallstreetbets,"PICK (base metals ETF, even pays a small dividend)"
2021-06-11 22:17:19,wallstreetbets,Vale
2021-06-11 20:00:05,wallstreetbets,"That's not so unusual. Supply chain interruptions/issues don't hit everywhere at once, unless things are grinding to a halt like they were mid lockdown. I don't fully expect to see price hikes outside of that until some bigger infrastructure projects get started here. The US alone is spending about 1 trillion (for now), but it's still getting approved."
2021-06-11 20:29:35,wallstreetbets,"MT is vertically integrated, global, and I have a few Sept. $40c that I really need to start seeing some green, so yes please!!"

2021-06-11 21:03:18,wallstreetbets,"Dude you should Google their CEO read the story about how he bought up shares and took over. He also HATES shorts and has basically said he will buyback shares if they continue screwing his company! He gives us a lot of confidence. There is some serious DD on the steel companies and they have been making money since Jan. Look at the charts of CLF, MT, NUE. There is a whole Reddit dedicated to steel!! Don’t miss out. My plays are leaps on MT, CLF, I’m buying leaps on TX next. Good luck. Hope you make the right decision"

2021-06-11 22:59:34,wallstreetbets,When people hear me screaming “Go Cleveland Cliffs!!!” they probably think I’m watching sports. This is a pretty fun sport though and good odds on the bets most of the time.
2021-06-11 20:25:29,wallstreetbets,I believe SNDL is being ignored on WSB.  SNDL is gonna moon soon and you're all gonna miss it.

2021-06-11 20:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Maybe it's hopium talking, but I think that's already been absorbed and priced in with the dump on Thursday. A push early next week is going to blow this thing up."

2021-06-11 20:37:56,wallstreetbets,"It’s a mixed bag depending on how the next shareholder meeting on June 23 goes. Blackberry is a definite long term game, success might not be evident till 2022-2023 depending on the Q1 report which they’ll release June 24"
2021-06-12 19:56:02,wallstreetbets,Looking at $32 on the next big move
2021-06-11 23:30:38,wallstreetbets,"We're way too overbought, due for selling pressure soon"
2021-06-11 22:12:59,wallstreetbets,6/18?
2021-06-11 21:21:02,wallstreetbets,It’s being shorted. I think any covering could start a massive rally next week. If apes got their shit together and dumped the Chamath scam company this could be the easiest play of their lives.
2021-06-11 20:04:01,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-12 01:46:34,wallstreetbets,Oh u have small COK I c
2021-06-11 22:26:47,wallstreetbets,I have a tiny cock but what matters is find tight pussies.
2021-06-11 22:42:47,wallstreetbets,"6/18. I suppose I'm not going to cry if they get called away at 11, but I feel like this company has more to run."
2021-06-11 21:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Relying on fickle apes isn't the best premise, but a big push on Monday and I can see them jumping on the bandwagon after it's already up a bunch."
2021-06-11 22:49:08,wallstreetbets,NGL. My 7/16 calls are hoping we fly by the $11 mark next week.
2021-06-11 22:52:37,wallstreetbets,"It's coo; if it does, I hope it moons to 20 rather than piddle at 11.2."
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Finally went balls to the wall and went all in. Feeling rich today but might be fully retarded by tomorrow. $SENS 
2021-06-11 21:57:25,wallstreetbets,What’s funny and shows the MODS stupidity is that I posted solid DD and my position on this WSB page back a couple months ago. Which they deleted and threatened to kick me out if I did it again. Glad to see you in it and doing well though! I’m sitting on 10k shares @ $0.88 each. See you on the moon here soon!
2021-06-11 22:16:40,wallstreetbets,"My average cost is $5.29

Look at the charts then come feel bad for me"
2021-06-12 05:27:19,wallstreetbets,To the moooon fellas!! 🚀🚀🌙
2021-06-12 17:36:40,wallstreetbets,Nice! I YOLO’d too… but I’m poor and it didn’t meet the $25k threshold to post. But I’m in big!
2021-06-11 21:54:23,wallstreetbets,The PROMISE study that just released on it showing the accuracy was a small look into how amazing this tech is and will be compared to what’s out there in the market space. FDA unanimously approved the 90 day sensor. It’s honestly just been delayed due to COVID and fast tracking anything related to COVID. Which has put approval on the back burner. Glad you’re with us. I’m in for 10k shares @ $0.88 each. See you on the moon!
2021-06-12 15:43:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you for doing so! Yours was probably one of the posts that encouraged me to keep an eye on the stock to begin with
2021-06-12 15:42:55,wallstreetbets,I was in the same boat til yesterday then pulled the yolo. Lots of people think it's got a potential $10 target and more room to run
2021-06-11 22:35:07,wallstreetbets,"4.90$ here, my friend, and now I’m worried that I’m going to lose them on the 8$ calls I sold for 7/16 🤣"
2021-06-11 22:23:29,wallstreetbets,"That’s the problem it actually is a good long term investment but that’s not what WSB is about and as the dumbass I am I just don’t know if it has any potential to do anything crazy short term. 

Tying up all your money in it is probably not bad for the retirement plan but then you may as well leave this group because all your money will be in sens for 5 + years while you watch retards posting +86% days in your fuckin face all the damn time. 

I mean my money that isn’t in retarded shit is in KO or O and KO is up 11% in the last 3 months so that’s blowing my expectations out of the water anyway. All it really means is I’m paying more for my permanent stash of coke than if it was in the dumps but whatever I’m waaaaaay too retarded to do any better than that"
2021-06-11 22:08:28,wallstreetbets,"They burned a lot of money because of COVID also due to diverted attention to covid only since to get the implant you need to see a doctor first. Ascensia Diabetes Care has also partnered with them and are really optimistic on the new 180 product I myself cant wait for the 180. This is the only longterm CGM that is FDA approved(90 day) now its 180 days and they have 2 more products in the pipeline. Just really nothing negative to say. The shorts were just to plan a takeover since this is a big flag for crazy growth.

All other CGMs arent long term and yes they are cheaper and some dont require healthcare but thats why this one is so good. Its exteremely accurate (its your health at play) AND the only long term one available. Its literally the Mercedes Benz of CGMs"
2021-06-11 20:48:28,wallstreetbets,Welcome... just know we don't throw fuck you out there all willy-nilly.... that's reserved for gain porn.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Some WKHS technicals from a dummy Some things to note from the weekly and daily WKHS charts, weekly first:

&#x200B;

[Weekly](https://preview.redd.it/5gokptlx0p471.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7be713d54e2f303b506c7cd6a371c1b08ed7f6)

* Good volume the previous two weeks

&#x200B;

* This is the second week in a row WKHS will close above the 10MA — hasn't been above since back in February.

&#x200B;

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/4wujed831p471.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbb195dd1c286f91007d3e8f6eabefafb711988b)

&#x200B;

* On the daily,  price now above  curling upward 50-65 SMA cloud and curling upward 20-23 EMA cloud.

&#x200B;

* Resting below a massive volume shelf which is acting as resistance. Needs big buying volume to push above — once above it may act as support.

&#x200B;

* Price is battling between Anchored VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) from year-to-date high on 2/4 **and** from the huge volume day on 6/3. Look below at how on 6/11 price *perfectly* tagged AVWAP from the YTD high, always cool when that happens. Watch for either a big volume push above this area or price being rejected here.

&#x200B;

[Close up of AVWAPs from 2\/4 and 6\/3](https://preview.redd.it/irw30m471p471.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f23f4b71d7ccc934ca832e1b4696e610e7f122)

&#x200B;

* As always, remember I don't know what I'm talking about and you're all kings/queens in charge of your own castle."

2021-06-11 23:18:47,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I lay in bed and wonder if they made any money off the 6 trucks they sold.
2021-06-12 00:18:59,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t matter this is a casino
2021-06-12 05:12:04,wallstreetbets,Sometimes there are companies not making any money for decades before they finally pop off. Its a gamble.
2021-06-11 23:21:37,wallstreetbets,"The new wsb. Where if it’s not short interest there’s no logic behind it. 

Jesus dude read his fucking post, he wrote out his technical analysis."
2021-06-12 00:35:13,wallstreetbets,There are legit pump and dumb schemes which actually break the rules and don't get removed with others posts lying about stats and don't get removed. I just saw a wkhs post which did not violate the rules in anyway and provided evidence for its info get removed
2021-06-12 00:14:21,wallstreetbets,"I read the post. It’s talking about the moving avg, it’s higher than it or trending towards it depending on the time frame. Also says if lots of people buy it it will go up. Crazy analysis bud."
2021-06-12 00:18:24,wallstreetbets,You don’t know what technical analysis is. Got it. Carry on
2021-06-12 00:22:00,wallstreetbets,More so saying this isn’t much to go off for a stock that is getting attention on wsb… I agree though short interest isn’t anything either. Technicals aren’t super helpful once it enters the pump attention of wsb. It’s something for any other stocks ie something more stable/no current attn from wsb like F or GE.
2021-06-12 01:00:42,wallstreetbets,"You confuse me. He posted technical analysis. You don’t have to think it’s relevant (I don’t either), but you asked what the logic behind it was (it’s technical analysis so there isn’t logic involved) and suggested shorts. Then acknowledge there’s likely no logic behind meme stocks. Just all over the place here."
2021-06-11 20:09:19,wallstreetbets,You are just exposing yourself even more. Go look at my posts. All I talk about is a nice long move forming on the WKHS weekly chart and how WSB is bought and paid for. $100s of millions just funneled into WKHS. It’s not the money from our WKHS reddit. So who is it and why can’t WKHS be hyped up on WSB?
2021-06-11 20:10:40,wallstreetbets,"You see, there it is, “how WSB is bought and paid for.”  Hearing that makes it so I don’t have to do research on anything else you say because you clearly don’t know much of anything."
2021-06-11 20:13:54,wallstreetbets,CNBC loves talking about your page. Must be for a reason.
2021-06-11 20:14:26,wallstreetbets,Because Jim Cramer is a clout chaser
2021-06-11 20:26:26,wallstreetbets,They help move your trades
2021-06-11 20:29:37,wallstreetbets,🤡
2021-06-11 21:01:23,wallstreetbets,You shame people who expose you. Sounds like another country I’ve heard of.
2021-06-11 21:02:45,wallstreetbets,"1) you know absolutely nothing about me and you’ve proved that

2) read the flair retard"
2021-06-11 21:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Wallstreet figured out how to make money of you guys, deal with it."
2021-06-11 21:17:51,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, you don’t know the first thing about me"
2021-06-12 01:22:16,wallstreetbets,I know that reddit flair seems a lot like a social credit system and you enforce it.
2021-06-12 08:59:46,wallstreetbets,"Why don’t you do something actually useful with your time and learn to be able to solve something like this.  [textbook](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~liweiyu/documents/Algebra,%20Second%20Edition,%20Michael%20Artin.pdf).  Should probably read Halmos naive set theory first or a book on set theory imo.  Makes it easier.  You can didn’t a PDF of that one online.

Let V be a Euclidean space of dimension n, and let S = (v_i, ..., v_k) be a set of vectors in V. A positive combination of S is a linear combination p_1v_1+...+p_kv_k in which all coefficients p_i, are positive. The subspace U = {v|<v,w>=0} of V of vectors orthogonal to a vector w is called a hyperplane. A hyperplane divides the space V into two half spaces {v|<v,w> >= 0} and {v| <v,w>  <=0}.
Prove that the following conditions are equivalent:    
(i) S is not contained in a half space.    
(ii) Every vector in V is a positive combination of S.     
(iii) S spans V and 0 is a positive combination of S."
2021-06-12 09:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Is that useful? I thought trading was all about mindset, a set of rules, and discipline. You give away your gameplan on a public forum. Sounds like your on-tract to beat wallstreet, genius."
2021-06-12 09:39:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, this is algebra not really trading.  While it may have applications to trading I’m much more interested in pure mathematics than in financial mathematics, but don’t know much about the former."
2021-06-12 09:43:22,wallstreetbets,Go become an engineer. We don’t give a shit.
2021-06-12 09:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Nah, fuck that.  I am very much not a fan of applied mathematics."

2021-06-12 07:57:30,wallstreetbets,Get piss at HF for pushing AMC down.. your option on AMC should be good
2021-06-12 00:05:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC thinking it was going move similar to GME

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
2021-06-12 05:55:44,wallstreetbets,"$100 possible? With a 500 million float that would imply a 50 billion market cap... that would mean AMC to be worth more than:

Ebay

Dupont

Electronic Arts

7-11

H&M

Deutsche Bank

Or worth 50x Wendy's

Apes really have shit for brains

&#x200B;

Edit: lol I see you have $145 calls. At 145 AMC would be worth more than:

Heineken, Activision Blizzard, Ford, Adidas. Good luck with that"
2021-06-12 06:36:39,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks 👍
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Gme yolo update. Gains from gme swings all year. —->

2021-06-11 23:39:19,wallstreetbets,When your buying power is normal people’s portfolio
2021-06-11 23:59:37,wallstreetbets,This is life changing money. I’m probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but Please don’t take anymore high risks. You can literally never have to work again with a simple 10% rate of return every year from now on
2021-06-11 20:45:35,wallstreetbets,Lotta trust to have robbinghood hold that much GME after everything they pulled.

2021-06-12 00:54:51,wallstreetbets,What's your exit strategy for these?
2021-06-12 01:31:10,wallstreetbets,It's rewarding to have patience and hold!!

2021-06-12 11:13:43,wallstreetbets,I'll bet an account transfer would cause RH a TON of pain. You should do it.
2021-06-12 13:03:33,wallstreetbets,This guy made my salary in one day 🤣🤣🥲🥲🙄🙄
2021-06-12 14:34:14,wallstreetbets,Take my girlfriend pls
2021-06-12 15:22:30,wallstreetbets,What trades did you make with your first 1k?  And what has your biggest leap up and down been so far?
2021-06-12 15:27:49,wallstreetbets,Your account makes me hungry for crayons. What was your entry price.
2021-06-12 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,467 buying power and you didn’t buy moerr???
2021-06-12 17:12:25,wallstreetbets,You should've spent $47 of your buying power before taking these screenshots
2021-06-12 18:29:52,wallstreetbets,Sir...this is a casino
2021-06-12 18:48:16,wallstreetbets,"That’s sexy. Congrats! 

Your return for one day is literally what I need to pay off my medical debt. 😂"

Now I pull an extra cover over myself because I'm so cold."

2021-06-11 22:24:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but he doesn't know how to sell. He can't move it."
2021-06-11 21:24:52,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, that takes much bigger balls than holding GME"
2021-06-12 02:05:04,wallstreetbets,Is there also a race to $0M?
2021-06-12 02:06:04,wallstreetbets,"I love you all so much.

Did I say love? I meant hate."
2021-06-12 17:20:52,wallstreetbets,How long did it take to get to that? Any advice that isn’t just telling me how to?
2021-06-11 22:57:58,wallstreetbets,"This guy fucks!

Congrats!"
2021-06-12 09:04:12,wallstreetbets,"What’s wrong with having $1M USD on RH or CashApp? I don’t use either, I use TD Ameritrade after that shit RH pulled with meme stocks earlier this year."
2021-06-11 23:44:31,wallstreetbets,His .40% gain is 2x more than my net total rn.. about to strap on my retard hat and make some moves 😂😂💎🙏🏽
2021-06-11 21:52:54,wallstreetbets,Knock another zero off that genius.

2021-06-11 21:48:07,wallstreetbets,Still is brah. Don’t knock yourself. I was once there.

2021-06-12 11:32:33,wallstreetbets,So far
2021-06-12 09:36:12,wallstreetbets,he has to pay taxes tho
2021-06-11 21:47:42,wallstreetbets,Fk it. I’ll risk it and try getting some from the hood for you boys
2021-06-11 23:27:08,wallstreetbets,I would watch a documentary about this.
2021-06-12 12:03:35,wallstreetbets,"Learn! Everybody shits on going to school and college but it teaches you that you can learn anything if you put effort into it. Put in the work, start small or by paper trading, and be willing to ask questions."
2021-06-12 11:18:39,wallstreetbets,🙂a gain is a gain
2021-06-11 21:42:46,wallstreetbets,Yesterday

2021-06-11 22:48:03,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir
2021-06-12 12:04:18,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure OP’s exit strategy is “Make mo’ money!”
2021-06-12 09:44:13,wallstreetbets,Indeed
2021-06-12 11:07:34,wallstreetbets,Ayyyyy he legit delivered in Reddit coins. Close enough. Placing my order of 1 dollar of gme for Monday.
2021-06-12 09:30:18,wallstreetbets,"he's been swing trading it, that means selling high and buying low multiple times while the rest of you hold through 10,000 and back to nothing"
2021-06-12 02:32:05,wallstreetbets,Yes. You're already here
2021-06-11 21:55:49,wallstreetbets,Let’s gooo!
2021-06-12 11:56:28,wallstreetbets,I’m assuming it’s the risk they’re commenting on (CashApp is not FDIC insured). They lose your $$ and you’re up schitt’s creek.
2021-06-11 22:08:13,wallstreetbets,Picture 4/4 shows ~$20K is the invested amount…
2021-06-12 17:22:21,wallstreetbets,The “ALL” gains show a difference of... oh well nvm I’m a retard 😂 thanks lol
2021-06-11 23:43:43,wallstreetbets,How?? You got in back in January?
2021-06-11 20:34:37,wallstreetbets,Mathias or messiah?
2021-06-12 12:00:22,wallstreetbets,Everyone does! But with that much money and a semi-decent rate of return you can cover the taxes and not work…but you can’t ball like a rap star and buy your friends lambos. So I vote for OP to both keep doing what he’s doing with the hope that he’ll like my comment and buy me a lambo one day lol
2021-06-12 19:05:38,wallstreetbets,Netflix stock would go nuclear if they made a documentary series on the shenanigans of Wall Street Bets. Lol
2021-06-11 21:57:26,wallstreetbets,No doubt bro. I fucked up on my GME play and missed out on over $400k gains by selling my calls way too soon. Trying to make it back up now but obviously at a much slower pace.
2021-06-12 11:18:06,wallstreetbets,God speed my friend
2021-06-11 20:58:52,wallstreetbets,Damn you sensitive too?
2021-06-12 16:20:48,wallstreetbets,Selling high and buying low? What kind of retarded strategy is this.
2021-06-12 13:35:05,wallstreetbets,"What’s the prize? 

Winner picks a charity of their choice and everyone donates what they want to the charity?"
2021-06-12 13:13:37,wallstreetbets,"So would this mean one should have multiple checking accounts so you can store $250,000 in each?"
2021-06-11 22:27:44,wallstreetbets,I belong here.
2021-06-12 13:33:09,wallstreetbets,Numbers r whacky. Post history. 50k—>3k to now

2021-06-12 13:23:31,wallstreetbets,My goal is to ball like a rap star. So I can buy my friends lambos. The marathon continues!
2021-06-12 19:20:49,wallstreetbets,Absolutely needs to be a tv show. Like 'Silicon Valley' but for a small fund run by degenerate assholes instead of a tech startup
2021-06-12 01:04:13,wallstreetbets,You just bad at math or is it reading comprehension issues? I agree with you. That 6% gain from 19k to 1.1m is some boomer shit.
2021-06-11 20:37:07,wallstreetbets,You just got knocked the fuck out!
2021-06-11 21:23:41,wallstreetbets,and eva

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,A retard’s first lesson in TAKE YOUR FUCKING GAINS. 
2021-06-11 20:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Pigs get slaughtered, bro"
2021-06-11 20:25:36,wallstreetbets,Just sell at the top lmao
2021-06-11 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,"""You either leave some on the table or sell for a loss"". Your call."
2021-06-11 20:31:31,wallstreetbets,Oof. That's a rough first lesson.
2021-06-11 20:35:24,wallstreetbets,"Respectfully, those are just kinda mad plays… 🤔"
2021-06-11 20:43:36,wallstreetbets,Good enough to screenshot good enough to take profits
2021-06-11 20:58:50,wallstreetbets,"I lost 18k from my high 2.5 days ago, for same reason trying to push my 400% option gains further -_-"
2021-06-11 21:16:24,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck are all these bots coming from?
2021-06-11 21:19:56,wallstreetbets,Suddenly my 40% return on my 1 share of AMC seems like a boss move.
2021-06-11 22:55:48,wallstreetbets,That's how every good loss porn begins.
2021-06-11 20:27:11,wallstreetbets,Really is the hardest part. Greed is a mother fucker.
2021-06-11 21:50:23,wallstreetbets,Hold the line you pansie
2021-06-11 22:30:24,wallstreetbets,Looool that's not first lesson my guy 🤭

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A visual explanation to short squeezes The year of 2021 will be one filled with market anomalies, but the one that took the market by surprise was the Gamestop short squeeze that was driven by a rally to take on short sellers from the WallStreetBets subreddit. Although short squeezes may seem simple, they are a bit complex when you *look under the hood.* This publication is meant to graphically show how short squeezes happen as well providing the mechanics on why they occur.

**The mechanics behind longs and shorts**

To understand short squeezes we have to understand the mechanics of *longs* and *shorts.* Most investors usually invest using by *going long* on a stock. This is when an investor purchases the stock and then hopefully sells it a higher price in the future. A *short seller* is when an individual wants to bet against a stock hoping that it falls. But instead of selling the stock at a higher price for a profit, they want to *buy the stock back* at a lower price, we’ll get more into the short positions if this seems confusing now.

Short sellers have all sort of motives, some short sellers are actively trying to take down companies (see activist [short sellers](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/articles/how-activist-short-sellers-police-financial-markets#:~:text=Activist%20short%20sellers%20are%20a,corporate%20frauds%20or%20financial%20misstatements.)), some do it because they think the stock is overvalued, and others may do it to hedge out their portfolio (see [long short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp#:~:text=Long%2Dshort%20equity%20is%20an%20investment%20strategy%20that%20seeks%20to,%2Dvalued%20and%20over%2Dvalued.) strategy).

We won’t dive too deep on longs and shorts but below covers the relevant material to understand them. Here is a *simple* process for entering longs and shorts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/flhcbdv51p471.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b1a38557bb176decff9dca745e2118f3cbe623

To reiterate the most important part of these positions are

https://preview.redd.it/siavo5961p471.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f447c0639e8693a0f9e4ba887a0b76327470718

We can see that an investor that goes long has to **buy** to get into the position, and **sell,** to get out of the position. And a short seller has to **sell** to get into a position and **buy** to get out. (The technical terms for the short seller are **selling short,** and **buying to cover**).

**Price Discovery Analysis**

To analyze a stock’s price we will use the price discovery method. We’ll start with a standard supply and demand curve for modeling stock prices. Although this explanation works in theory and the mechanics behind this model are applicable in real life, it is technically impossible to know the future movement of supply and demand curves. To do so would require one to know all of current and potential investors’ future decisions, which are hard to predict.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p2a50m371p471.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de58d6059ff1b46277d814224cbdae8f6538fe1

In this simple representation where supply stays constant, an increase in demand leads to a higher price and a decrease in demand leads to a lower price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9zviv8r71p471.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=6832c9ff03e755ef89c5c94028f8a31dbcd3ef2e

Even though keeping supply constant is **not technically accurate,** it provides for a better visual explanation later\*\*.\*\* In general, changes in supply would mean that there are less or more sellers in the market.

**Orderbook analysis**

To analyze movements in the stock we will examine the *orderbook*, which displays the type of order and the quantity of orders for a certain price. It shows how prices change with incoming bids and asks. The *bids* are the orders to buy the stock and the and the *asks* are the orders to sell the stock. In stock trading there is usually a slight difference between bids and asks (the *spread*), we can see that the spread between the highest bid ($125.82) and the lowest ask ($126.80). A *transaction* doesn’t occur until bid and ask agree upon a price (which would look like an order on each side of the price). So in this case if you were looking to buy the stock you would have to meet the lowest ask which is $126.80.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3uaq33l81p471.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=a599b5d90613f08f5a053d54d33e0d7e67bdfa56

This is a sample orderbook that I found from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/). A live orderbook would be filled with a number of bids and asks in each column. Orderbook information can be found in your brokerage account if you have access to level II market data. I like to think of orderbook dynamics as forces moving against each other. For example if there are more buyers than sellers then, the green vector will be bigger than the red vector which will push the price up. If there are more sellers than buyers then the red vector will be bigger, which will push prices down.

The following is a different visual representation of bids and asks that shows volume. Looking at the bids (*green)* we can see that there is a preference to buy the stock at a lower price. As for the asks (*red*) the majority of sellers are looking to sell the stock at higher price.

&#x200B;

**Gamestop Example**

Now let’s get into the mechanics behind a short squeeze, and in this case we will look at the Gamestop short squeeze which garnered a great deal of attention recently.

In this example we will start with 7 short positions. Each short position comes from a different short seller. We can see on the aggregate that the stock is downward trending for the most part. This works in the best interest of the short seller who **sells the stock and hopes to buy it back at a cheaper price**, and they will profit from the **difference**. We can also see that the short sell positions are represented with the *green* *profit bar* below the price they entered in at.

https://preview.redd.it/ojczn2t91p471.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65987f0347a0ce2bed614323ceccab066a83f3cf

Now let’s talk about how the short seller’s position may go awry. If the stock price increases which isn’t what the short seller wants and they begin to lose money, then are going to want to exit their position. Keep in mind that **exiting** a short position requires **buying** the stock back. This is *the bug* in short selling, its this little feature that creates a short squeeze. Let’s say a short seller wants out, they’ll buy the stock back, but also going back to our price discovery method, buying a stock **increases the demand**, which **increases the price**.

This is where the squeeze occurs, each short seller **exits** their position which pushes the price up, causing the next short seller to lose money.

The timeline of trades would look like this.

https://preview.redd.it/qu3rdfma1p471.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cfe11ab1b3d42c0340167076f541828a48f62

Graphically it would look like this with the price on left side and the supply and demand on the right side. We can see that when the short seller buys the stock back they increase the demand which increases price.

https://preview.redd.it/og7139gb1p471.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d505e0a7ddc97c446fd4cf90f6beb413dec217d8

We can see that when this all starts to happen the price can dramatically increase.

https://preview.redd.it/2zvr183c1p471.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c50d93d517fff2c4c6d58d27b7761cd358452f4

**Why Short Squeezes happen**

The main factor that contributes to short squeezes is that a short seller who is looking to exit their position has to **buy** the stock which pushes the price up, and that hits the next seller and so forth.

Some short squeezes may occur naturally, although they rarely do. This can happen if a stock posts good quarterly results or makes a positive announcement. That increase in price could trigger a short squeeze. For example when famed activist short seller Citron Research ran by Andrew Left switched his short position on Tesla Inc, that created a short squeeze(see [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/23/short-seller-who-is-suing-tesla-changes-his-mind-tesla-is-destroying-the-competition.html)).

If short sellers succeed and push the price of the stock down then there is a risk that a short squeeze may occur. *Contrarian investors* which are investors that take *go against the grain* approach in investing may bet on a company who’s price is falling. Their purchase may cause a short squeeze, and its common for contrarian investors to try and garner public support which would rally investors. Value investors who constantly ask “*is this stock overvalued or undervalued?”* may see a stock that has been falling because of short sellers and say that its undervalued and buy up a bunch of shares causing a short squeeze.

But the most famous short squeezes that are studied come from market manipulation. This occurs when a trader or group of traders realize that with a large enough buy order will push the price up triggering a short squeeze.

Although it feels like short squeezes have been happening a lot with talks about *meme stocks*, they actually don’t occur too often. I would assume that as markets calm when our lives fully revert back to normal (or whatever normal is post-pandemic) there will be less of these events."

So I came up with a game called Lights Out. Told her to leave the door unlocked, with a specific time Id walk thru it. Also told her to be naked in bed, blindfolded, I was going to walk in, go straight to business, and the only thing she could say was ""yes sir"" and that I would leave once we finished.

So I did the deed, left, and didnt have to spend my whole evening there. And she liked the game too.

Used the rest of the night to make retard moves on stonks."

I'd been slowly building up. +25% over the past month using somewhat safe stocks such as nio, bought spce at 20, amc before the pump.

Lost all my profits in 1 hour buying wish. I'm such a retard.bif I had just waited an hour and bought in a bit cheaper id still had lost money but not as much + I'd have a better idea for market direction.

Waited an hour or so before buying amc this morning at 43, could see of all the meme stocks it was the least volatile and was itching up to make a move. Once it broke up a little there was some breathing room for a stop loss. Much easier to hold a stock when you bought at the bottom then the top."

Buying shares = investing. If you want to buy shares then move your ass over to r/investing. This is wallstreet**bets**. We make bets. We don't invest. Pre-GME, buying shares was the exception, not the norm. People would get shit on for buying shares, unless we're talking $500k+ in shares and 100% portfolio diversity. Now, it's the opposite.

Options fit wsb perfectly because options are risky and a gamble. It's either you make a shit ton of money or lose it all.

Probably going to get downvoted by the newbies but it's true. Pre-GME wsb wasn't what wsb is today, and I think just saying fuck it and banning all share posts, at least temporarily, would be a step in the right direction."

Seek a woman that actually has restraint, not as those that claim they do and lie, who are full of conceit and offer themselves up to numerous men, but seek those that won’t dishonor and destroy themselves for the appearance of status, money, fame, or a single night, which are fleeting, because a woman with true restraint and respect for traditions and family is so much easier to love."

As I sit here counting the cottonelle wipes I use until I get a clean run, i ponder at how cripplingly-traumatized people are unable to learn and/or apply what they learn and/or compete/function in life.

Because trauma isn’t visible, they have to, and they do, accomplishing an insignificant fraction of their true potential. Trauma is mostly generational, it probably runs in the DNA.

Jeff begins walking across the street after having just watched his warehouse worker pee in a bottle and waste 14.234554563 seconds of valuable part picking time. He’s decidedly upset, but reminded that worker will soon be fired and subsidized by the suckers that pay taxes. He’s. Rock. Fucking. Hard. 

His eyes catch Elon standing at the corner. The rain is coming down hard but is bouncing off Elon’s smug aura. They glare at each other and approach. Elon compliments Jeff’s bald head. Jeff’s pants begin to burst at the seam with his raging blood boy fueled boner. Elon talks for 25 minutes about how the hair transplant he received in his thirties gave him the confidence to launch a car into space. They inch closer and their lizard tongues interlock. 

They decide they need to release. Jeff taps his wrist and two drones come in, grabs their uncircumcised meat socks and takes them to the local penitentiary. They’re dropped off in the open ceiling cell of Martin Shkreli. Martin, having just been pumped full of semen from the US judicial system decides two more are in store for the day. Martin grabs their weenies, inserts one at each end of his body.  Martin starts rotating like a pig over a campfire. 

Elon exits Martins mouth after releasing his fresh load of sushi grade roe and asks if all is okay. Martin, teary eyed, looks at Elon and says one thing.

First night with the trap I caught this mean motherfucker of a feral Tom cat. And he was pissed. Had to take him out to a vet and have since released him. A few nights in we find this sweet emaciated lil girl and have her while looking for their owner. A few nights later we get a call that a neighbor has them in their driveway. Go pick him up, it’s dark, get him back to the house, and realize, not the right cat. Now by this point, I’ve cleaned out the damn trap and reset it, and last night wouldn’t you know it, I catch another goddamn feral cat.

Central Florida

80F, clear

I got a $10 haircut from a black barber shop in a derelict shack today. I've been cutting my own hair during the pandemic and wanted a fresh fade. He had a 4.8 on Google and had online booking. I had never been to a black barber shop before.

I was pretty stoned when I pulled up and there was no parking lot, but the two gentleman standing on the porch were kind enough to direct me where to park. As I approached, they said ""Damn bro you outta it"" noting how stoned I was. They directed me inside. 

There was preaching on the radio, a TV with no signal, and about 15 people in this old 2-room house converted to a barber shop. This is considered the ""historic"" part of town. There was duct tape on the walls, and a nephew was walking around sweeping up hair. Several men came and went, and I wondered if possibly there was some sort of drug operation going on. I immediately felt at home.

Rufus' nephew wanted to be an artist, but Rufus wanted him to be a football player for Tallahassee. I told him I'm a graphic designer and I run my own business and I showed him some of the digital art they sell nowadays on my phone. They all got very excited that art could sell for so much. Rufus had 2 cosmetic silver fronts on his teeth glistening when he'd look up to repeat a proverb. He got to talking about money and said he was on the verge of bankruptcy, but that Jesus will get him by. He had an impressive social media presence and was the top ranked in town, but 10 dollar haircuts in a shack don't pay well. He said he had a background in prophecy and told me to continue in the path of the righteous man.

He gave me a fade and I gotta admit he was rough as hell. The sort of haircut you get in prison. His father, Big Rufus, made franks and beans in a microwave and sat down to eat in the corner chair. He kept dropping proverbs the whole time about how when the world knocks you down you just need to trust in Jesus to pick you back up. If the lord makes you a table, you sit down an eat. I tipped him a 50.

I walked outside and Tesla called me. My car was delayed again, wouldn't be ready until tomorrow. I wanted to be mad, but I realized I'm blessed. I asked them if they could upgrade my rims for free for the delays. They told me to fuck myself."

- invests his personal money in the company

- speaks openly and honestly and does not suffer fools

- had the guts to remake a 174 year old company at a risky time which turned out to be exactly the right time

- did it at an absolute bargain price

- tells the truth about China

- does not spend investor airtime on woke dogma

- seems to have NO PROBLEM finding labor while others are whining

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME merger (serious) You know what would be the best decision these companies could make going forward to really stick it to the hedge / keep momentum and stay strong? They need to merge together. Can you imagine a world where you walk into AMC theaters, can walk into a gaming shop play games, hang out and  go watch a movie? Maybe a little bit of alcohol and boom revenue through the roof. Why would they do this? 
AMC theaters have enough space and can change the insides to have a place for GME merchandise and play Areas. 

I think the companies could make a killing by working together. 

Opinions anyone?"
2021-06-11 20:15:58,wallstreetbets,Both are located in malls!

2021-06-11 20:24:28,wallstreetbets,I mean... every month of 2020 me and some friends would get together and rent one of the theaters here and hook up game consoles and play on the big screens. They couldn’t show movies due to restrictions but they could rent it out to private parties. Cost $200 for a 3 hour sesh. 10 friends at $20 each and you’re good to go. If you’ve never played Smash bros with killer surround sound and where friggen pikachu is 6 ft tall then just know it’ll change your life. If AMC would cater to more of a video game crowd like that then maybe a GME merger would make sense.

Gamestop is going to e-commerce. They aren't an arcade.

You have also perfectly described what a mall used to be. And, as malls continue to erode, nudity and shitfacedness are definitely on the table.

Why not throw a WEN merger in there to have them run concessions and NIO/TSLA made from none other than CLF steel for transport to and from. Can't forget CHPT to charge up the EV services. Order the UBER on your BB and lets just have one big fucking orgy. CLOV will handle STDs. SNDL will handle vegetation needs. SPCE will take this merger to the moon."

2021-06-12 14:26:38,wallstreetbets,It could work if there was more to it than just what you are putting here. If not digital games will continue to kill gme and om demand movies will kill off amc aventually
2021-06-12 14:45:10,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when you eat all the fucking crayons!

2021-06-11 21:10:37,wallstreetbets,What in the fuckery?? I can’t believe you would suggest this.. Fucking genius! If you’ve been to Seattle there’s a game store (gameworks) right next to amc theaters and often after movies that’s where ppl would go and vice versa. This would make a killing!
2021-06-12 08:35:43,wallstreetbets,This is the dumbest post and comment section I’ve seen in a long time. I think I’m gonna take a break from Reddit

2021-06-11 23:16:55,wallstreetbets,They could change the stock ticker to $ACME or $GAME. Honestly $ACME would be dope.

2021-06-12 07:52:28,wallstreetbets,"That would be amazing, because, as we all know, the only industry doing better than the theater business is the arcade business."
2021-06-11 20:44:22,wallstreetbets,"I know Gen Zers that just watch people play video games and never play.  ""Smart people.""  A few that I met at Cal.  They would actually do this.

2021-06-12 07:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Brilliant!  It takes the internet out of the home and turns it into a drive to the mall.

People love driving to the mall instead of using the internet from home, which is why AMC and Gamestop are such fabulously successful businesses to begin with.  Doubling down on trips to the mall means doubling down on that massive success!"
2021-06-11 21:08:39,wallstreetbets,ADTR?
2021-06-11 22:32:34,wallstreetbets,Might as well merge with TLRY as well so everyone can be stoned while doing all this. Stoned Apes. The stoned ape theory... MMED should get in on it as well.

2021-06-11 22:36:18,wallstreetbets,It would completely rock this world and what the Wallstreetbets and retail crowd could do. Hope it happens
2021-06-11 22:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they need to do. Go above what everyone would expect from a boring game store and old movie theater. Think big"

2021-06-12 08:00:18,wallstreetbets,Same in mine and actually you can rent AMC theater
2021-06-11 23:50:08,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't be many players.   Need crazy software and hardware to assemble all player console outputs into one frame with low enough latency to the projector.   To get the split screen functioning for semi-mass multiplayer.  Unless the game can already natively split 16 or 32 players into a screen.

They have room where the lines usually are to buy tickets since everyone can order them from the app now.."
2021-06-12 15:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Sarcasm aside, what do places that want to attract a younger crowd do? Put arcade games in.  
  
There are pizza restaurants, and there’s Chuck E. Cheese. There’s American bar and grill restaurants, and there’s Dave and Busters. There’s driving ranges, and there’s Top Golf.  
  
Granted, some AMC locations have arcade-style games like bowling allies do, but for those that don’t there isn’t much besides picking your candy and watching the movie that you can do there.  
  
This adds another revenue stream and the potential for collaboration if GameStop paid for space and sold movie-themed items in their stores like posters and DVDs."

Imagine how much money they could make if they figured out a way to deliver that entertainment product to viewers who didn't even have to leave the house!  People could have their own screens and sit on their own couches watching these games from the comfort of their own homes!  Movies too!

The bounce off of the well formed $8 bottom is just the first stop on the way to the range it should be trading in based on peer valuations $20-$25. FYI, the average of current analysts target prices is $23. Simple oversold new IPO that needs to revalue. After they report the next quarter the market will see that they were simply sandbagging their guidance. There is so much operating leverage in their business model that even a slight decrease in marketing spend will see them produce some serious EBITDA. On top of peer leading Revenue growth and Gross Margins they have the best balance sheet. In fact they are too flush with cash and I wouldn't be surprised to see them kickstart a share buyback.

I don't think they buyback shares, but since they have money, a big plan and the SP is so low it's a reasonable assumption.

They could be profitable right now if they stop investing 60-70% in marketing, but at this stage growth is more important than small profits.

Just the data they collected via their AI could be worth 3b right know and they have 2B in Cash. They build up a brand and have a international network. And you value them at 1B???

It is common to use gross and not net Rev, look at other e-commerce company's"
2021-06-11 21:58:34,wallstreetbets,"They have money from their IPO. They are burning threw it as you mentioned in sales and marketing expenses losing 175M last quarter and 500M the quarter before. They could be profitable but the are concentrated on growth. And they will continue to be. So No part of their plan for the next ten years will include a share buyback and to think otherwise is dense and naive. They have 2B COH but they will certainly have to go back to the debt markets with their cash burn. Albeit that won’t be for two years. 

If the data they “collected” was worth 3B they would be able to recognize it. When they are able to monetize it you will see it on their balance sheet and you can speak to it then. 

There is not one other company that uses gross rev. Amazon, uber, lyft, dash, FB marketplace, Etsy … not one. name one other company that uses gross rev and I’ll destroy their balance sheet too. It’s extremely misleading to think they have any access to use that money as it’s already slated to paid to the service provider. 

I Value them around five dollars. Their balance sheet with $1B in shareholder equity values them at $1 dollar. Their enterprise value which is fairly accurately is where a stock trades (Tsla is ridiculously overvalued but still trades at their EV) is $4.8B. With 619M shares that gives them an EV price of ~7.7.

Edit: 
Let’s say you take an Uber for 20 bucks. Uber’s margins are 20% so you pay uber 20 bucks, they pay 16 dollars to the driver and 4 dollars uber collects and recognized as revenue. 
In the above example WISH, in their logistics space, is recognizing the entire 20 dollars that was paid to them as revenue. Though still has to pay out 16 dollars. It’s pretty shady accounting.

If uber booked gross rev like WISH does uber would had have $65B dollars in rev for just 2019. For a company whose market cap is currently 50B. Just to show you how misleading this gross rev number from Wish is in their logistics space."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Canoo ($GOEV), their Recent Big News, Upcoming Catalysts, and Short Interest **Recent Movement**

It's no question that Canoo has been beaten down the last few months. It's down over 50% from it's pre-merger highs and dipped well below it's former NAV of $10. The big question is : why?

The news of their cancelled deal with Hyundai during their first earnings call is what caused the most recent downward move, but was it really negative news? Why have your engineers work for another car company, helping them develop a car and giving them your valuable IP? It makes more sense to focus on your own products, which will lead to much more revenue over the years. 

Their original CEO, Ulrich Kranz, leaving was also a contributor to this movement. But again, the move makes sense. Ulrich is an iconic engineer and designer. That's where his focus should be. Having him step down and putting a business oriented CEO (Tony Aquila) is the right move. Not every engineer is Elon Musk. Kranz decided not to retain an engineering position with Canoo, leading me to...

 **Apple Hires Ulrich Kranz for It's Rebooted Car Project** [see here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous)

Lots of speculations can be made here. If Ulrich had left on bad terms, most speculation would be bad.

However, both publicly stated the departure was made on GOOD terms. 

As you know, Apple tried to acquire Canoo in early 2020, which means their technology is the real deal. What do I think they're targeting? Canoo's **Skateboard Platform**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vrul6ibmo471.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6448dc4281f18423835ddb8ac2d068b03e7f9c3

If Apple had this, it would speed up their creation of the Apple car since they would only have to design the piece that goes on top. And since Apple couldn't buy Canoo, how could they get their hand on this?    Hire Ulrich and have him make one? : No, Canoo has their technology (a.k.a Ulrich's own tech) patented. 

I speculate a deal is in the works where Canoo licenses out their skateboard platform to Apple to build a car on in exchange for some royalty they receive for each sale. And hiring Ulrich Kranz helps them because he knows how to build a car on the platform because **HE MADE IT.**

Of course this is highly speculative, but I believe it's the simplest explanation.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

1. **Investor Day**

Canoo is holding their Investor Day next week on the 17th in Texas where they are actually letting investors attend and see their vehicles. They currently have 3 that we know of : the delivery van, pickup truck, and lifestyle vehicle(a.k.a minivan or BANGBUS). They have teased a sedan model in the past, and it's speculated they will unveil it at this event.

2. **Manufacturing Announcement**

Canoo's CEO said that their contract manufacturer would be announced in Q3, likely during the Q2 earnings call. This is the only thing holding them back right now. Their product is much further developed compared to the other former SPAC EV's, with 3 models that have drive-able prototypes. They may provide an update to us during Investor day.

**Long and Behold: The Short Interest**

Ortex is showing a current short interest rate of 30% of the share float, up 300% from their 10% short interest rate in January. They are betting against Canoo, and there are a few upcoming catalyst that could drastically change the market sentiment and blow them up.

**Disclosure:**

This post contains highly speculative predictions, and I encourage you to read up on Canoo and do your own research. This is not financial advice."

I think their skateboard is an excellent idea to keep costs down and if you want a larger vehicle, you make a larger skateboard after you have every small delivery van, coupe, convertible, pickup, minivan, and suv that can fit on the current chassis.

They won't have vehicles out until next year. I think they have a good chance of coming up with some good stuff and being acquired by a larger company for a shit-ton of money."

They were founded by members of the infamous Unit 8200, a department within the Israeli defense forces. This unit is known for having the most skilled cybersecurity pioneers on the planet. Many of their former specialists have gone on to form multi billion dollar companies in the cybersecurity industry. 

Varonis caters to securing private data for multi national fortune 500 corporations around the globe... and as such, it protects our data. Their customers include some of the largest financial institutions on the planet including Barclays and Deutsche. Universities including Boston University, George Washington University, The University of Surrey, and the University of Pennsylvania. They also protect Phillip Morris Tobacco, Sirius XM Radio, Simon Property Developers, Spotify, Exxon, and Dominion Energy. 

They are currently trading at $53 a share and Analysts have their average price target for $68 a share. High estimates range from **$88 to $117 a share**. Low estimates have them at $58 a share. 

VRNS just broke out of a descending triangle pattern and retested the downward sloping trendline and bounced off to the upside with fury today. 

This is a very low volume and traded mainly by institutions. It also has a 6% shorted volume allowing for plenty of upside from covering shorts in the coming weeks. The ATH price was approx $75 a share back in February. 

I am all in with **200 shares at a $51.38** cost basis and **25 calls for 12/17 at a $50c**.

Most of the downward price action was from the block sales, that banks were liquidating back in March (those steep red drop, and volumes). All that action is done now, and what is left, is an amazing opportunity to get this stock on discount.

Another big catalyst coming next week? You guessed it, DIVIDENDS. Vast majority of dividends on this stock will most likely be re-invested back in. Should give it a good pop in price action next week.

Now that the price is wedging around the support levels, get ready for take off retards. And as always, I am just another retard that draws arbitrary lines on charts and calls it smart. Do your own research, and place your bets!

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Should You Buy Corning Stock? With 5G and everything running off of fiber, Is this a good stock to invest in and why? [https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/15/should-you-buy-corning-stock-at-36/?sh=6117ec611813](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/12/15/should-you-buy-corning-stock-at-36/?sh=6117ec611813)

Should You Buy Corning Stock? With 5G and everything running off of fiber, Is this a good stock to invest in and why?

The global spread of Coronavirus has impacted the sales of Corning due to a decline in capital spending from some of its customers as well as pricing pressure for its display glass products. That said, the company is now seeing a rebound in demand, and it posted a 2% y-o-y sales growth in Q3. The company’s total revenue in the first three quarters of 2020 was down 8.4% y-o-y to $8.0 billion, while the adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share reflect a 77% decline over the $1.10 figure reported in the prior year period, primarily led by higher operating costs owing to the pandemic. Looking forward, with economies opening up gradually and availability of vaccines, the capital spending on 5G is expected to rise, boding well for Corning’s optical fiber business, while the company will also see higher sales of its glass vials that are being used for Covid-19 vaccines. Also, the new Apple iPhone 12 uses ceramic shield, manufactured by Corning, and iPhone 12 sales alone are touted to be in the range of 80 to 100 million units by October 2021, again boding well for Corning. That said, much of these factors appear to be priced in the current stock value of $36, despite the expected recovery in demand post Covid. In reality, 2020 full year revenues are estimated to see a decline of 3% to $11.3 billion, while earnings are expected to be down 22% to $1.37."

Only thing that matters to me is that Dave Tepper bought a huge stake and that dude knows how to make tendies. Price target, MOON. 

“Marqeta (MQ) is worth $17B. The annualized revenue expectation is $350M for this company. Paysafe $1,550M in revenue in 2021. To simplify Paysafe has 4 times to revenue. However, it is worth $8B. The company just saved $78M in operating costs, by paying $1.1B in debt and refinancing $931M of debt with a 1.25% lower interest rate. Paysafe is a powerhouse next to Marqeta. By many statements mostly from amazing DD done by Lincoln, the stock should be at $46 per share, or $33B. Using the simple math Marqeta is case in point being overvalued, and one of many examples now how Paysafe is undervalued. So what is happening? For whatever reason Bill Foley has been red-circled by Wall Street. None of the SPACs he has tied to the merger made returns. The members of PIPE have sold the stock short which is very apparent and the stock is controlled by the conspirators by being sold from the day merger was completed and long before it.”

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Peloton the Short Side No position at the moment.  I think this is a very valid consideration and looking for input.  No way in hell I want to get caught in the short side of an APE army but I do believe in fundamentals of markets.  

With the pandemic ending soon I've been looking at some short options to trade.   Some of the biggest gainers like Peloton were amazing on the way up.  Demand was so hot you had to wait months to even get a bike.  Their subscription services were through the roof hot.  They had some major trouble a few months ago with shipping / cargo.  In-fact they are still having those issues.  So much so they decided to announce a US based manufacturing plant that will cost upwards of 500 million dollars and will not be completed until 2023.

Major inflationary pressures I believe that are not in current revenue numbers.  The cost of carbon fiber steel has increased in Aug 2020 from $459 to $1511 today.  A near 300% increase and still climbing quickly.   These pricing pressures to manufacture their equipment must hit their bottom line soon and thus I believe will impact earnings next quarter.

Next take a look at shipping issues.  Pricing on shipping is still increasing.  If they can't deal with shipping issues until 2023, I believe we will see more pressure on the bottom line.

Then, how many people do you know that are getting ""back out"" to the gym.  I was just at my local LifeTime fitness and it was SOLID packed.  Granted, I'm in Tx but I'm hearing that places are opening back up.  I believe while a lot of people will be scared for a while longer, that more people will cancel their Peloton subscriptions and want to get back into society and socialize at the gyms.  Also you'll find a large subscription churn if consumers are getting hit with inflation pressures on other goods/services which we are seeing.  They will cut expenses where they can and subscriptions like Peloton would go before Netflix and chill...

Lastly lets look at the major shareholders of the company.  This is primarily composed of mutual fund companies.  Vanguard Group invested a hella lot back in April-July 2020.  They went from 3 million shares to today 22 million shares.  I believe with the re-opening trade and headwinds described above these mutual fund companies are severely overweight and will rebalance very very soon if pricing continues to decline.

I'm noticing some pressures around Options trading.  Their appears to be a market maker who is selling quite a bit of puts and then like today on low volume increasing pricing with no underlying news, on a down dow day.... Sus for sure...

With the above, I believe that some of the Covid plays should be considered for the short side trade.

Thoughts?"

Their current product line up includes the c-series trucks. Which are essentially electric postal delivery style trucks. They also have a drone business called horsefly, which they claim can help with delivering packages. Finally they also have Metron, an app that can keep track of their trucks and monitor them to help with inefficiencies.

&#x200B;

[Product Lineup](https://preview.redd.it/mq0vm13xfo471.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed883919f468ff5014bceee5e6405f8fa6b818d6)

If we take a look at valuation, at $15 we are sitting around $1.85 billion.

[WKHS Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/3j76xe2tfo471.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fdf821b66ef9b98b018eb804df1c73df9c076f5)

As you can see on the chart, they reached a high $43 a share back in early February. However, after failing to gain the USPS contract they fell all the way to $7.25. They became heavily shorted, and are now back on the rise for that reason.

If we look at their financial position, we easily see they are overvalued.

They have barely started to regrow sales, but they are still minuscule. They are valued about 1000x their ARR (Annual Rolling Rate) if we take the $500,000 they made in Q1. This is absurd. They have been in business for years and still can't sell their products.

[Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/j1clghhufo471.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=f807cfa2aab39c1a7a9cd3dcd5a0a8d7da0ddec2)

The competition in the space is only increasing. Rivian, Lion Electric, Proterra, and Arrival are all joining the fray, except they already have partnerships with delivery giants. Arrival has a [deal](https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21121715/ups-takes-stake-in-evmaker-arrival-will-buy-at-least-10000-electric-delivery-vans) with UPS. [Rivian](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs) and [Lion Electric](https://www.electrive.com/2021/01/11/huge-order-for-lion-electric-trucks-from-amazon/) both have partnerships with Amazon. And all of them seemingly have a better growth ahead, even accounting for the higher valuations compared to Workhorse.

Workhorse has never made a profit. The only time they had positive earnings is when their invest in Lordstown Motors blew up. Now RIDE is on the down tread. Their balance sheet is relatively healthy, and potentially a turn around could be possible, but unlikely. Back in October they sold 200 million in convertible notes, which are due 2024. They also have various other liabilities that total $204 million, including long-term. They have about $205 million in cash $200 million in Lordstown Motors. This is most of their liquid securities.

Of course they could last a while with that much money right?

Maybe. But things are still not good. In Q1 they lost $5.7 million in just cost of sales alone. This isn't even operating costs. For every dollar of sales, it cost them twelve dollars just to build. Of course this could be improved if they scaled up production, but they aren't receiving nearly enough sales to make a dent. The cashflows aren't looking good. They lost about $36 million in Q1 alone. That could mean they burn through $144 million in cash for 2021. They also have their drone project which continues to burn money as well, even with no potential near term.

There was hope a few months ago. They could've won USPS, but probably due to their limited manufacturing capabilities, they didn't get and lost it to Oshkosh Corp. This was surprising to some. They seemed like the perfect fit for the new electric government vehicles. Lots of protest rose up over it from some government officials and Workhorse. However nothing has come out of it. I don't see a future where Workhorse gets the contract, unless the House can pass a bill forcing the USPS to go electric, but even then Oshkosh still might keep the contract. Even Cathy Woods sold her stake in Workhorse a few months ago.

Meanwhile, Arrival, Lion Electric, and more have partnerships and outside investment from huge companies that could benefit from this.

Is it attractive? I don't see how. They aren't unique. They are burning through cash like crazy. They lost contracts. Everyone is selling out of them. Yet they are still valued like non of that is happening. Arrival has a lot more products and partnerships. They are probably overvalued too though.

2021-06-12 10:17:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but so is Workhorse, they are also burning cash.

I like Lion Electric, they got a lot going for them and have a deal with Amazon.

Arrival I think is overvalued as well, but they have a lot more vehicles in the works, and huge partnerships as well.

Another company is lighting e-motors. They don't develop in the same segment, but lighting is planning on expanding to delivery vans, and they have a lower market cap. And they make twice the revenue.

TA is not in favor of WKHS short term either. The MACD is pulling back down, PSAR is also suggest bearish case, and we are starting to see people sell on run-ups, like today where it ran up 7% then slowly started selling off."

Over a 2-year period, the key sectors to look at are the Expansion and Emerging sectors. The chart below shows that these two sectors show a good increase.

In short, this is a good long term growth stock. The main factor that made me buy this is their acquisition strategy. A company that keeps growing their market share and brands is very good for the company in the long run. However, I expect in the short-term to take a hit. Revenue wise, more brands, more variety and more sales.

2021-06-12 19:22:04,wallstreetbets,$UTZ is a good company but it's fully priced right now.  It was overvalued when it was in the high 20's.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Undervalued and Not a Meme Stock Let’s look at this;

- Expected revenue for 2021- $3.25 billion. 
- Cash on balance sheet- approx. $2 billion.
- Revenue increased 75% compared to last year.
- WISH is also most downloaded e-commerce app in the world for last 3 years.
- In 2015, Amazon had offered $10 billion in cash but WISH walked away.
- Current Enterprise Value = $6 billion (Market cap.) - Cash (2 billion) = $4 billion
- Currently trading at 1.23 times expected 2021 revenues. 

Wish is one of the largest and fastest growing global ecommerce platforms and should be trading at least 5-6 times revenue i.e. $16 to $20 billion  and stock price between $25-$30. 

With economies reopening it will be easy to facilitate shipping and will favourably impact WISH. In addition, low income group which were adversely impacted will be back.

As you can see there are lot of tail winds for this stock and it can easily muti-bagger at this dirt cheap price. 

You don’t make money without patience. Just buy and hold and let compounding do it’s magic.

WISH went through several rounds of raising capital through equity financing with company valuation way north of $10 billion. As a result, early investors are not going to sell at this price level.

Short sellers will be rudely awaken next week , if they think that stock lock up expiration if going to give them an opportunity to buy back the stocks cheaply in order to cover their short position."
2021-06-11 21:15:53,wallstreetbets,WISH number 6 trending stock on here! Hasn’t popped yet! Let’s go 🌙 🚀 💎 🙌

2021-06-11 20:24:59,wallstreetbets,"I think people don’t get that this isn’t a company that has everything figured out perfectly. If they did they would already be Alibaba. They do need changes, if they didn’t it wouldn’t be a company with such a small market cap. The potential is there however and that is the attraction as it is a bargain e-commerce stock where if they do turn things around early investors here that are in it should be handsomely rewarded."
2021-06-11 20:37:47,wallstreetbets,"My only input is that I buy a lot of bootleg gaming stuff and cheap accessories, and I do so between wish and aliexpress

My wife went to make a order on allibaba and shipping was $1100. 

This is not going to help the stock for the future. It will be a shorts game"

2021-06-12 09:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Q1 of 2021 they have dramatically improved revenue. Although they devoted more money to development etc. They are increasing merchants and banning bogus merchants.  They are still young.  Amazon wasn't profitable either for years.  Amazon offered 10B for the company in 2019 they refused.  

The App is the most downloaded retail app for the last couple of years.  With the cost of living going up on those most desperate more people will be seeking value pricing.  Kind of a no-brainer."
2021-06-11 21:55:38,wallstreetbets,"6/18 $15 call, let's go 🚀"
2021-06-12 04:09:39,wallstreetbets,"But the general business climate of China, Covid reemergence, and the infinite wait time for what are basically unnecessary products does not lend for a favorable future for this stock. This was posted yesterday too and it lost 10% Friday."
2021-06-12 01:43:17,wallstreetbets,Very nice
2021-06-11 22:08:17,wallstreetbets,"I watched some stock guy on tv say the 10% short was totally wrong, was really 40 % which I completely believe when I see how fast the uptick was stopped. Bunch of float shares were unavailable or locked up and the 10% was calculated wrong they said. I’m no expert but what I do know is I’m going to hold wish, clover, gme, amc, and a shit ton load of over sold stock🦍💪 I like them and will keep buying more every chance I get."
2021-06-12 10:06:38,wallstreetbets,by everyone you mean the 700 retards in this thread? I'm with you but I think we're in for a rocky ride
2021-06-11 20:30:32,wallstreetbets,amc is up %1000 wise gone up only %20.. wish has more room to run if it decided to do so.. well its just my opinion because Iam long :)
2021-06-11 20:58:14,wallstreetbets,yeah and somehow wish still sells 100x shittier products
2021-06-12 12:23:20,wallstreetbets, Nike is Vietnam.
2021-06-12 12:17:28,wallstreetbets,For sure. I used their app and they just sell the same garbage you’d find at a dollar store
2021-06-11 20:59:04,wallstreetbets,I'll buy on Wednesday for $1
2021-06-12 09:58:34,wallstreetbets,"ah, bank on poverty, that *is* a no-brainer"
2021-06-12 09:57:56,wallstreetbets,"What? Revenue sank from q4 2020 to q1 2021

They just had less expenses, so that their eps was ""less"" negative.
You cant compare wish to amazon. Alibaba dominates the chinese market and amazon the european one. Also everyone knows wish already. Its not like amazon, which became exponentially more prominent.

Also the wish experience is very disingenuous. It feels cheap and you still feel like you are getting ripped off. All those ""discounts"" are clearly fake. You can't sort search results in a way that literally every other shopping platform lets you.
With the added shipping costs its also mostly more expensive than amazon/ebay. I dont think they are unfairly valued."
2021-06-12 11:13:33,wallstreetbets,People who shop WISH dont care about the wait.
2021-06-11 22:54:41,wallstreetbets,"probably because the commenter has zero understanding of basic financial concepts. traditional gaap book value is quite meaningless for companies whose value is derived from intangible assets (i.e. software, technology), and enterprise value is literally a function of share price, not the other way around."
2021-06-12 11:21:47,wallstreetbets,Hope not lol
2021-06-12 11:45:04,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually the 9th highest on just pure volume bud… 85mil just like nio, has to do something lol n my ape brain that is"
2021-06-11 21:39:32,wallstreetbets,2.5 billion in revenue don’t lie. I bought a few things from wish recently will see how it goes.
2021-06-11 23:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Wework is an exception. Private investors are generally less emotional and more forward looking than the public. 


You can go with your definition for fair value. But I bet you will think all young tech companies are overvalued."
2021-06-12 10:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much, I'd prefer to say Income deprived.  And I don't think many have doubts we will see more income deprived people in the next year or 2, especially once the Stimmy money and the Unemployment run dry.   DLTR and FDO are doing well banking on people looking for low prices."
2021-06-12 10:01:43,wallstreetbets,I agree their app and products are cheezy.  But there is a market for their goods.  Amd opening it up to more merchants may increase the quality.  But people in this Sub do not usually buy crap like a ton of other people.  I usually buy value over price.  Their model is price over value.  WISH caters to people who buy cheap ass furniture From Bob's Furniture or some other discount place.  Where I usually stick to Jordan's.
2021-06-11 20:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Ability to move the stock depends on daily volume, not on float"
2021-06-11 22:10:30,wallstreetbets,Amc had over 500 million and it moved just fine😎🦍
2021-06-12 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,"They might care somewhat less about the wait than other shoppers but if they truly did not care about the wait at all, then they wouldn’t care about ordering the product either."
2021-06-11 20:09:49,wallstreetbets,So wish is a pump n dump
2021-06-11 20:16:40,wallstreetbets,Tell me about the tendies again George...
2021-06-12 03:16:33,wallstreetbets,This is honestly the best analogy for this sub 😂😂😂
2021-06-12 10:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Yesh but thats it... it isnt cheap. You cant get a decent looking tshirt for under 15-20 bucks total. Sure the tshirt is only 7 bucks... but then 12 are added on shipping.

I always compare everything i buy on multiple sites and wish was never the cheapest for the same product yet (or maybe once).

And again, you can't compare it to amazon. Amazon had first mover access to online retail. Wish is moving into an already highly competitive space and they aren't really bringing anything new to the table."
2021-06-11 20:03:44,wallstreetbets,Inserts “I can’t even” bitmoji
2021-06-11 20:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Daily volume has to be a lot higher when the float is a lot higher, this is like basic ass investing"
2021-06-11 22:12:34,wallstreetbets,And they are still issuing more stock. But touché good point.
2021-06-12 10:03:30,wallstreetbets,"More exposure to everyday investors. Everybody has been to an AMC location to watch a movie, I have met a couple of people who have bought something off wish and turned out to be junk that they regretted buying. I bought some wish stock, but, like the friends I know, am regretting it already"
2021-06-11 23:20:41,wallstreetbets,"I think it's legit, but I definitely think there's uncertainty... I mean institution ownership is 97% so plenty of other people thinking it's legit too"
2021-06-12 10:11:19,wallstreetbets,"I have never thoroughly looked at theirshopaholic. The site is Too busy for me and stuff looks cheap.  But that is their gimmick.  Sell to those who buy crap on impulse to ""reward"" themselves for misery.  I think of it as a porn site for low to middle income shopaholics."
2021-06-11 21:48:58,wallstreetbets,Which it is. Many times higher than gamestop's volume.
2021-06-11 21:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Not compared to how large the float is, why is this so hard for you to understand. 90m volume in a day on a 600m float is wayyyyy less when compared to 10 or 20 m volume on a 90m float"

If you would double the stock price the company valuation would  still be less than the asset value of their properties—we are talking premium real estate in Europe and North America.

The stock has been shorted heavily during covid due to the company renting space for cinemas, malls and retail stores. Actually $URW is renting out to $GME and $AMC. Short sellers apparently did not care to do a DD as that the company's deep value is based on real estate. Will be worth even more during inflationary periods.

Why do news sites says June 14th?  Because Wish is undercovered and it's easy to be wrong.  Bloomberg just updated their float from <70M to >300M shares this week.

Wish is 70% owned by the following people:  
\- Piotr (20%), Founder  
\- Shang Zheng (10%), Founder

\- Formation8 (16%), Joe Lonsdale is Wish board and can't sell

\- GGV (7%).  Hans Tung is GP and on Wish board so can't sell.

\- GA (2.6%).  Tanzeen is on board  
So \~50% owned by above entities who can't sell due to being on board/insiders

\- Temasek (6%), singapore sovereign wealth fund

\- DST (\~21%), did a pro rata distro to LPs, who might sell.  Too lazy to link s-1 doc

\- Founders Fund (13%), did a pro rata distro to LPs

40% owned by above entities, with some LPs selling via exercise of pro rata rights.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Simple Note on Why CLF is at the Perfect Cross Section of Where the Market Wants to Invest 1. It is a meme stock that has barely even memed so far
2. 6% GDP Growth + international demand - starving for steel.
3. It is a value stock - market fleeing to value
4. It is a commodity stock - market wants an inflation hedge
5. It is a steel stock: we can't just ramp up new steel plants willy nilly.
6. They are going to make a bucket of money - for sure this year and a strong market for at least 3-5 years in my opinion.
7. They are protected by steel tariffs that aren't going away.
8. China wants to go green, and reducing their dirty cheap steel production is one of the best ways for them to accomplish this
9. They are a PRIMARY PRODUCER of steel which is vital to our national interests. They aren't just melting scrap.
10. They are FULLY INTEGRATED producing all of their own Iron for their steel mills. They even have a cutting hedge HBI plant (produces things that other steel makers need and for themselves. super high value)
11. Their CEO is a fucking badass who hates shorts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcagi2icXaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcagi2icXaU)
12. The stock is undervalued because they have only had ONE QUARTER as a newly combined entity. Institutions will wait for things to get proven out before they fully invest. They bought AK Steel and Mittal Steel's U.S. operations in 2020 - amazing timing. #1 steel producer in the USA. Edit: This will also give them more negotiating power.
13. I am comfortable holding shares for 10 years. I don't care if it doesn't rip. If the stock Memes it is merely a bonus for me and faster time to value. I see this as very limited downside and massive upside.
14. Edit BONUS: NEGOTIATING POWER AS COMBINED ENTITY: From Q1 Earnings Call: ""Another thing is that the real competition for the more sophisticated grades of steel that AK Steel, and Cleveland-Cliffs owned AK Steel for alone for almost a year. The only real competition was AM USA. So now we own both. So the automotive clients, they have already realized that. And they are no longer negotiating with a beggar. They negotiate with the supplier that treats them with a lot of respect and demands respect in retrospect, so we are doing great. "" - LG
15. Edit BONUS 2: Auto chip shortage seems to be easing. This will help CLF. Their massive profits will also trail a bit as contracts get renegotiated. In other words Q1 was just an appetizer.
16. Edit BONUS 3: You can sleep at night knowing that this is a real and profitable company and not the usual shit meme stock with zero revenue or massive losses.

From their updated list, CLOV is deleted and UWMC was newly added to Russell 3000.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx3min/uwmc\_added\_to\_the\_russell\_3000/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx3min/uwmc_added_to_the_russell_3000/)

As you can see from the list, they don't indicate whether the company is in Russell 1000 or Russell 2000. Everything is written as 3000.

[https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice/?id=2600634&\_ga=2.66413230.1628464201.1623373167-1447825447.1623373167](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice/?id=2600634&_ga=2.66413230.1628464201.1623373167-1447825447.1623373167)

&#x200B;

I was reading all replies and realized many people misunderstand the difference between Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000. Some guy even mentioned that CLOV was a better company so it was included in Russell 2000 and UWMC is not good enough to make it to Russell 2000, and only made to Russell 3000...

&#x200B;

Here goes a simple explanation of what are Rusell 1000, 2000, and 3000 are:

Russell 1000 = The largest 1000 stock indexed in Russell 3000

Russell 2000 = The subset of smallest 2000 companies in Rusell 3000

Russell 3000 = Russell 1000 + Russell 2000

&#x200B;

When they announce a company is included in Russell 3000, we only have half the news. It will be either 1000 or 2000. The easiest way to make an educated guess is to check the company's market capitalization.

If the market cap is large enough to be included in Russell 1000, probably it made to Russell 1000. If the company's market cap is smaller compared to large 1000, it will be included in Russell 2000.

I believe UWMC's market capital is large enough to be included in Russell 1000.

Please be aware that Russell 2000 is not better than Russell 3000. IMO, Russell 3000 is better because it is more diversified for smaller risks. Obviously, Russell 1000 is the best."

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"LAST CHANGE GME Gap Fill Incoming First let me start out by saying I'm an APE who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest, rarest, and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices. WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons.

Now, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting...

**PRICE ACTION** First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2

Also, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low.

**FIBS** This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the ""Golden Trade"". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6

**OPTION VOL** Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138

**PC RATIO** Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap.

&#x200B;

If you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see ""BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP"" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history. This cannot go tits up ;) Not financial advice don't wanna get sued. I'm gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at Arby's is almost over."
2021-06-12 08:39:04,wallstreetbets,"Also a point you're missing is that when you cash out and issue shares based on an imaginary price, that price becomes reality, because now GME is like a combination of a cash flush IPO with a massive existing network, top leadership, and all the press in the world.

If I was getting paid in stock, I'd want to get that new share issue done with hot and fast and then have my stocks based on the price yesterday.

If I was a short-seller, I'd short the fk out of that share issue and crash it as hard as I could.  


Even Bloomberg is hyping gamestop as a good company to buy now. That's going to draw a whole new class of investors now that it's gained a shtload of legitimacy.

I think a lot of stars are aligned on this one.

I yolo'd on a 6/18 300c when the stock price was at 215. Already got 50% on it riding up to 235, so I'm really hoping this is as correct as I thought it was yesterday when I did this to myself and that monday AM we're back up to 280."

This is the dip to buy in my opinion.

With contracts with the US and UK in military intelligence police heathcare and others with IBM, Amazon etc, I’m intending to ride this to not just the moon but to Mars.

Short term I see this going to $27 and attempting to break/ hold that key level. It is already showing the golden cross formation of crossing moving averages. In the long run this play does not have a roof, it will easily get back to all time highs of $45 and from there contract announcement after aannouncement will take it even further. My own PT is $80 min.

Today Annaly Capital Management (NLY) announced they will keep their dividends at 0.22 a share which is good for investors because the dividend is guaranteed. The company is at $5.78 a share which is a good time to get in. Investors need to get in by July 30th, 2021 to get these dividends.

U.K. opens up from Covid 100% by June 21st, 2021 which means Cinemark (CNNWF) is going to hit records, and right now the company is sitting at $1.27 a share. Lloyds of London (LYG) is sitting at $2.70 a share. It's a good time to jump in before U.K. opens up. Please share your thoughts because I am very interested in what all investors have to say.

Recently, Caterpillar has tanked about 10% from it's recent high. For a blue chip stock, that is pretty significant. It seems to be for no reason except some people were afraid of the valuation? With a forward PE of 18 and a reopened economy I could give less of a shit about their concerns. 

&#x200B;

Do you ever drive on the highway, a bridge too perhaps? You know what you see when they are doing construction? Yes, Caterpillar vehicles. The government almost exclusively gives contracts to Caterpillar for infrastructure improvement, none of that weak bullshit. 

America's infrastructure sucks! Which is why Biden has gotten together with Republicans to sign a **$1 Trillion** infrastructure bill. Undoubtedly $CAT will recover (maybe even hit a new high) when it comes to a close. News is that there a 'tentative' deal, which means they just have to get the specifics down and then *BOOM* we're in the money boys. 

&#x200B;

Not to mention I read some crazy yahoo article saying that $CAT could be worth 34% more than their current intrinsic value. Link here:

# Relative Valuation for ContextLogic Inc. performed by Baconnator69420.

**Introduction**

So for those who are new to valuation, I will give my overall thesis as to why I am so bullish on the position ContextLogic. First off let's define what relative valuation is so that we can get a better understanding of why these metrics are useful.

**Relative Valuation**\- also called valuation using multiples is the notion of comparing the price of an asset to the market value of similar assets. In the field of securities investment, the idea has led to important practical tools, which could presumably spot pricing anomalies.

*(for the dumbasses, comparing numbers to other companies numbers)*

[**The 4 Important metrics when valuing a business is**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp)

* Price to Book Value or (P/B)
* Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)
* Price to Earnings Growth (PEG)
* Dividend Yield \*Note this stock does not currently pay a dividend\*

Further Fundamentals will be considered as we take apart the most recent filing for ContextLogic Inc.

&#x200B;

**Body** 

The first metric we will be looking at is the price to book value of the company of ContextLogic. Price to Book essentially calculates the market value of the company and the intrinsic value of its actual holdings. Further explanation is what is the company actually worth without participating in the market. It is the calculation of all the assets the company currently holds. Most of this information will be pulled and calculated from the website [MacroAxis](https://www.macroaxis.com/stock/WISH/Contextlogic-Inc-Cl) so feel free to access the information Via the hyper-link.

&#x200B;

[Price to Book vs Current Valuation ](https://preview.redd.it/xnypsj1bln471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=48266c4526b6a9566f1f004253a199360eaf93f5)

This alone proves the overall undervaluation of the company ContextLogic. Looking on the X-axis we can see that in the market we have a similar Current Valuation to competitors, but are not trading at as high of a multiple as a company such as MELI, ZLNDY, or EBAY. These are all E-Commerce companies, CVNA will not be considered with Chip shortage because that is the sole reason it is trading at such a premium because they are in used cars. So looking similarly we can conclude that growth is to be expected as a company like ZLNDY trades at 13.68 P/B with a current valuation of 24.9B. Whereas $WISH has a 5.51 P/B. This allows us to conclude this could very well be a 50$ PT in the coming future.

&#x200B;

[Short Ratio to Total Debt ](https://preview.redd.it/4m4f3o8gpn471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=f971126f4839485580c02148c8277a6af83b0c98)

This analysis shows the total debt on the X-axis and the Short Ratio on Y-axis. Again CVNA will not be included. Similarly, we can point to the thesis that this company maintains low amounts of debt in fact the least amount of debt compared to other companies operating in E-commerce. The current short ratio is arguably pointing to the conclusion that this stock is heavily being targeted by shorts with not a lot of fundamentals to back it other than ""Wish sells shitty products"". That is a harmful thesis as we have a market expectation of high inflation. With high inflation, people will have less money which further affirms that customers will transition into secondary goods, AKA shitty $WISH products. This is not a bad thing. Another correlation to this is during times of economic downturn we see many consumers shopping at discount stores such as Dollar General or Dollar Tree. Overall the market is not very forward-thinking if we consider those facts alone.

&#x200B;

[BF EV\/Rev](https://preview.redd.it/8ouz8bsjtn471.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=9affd94a41c074ade14d4fc15f7b1d1d54587bad)

The last part of this valuation will be my Price targets and analysis of the reasoning.

This is a [Bloomberg Quote Snapshot](https://bba.bloomberg.net/Content/Html5/Citrix/src/SessionWindow.html?launchid=1623427103961) at 12:05 EST June 11th, 2021

BF EV/Rev quotes $WISH at a 1.3x multiple. We can consider based on previous research that this company maintains low debt, but trades at a low premium relative to earnings in this market. Competitor EV/Rev averages 6.2x multiple considering this metric we can conclude by doing some simple math 6.2x/1.3x = 4.7692307692x is the room for wish to grow. An almost 5 BAGGER HAHAH. Multiplying this number by our current stock price of $10.13 x 4.7692307692 = $48.31 which would give us our overall price target based on competitor performance. Safe to say this is very undervalued. My price target will be an Even 50$ dollars because of the mental number of 50$.

# Conclusion 

In conclusion, shorts are greedy as fuck on this stock. This is a value play not even a meme stock. There are strong fundamentals that point to the overall undervaluation of ContextLogic Inc. And to all the people that say WSB doesn't do good DD or doesn't take into account fundamentals. Go Politely FUCK YOUR SELF. Let's make Tendies. This is Cheap."

So I buy a call ITM, wait for the stock to go up, then just sell an equal amount on contracts at higher premiums? Does this close out my position entirely or are you still on the hook for those options until they expire/are exercised?  


Anyone can answer if you're willing to ELI5"

2021-06-11 20:28:53,wallstreetbets,Buy some UWMC and you can afford to fix that

2021-06-11 22:08:55,wallstreetbets,Every bit helps 👊
2021-06-11 22:51:54,wallstreetbets,"Not even good put potential. I'm long term bearish on this whole sector but UWMC will weather the next 5 year slump (soft landing instead of a bubble pop is coming, but growth will suck once interest rates move off historic lows)."
2021-06-11 20:11:26,wallstreetbets,They been posting about this stock all week and it ain't really move. I got a call for it. It sounds like a great one.
2021-06-12 06:28:21,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit. I tried to sell my one 6/18 call when it was up around +300% but it was at the peak and it didn’t get scooped up before the price dropped.
2021-06-12 14:39:01,wallstreetbets,I bought $9cs expiring next week. Paid 1.24 per while stock was resting at 10.14. Super cheap value to control 1000 shares for 10cent theta

2021-06-12 07:00:21,wallstreetbets,Usually selling the option ITM and buying shares will yield you more because you also get the premium when you sell vs exercise.

Shoot for 100 shares so you can start selling calls and getting premium."

2021-06-12 03:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like more research would be a good idea.  Shares are lower risk until you really understand how options work.

But to answer your question.  If you buy a call, and the value goes up and then you sell it, you have just made some money.  After you sell the call option, you are not on the hook for it."
2021-06-12 09:45:03,wallstreetbets,"Sad, right?
But that's how it works in HCOL area and with Uncle Sam."
2021-06-11 20:24:21,wallstreetbets,"12-14 is true, 50-60 in 3 years there is literally 0 chance of. Stocks do trade on fundamentals at some point and that would be higher multiples than most tech giants.

I believe fair market value is 12-18 personally. It can definitely pop to $20 though pretty easily imo. Low float is the key. If it runs, it will run hard.

Position or ban:
10k shares
248 options contracts (not being 250 sickens me too)"
2021-06-11 21:40:35,wallstreetbets,I spent some of last week's banana money on these as well in hopes of buying more AMC/GME. Cheers!
2021-06-12 07:15:19,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that. That’s what I thought but my math is not strong so I’m getting twisted. I’ve never let a call exercise before. In what situation would it be advantageous to exercise?

2021-06-11 22:58:32,wallstreetbets,Woh nelly
2021-06-11 22:29:54,wallstreetbets,Damn I really have to learn options. It’s always so confusing.

2021-06-12 04:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Haha yea I'm trying to get my research in by talking to people who have more exp than I do; after all I can only do so much before actually attempting the real thing myself  


I wanted to try options first because other people told me it was actually the best way to limit your risk if you at least know how to get out of them at the right point and not to sell without a risk strategy; I was just confused on why some option selling trades are super risky but calls you bought you get off the hook for after you sell them, i think that is the part I'm not understanding"
2021-06-11 20:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes you are right. But food for thought. If retail united as one and all bought CLOV it would happen. But you can’t convince GME apes, AMC apes, BB retards to all drop their shares and buy 1 thing. Market makers split us all and at this point there are bag holders at 100K plus in the red. They aren’t letting go of their babies. And I don’t expect them to. The play is move on to the next quick pump or go for a stock that can make it on its own with or without hype. UWMC is actually a strong company that can beat RKT any way. Plus it has a bit of hype + it took CLOV’s place on the Russell index."
2021-06-12 13:38:35,wallstreetbets,Live in the California Bay Area down payment and closing cost me ~200k
2021-06-11 20:36:51,wallstreetbets,Dude if they take over 50% of the wholesale market kennel in addition to moving to The number one mortgage lender in the United States it is it unreasonable to expect four dollars or five dollars per year in earnings. With a 12 x multiple that gets right to my range. I apologize for any typos I’m using voice to text
2021-06-12 03:13:23,wallstreetbets,"Had my Reddit account for way too long. Company is legit and was beaten down for a number of unfair reasons, including its SPAC nature. 

I was following UWMC for a while and decided to buy before earnings. It dipped from 7s to 6s in the week before. I held because of conviction. 

Earnings were great. Guidance was even better. They’re going to kill Q2. And buybacks are amazing for shareholders. 

The share price is now 10.50ish and I’m not selling a share. This is a legit play with a lot of room to run."
2021-06-12 07:29:34,wallstreetbets,"If for some reason the option is illiquid and you can't get a fill for a price better than intrinsic value you may exercise.  Sometimes to capture a dividend.  

If you are planning on holding for over a year you may exercise because it doesn't generate a taxable event."
2021-06-12 05:22:20,wallstreetbets,Thank you! But...not sure if that helped pump the stock...he could've waited until after the interview to do those last 3 rails lol
2021-06-12 18:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Confirmed retarded and holding RKT bags. You shouldn't marry a stock, sell for a loss and ride UWMC to the moon, otherwise go back to your RKT subreddit and cry with the rest of them."
2021-06-12 00:12:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s really not that hard to learn.

What is hard to learn is when to cut your losses, when to take profit, when it’s smart to buy something dumb, and how to unfuck a position.

Example of a recent win… i bought UWMC jul 14c weeks ago and am up 500%. This was a seemingly stupid call when I bought it because the share price was in the 7s. But that allowed me to buy my calls for an .11 avg. so why did I buy it? IV was low and The share price was excessively undervalued and it is a company I want to own as much of as I can. I was up 1300% and didn’t take it because I have a month to go and absolutely believe it’s gonna keep pushing. I took profits by using those calls to sell a poor mans covered call that expires next week. The calls I sold paid triple what I paid to open my position, and would give me a 9x profit if they exercise. So now, no matter what happens, I can’t lose on that position. 

Example of a recent fail: before the WISH run up I bought the 25c because IV was rapidly climbing and I expected it to get much higher. Was up 5x my money. They crashed hard as fuck, so I lowered my average to a point where it won’t be hard to break even. 

But even if that position ends up being a total loss, I’m not overly worried about it because I also bought shares on a dip and opened debit spreads that have plenty of time and potential to make back all losses from the 25c.

Overall, be patient and buy before the run while giving yourself plenty of time to profit. And don’t FOMO into some bullshit you don’t actually want to own just cause it’s up."
2021-06-12 01:52:14,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-12 04:14:20,wallstreetbets,"Ya, you are off the hook after you sell them, but you can lose a lot more money with options than with shares because there is a time limit.  If stock price dips, and your itm call goes otm, they can expire worthless."

2021-06-12 18:05:30,wallstreetbets,"If I had to choose between the two lame stocks, I would buy RKT for sure. It’s at least a growing company and far outpacing UWM in every way. Good luck on the pump and dump"

2021-06-12 04:42:20,wallstreetbets,Wait for Monday’s lock up period expiring. The amount of yolos always seem to be increasing before expiry dates.
2021-06-12 04:56:03,wallstreetbets,I remember you did a scam competition on your tweeter account. I am not sure how can people still follow you.

2021-06-12 12:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Why when you could have put all that into AMC or GME, the ones that are about to moon."
2021-06-12 12:51:34,wallstreetbets,I had some punany and a tossed salad for lunch.
2021-06-12 13:11:21,wallstreetbets,Why tho
2021-06-12 13:11:52,wallstreetbets,Bad move
2021-06-12 13:26:09,wallstreetbets,"An argument can be made for WISH being a value play in the software sector. As of Friday’s close, their p/b sits just north of 6, relative to the SW sector average of 13.34. Current market cap is 5.86B on 2.5B of revenue in 2020 (2.3x last year’s revenue). Revenue is growing at a 34% YoY clip, with 107M average monthly users in 2020, representing 19% YoY growth. They are sitting on 2B in cash/cash equivalent assets, and their ATR is .3512 vs SW sector median of .1225, ranking 6th in the sector out of 291 companies. 

Their asset/liability ratio is also improving at 1.86, ranking 86 in SW sector vs 290 other companies. EPS improved drastically QoQ from Q42020 to Q1 2021, from -.9 to -.2, ranking 114 out of 291 in their sector.

From a technical standpoint, WISH is roughly 70% off of its ATH, and just bounced in the high 7’s. We continue to see rotation back into growth with the Russel outperforming other major indexes. WISH operates in over 100 countries with over 550K partnered merchants, and growing. Analyst coverage breadth is considerable, with most analysts in the 20/share range. WISH got beat up pretty badly at the beginning of the year along with nearly all of growth, but the technicals are pointing to a reversal. MACD is curling back up on the weekly chart, RSI is not overbought on the daily (around 49), we have seen follow through, and sector rotation back into growth is encouraging. Shares profited % is only 6% and change - which can point to much more room to the upside. Thanks for the idea - this one was worthwhile. I started to average in on Friday, and am going to start scooping up some options or selling premium to lower my cost basis moving forward. This has potential to be a big winner."
2021-06-12 13:42:49,wallstreetbets,You wild.

2021-06-11 21:47:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't know how it's booking in other countries, but in Scandinavia they are increasing taxes on Chinese products. If I buy a scooter for 800 euro, I'll have to cough up another 500~700 euro as it hits the customs agency.

2021-06-12 18:38:34,wallstreetbets,They recently updated it. I think it’s great. Very easy to find everything you need about your account. And free level 2
2021-06-11 21:27:19,wallstreetbets,"I've been pretty happy, especially with options. I'm able to quickly lose high percentages of my hard-earned much faster than previous bank-based platforms. Order execution is excellent, and you can get snapshots for 0.01USD to catch up with the 15min delay. 

I think the minimum requirement is $2000 for a margins account, otherwise I think 10/month for maintenance (not charged if your commissions are >10USD/mth)The midprice order is excellent and commission/exchange fees are good IMHO (went from $20-30/trade to $1-2 trade). I get market data.

The GUI is ok - you can customise columns to show your total loss per instrument - the daily loss thing is a bit weird with timing and you get emails about it. Otherwise if you make gains, I guess they would appear as gains? Each to their own."
2021-06-11 22:47:26,wallstreetbets,Yes they are a great choice. I personally use fidelity but you cant go wrong with IBKR if you choose them.
2021-06-11 23:19:00,wallstreetbets,My former day trader sibling prefers IB to anyone else; I use Fidelity myself.
2021-06-12 14:55:04,wallstreetbets,I hated it. They nickel and dime you for data I already pay for elsewhere. I had to type in my cypher code every time the screen changed. I lost money because it made me so angry to do anything on their site or app that I would just refuse to spend ten mins to sell something that would take ten seconds on another platform. Gladly closed it and never looked back.
2021-06-12 05:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Also, when you make an.order on RH, it doesn't provide best order execution. Whenever possible, they delay enough to make a profit between your offered price and real available price.
Example: You ask to buy at 6.90, RH receives your order, executes at 6.89, then sell it to you for a profit of 0.01. 
This sucks especially bad for options, as the spreads are larger, and yes it's easy to buy, but you but at a shittier price. Ask around and see how fast options spread fill on proper brokers versus RH."
2021-06-12 00:09:10,wallstreetbets,"It's more of a ""brokers that sell order flow"" vs ""brokers that charge you a fee on each trade""

&#x200B;

When you go with one of the brokers (E\*TRADE, Webull, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, and Ally Invest. And Interactive Brokers primarily uses its own order routing system, but it still occasionally earns PFOF from over-the-counter market makers for certain stock orders.) using the ""sell order flow"" model; your trades are being routed through to certain players who then can use that information to make a very tiny percentage points on everyone using those platforms by utilizing a number of techniques but mostly just having faster connections to the market.  Since they can see how much the retail investors using these platforms are willing to pay ahead of the trade going through they are able to buy that stock at fractions of a cent less than what you are willing to pay and then sell it to you (or something like that, give me a break I'm a fucking retard ape who spends more time jerking off than actual DD)

&#x200B;

However, some companies — like Fidelity, Merrill Edge and Public — don't accept payment for order routing.  When you go with one of the brokers using a ""fee based"" model, your trade order isn't sold to these players to use.

&#x200B;

If you aren't the customer, you're the product.

2021-06-11 21:04:37,wallstreetbets,"The real question is, will they buy from it again? There's just not enough old women around and the young are more aware of the store being shady."
2021-06-11 20:05:27,wallstreetbets,What was so bad that you had to throw it out on arrival?
2021-06-11 23:15:30,wallstreetbets,Eventually you could reach a point where your calls get hit and your shares get called away with a loss tho.
2021-06-11 23:59:56,wallstreetbets,"But you won't get as much premium for selling a call above your strike if the stock drops, not enough to break even anyway, selling calls below your entry price for the premium sounds like a smart idea to regain the loss but if its exercised then you're at a net loss still."
2021-06-12 17:26:00,wallstreetbets,Only had to return something once threw wish and they instantly refunded me and let me keep the product anyway. With Amazon I had to print off a label and return the old package myself where do you guys get this crap about wish? Yeah it might never be the next Amazon but with 8 billion potential customers searching for a deal on something they don't have to be worth a trillion dollars. A market cap of 200 to 300 bill 5 or 10 years from now is forseeable like buying FB when it was 18 and nobody wanted it or NFLX under 50 before they did a 7 for 1 split!!!!!! IDC dis it all you want time will tell I'm loading up on wish for the long term.

2021-06-12 13:23:30,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much it would cost to build a new Robinhood type app. One that was really about helping retail investors. Even if it charged 10 cents a trade but didn’t sell order flow.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Great Gap Fill Play: $ E B I X (Chart Update for $15+ Upmove) &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6jjfr0trn471.png?width=2791&format=png&auto=webp&s=5969548b1dfd888b7b80dc6799d912fd2f40ec8f

Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nweqj8/greatest_gap_fill_of_all_time_e_b_i_x_only_23m/), the chart has been playing out perfectly and price is set for a quick move to fill the gap.

**Technical Analysis Update:**

* Price has officially confirmed that the $34.00 level turned from resistance into support. With yesterdays (June 10) Daily candle wicking $34.00 and rejecting it, we can see buyers are stepping in to protect that level.
* The red candle from yesterday (June 10) closed with less volume than the uptrend candles the days prior, which is supportive of our bullish thesis. Bullish continuation usually has increasing volume on bullish price with less volume on pullbacks.
* Today's candle is especially bullish as price has cleared above yesterdays and the day prior's high.
* Again, the float of this stock is extremely low, so price can move even more volatile compared to GME.

https://preview.redd.it/sj0gnfl8tn471.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c3a3ef2326fb63327b4b17c52daafa007bde18

**Unusual Option Activity:**

* We are seeing more unusual options coming in, all with Sweep Orders. Sweep orders are the most bullish unusual options in where participants buy fractions of their entire order from different exchanges to hide their purchases from the public eye.

https://preview.redd.it/ml2khxostn471.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7c4997d728cc8419055aa27ef3447d636f060f

**TLDR:** This trade is now confirmed as extremely bullish and it is set for a quick move into $50 minimum."

2021-06-11 22:37:50,wallstreetbets,This is the most juvenile thing I’ve ever seen
2021-06-11 23:07:02,wallstreetbets,"It seems many people commenting seem to think they are measuring intelligence as in IQ where I am pretty sure I heard them mention several times it is EQ or emotional intelligence being measured.

I could be wrong but just looking at them, no way the tubby dude is the smartest of the group & I would say the hot chick could only develop that sort of arrogance by being above average intelligence as in IQ.

By her rant, I would say her being designated the one lowest in EQ falls in line with expectations.

Also the one lowest in EQ would be the least likely to comprehend this so her reaction is exactly what I would expect."
2021-06-12 00:31:09,wallstreetbets,They’re mocking you
2021-06-11 20:35:24,wallstreetbets,Seriously fucking brilliant. We have the smartest ape tribe!

2021-06-11 20:14:51,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts, once BB starts realizing profits for EV software integration then profits will increase exponentially and maybe Blackberry's name will be resurrected and not turn off investors that think it's a washed up mobloe phone company. 
NLOK runs around $28 for security software with subscriptions and BB will be software with vehicle manufactures paying the license for use so very positive outlook for BB."

2021-06-11 21:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I had CLNE calls that were 300% earlier this week. I thought Thursday would be worth more. So I held

If my options didn’t expire on the 18th, I wouldn’t have been as scared but I sold my contracts today for only a 200$ profit instead of 10,000. Which sucks but I learned my lesson.

Longer contracts and sell in the green. Next time will be better."
2021-06-12 05:47:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got three of em $0.00
2021-06-11 20:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Theta is a measure of decay in the value of an option over time. Generally, non-trading days (like weekends) decay the value of your option with zero potential upside (because the markets are closed). Obviously, there are exceptions to every rule but it’s usually better to buy options earlier in the week."
2021-06-11 21:13:16,wallstreetbets,"Yea feels bad to see the gains on wednesday go down on my CLNE options too, but im still holding my 6/18 calls. Hopefully monday treats us well"
2021-06-12 07:29:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I ejected from AMC on May 25th for a 50 percent loss.

2021-06-11 21:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Hope it works out for you. I sold and bought July CLNE calls. 

What am I saying, I don’t hope. It **will**work out for both is us. The question is will it work out soon enough. THATS what I was worried about"
2021-06-11 22:49:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea definitely understand that sentiment, I have longer calls so maybe I should've done the same thing you did and got even more. But I trust that it will work out, good luck friend"

2021-06-12 16:30:43,wallstreetbets,"Some things that make $CLF CEO Lourenco C. Goncalves (aka LG) stand apart from many other CEOs and why I like him so much:

- knows his industry better than anyone on the planet

- invests his personal money in the company

- speaks openly and honestly and does not suffer fools

- had the guts to remake a 174 year old company at a risky time which turned out to be exactly the right time

- did it at an absolute bargain price

- tells the truth about China

- does not spend investor airtime on woke dogma

- seems to have NO PROBLEM finding labor while others are whining

- loves the USA and its workers and makes a point of saying it right into the camera every time he speaks...in his second language no less... when so many won't say it in their first!"

They started literally moving an entire town nearby, building by building, and then half way through the process realized the mine is no longer profitable so they stopped. To this day, half the town is in the new area, and the other half is 5 miles away.

They have also left giant open pits in areas. This is again my states laws, but they put up a fence around it and dropped a picnic bench and called it an “observation site” to get around having to clean up after their mess. Their mess also includes 55 gallon drums of poisons that they have left around the area. I personally called the sheriff to report a 55 gallon drum of cyanide I came across in the woods that they just left.  

They go into communities, take everything they can from the ground, and leave the area significantly worse, without bettering the community."

2021-06-11 22:38:06,wallstreetbets,i congratulate you on your gains. I am rather not as fortunate as you to have the capabilities of buying the quantities you are accumulating. Hoping to magnify my positions.
2021-06-11 23:09:14,wallstreetbets,"Im just joking around. Also, i only have arounf 60k total. Thats my mommys 401k."
2021-06-12 17:10:45,wallstreetbets,"And also, you're pretty much saying that because your stack isnt as big as mine, now you have to make risky options bets. Im not criticizing your position this is WSB i just found it funny you felt the need to bring up my stack which has nothing to do with this. I would be down 50% as well."
2021-06-12 17:50:22,wallstreetbets,"Whether you were joking or not, your initial comment was clearly a mockery of my call options.  Now I’m not too sensitive so it didn’t really bother me which is what garnered the response I gave you. I brought up your stack because I don’t think I would be involved in call options if I had the buying power you did, but I can’t say that for sure simply because I’m not in your position. 

Again, I am looking for dramatic growth in my portfolio rather than slow and gradual. I’m willing to take that risk if I can make five/six digit gains on options since I don’t have the shares or capability to afford shares that could make/lose $200,000 on a single 10% trading day."
2021-06-12 06:14:53,wallstreetbets,"It was fun to see the run up, but CLOV just doesn’t make money. Even if they reach their goals, they will only have 200k subscribers in 8 States, mostly in NJ, by the end of the year. So the company has $800M in current assets and loses more than $100M/quarter. Who wants to pay $6B for that? Even if they do have valuable software, is that enough to turn the company profitable in 2022? ‘23?"

2021-06-12 14:31:36,wallstreetbets,Most of these guys are playing with house money and that's way different from yoloing your life savings....I mean I'm not yoloing either...I worked hard and paid taxes on my money that I invest....so while I do play with all of these memers...I don't yolo

Just turned 50 though and have a wife and kids going to university so I just can’t afford to make huge mistakes.  I’d like to see this guy and all the rest of the apes for that matter win big."

2021-06-11 21:21:07,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but not just yet...lost over 30k the last time CRSR was pumped....but will def buy in when it crosses ATH because that's the best time to lose money on it again"

2021-06-11 21:12:19,wallstreetbets,I like this stock.

2021-06-11 20:04:35,wallstreetbets,I bought Wednesday. This thing is ready for take off. Let’s go gamer crew 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-11 20:35:08,wallstreetbets,I've got 5k shares and a 50 calls for November 35 and 40 strikes.
2021-06-12 09:43:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm in with 200 shares, been adding more consistently the entire year."
2021-06-12 13:27:19,wallstreetbets,Invested on Friday!
2021-06-11 20:49:46,wallstreetbets,"Amazing opportunity.  Eagle Tree is profit taking , which is suppressing the price right now, but that just means more opportunity for apes to  buy buy buy."
2021-06-11 21:20:43,wallstreetbets,"For anyone skeptical about the fundamentals, do outside research.  You will see it has majority buy ratings with average estimate price at $40 something. This has to be the easiest buy when I pulled the trigger.  Absolute worst case it has support at $31, more likely case this is gonna end up $40 or more once the apes start marching.

2021-06-11 21:37:26,wallstreetbets,"I've been telling people for months Corsair , Ford, and Palantir are my favorite looooong term plays this year (so far).

Starting to add UWMC and Switch to that list too.

Insane growth and value."
2021-06-11 22:56:48,wallstreetbets,I love CRSR as potential 🚀🚀🚀.
2021-06-11 23:23:05,wallstreetbets,"Alright, you convinced me. I bought 55 shares for tomorrow. Guess this means I have to buy one of Corsair's fancy gaming PCs in support. Darn..."
2021-06-12 01:00:53,wallstreetbets,"I’m about to buy some calls, I also have NVDA LEAPS, so this is like the BECKY for guys."
2021-06-11 21:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm in CRSR. 1,000 shares and some July options. That and TWNK are my plays, holding both CRSR and TWNK over the weekend"
2021-06-11 21:29:59,wallstreetbets,"I've got $6k in November $30 and $35 calls. I'll add $2k more everytime it dips below $31.25 this month. Someone mentioned this is low risk, medium reward, and I wholly agree."
2021-06-11 22:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Share gang for me until a catalyst like earnings or just general mid cap tech starts being rotated into more heavily, then loading up on some late 2021/early 2022 calls."
2021-06-11 22:21:01,wallstreetbets,"In for 1000 @ 36.41 have been selling CC @ 35/40 and have an adjusted cost basis under $30, probably going to acquire new shares through CSP going forward and hold onto the 1000 shares uncollateralized"
2021-06-11 23:03:22,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is one of the worst performing stocks in my portfolio, but I like the stock. This company is a staple of the gaming industry so I'm in it for the long haul"
2021-06-11 23:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Well they make a lot of overpriced underperforming products (notably cases and fans), but I like colors and grapefruit so I guess I'm in."
2021-06-12 10:43:05,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is actually a good company and it’s still early to get in, hasn’t memed yet. Buying more shares Monday along with TWNK this is primed for liftoff 🚀"
2021-06-12 12:33:26,wallstreetbets,CRSR is growing really fast. This is the best tool I am using to analyze their financials: https://www.easyfinancialcharts.com/c/dashboard/crsr
2021-06-12 05:38:45,wallstreetbets,Corsair is waayyy to profitable for WSB to even consider.
2021-06-12 04:52:23,wallstreetbets,Currently holding 531 shares and will increase my position as long as EagleTree reduces their positions and keep the prices around the $30-35 range. My short/mid-term price target is around $60 however willing to change my opinion if they increase their margins meaningfully or the streaming industry grows faster than expected.
2021-06-12 03:19:46,wallstreetbets,"You don't mention the situation with eagle tree, the institution that holds over 60% of the shares. They are obligated to have below 10% 5 years from now so that means that there is a certain selling pressure. Regardless, the stock will rise, those of us who are pc gamers know the beast that is Corsair"
2021-06-11 20:17:08,wallstreetbets,"Been wheeling crsr for a while now, my brother put me on , stays between 30-35 for the most part"
2021-06-11 20:36:48,wallstreetbets,Ive been averaging down since it was at 50.  RIP my 50c at least they are in November.
2021-06-11 21:17:50,wallstreetbets,I read this exact same DD back in February about it being so undervalued when the stock price was $40+
2021-06-11 21:19:25,wallstreetbets,259 Shares in and few calls. I have been bullish into  this company for months. People still don't realize how big Corsair is. Much more than components and keyboards.
2021-06-11 22:06:12,wallstreetbets,U should buy !
2021-06-11 22:17:48,wallstreetbets,"Why CRSR? For what, computer parts? Whats to stop China from undercutting them?"
2021-06-12 00:24:43,wallstreetbets,Sounds good to me
2021-06-12 06:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the graphs, there’s definitely growth. But also looking at their graphs makes me a little bearish"
2021-06-11 23:37:12,wallstreetbets,"CRSR, in their own words, is in a highly competitive space, depends on CPU and GPU manufacturers to constantly increase power usage (hint: that’s NOT what chip manufacturers are trying to do) to sell their PSUs, and had their top 10 customers account for well over half their revenue and these customers do not sign long term contracts. Sure CRSR may defy the odds, and I made some money swing trading them before their Q1 earnings, but definitely not a foolproof money printer."
2021-06-12 10:58:59,wallstreetbets,Why is it there has been so much insider selling from the CEO’s of recent if they’re so promising? Have you seen the SEC form 4 forms from July
2021-06-12 13:02:28,wallstreetbets,People been saying this since January and it's only gone down
2021-06-12 05:41:54,wallstreetbets,Well why are they priced so cheaply then? What's the bear thesis?
2021-06-12 01:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Projected revenue was actually raised to 2.25bb, will probably end up being 2.5"
2021-06-11 20:57:37,wallstreetbets,">3) A huge part of the world are still in the process of getting access to the internet and computers, it's a never ending growth for the next coming 50 years (probably more like 80-100 years), imagine when India with the population of 1.3b gets to 75-85% access to the internet. Today it's at 50%.

This is the part I'd be most dubious of. It's way more likely that almost all personal computer use is replaced with streaming out of datacenters within 25 years. That is really probably the longterm strategic risk to everyone primarily in the consumer hardware business."
2021-06-12 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,"I decided to look at this via wave theory / TA and I think  this thing has $40 inbound very soon.  I got in Friday but will look to add more if I can   get lucky and get any slight pullback from rejection at the 50% retracement resistance.

2021-06-11 23:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Sure, 1 out of every 2.5 people on this planet will be a “gamer” because they downloaded (shitty mobile rts game), but that doesn’t exactly translate to market dominance for Corsair. Not to mention they explicitly call out in their prospectus that more than half of all of their net revenue comes from 10 clients who do not engage in long term contracts. AND they call out that their peripherals depend on chip manufacturers making more power hungry PC parts to create demand for better PSUs. Given that the major focus on chips the last few years is power efficiency, that seems counterintuitive for a long term strategy."
2021-06-11 20:40:42,wallstreetbets,"logi does peripherals as their mainstay, corsair does nitty gritty shit that actually has a bearing on computing AND peripheral stuff"
2021-06-11 21:09:26,wallstreetbets,"300 in 5 years is not realistic. I agree with basically everything else you said...but this is not a tech company, it's a manufacturer. I expect crsr to outperform a majority of companies in that time, but its not likely to 10x"
2021-06-11 20:46:41,wallstreetbets,"Corsair does more than LOGI, but let’s say for a moment they are equal.  LOGI current trades at $120.  So getting the stock sub $100 sounds like a fantastic deal to me!"
2021-06-11 21:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Great place to yolo on shares, would not suggest going deep in calls.

Risk reward is great, it seems to have pretty strong support consistently in the low 30s"
2021-06-12 09:27:54,wallstreetbets,When is the expiration? And what is the strike price? I am planning to go for it on Monday.
2021-06-11 21:18:30,wallstreetbets,Lets get those CRSR bananas I yoloed too
2021-06-11 20:17:42,wallstreetbets,I've been bag holding since $39.50 🥴

Reading that they are required to sell till 10% ownership. Really big sandbag, but they can't just randomly sell as they are insiders. Wouldn't buy calls because of that, but shares are solid, especially with ccs"
2021-06-12 18:02:32,wallstreetbets,Where can you find this out?
2021-06-12 03:48:41,wallstreetbets,Where do you see that? Thought I saw only 6.5%

2021-06-12 02:51:14,wallstreetbets,"EagleTree, a private equity firm bought corsair in 2017. As part of the ipo they need to unwind their share positions, which has put a damper on the stock going to 60 or much higher numbers. The stock still never dipped past double their ipo price (30), without having major support from retail investors."
2021-06-12 02:43:23,wallstreetbets,"This guy options.

CSPs is the way for corsair. IV would need to spike a bit though."

2021-06-12 10:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Eagle tree selling pressure will be far less substantial as volume increases. Additionally, it’s very possible they have set yearly sell targets that they’re already close to fulfilling between this last sale and January’s non dilutive offering"
2021-06-11 23:39:56,wallstreetbets,"doing my part in GME, AMC, and CRSR"
2021-06-11 21:23:10,wallstreetbets,The stock is not undervalued because people think is expensive at 40. You can clearly see how between eagle tree capital taking profits and few founds manipulating price in order to gain options is destroying cotization. If some apes give some love and keep the price above 35 and steal some stocks from eagle tree we will be more than ok. Just needs some ape love. They literally dumped 6% with just 50.000 stocks on after market. Is a shame and too obvious.
2021-06-11 23:32:53,wallstreetbets,"lol! FUD?  I have AMC, GME, and CRSR and a few others but mostly AMC GME and CRSR. In it to win it!"
2021-06-12 06:17:12,wallstreetbets,Well the stock has been trading sideways so Implied volatility is low and both calls as well as puts are very cheap.

Shares are the way for crsr though, imo. Far otm CCs have great returns while it slowly wakes back up"
2021-06-12 01:24:36,wallstreetbets,I have shares but thinking of adding leaps. Vol is way down. Maybe base building here before launch off ? Could easily be $60 a share.

2021-06-11 20:10:21,wallstreetbets,Bought too many at 39 then many more at 30. This chart has looked ready to pop for months
2021-06-12 07:42:11,wallstreetbets,"I just look at inflows and outflows of shares. Which institutions are buying or selling, and how many hedge funds are adding positions in general. Also helpful to get a good breakdown of who currently owns corsair and how much they own of it. You can also use it as a hedge fund track and find new plays. Like following Michael burry and seeing what he does with scion capital is always interesting, especially since he was the first to come up with the gamestop thesis."

2021-06-12 13:48:06,wallstreetbets,To an extent this is probably already priced in and why the stock is so cheap. Im going to be holding some long-dated debit spreads as we're already seeing supply pick up.

2021-06-12 09:17:40,wallstreetbets,"Edit: Nvm, reading that the eagletree 10% thing may be fake news

Read elsewhere in comments that eagletree (major shareholder) has 50 mill more shares they are obligated to dump (have to go under 10% ownership).  If this is true, that is likely why the stock has been depressed for so many months, and will likely to remain that way outside of temporary runs.  I'm super bullish on CRSR and have a large position in shares and a few leaps I regret buying, but I think the upside may not be as crazy as people hope until after they are done unloading"

Edit: because the investors are paying management fees to the PE firm, they want the fund to close and give back the money.
However CRSR has been super lucrative to the PE firm, with over 500% returns in just 3 years."

2021-06-11 23:08:22,wallstreetbets,"People still need to be buying CPUs and GPUs to buy Corsair components like RAM, cooling, etc. They also own Origin PC Gaming PCs which is probably slowing down due to chip shortages.

It will affect them, but either way, Corsair is a wicked long term /r/investing stock even if this year is a hiccup"
2021-06-12 00:20:35,wallstreetbets,"They have to file with the SEC when they sell, I think so far there was only one filing for a 5 million share sale, but I could have missed something"
2021-06-12 07:11:42,wallstreetbets,"So they likely will sell on all the price spikes, but don't want to sell too cheap?

Do you think microchips are only in GPUs? They're in mice as well now that I think about it, how do you think the mouse takes the input and converts it to a signal for the computer? 

Jesus what an uninformed take and it's getting upvotes. I guess the issue is that people (myself included) use ""microchip"" when it's really a semiconductor shortage and they are used in everything."

2021-06-12 02:35:12,wallstreetbets,"They do. Headphones, keyboards, mice, they all use microchips/semiconductors and are affected by the shortage, that dude is 100% wrong"
2021-06-11 21:30:26,wallstreetbets,A lot of consumers are unable to build new PC's due to the GPU and CPU shortage. I believe Corsair will continue to do well as the major components become more available with the changes coming in eth we could see more new PC builds. People are just sitting around on old hardware so no sense in buying new cases and going water cooling when you can't get a CPU or GPU right now.

1) They are in the forefront of AI driven approach for cyber security solutions. Their code was effective against the recent colonial pipeline cyber attack and their systems are widely used by the US govt.

2) Their partnership with Amazon for Ivy, and qnx, their other offering in the EV OS platform. Some 175mil cars already use this.

3) Patents/ litigation settlement with FB.

I'm actually thankful for the meme stocks for bringing my attention to BB. Sure I'm using the ongoing volatility for some quick profits, but I'm going long on this. It'll be interesting to see how they compete with rivals (right now there aren't any) like Google in the future.

&#x200B;

* Apple wanted to buy Canoo during the first half of 2020
* Canoo didn't want to sell (at least not at the price Apple was offering then)
* Now Apple hires Canoo's former CEO as they try to bring a car to market as quickly as possible, and he knows better than anyone how perfect Canoo's skateboard would be for Apple, because it was literally his life's work and the totality of his earned expertise, poured into a single platform
* No reason to believe Apple couldn't go back to Canoo with a new, far more compelling offer now.
* If they made a deal, it would allow Apple to get to market years earlier than they otherwise could without GOEV.
* And it would simultaneously give Apple the only platform in the world that has been purpose built for a driverless future.

At some point Tootsie will explode. To many people are watching it and Algo's trade it as a pairing on this sub."
2021-06-12 11:19:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought options at a $50 strike price, meaning im expecting Tootsie to shoot up close to $50 soon. These contracts expire in 190 days so I have until December of 2021 for my thesis to come true. See below video for an expiation for options. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJgHkAqohbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJgHkAqohbU)

Overall Tootsie for me represents a massive opportunity for a little risk. Since Implied Volatility is around 40% then if Tootsie gets any volume and trends upwards then we will see $TR explode and the volatility go from 40% up to 120% which will drastically increase the price of the options. The shares will increase in price as more volume is added as well."

2021-06-12 04:46:21,wallstreetbets,"so i just glanced at the financials

negative EPS - not great however its not that bad
negative return on assets and equities - usually you want those to be at least 5%
More total current assets than total liabilities - absolutely great, they can cover any debts they may have
Revenues down - not great however we can blame covid for that
Less shares isssued over time - means they're buying their shares back. shows confidence in the company, great thing
positive free cash flow - its a good thing however its not much but at least its positive
negative profit margin - not great but it should be improving as Biden and the rest of the G7 are pushing for clean energy

my verdict - seems good on paper plus clean energy has very good growth potential with government subsidies and stuff for clean energies. i'll do some technicals later and maybe add it to my portfolio after i close my position on wheat

2021-06-11 20:00:23,wallstreetbets,Apple needs a car out to compete in the luxury EV segment within 2 years to fill the void that Tesla left when they downgraded their badge to economy. 3-5 years doesn’t cut it.
2021-06-11 20:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. How will Apple create their car in 2 years when it takes 3-5 years to create from scratch? No matter how much money they throw at trying to develop in-house, they still have to pass crash tests and etc. They’ve already tried making this in-house under Doug Field- they learned even they cannot do it.

One way would be to partner with an existing manufacturer. Every single one has turned a partnership with Apple down. They’re just not setup to  act contract manufacturers for others.

The alternative would be acquiring a company such as Canoo or at least licensing their skateboard, in order to give them the jump start they need. Canoo is currently at $2b market cap and paying 2x or even 3x would still be tens of billions of dollars cheaper than their next competitor."

2021-06-11 22:39:02,wallstreetbets,"To be a contrarian:

I would say there are issues from number 3 in the OP and down.

1.  MAPs pay more than OG Medicare to institutions

2.  ~50,000 members is nothing

3.  Expanding Medicare age is laughable for expecting major market share changes.  Think about when people retire (age), who actually can afford care with extra premiums if they work at job with no benefits at 60+. Medicaid and OG Medicare will pickup more, but premium based plans are not.

4.  I would say Machine Learning for the brokered insurance plans are not going to wash away inadequacies of health systems or cost drivers from waste, drug/device companies, or general population of fat/lazy American citizens (look at their current footprint’s demos lol).  They still have to contract with these inefficient health systems, practices, independent physicans, etc.

If you want to “improve” Medicare costs you implement at an OG level so you see utilization across all regions.  In reality that just means more cost shifted to patients either via non-coverage determinations or via contractuals, which means higher charges on other things.

If the share price goes up it will have little to do with longevity/competitiveness of this small time MA player lol.

There is so much that goes into UHC, Humana, BCBS, etc dominating in the MA space.  A company that is trying circumvent, I just don’t see it working.  Maybe they carve out a very small piece, but can’t see them dethroning anyone.

* I have no positions in CLOV, no plans on any."

2021-06-12 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,No need to sell. Be patient. I was in the same situation with AMC.  Missed the big trip and made a small profit to get out of the stock.  Kicking myself in the head.  Lesson learned.

2021-06-11 20:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Good question, not totally sure how that works."
2021-06-11 20:24:13,wallstreetbets,"I see. So the issue is that the public shareholders is 2.6% and not 5? I still don'tt get why removal from the index doesn't have to do w/ the free float, because I thought that the total percentage of of public shares available for trading, and so the index's rule about 5% of voting power belonging to ""(free float) share holders."" To clarify, I wasn't saying that there was less than 5% free float, but rather that > 5% of voting rights belong to free float shareholders. Am I misunderstanding the meaning of free float?"
2021-06-11 20:27:55,wallstreetbets,Voting power for class A shares is 10x less than class B shares. Each 1 class B share has 10 voting share power. Whereas each 1 class A share has 1 voting share power. Class B shares are not traded shares.
2021-06-11 20:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i get that, and thank you. just got confused about what free float meant. Im not trying to say the exclusion is a good or bad thing btw. It just seemed like the exclusion did have to do with the lack of common shares being held (as well as the percentage of voting power afforded to each share) - thats all!

But he’s right that the smallest coins package that covers the cost of the blow reward on its own is the 40k coins for $100 package.

Edit: on second thought you can also get 3100 coins for $10. So the lowest possible price for the blow reward if you have no coins in the first place is $30."

It was literally the best investment on the market & getting even better as time goes by. I’m not gonna bow down to these hedge funds & let them tell me what I can and can’t invest in when they’re dumb as fuck

I actually can’t believe the SEC after 5 months are still looking for ways to regulate retail investors (atleast that’s what I heard on CNBC the other day), the very people who helped two companies out of bankruptcy in unfortunate times which provide real value to real people. Truth is they’re never going to find ways to regulate retail investors because there is none

As such we would need to outlaw humans being human, people working together for a common goal, and groups working as one....oh man there goes every business, social group and family (can’t have a family without a pair who believe at some point they have something in common even if it is only that they want time in the sack at the same time).ILLEGAL....LOCK EM ALL UP FOR BEING HUMAN...."

2021-06-12 15:27:59,wallstreetbets,"You seem pretty pretentious, you think this social justice bs matters? It's just another ego trip for people who are too lazy or incapable of lifting themselves out of poverty. It's just another way to cope. There are only two types of people in the market, the skilled and the unskilled, you are either hoping to get lucky (gambling) as an unskilled person or just delusional. It takes years of experience usually at least  several to even become profitable on a regular basis, you think the market makers won't win? Like the past 100 years haven't proven they will? You don't know anything about my dreams so don't waste your time making wild assumptions about my character because I am a trader. I regularly pull 7 figures a year out of the market and if you would bother to do some research you would see that I post some of those plays for other people to ACTUALLY make money, instead of wild guesswork and bullshit about overthrowing the ""hedge funds"" who do you think pumped it up? They will leave you bag holding if you don't take profits. look at DRYS because that is what they will do to all of you."

This however has no relation on my mental instability, ohhhhh wait....now I understand....
Should I have made this purchase, and spent $30 and still be 700 coins short, it would be enough to drive me to mental instability...now I see....phew I didn’t buy them...or did I?"

- Complete the Market Maker Registration Form (PDF) 

- Have your clearing agency call the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) to ensure a clearing arrangement.

- Contact the local FINRA District Office to express an interest in becoming a NASDAQ market maker.

- Compile all information, and send it to the local FINRA District Office for review to see if you are qualified to be a NASDAQ market maker.)

- The FINRA District Office will forward an approval form to NASDAQ’s Subscriber Services department. (If your firm is not a FINRA member, the approval will be made by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.)

- A NASDAQ Subscriber Services representative will notify you if you are permitted to make markets and will activate all your services

2021-06-12 04:45:32,wallstreetbets,"You have it at the 15 call strike. My advice is dont get greedy. We can salvage this if we get another run up. 

What you will do is if it shoots up to where options premiums are around 3 dollars again sell what is called a ""back ratio"" 
at the 16 and the 17 or 18 strike price .

What this means is you will be selling 2 contracts at 16 and buying an additional contract at either 17 or 18. Do this enough times so that you make a butterfly spread with your existing options.

Edit: 

So your postion will be 

+52 at 15
-104 at 16
+52 at 18

The premium from selling the 16 should get you a bunch of your money back. 

Then from now on when betting on meme stocks. Always spreads!

It limits your upside but prevents a GUHH! Moment from occuring"

Great DD for sure.  Thanks for posting."

2021-06-12 00:19:11,wallstreetbets,Good point
2021-06-11 20:26:58,wallstreetbets,"You don't know your history clearly.  If you wanted to be completely technical about profits, I'm not sure exactly how many were completely negative, but they tried to operate at a 0 net cash flow up until 2016.  They went public in 1997, and made little to no money at all until the end of 2016.  Since the end of 2016-2021, they have changed their focus from market share to earnings.  That's 20 years of essentially little to no earnings to build the platform they have today."
2021-06-12 11:40:13,wallstreetbets,"I don’t gamble which is why I’ve never had a year where I’m up 100%.  My best year ever is about 130%.  That being said, if you wanted to increase the return, I’d recommend 2023 leaps deep in the money.  Stocks can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
2021-06-12 10:34:23,wallstreetbets,"Actually the quality of loans exceeds all other lenders in the US.  The reason for this is that they are a fintech company.  They have contracts with other companies like Intuit, Schwab, etc...

2021-06-12 01:17:35,wallstreetbets,"I haven't been following TX and didn't realize the absolute beast it appear to be(gotta do DD), what are the general EOY price targets on it."
2021-06-12 19:29:56,wallstreetbets,What's the downside?
2021-06-11 22:19:24,wallstreetbets,"The primary point of my reply was that the way MT & TX operate in Latin America are essentially congruent. Both companies observe substantial risks correlated with the Mexico & Latin American emerging markets. 

However, because TX's Mexico/Latin American operations are a proportionately larger part of the entire company's operations, TX harbors much greater risk than MT in the overall scope. 

For example, TX's 2020 Annual Report (F-20) states a huge risk for investors: ""Ternium’s most significant market in the Southern Region is Argentina, which in 2020 accounted for approximately 94% of sales in the Southern Region"" (pg. 50)

In addition, you have to be more careful when selecting metrics for comparisons between companies. Using commensurate metrics will allow you to better judge how MT & TX actually compare. 

For example, below are figures derived from the respective companies' 2020 Annual Report (20-F):

- MT Mexico - **iron ore** mining (2020): 6.6 mt/yr
- TX Mexico - **iron ore** mining (2020): 3.8mt/yr

- MT Mexico - **crude steel (slab)** production (2020): 3.6mt/yr
- TX Mexico - **crude steel (slab)** production (2020):  2.4mt/yr  

- MT Mexico - **finished steel** products (2020): 1.7mt/yr
- TX Mexico - **finished steel** products (2020): 7.6mt/yr

*as indicated in TX 2020 Annual Report, this amount of finished steel consumes 100% of TX's Mexico crude steel production and TX purchases the rest of their crude steel needs primarily from ArcelorMittal (pg. 52)


Additional Latin America comparisons: 

- MT Brazil - **iron ore** mining (2020): 5.1 mt/yr
- TX Brazil - **iron ore** mining (2020): 0 mt/yr

- MT Brazil - **crude steel (slab)** production (2020): 8.7mt/yr
- TX Brazil - **crude steel (slab)** production (2020): 5.0mt/yr

- MT Brazil - **finished steel** products (2020): 9.4mt/yr
- TX Brazil - **finished steel** products (2020): 
0 mt/yr 

Lastly, the reported metrics you referenced for $/ton are not comparable. TX uses ""revenue"" while MT uses ""net revenue"" to calculate their average selling price ($/ton). The difference between these is that revenue is a straight calculation of net dollars ($)/tons shipped, while MT incorporates costs and expenses (labor, raw material, marketing, shipping, etc.)

Since revenue is more straight forward, let's calculate it ourselves for both companies for 2021 Q1 quarter: 

**""Revenue ($)/Ton"" = Net Sales ($)/Tons**

- TX Mexico - Net Sales (Q1 2021): $1810.8 (millions) 
- TX Mexico - Shipments (Q1 2021): 1,699 (kilotons)
> **TX $/ton= $1,066/ton**


- MT NAFTA - Net Sales (Q1 2021): $2536 (millions)
- MT NAFTA - Shipments (Q1 2021): 2,511 (kiltons)
> **MT $/ton= $1,010/ton**

Hopefully this helps you have a more accurate idea of how MT and TX compare. In general for the Mexico/Latin America markets, MT is geared for crude steel (slabs) because that's where the iron ore/raw materials/cheap labor is (operational efficiency), while TX takes that crude steel to create finished steel products (higher margin). Although they are technically competitors, both companies can be successful in the 'Americas' market and even work together as we see in their 50%/50% joint partnership of the Peña Colorada, Mexico iron mines & processing facilities.

2021-06-11 22:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Very good information. I indeed stand corrected in regards to $MT's NAFTA revenue. Thanks for breaking this down!

I don't believe $TX has substantial more risk involved as their new Mexican plant makes even more of their business grounded in Mexico. The USA isn't going to let their land border of Mexico become unstable for obvious reasons. But we can disagree on the risk Mexico presents for the company.

The Southern Region of $TX is indeed a risk in terms of that portion of their revenue. I don't personally see it as a short term concern but would agree that the area is less stable than the USA, Canada, or Europe for the longer term timeframe."

2021-06-11 20:02:29,wallstreetbets,Nope 15k down the drain in BB calls. Im okay with it because I made 6k profit with AMC calls this week and bought some more AMC calls expiring in July worth about 15k
2021-06-12 13:54:56,wallstreetbets,Wait didn’t it? I think that 65 dollars per share didn’t come close. I thought it settled at right under 50.
2021-06-12 12:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Good luck friend, may the tendies rain plenty!"
2021-06-11 21:36:29,wallstreetbets,"It went up today, congrats."
2021-06-12 00:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so it barely made it but didn’t do it. I think making $50 was very important due to the options but my theory may have become a little unhinged because there were a few factors on the “memestocks” I couldn’t have accounted for and part of it may be due to coincidence. Let me think about it over the weekend. 

Problem with the last 2 days was what seemed like the GameStop shares selling in blocks to raise their capital and what effect that could have had on the other stocks. 

It seems like the options expiring today really only worked if you bought 0DTE Near the bottom at 42. Did they end up being profitable at all? I had same day $260 GME that I bought for $0.30 and even those sucked the life out of me. 

In my opinion the options market is a huge determining factor on how things play out especially on expiration day. AMC had trouble closing above $50 several fridays in a row now and I bet that’s no coincidence. There would have been millions of shares needed to deliver next week T+2 with buying starting Tuesday if closing over $50. 

What Makes sense to me is that options expiration dates at certain critical prices aren’t important just for that date but can cause a cascade of future events. If a certain strike is surpassed and people start exercising calls then they will have the shares settle the following week. I think the Friday’s this month are especially important for the longs because amc was $8 just last month so if shorts are getting margin called you have something like T+2 or T+5 to start covering depending on what kind of a fund you are. (I could be wrong) and above $50 is likely a big danger zone for a lot of the smaller funds. Long whales would want every Friday to hit those closing strikes and create pressure the following week when those shares need to be delivered. Each weeks closing price can either compound a problem for your opponent by forcing market makers to deliver the shares and some smaller funds to cover the following week (making next weeks buying pressure increase) or take away steam from your own position. 

With amc and GME likely being added to the Russell 1000 end of June, these weekly and monthly calls with high OI could add a lot of upwards momentum in actually raising the floor leading up to it. 

June25 ( Friday) and June 28 (Monday) are T+21 / T+35 FTD cycles for GME and that will create tons of buying pressure. I can’t say what AMC’s FTD cycles are but I bet they will move together once again as they always do. as a long you’d want as much momentum going into this to allow your rocket to reach new heights every T+21/T+35 FTD crossover cycle. 

So we saw this reversal happen on March 25 which was an FTD day for GME. AMC rebounded as well. 

Monday June 15 is a small T+21 FTD cycle for GME so let’s say GME and AMC closed above critical strikes today. Monday there might be some buying pressure from the FTD’s, Tuesday buying pressure from delivering the shares exercised from massive OI on $50 calls, that gives you good momentum going into the monthly options Expiring June-18. Makes it easier to now hit $50, $60 again on strikes. This gives you cushion to fall even if you get shorted and still land above some important strikes on a Friday. 

Repeat that again the following week and do it again June 25 when Russell rebalancing starts and AMC and GME both get buying pressure from ETF’s. 

Then starting week of June 28 you have your your FTD cycles crossing over and further buying pressure. 

So IMO, I think there’s this calendar of the options going right to allow the subsequent weeks to play out in your favor whether long or short. 

Just a theory don’t know if that makes sense but today was a bit messy. I’m sorry for your loss porn. We just ended a big FTD cycle so I think even if you got the lowest price yesterday on the calls the whole day of theta decay and last minute move up on SPY AMC and GME was not enough to make up for the premium. Would have needed to play 0DTE.

I think going into the week of June28 will be much better for options. Let the IV come down a bit, consolidation, premiums become lower, and off to another repeat of march10, may25 runs.

Keep an eye out for CLOV to try and close above $20 next week. Closing above $15 this week IMO was very important."

...but it all comes comes to money. If you saw the waste on useless shit and the lack of basic necessities due to ""not enough money"" you'd laugh your ass off on betting anything on this."

You might actually learn something you didn't know, but thought you did. I doubt it though, I mean, in your comments on this post, you sound like you know every actual thing about everything bro. And I am positive some of your comments just aren't factual, but my momma taught me that to argue with a fool makes you a fool too. Gl in your investments! 😁"

If they say it'll take one year they mean twelve years... I'm not even kidding 

I see the shares as wasted potential where that money could be used elsewhere. But if you want something like a CD that pays .003% maybe workhorse will outdo that lol

I followed this bidding process for years and it's nowhere near complete. Event the contract award is being sued and held up by new administration as well and OIG. Just.... you'll see Tupac write a new song before then."

I posted a disclaimer that this was a high risk to reward play for a reason. Name one person who has every options play hit... you can’t. This is why you scale down the position, high risk big upside that’s a classic FD. But if this play hits once every 19 times it pays for all the other plays. So I do actually have an options strategy, it just didn’t hit. That’s how options work..."

2021-06-12 02:57:45,wallstreetbets,"Sure but it's really prolonging the inevitable. Come 2023, they MIGHT have positive cash flows but the unfortunate trend is towards streaming services. Now that TV shows are becoming equally as quality as movies, the cash flows will just trend towards 10 episodes with people paying a subscription over one time blockbusters; it saves so much on CapEx (no movie theaters to maintain) and is so much more sustainable revenue wise (relatively cheap monthly and easily accessible library of extremely good movies and TV shows from most devices).

Moreover, the pandemic has really forced people to reevaluate how they spend their time, so much so it's even affecting low-wage job numbers. I have severe doubts people want to spend 20 dollars on a ticket, 10 on popcorn, or 8 on a shitty nachos, let alone smell it in the theater when watching a movie. And with those prices, AMC will \*still\* be losing money.

With most of, if not the entire AMC executive board selling instead of buying more shares, it's enough to show you that they don't even have faith in the business and are just more keen on pocketing money rather than help the business thrive.

Point is, don't overvalue the retail investor in this case, despite how extensively this bubble is being covered. I don't mean to be that guy who rains on a parade but a lot of people are legitimately losing money to this, with all the loses are just benefiting the executives at AMC."
2021-06-11 20:21:19,wallstreetbets,"AMC is liquidating it assets thru new stock offerings in order to pay interest and rent. Without that they would have been bankrupt this year. They need to do that again to avoid a bankruptcy in two years as they still can't service their debt and overhead through revenue. Before their recent shares offering,  the interest on debt, rent, and wages all owed in 2021 was more than AMC has ever made in revenue.

As soon as AMC can refinance their debt and/or pay a lot of it down, then they will be looking good."

2021-06-12 06:06:57,wallstreetbets,Let’s look even further ahead where they will have a transmitter and sensor all in one implanted so that there will be nothing worn on the skin at all. The sensor will be a little bit longer due to adding the transmitter but it’s a little bit bigger than a grain of rice right now. At that point the 365 will at a maximum require a weekly calibration. The implications of tracking other analyses are important but diabetes will be the main focus for senseonics. But monitoring cholesterol would be a good start as well it’s uses for patients with cardiac disease.

2.i have no idea how the venison backstrap I pulled off the deer I shot is ""high processed."" I mean yeah I had to skin the deer and pull it off so that's technically processed? How is my washed broccoli processed?

3. Salmonella can hit anyone. And brits have cases. There is exactly zero countries with zero cases. Quitcher bullshit. And we have way more people and chickens so statistically would be likelier anyways. Apples to oranges with lies sprinkled in like the typical brainwashed government worshipping brit. Lmao.

4. I wouldn't know. I don't care for sugar. Doesn't mean I won't eat it I just don't seek it. Sometimes I do sometimes I don't. But then this beer I'm drinking has starches in it so I guess I'm going to die a sweet toothed drunk. Boohoo.

2021-06-12 07:33:46,wallstreetbets,"It was a meme around here a while ago. There was a pretty big RKT vs UWMC war that divided the sub. That's how I learned about it. The war died as both stocks got beaten to death on the fears of higher interest rates destroying their earnings.

Basically the key on this sub is to filter by DD, then to find the 10-15 companies that show up every week and do your own DD on them. UWMC came out on top as a conviction play for me based on their fundamentals so I went all in and averaged down as much as possible through the dip. I went from $80k ish to $30k but like I said, it was a conviction play for me so I trusted my DD (and I only buy longer dated options) so I just held and added as much as I could. 

I'm back up to $160k now and definitely still holding :)
