03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit this is like gme but better... Putting $0 on it I will be a gme ape until the end (sorry)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,First news article i see says amrs overvalued
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a 22c for 5/21 that's been bleeding for a hot minute now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come on we're retarded apes, but we're not that fucking stupid... This would be a classic case of buy high sell low..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Done
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at ENPH's price chart. Many probably said the same thing at this point for that company too....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm waiting for mid teens maybe 12. almost jumped at 18 the other day...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm you son of a bitch

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean that auto-generated Yahoo Finance / Guru-focus article? Totally worthless.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So buying GME at its current prices isn't buying high and selling low? This whole sub does that, so thats a bad argument..


This company is in the early innings of it's growth and is poised for huge returns this year, even at this current price after it's run up"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"i am long amrs but there is a huge difference between 1000% returns and 10,000%..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I shall respect the poo poo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of my ENPH was purchased between $30 and $60. Made some more with calls. Made a fortune. There's no telling how far AMRS can run....but the point stands. If you didn't buy ENPH at $20 because you were mad you didn't get it at $1, you missed a huge opportunity"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really wanna get in BB with 1000 shares but there is absolutely no catalyst. Please tell me why I am wrong. What will make this stock move? If it wasn't called BB it would be 100+ by now off of hype alone!!! The only legit catalyst would be revenue and profitability. 700k is a lot. Might be 7 million one day. I want to buy but I feel like it just won't move. 

I've been thinking about this stock so much that it's been driving me crazy"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sheesh. You’re the DFV of $BB.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You crazy son of a bitch, I love it"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the earnings will indeed be good... unfortunately the stock has went parabolic with the reddit wallstreetbets craze and earnings may have been priced in already

One can hope but if this year has taught me anything is the better the earnings the worse the stock does that week."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I'm a buyer at $7.50 based on the Weekly Chart ... Best of luck!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont forget you can diversify with some nok shares.  The great thing about nok is its arguably the best sideways trading stock in the entire market, so for every dollar you put in thats a dollar you didnt put into another stock but you still get that casino feeling, like that one person you know who goes to the casino for the cheap food, but deep down they really just like watching everyone throw money into a machine thats designed from the factory to steal their money"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you're being sarcastic. They haven't made phones since 2016
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be a catalyst for the share to pop. Good news tends to make it tank.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tuesday.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your post history shows a previous love for bb. Probably sold before it’s spike. Ape
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought my $16 was bad
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit! no way

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean getting a partnership with one of the worlds largest companies (Amazon) seems like they are doing something right.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently it’s also very difficult to invest in bonds. Tldr-same thing as putting your money in the bank. Ape
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why aren’t you guys averaging down?  This is a great candidate to average down on.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ain't in the habit of predictions. I want exposure n payoff. 

The rest is noise. 

I will post screenshots of my 2. Blackberry keyones. 

Stop downvoting me u linear humans. U r dealing wit an ape."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I went deep with 2000 shares near the peak of that GME / BB mania. I’d like to average down but I’m already overexposed.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged down this past week.  From 21 to 15
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey I was wondering, if its not too much trouble, could you possibly lick my scrotum cheese?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just saying sup @ 20.14CAD

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedgies must just crap there pants when they see this 😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m going to buy a Nintendo switch from GameStop and go play it while watching a movie at an AMC theater
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I am overjoyed that I have a 100+ shares and purchased a call for $AMC that hopefully goes through in the morning 🚀🚀🚀
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got my second Moderna shot a few days ago, planning to go see literally whatever the fuck is playing that night when I hit two weeks, followed by an immediate trip to the bar.

I can't be the only one feeling that way."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Between the two GME is the better play. AMC was trading at $10 Oct, 2019 pre-covid crash. Since then they've taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt at high interest rates, issued tons of new stock to (hopefully) fund business through 2021, and given themselves tens of millions of bonuses. It's a slowly sinking ship. There is money still to be made there but don't get stuck holding the bag."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely, they were hoping to tank amc before pandemic slowed down.. shit happens.."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This just gave me hope too I am in the same boat with calls.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What dose your shot have to do with anything
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've been selling covered calls hoping to get assigned but the price always drops before expiration."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gona go see it twice just to spite them
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha do it .... 🤣
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,600@ $15.00. Holding to the moon.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of us are not like this guy. I. In the red. Held through 17 and 14 and will still do so but I think folks like this already won the lotto, however the winnings keep growing. It's stellar for them.we need to hold strong for those in at the higher figures but if and when it squeezes every ape should be good. Thanks for showing me the commitment. I'm not leaving."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,there with you... 1.1k shares @ 9.60 avg price
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Held through the first $14 push back in January and averaged down to like 10.50. Yolo'ed EVERYTHING into it haha. In it for the squeeze, to the moon!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In for $10.50 (1449 shares) Wasn’t even tempted at 14.50 like you I just like the stock... the masses will return to cinema amc will succeed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well played 👏 holding for the squeeze?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you're holding on and being strong.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro, you must have nerves of steel!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 💎🙌
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is this? So purrty
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is taking off start this week don't miss out 
Look at the DD"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand why people are still in amc instead of gme.

 I realize both stock are somewhat linked by weird short interest and similar fluctuations, but doesn't gme have the better chance to turn into something that actually reflacte the current share price ??

I'm already scared shitless holding gme because i'm not sure about  the squeeze but at least i tell myself i can trust the people behind the transformation.

Meanwhile i understand AMC has been issuing new stock to cover debt multiple times with no interesting prospect for the future ?

Why are people still in this mess instead of GME ?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I have to ask, if you actually have that amount, why don’t you sell? That’s a good chunk of money.
Yes, the stock could go up more, but very good chance it could tank and go down.

Do you get some satisfaction for simply holding it?
Do you plan to keep it forever?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No ape left behind!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep hearing that other stocks will have short squeezes but their situations are different than gme, amc has a shit ton more shares and less short volume no?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding. I just really like the stock 🤷‍♂️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he’s holding, I’m holding"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We just like the stock man
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must not understand the massive built up demand for going out to the movies after this year. 

Yes you can stream movies at home but it’s going to cost $30. Wtf would I spend that for at home ( I just wait till Redbox has it for $2 ) if I’m going to spend 30 then I might as well go see it on the big screen.

Plus there is only one place you can see new movies like that, at the theater. I wouldn’t be surprised to see AMC the only large theater chain left some day. But don’t get it twisted people are still going to see movies on the big screen. If for no other reason parents need a place to drop the teens off on a Friday or Saturday so they can suck face with someone."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,actually after looking at price history of amc i understand why people think it's undervalued
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC is affordable to play,. GME, has already been squeezed multiple times. That orange must be getting a little dry at this point."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you scared...go to church.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked for GameStop corporate and I have zero faith they will turn it around as a retailer.

Still like the stock though."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think essentially at the time both were being hyped amc was seen as the poor mans short squeeze, gme was at $300+ and climbing and new investors heard a stock trading at $10 could have the same results.

Gme was being shorted into bankruptcy despite being a good company, with amc you see why they were headed to the shitter and they haven’t learned anything."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm all for everyone making money but AMC is not the play at all. Zero chance of an AMC squeeze given the low short interest and huge number of shares outstanding. It may putter back up $14 eventually but more likely bleeds back down to $5.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My take gme could turn it around if they get into better online sales but the current model or even with changes I do not think the company is worth where it is currently. I do believe as they open up theaters again that amc will recover
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's like a double whammy because it's cheap per share (of course it has a way higher share float than GME) but it feels more affordable and everyone feels that AMC is a safe long term play if it doesn't take off (it will). I can easily see the stock being a natural $20-30 stock without any HF short fuckery going on. AMC has the math behind it to squeeze right up there with GME, and it's going to be glorious when we ride that rocket together up there."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME future is very uncertain. Cohen will have to literally come up with a new idea for the company. AMC exhibit movies, and people enjoy going to a cinema, however people can now buy games  from home instead of going to buy at a Gamestop.
Plus the GME shares are already inflated. Keep in mind for a merely 100% profit you would need to make the stock keep moving from 190 to almost 400! And we are talking about a price 190 which is already way over inflated than it’s original price of 40, last month.
AMC however besides being cheaper to jump in, is still in the very beginning.
You can make more money if AMC jumps  100 dolars, from 10 to 110, but you will make much less if GME jumps from 190 to 290."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,because you can buy 20 times as much amc stock as you can gme.. and then you only need a fraction of point increases to make the same money
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"the squeeze was 4 to 420

what is wrong with you people"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. What’s an exit strategy?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably just likes the stock. I would hold it too. He will probably always get a high return, because the probability of a deep drop is relatively low and it could even go up even more."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not OP. But doing the math if the screen shot is recent. OP bought around 7$. So it could still tank to like 9$ or 8$ and he'll still profit 20 or 10k from stocks. On the flip if it goes up to 14$ again op would be at 70k~ gainz. 

Risk/reward. Hes a lot safer than anyone who bought at 14 and stands to gain more and lose less if it crashes. 

Op doesn't have to hold it forever but they can certainly hold it for longer than your average retail investor who bought at a higher price."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term capital gains vs short term capital gains is one reason. Depending where you live and what tax bracket you're in, that's a huge amount of money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,it already tanked...only place left to go is up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's probably as shorted if not more, HF's won't stop doubling down and I'm sure its over 100% shorted.. some speculate 200-400%

Not financial advise but I think GME and AMC are going to go on a rocket at the same time, it's just a matter of when"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,While Im deep in GME no1 even knows the real short volume how can they be so sure it’s more than AMC?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re holding I’m holding
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No doubt their revenue will pickup... Maybe even to 2019 levels eventually this year? But in the meantime they've created so much debt it will be years before they recover if at all IMHO.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes AMC at the price is a safer buy and more manageable for a lot of people.  When I see people talking how GME is currently undervalued I laugh.  Chewy has a 50% market share and has a stock price of under $80 so there is no way with an under 2% market share GME will be worth more than that in the near future.  I am in both for the same $$ amount and I like both stocks.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t AMC going to be massively diluted?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to get paid...YOLO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's more about perception than reality at this point. Quick delete your post lol.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Suck it shorty
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once covid is over, I think people are gonna go to the movies because they couldn’t before. 2 summers of blockbusters could potentially hit the theaters with new releases and re-releases. 

AMC isn’t a long term play though.... I think they will have a couple of amazing quarters, maybe even 2 years, but people will stop caring and will Netflix and chill instead. It’s human behavior.

GME is fun to ride the crazy moves with FDs, but everyone saying GME is under valued is crazy. Blockbuster could have certainly re-organized, but they failed. They considered buying Netflix for 50million and didn’t follow through. GME COULD recover, but there are so many pitfalls, lots of competition and the industry is moving more and more towards online game purchases and I can see the major players, Sony and Microsoft, making console gaming a software as service proposal. Microsoft already is busting through that door and Sony is pushing PSNOW and will grow the service. That leaves GameStop on the sidelines. Their best bet is to get bought out but that won’t happen at these prices.  

The pluses though is they have a vault of stacks of cash so they could burn through cash and remodel their whole business. Whatever happen to GameStop, out of business or success, they can not continue being a brick and mortar gaming pawn shop."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Um... someone wanna tell this guy how percentages work?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,why did it still go from 38 to 347 a month after ?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. And AMC took profits from you silly apes to enrich their CEO. 

I hope all goes well for the AMC crowd, but GME is definitively the play in my opinion (and apparently Melvin’s opinion too)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you actually take time to read DD before you say make yourself look stupid or do you just go for it?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oct, 2019 it was trading right where it is now. $10/share. There were fewer shares back then but they also didn't have hundreds of millions of dollars of debt at ridiculous interest rates. I read the revenue generated in 2021 is not projected to give enough cashflow to cover the expenses + debt service. Which is why they need to sell even more shares now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I stay with the you’re it strategy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just repeating stuff DFV said like a parrot?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,/r/Cringe
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again the short interest isn’t the problem, its the diluted shares that will be the problem."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short volume isn’t even the question, people assume its a lot, maybe it isn’t but that doesn’t matter.

AMC has so many more shares than gme how could those shares be held to even short squeeze? 

There’s just too many shares out there."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hodl
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That debt is bad. I would assume the vote on may 04 for permission to issue more shares is most likely about that. New issue of shares would be an awesome way to wipe out a lot of that debt with no cost to the company. I’m not sure which way to look at that, from a short term perspective it’s of course terrible if they issue a ton of new shares. But for a long term play could it be beneficial?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't just compare share prices, you need to look at market cap."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you compare the two......
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Its just an option. If they stay afloat there will be no need to issue additional shares
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Already is. Its never gonna 5x or 10x the way GME did. But premiums for selling calls is huge. And it could easily 2x again. Just based on volume. I have 100 shares of AMC that I can sell options on. I can't afford 100 shares of GME. Not that I'd drop 20k on a meme play even if I did. 1k is doable tho
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Frankly? Because they don’t understand their growth audience. They believe every gamer wants CoD/Madden every year, and everyone who buys other titles is an “edge case.”

Most of the non-c level leadership is from Home Depot. Paul Raines brought a lot of SVP and VP retail “talent” over with him and continued to do so over the years. 

GameStop is NOT (and never has been) a video game company. It is a HIGHLY niche retailer with extremely thin margins. It was only ever profitable because of used games - those days are disappearing, and fast. While they’ve tried to diversify, the cost on keeping some of the collectibles (and PC parts) in stock and on shelves of 99% of their stores doesn’t make economic sense, so it becomes empty box order online “ship to store for free” sales, at which point most people would prefer to pay less via Amazon, etc."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair . I wouldn’t say GME would be something that will be viable in a few years either tbh . I do think it’s possible that GAmeStop is out of business in a few years though
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the amc play is a short window, people will want to go to the movies because they were deprived but once it’s a normal thing it’ll not be as popular.

People had a year to get over movie theaters, once the novelty wears off it’s over, maybe for good."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Second squeeze!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just repeating stuff DFV said like a parrot?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really. They can all be bought up by various institutions. It's not as if AMC is currently trading in the 100+ range.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term for them it's the best play by a mile, especially if the share price continues to stay high. The alternative to not selling shares will be bankruptcy, which would wipe out all common stock, but maybe allow them to emerge with a more streamlined business model.

Anyway if you're in to AMC for the long haul go for it. Those apes thinking this thing is jumping up to $20 or higher levels, not likely imho."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I usually don’t but the discussion was why are people in AMC instead of GME.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The problem is the debt service they've created. I read even with 100% pre-covid revenue (which is unlikely) they will not be able to keep up with their expenses + debt service. Only option is to sell more shares further diluting current investors. Long term the stock is going belly up for sure. Short term you can make a few bucks but keep puts in place or risk winding up a bagholder.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I fully expect AMC to squeeze. Lol I bet it tops $20 at anytime. Will is squeeze as hard as GME probably not. Leaving amc squeeze out of the picture when GME start to moon again it’s going to have an even bigger impact on amc then last time. Last time it jumped from 4 to 20 when GME started. Now we have way more people who have bought in to amc and are holding. Not to mention the millions of boomers and other people who saw what happened with GME. Once they start to squeeze amc will get caught up in it and then Fomo is going to boost it even higher.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear the sound of thousands of wrinkles forming on brains across the globe
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,great explanation. Thanks for the extra wrinkles!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this how it was done before computers?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The NASDAQ market is a computer network of securities dealers who disseminate timely security price quotes to NASDAQ subscribers. These dealers act as market makers for securities listed on the NASDAQ. As market makers, NASDAQ dealers post bid and asked prices at which they accept sell and buy orders, respectively. With each price quote, they also post the number of stock shares that they obligate themselves to trade at their quoted prices.   


These are the Computers you are referring to."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure most of this is done by algos now in tenths of a second.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guhhh, my brain hurts! One more wrinkle just born on my smooth 🧠"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is the NYSE typically used to facilitate massive order blocks from giant clients? 

Seems really inefficient and unable to scale to millions of shares of volume per day (Walmart avg is 9.3M) unless people are trading tens of thousands of shares per order. Even then, are people really walking back and forth between these stations thousands of times a day?

How do retail orders get fulfilled? Are they aggregated together and settled in big blocks?

Seems like all this could be done from behind a desk instead of walking around in person.

Edit: Sounds like floor trading is relatively rare these days

I’m going to buy and hold GME 

I’m going to make risky plays in cannabis and increase my exposure in currently held stocks with poor key indicator assessments 

I’m going to continue to regret buying RKT and XLA but I’ll just hold them out of spite 

I’m going to rip cocaine and take a huge shit and throw it all over the place while screaming “stocks only go up” which will undoubtedly disrupt the sex my wife’s boyfriend is having with my current mistress

Cause fuck him, I hate having to do his dishes all the time.

No drilling too

I see the gloom

For depressed bears like you 

And I think to myself

What a wonderful world

I see hopes of red

And charts of green

The bright blessed peaks 

The dark sacred dips

And I think to myself

What a wonderful world 

The colors of the rainbow

So pretty in the sky

Are also on the faces

Of the bears strolling by

I see HODLers shaking hands

Saying, ""How do you do?""

They're really saying

""I hate bears too""

I hear perma bulls cry


I watch them grow

They'll learn much more

Than I'll ever know

And I think to myself

What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself

What a wonderful world

We get orders now from all the grocery stores, convenience stores, Walgreens, petco etc. Covid has opened the floodgates for delivery services and they want to change the way you shop and buy *everything* I do not have a position but if I did I would be looking at leaps or just a plain buy and hold. this isnt financial advice and I almost shit myself today on accident."

But then, Caesar turns the corner in a casual stroll. *This is it*, thinks Brutus, *he's not even trying. He's finally submitting to me*, growing erect with a smug grin.

They also went all out and bought the expensive sirloins from BJ's Wholesale Club. A lot of shoppers out here in Riverhead, Long Island. NY economy is booming with everyone gearing up for the HUGE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. I work out in the Hamptons and virtually it seems like every big house out here has dozens of crews out. I'm seeing installations of new lighting systems, siding, patios, driveways. Oh man, new houses too. A lot of people I've talked to while on lunch lines at the delis say they like the Lowe's Amex card they like the pro discounts, they wonder why Home Depot doesn't have an orange card, complacent?

And they teamed up with Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defence Systems last summer to build an Iron Dome in the US and potentially for its allies as well. The Iron Dome is still relatively new technology (in service since 2011) and the system has proven to be extremely effective. Granted, America and most countries in the West might not have as much demand for a missile interception system as Israel does, but who knows what the geopolitics of 5-10 years from now will look like."

Say Apple is currently trading on projected earnings of $1,000 for 2025. Inflation causes the relative value of that $1,000 to be less, which causes the stock price to go down."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"> “It’s certainly what the market has appetite for right now,” said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Quality Growth. “Ark has shown a tremendous propensity to attract money, and all eyes are on them.”
> 
> Wood’s firm filed for the fund on Jan. 13, which means the earliest Ark could complete the Securities and Exchange Commission approval process and release the ETF to investors is March 29, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, although its application may get held up. A spokesperson from Ark declined to comment since the fund is still in the SEC quiet period."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope $NOK is included!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Besdies LMT and MAXR... what do you folks think will be included in the fund?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I need some space tendies!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,ill wait for this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's go MAXR!!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got 50 shares in a space tourism SPAC...here's hoping.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have ARK but I feel like this actually isn't a great idea since SpaceX won't be in this fund since it isn't public and the entire space industry is crapping themselves over what Musk is doing with SpaceX
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got some 04/16 50c on friday. Maybe a  bit optimistic, we'll see."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,great! more ways for her to lose money
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck her!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Look’s like she is trying to reinvent herself. Last year’s “strategy” ain’t gonna work this year. Keep placing your trust in her and see what happens.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruce Jenner invests?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t WUGI and IZRL part of ARK?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ark and Cathie are fairly open about the reasoning behind their picks so, so I would recommend taking a look at the companies they own, forming your own opinion on them, and then seeing whether their research has the same conclusions as yours or is able to convince you about their conclusions. I personally disagree with a lot of their research, but depending on your personal investment philosophy it might work for you."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She loses lots of money
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Theres articles every day of how ARK has been buying dips on a bunch of companies throughout the correction. Spoiler alert: those companies are still correcting. Although I do agree with ARK that those companies has value long term.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which Space SPACs?

I just bought a bunch of $LUXA warrants on Friday."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😢
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,¡Maxr!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sound just like the people that doubted her on her first Tesla price target. Tesla flew by that. 

I totally agree that her target seems extreme but I would 100% not bet against her. Plus her funds performance over the past few years are amazing."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol no one ever said that
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR is going to cum all over the place after the GME lunar landing. This is financial advice: cum. everywhere.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My son made fun of me for turning down the difficulty. Damn son, I’m just trying to have fun, not get my ass kicked over and over."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I missed the vote on the 23rd
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Ark buys 200,000,000.00 $NOK""

I.e. 0.0001% of the float"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There are a lot more space companies than just launch providers.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,short tesla and see what happens
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,IZRL is also run by Cathie Wood. I have no idea what WUGI is.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm that sounds too reasonable for me. I usually pick the stocks that are green/red and move in a way I like and people on Reddit tell me to buy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Her reasoning is that she is chosen by God.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,God?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How? All of her funds are up ridiculous amounts over the year and 5 years?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,THE LEGION....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The performance is great no doubt
But her tsla calls the first time around coincided with free trading everyone at home at people on this forum with irrational exuberance

Have you ever thought tsla was the first gme and amc?
That the company isn't even worth 100? All built on speculation and momentum..
It is a fact January 2020 that tsla was once again on the brink of bankruptcy...and had to get bail outs from china...then tsla did more debt offerings...then as the price soared they printed 10+ billion of cash from traders...

Think about the facts....so was she so smart or the timing of the speculation and wallstreetbets???

Think, think think"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">Sound just like the people that doubted her on her first Tesla price target. Tesla flew by that.

Sure, but her first price target in 2017 was based on Tesla selling over 500k cars in 2018 - something that Tesla managed to achieve only in 2020. She missed by a lot and just moved her stock price targets even higher afterwards. So she wasn't correct on the fundamentals, she was just correct because lots of other people were hyping the stock as well and that resulted in the stock going up. The question is for how long will fundamentals not matter."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. She said 4,000"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think The only way PLTR even hits $30 this year is when Apes done Squeezing.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted for you don't worry.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"well certainly, but I think a lot of the innovation that is happening in that sector is coming out of SpaceX, and maybe starlink? I haven't yet formed an opinion on starlink, at least it will be going IPO when it has positive cash flow. We know how long that took to achieve with Tesla"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"$884 --> $618

(So that we are clear....She won't loose $$$, you will)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just look at the previous all time high and go, ""Man' stock is down here. Could be up there."" Then yolo my portfolio in calls without any research"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause bro it’s weeklies or bust you fucking boomer
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"She has so large positions, that if she decides so liquidate any, she would tank the specific stock and her p&l would be negative."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of this matters or is even relevant. She said it will happen and it did. People who listened to her made money. People who were self righteous for the reasons above didn't.

If you think TSLA is the previous GME, have respect for Cathy for calling the next GME before GME saga existed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She said $7000 before that. Her minions shook more magic 8 balls and now she says 1.5k worst case 4K best...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She also said bear case: 25% that it’s below $1500 in 2025. Some of y’all are so retarded and not the fun kind
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Longterm I think sky is the limit for PLTR but it certainly feels like investment purgatory while this plays out.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d be thrilled if pltr hit 30$ by end of year at this point
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well, you know, that's, like, your opinion, man."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I am in this picture and I love it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you should say you lose a lot of money on her you fucking ape. Shits on sale right now buy calls 3 months out. You'd be able to afford it if you stopped throwing your checks simping on only fans.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She's also so concentrated that any decline in one of her major holdings would force selling across the board.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha I give her credit for an amazing 2020... unfortunately when you make 250-500 million for 1 year you must do it again or be prepared for backlash...

I admit I am very jealous of her Payday...very and I'm trying to get it as well in unconventional ways"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"7000$ pre-split, meaning 1400$."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody here said her word is law? Merely stating what was actually said. Not sure you’re exactly the good kind of retard here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"'The Dude' Love it!

I just hate Cathie and friends screw retail investors. After all, she IS and institutional investor."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then tell your mother to knock the fucking price down dude. 

She doubled her monthly fee when she met Requis and it’s cutting into my spy call allowance."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Force selling ?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks Chinese national math champion
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how you’re the one arguing with me. I commented on someone saying “$3000 at the minimum” when she in reality said nothing of the sort.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck me this little back and forth between you guys cracked me up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you shoresy!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Guys please don’t be mean !! His mom has to work on onlyfans to pay for her retarded son!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The etf probably has stipulations that one holding cannot be more than X% of the total fund. If One holding tanks then it would be out of balance and she would have to sell at a loss to rebalance.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What a sore loser
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right I agreed with you. I said she said 4,000. Not 3,000. Which agrees with you that nobody said 3,000. Cmon ape do better."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If it tanks she would have to buy more not sell off.. tf?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That seems kinda counterintuitive but what the fuck do I know
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"She didn’t say $4000 minimum lol. Her most bullish case stated “we believe there is a 25% chance that Tesla could be worth more than $4,000 per share or more in 2025.”"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah she would have to sell other holdings to buy more Tesla. Unless she keeps a ton of cash lying around.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t say she said minimum. At this point please just stop talking. You’re trying to argue off semantics or argue for the sake of arguing. I’m not here for that.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I'm here if you need to talk xxx
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if a holding tanks she would buy more of it to rebalance not sell other positions (dunno where you got at a loss either)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in![img](emote|wsb_emojis|tendies)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So I gotta be honest I closed out my whole position at a profit when we were in the $15’s from my entry at $10... on Friday I started loading the boat with 4/16 20c... they were fucking 10cents a contract. Tomorrow I’m buying another 4K of them I’m willing to go down with this ship. Thanks for giving me some hope man
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess I’ll get on board this train again. Only burnt me a little the first time around. The share price is real low, too."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have.
1000 shares,
250 April 15C,
30 may 17.5C,
550 aug 40C

Get rich or die tryin"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! I took part in the lotto and watched it all burn away. I did flip calls on the spikes so didn't lose anything overall.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only skimmed the TL;DR. I'm already long and bullish, just holding. Sold my warrants at 5.60 for small profit, but still holding tons of shares avg price of 16, which is not that good."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This stock has done nothing but burned money from me. Gonna sit this one out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got some stock and will probably pick up some more. I assumed they were avoiding sedans to not have to compete directly with Tesla (and seemingly every other B2C car company doing EVs). If they've got somebody else to finance a sedan hat on their skateboards, that's even better"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My 4/16 15$ calls have been bleeding out for weeks.  I’ve white knuckled these things and they’re way down.  Here’s hoping earnings reports help.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many of you might remember that beautiful gamma ramp from 3/16. While that ended up closer to cardboard box status than valhalla, this earnings is shaping up to be something special.

Someone has shorted themselves down to an estimated SI cost basis of 14.73. Earnings have every potential to be unexpectedly amazing and cause a massive pop. There is an Ortex estimated 20mil shares SI, and 13 of that was in the last two weeks. If this was just earnings we'd be looking at some excellent gains. If earnings is good, these shorts are going to have to cover and it will get **ugly.**

I'm in, and super excited to keep an eye on this Monday.

I'll try to keep coverage of updates Monday here if any of you all are interested...."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do I wish I had sold when my contracts were up at $16 and then bought back in when it dipped this week? Yeah, I do. But thankfully my other plays payed off last week and I still managed to double my 4/16 15c position. I’ve spent more time than I care to admit on Canoo’s website this weekend, and I’m seriously in love with the way their vehicles are designed. Hopefully we get solid manufacturing information on Monday that will prove they’re more than just good design and hype. My biggest concern is sentiment surrounding EVs in the market is poor, so I feel as though they will really have to deliver significant good news if shorts are going to cover. 

Either way this week should be entertaining. LFG

Edit: currently 30 4/16 15c. Debating between adding to that position or adding some 4/16 12.5c instead."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, no one's discussing micro factories.

So the idea is to have a billion (possible hyperbole) 3d printers to print everything?

That seems very expensive and slower than say casting or stamping. No?

What's the story there?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanks for the update, sitting on a 5/21 $17.5c"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canoo have strategic collaboration with Hyundai and KIA for their global EV go to market 

In a way Hyundai has validated  canoo potential and technologies 

Has potential for GOEV Stonk to go higher I think

Will Biden new budget for green energy helps ?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been thinking of getting on this train as well.  I never got burnt before on the first round like some have stated, but from what I've researched this has a lot of potential to go the fuck off and make some money.  Im just not sure how far out I wanna date my calls, im not sure how long this will take to get traction, ones everything is announced."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is one of the best DD I've ever read. Great job.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m wondering if they mention something about chip shortage. This glut will last for a while, probably well into Canoo’s scheduled production start.

But - Canoo doesn’t use the fancy screens and entertainment centers. The idea is user hooks up his mobile device anyway, so why duplicate it. They should need significantly less chips than competitors, but I don’t know much about car electronics to quantify this."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d wait a week before buying. Basic indicators are showing that it still has lower to go on the daily chart.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"confirmation bias = buy more tomorrow

edit: GOEV warrants are mighty tasty right now..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GOEV is one of those ev plays that ain't gonna make it. Sorry those cars are trash.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the price target?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever this DD is, I'm in!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop is a cool store. I don't want it to go.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is my DD. GOEV looks too much like gov, as in government, so I cannot sink money into government trying to win future innovation in a high technology field. Good luck with your ""design by committee"" dream."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us... same
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I just got rid of them.  Guess I'm back in again."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So that’s $10 total risk if I bought one? Profit would be  possibly be $800 if it went to $20? 

Please fact check me, I’m learning."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I respect this Respect
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I also should have rolled forward to May or took profits...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Youll be ok
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I Respect that..
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sedan is not revealed yet, but teased on their site as as blacked out silhouette"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You and me both brosky
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,HE HATH RETURNED!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What “earnings”?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"/u/planereflection is planning a deeper dive into that, also u/misterInvicta can discuss as well I don't want to steal their fire as they actually know what they are talking about"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're unsure, and that is why we are hoping earnings will shed some light. 

Our current theory is that they'll have the skateboards produced as a license deal with KIA/Hyundai to get them at cost and distribute, then use microfactories to do the tophat and the customization that they've been talking about. 

There is a company that specializes in microfactory work and software to help scale about four miles away from Canoo's headquarters....

This is schizo posting. None of the above is confirmed or even mentioned beyond the deals with KIA and Hyundai. 

Plane and Invicta will explain more. They know much more than I do."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I respect that
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you were ever thinking about buying warrants on a company this is the one to do it on. Also my 7th Edition is probably the best one to read for actuall DD on whats going on with the company vs Shareprice
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wonder how that will all play out as well.. hopefully manufacturing will catch up by the time they open
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you post your crayons?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I will be putting in tons of loot from my plays if I make it into warrants absolutely chad move confirmed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they haven't figured out how to explode into flames during all of their crash testing yet, I'll give you that..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Papa Manpreet has been right recently... check his twitter If they say something cray cray at earnings about fleet orders, partnerships or manufacturing then this will look like the RKT happening."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"?? I'm actually confused by this, do you have an example of where a government vehicle was actually efficient?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 20c at $20 is going to depend on IV and days til expiry. Intrinsic value is 0. A 20c at $21 has an intrinsic value of $100.

It's hard for me to guess what a 20c would be valued if the stock went to $20 tomorrow, but it would probably be worth over $100. 

So $10 to possibly $100."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Check on optionsprofitcalculator dot com
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope we can swim in Iranian caviar and drink grand cru champagne.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lesson learned. Your DD has been great and hilarious. If I played a bit better, could have 2x just based on the spikes happening. Definitely see another opportunity for this month.

Can you say round 2??"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean Apple Car not revealed yet...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In some pictures from Aug 2020 you can see the back end of the sedan behind LV’s.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Best case scenario? Income from partnerships. Mostly hoping for announcements around manufacturing and guidance.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take a look at the MACD... lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If this goes to 20 tomorrow the IV would blast off to pluto and back...just the hedging alone would destroy the shorts.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I was basing it off current price, not strike. Thanks for clearing it up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude all Tony has to do is just not say  Haters and not lie about pre-orders and we'll pull ahead of the pack
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's possible but the best chance was through Hyundai who blew it blabbing to the press.
Apple definitely liked the concept and could happen on its own though. I think the next big catalyst is either a blue chip delivery deal or Hyundai announcing they really are using Canoo IP. The lack of the leaf spring shown on the skateboards theyve shown makes me think it might be more engineering assistance and less IP unfortunately."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not yet
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeaaa I saw that. Its like a flat canoo LV.

I'm not sure if the canoo LV will be popular. They should focus on a smaller platform like a hatch."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Link?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,BOOOOOOOOO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Does MACD take into account catalysts such as ER and PR tomorrow?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the 15c are .5 ish? Fifty bucks for 500 if we go to $20. 

Worth it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm sort of joking as it'd how I lost money on canoo the first time, it's actually in my opinion, something to do with a line of purpose build vehicles /u/misterInvicta is writing an article about that as we speak..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks drop on good earnings just as much as they go up on earnings. Flip a coin
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they drop on block buster announcements?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. They have.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not when they are 50% discount to 52w high
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They look like they have hit bottom and coming back. Good long play, maybe short too. I'm a crayon eating 🦍 and not a financial adviser."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is horrible news for the USPS. It is exactly what the asshole in charge wants. Privatize all deliveries.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I jumped into PB like 3-4 years ago when USPS was pushing their sales team to include PB as an option.  Sadly the stock keep dropping and dropping.  You can tell it may be getting shorted throughout the years.  Sadly I cut ties with PB and took a lost since it hasn’t produced any returns regardless the positive news it released.  

This yea I sold for a lost and used it to buy AMC at $8 ish a share."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"In case you didn't know, they handle a lot of packages for ebay international shipping program. With Brexit there might be an increase on that end. But I'm no expert and this is not advice."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no way to profitably privatize all home deliveries. Privatization will cause the elimination of home delivery for all most the most profitable routes. Everyone else will have to use PO boxes.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question: why would that be a bad thing? Have you ever browsed YouTube for ""Mail carrier caught""? It's tons of videos of mail carriers throwing bags of ppls stuff in dumpsters because they didn't feel like delivering it. If there was ever a business that should have gone under a long time ago it would be the USPS imo."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a tough one for sure. I work in supply chain and they really do a great job for shipping platform integration.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Right so privatize and those people get screwed or pay an arm and a leg.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious answer: because the non profitable routes would never get mail deliveries. Middle America and rural areas would suffer far more than the densely populated areas. Rural America is America. Urban America is America. It is good to have a government entity to ensure fairness in delivery and pricing for those who live in rural areas.  
Also. USPS often does “last mile” deliveries for fedex, ups, etc. So the private companies take the profits of delivery, bring it to a local mail hub, pay usps a very small amount of money to deliver it to the homes. So they undercut the profit usps could be making, and force usps to do the part of the delivery that would make them unprofitable.  
This is a government subsidy for fedex, ups, Amazon, etc. It’s taking the profit out of the usps, making them do the hard part, and then blaming them for not making as much money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not saying you're wrong, but  I've only ever seen carriers from private companies on video doing that stuff. Fedex is notorious for trashing packages. Someone posted a pic on Reddit recently showing the inside of a Fedex delivery truck that was an absolute disaster. Said it's routine."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Fuck that shit and fuck anyone for it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The flip side is by doing this it also takes most of the cost associated with packages which is transportation cost.  So USPS delivering the last mile can be profitable.   The bad side is when USPS made deals with Amazon and FedEx they started to route the business into their own network instead of USPS.  So basically USPS is giving up their market share and these last mile vendors are slowly taking away USPS customers.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt. I actually saw that pic. For the record Im a UPS driver so I know that plight that many ppl (including myself) face when ordering anything really. We all like to believe that there is a tractor trailer that is hauling our package all by itself and is tightly strapped down to the floor to protect it. But the reality is its shipped in a tractor trailer full of about 1500 pieces, everything from generators to mattresses to boflex weight equipment. Sometimes we're lucky and our packages are on the top of the pile, sometimes, not so lucky and its on the bottom. Thats why we insure all of our packages. Im not sure how FedEx does things but all of our packages at UPS are insured so I guess thats one upside. And if our drivers ever threw packages in the trash because they didnt feel like delivering them they wouldnt have a job anymore lol. 

I dont want to see USPS workers without a job but Id be happy to see FedEx or UPS or even a mix of both pick up the mail carriers for small package volume and let the USPS go under."

The advantage it had was speed to market, that edge will disappear soon."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I got in presplit last year, I still sold. The stock could enter a bear market much like Amazon did after the tech bubble popped & if competition continues to fulfill advancing their timelines it wouldn’t necessarily ever reach the highs it was at. Is that a possibility you’re prepared for? I was/am. And I called it out here pretty publicly tbh I’m a OG & called the Tesla top. Saved a lot of people thousands of $$’s posting about it. Technical and Quantitative analysis tells me that it has much further to go. $500 is strong support/floor, but nothing is telling me it couldn’t just as easily diverge further downward.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">  Is that a possibility you’re prepared for?

Yes, I'm 99% likely not selling for five-ten years. I've bought at lows and highs before and all of that (and probably its current price) is chump change compared to where I expect it to be."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. Past this $500 test that’s coming up I can’t say anything on what may or may not happen that’s speculation.

VWAGY, F, GM, & Porsche would be eating TSLA’s lunch these next 4-5 years as well as their EV timelines have advanced significantly compared to even a year ago. Something has to give in this space. Continuing to say that level 2 autonomous software will magically jump to level 5 and ignoring competition like Waymo isn’t doing Elon any favors as well."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">VWAGY, F, GM, & Porsche would be eating TSLA’s lunch these next 4-5 years as well as their EV timelines have advanced significantly compared to even a year ago. 

Competition is nothing like what it needs to be for that to be a real concern.

VW's (which includes Porsche by the way) stated plans for 9 years from now have them building enough batteries for about 1/6th of their current level of manufacturing at that time. GM and F are still buying batteries and will have to outbid everyone else who also wants batteries from a few small players. GM's only (currently under construction) battery factory is a fraction of that size again.

>Continuing to say that level 2 autonomous software will magically jump to level 5 and ignoring competition like Waymo isn’t doing Elon any favors as well.

I don't even know why you think Elon's ignoring Waymo, he just thinks they don't have a chance. Geofenced and needing much more expensive hardware... it's not a good combination, but time will tell."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you won’t ever get past level 2 without lidar... which that recent crash into an emergency vehicle shows that level 5 will only ever be possible with lidar. And this isn’t about them becoming single players themselves in that field, this is about timelines advancing. For example, Cathie wood of Ark has Tesla selling 10 million cars in 2025. Which is 1/10th of all total car sales projected (100 million) 10 million would be all EVs sold (real projections) and Biden’s plan for tax cuts for cars will make the credits evenly spread across all auto manufacturers. Making the bullish case for other manufacturers to see sales as well a reality. The bull case gets weaker by the day for Tesla. None of those companies needs to become dominant, they together advancing their timelines will be enough. Look into Burrys tweets on the matter with Volkswagen alone. People are heavily underestimating German engineering. Audi has the best selling EV in Norway now. GM has the best selling EV in China now. Things are happening. The main driver of Tesla’s stock price was speculation & aggressive call options buying + a short squeeze & a reverse stock split & S&P inclusion. A lot of those factors are now not something the stock may see happen again. Last year was an insane run. An all time run."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Well you won’t ever get past level 2 without lidar... which that recent crash into an emergency vehicle shows that level 5 will only ever be possible with lidar.

It really doesn't. Tesla's philosophy is basically if you can see it with your eyes you can see it with cameras. At that point it's a matter of getting the software to work. Not easy, but not at all infeasible. It then works everywhere. Anyway, let's let time answer that one.

> For example, Cathie wood of Ark has Tesla selling 10 million cars in 2025. Which is 1/10th of all total car sales projected (100 million) 10 million would be all EVs sold (real projections)...

I haven't looked at her projections so I'm not going to comment on those, but 2019 car sales were 65 million world wide so that doesn't seem right somewhere.

> Biden’s plan for tax cuts for cars will make the credits evenly spread across all auto manufacturers.

That's not working out the way you think it is. Tesla has already used up all its zev credits, so if he spreads it evenly across all auto manufacturers that's Tesla back into receiving credits again. 

> Look into Burrys tweets on the matter with Volkswagen alone. People are heavily underestimating German engineering. Audi has the best selling EV in Norway now. GM has the best selling EV in China now. Things are happening.

Burry shorted Tesla before getting burned out of the position. 

You talk about underestimating german engineering but there's no denying the shortfall in batteries from their own stated figures. They either need to expand that program at a race they currently don't feel is feasible (or they'd have announced that) OR remain behind in battery production capacity.

> Audi has the best selling EV in Norway now. 

Maybe in Norway but [not in Europe](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2021/03/Europe-plugin-vehicle-sales-February-2021-CleanTechnica.png), and Europe doesn't even have a Tesla factory yet. Check that again in a couple of years. Deliveries to any one region are highly susceptible to delivery waves in the time period being discussed.

Things may be happening, the question remains are enough things happening. Time will tell.

I don't expect Tesla to be a huge portion of the market, but they're lining up much better than the others for EVs based even on the plans those others give."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I can never figure out if Cathie Wood is a forward thinking genius or a Wall Street Houdini that likes to watch money disappear
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"OpenDoor has a structural problem sort of baked in... it's the same problem everyone has when they want to ""eliminate the middle man""... when a downturn comes, they will be holding the bag on a ton of real estate.

They TRIED to avoid this last year when they suspended purchasing, but obviously we saw the weird K split for a few months and then most markets started shooting up by September... so OpenDoor was short on inventory and is now paying premium rate in the markets they operate in.

They aren't a bad company, but there is a very good reason they are trading low right now, risk isn't just a thing here, it's just a question of timing."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to provide a disclaimer. Cathy has been successful for a very short time with ARK and her plan isn't short term. Just because she is investing heavily in something doesn't mean she hopes to see a significant return this year or even the next year. Stay safe
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Opendoor has two big looming problems:

1. Housing bubble - houses can’t be built fast enough
2. New Home sales are done by builders"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie seems to set her price targets after smoking crack tho 🤷‍♂️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so Opendoor is doing what robinhood did for investing? Gameifying real estate? Beautiful. I’m down.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hasn't RKT rocketed yet?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying short Opendoor?

J/k I don’t know much about Opendoor. But following ARK into a stock is like following a gambler into an opium den. May feel good for a little bit, but... 🤷‍♂️"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speaking as a realtor of 7 years. OpenDoor will never be the future. It's a niche product that is only beneficial to people distressed financially that need to sell immediately. If that's not you, then stay away because they take cuts on both sides of the transaction that ultimately impact the homeowner and homebuyer. Think of it as a GrubHub business model.

This is not financial advice."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Flipping homes is a tough business with very thin margins. Check ZG's latest financial statements. Sure revenue is growing, but home flipping portion is losing money. And it's not that you can exhibit huge economies of scale there in the long-run. Look at their online business which is printing money at 90% gross margin vs buying/selling homes.

TAM sounds sexy, but don't forget that local markets are tough. and RE is all about local markets."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold the door
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're also a good reopening play as well, the housing market should be strong with interest rates being low for years."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,she bought shit tons of PLTR too and yet it continues to drift lower
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long Opendoor, but realize that might take a while."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd wait for a big pull back and maybe buy some if it dips 5+
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have big doubts about Opendoor. a $290M net loss? Most employees are commissioned. Their bio says they buy, fix up, and sell? I did this in 2008-9 and renting was my only profit. Why was 2020 a bad year when it was a boom for everyone else?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never heard of them.  

I just listed my house with Redfin, and so far, excellent arrangement."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg. A DD post on something other than GME. Is r/WSB coming back...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie is on crack
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She is either a jedi trader or a street Hustler not sure which one.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m getting smoked on my 5/21s.  They are at a discount and I’ve been buying the deep.  Pleas fly
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re telling me my 3/19 $30c have a chance?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If open door partners up with Ring that’d be fire
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,To the moon
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Visited a few open door homes when looking for home....almost bought one.  Home sales are on 🔥 right now.  People are paying 💰 for houses because their monthly interest is providing low monthly payments. Home prices are skyrocketing-  our home went up 50-60 k from a year and half ago.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie wood is the next Warren buffet
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It is not her own money.  She is drunk on free coin. If people handed me a bunch of money and told me stick it somewhere I would go will nilly nuts too.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not going to invest like Cathie Wood because my goals are not the same as Cathie Wood.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t tell the rkt guys.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She also just bought a shit ton of Zillow
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,honestly feel that hedgefunds are shorting ark as payback for all the spotlight she got last year. they seem like the jealous bunch. so everything the etf holds has been down
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a long time before Cathie for $27 :)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bigger companies are doing the exact same shit ... Zillow, Redfin. Revenue declined while market share accelerated for the other two companies ... why is that ?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Her ETF had a return rate of 0.8 for 10 years. If you guys still think she's some kind of genius you need to eat more bananas cuz you lack potassium in the brain
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is that the cathie woods whose funds are crashing right now?

She did good in one of the greatest bull markets of our time.  But it's not like she just came into being in 2020."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be a play after GME, but not before"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool.  Inverse Cathie
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"#thanks, Jeff"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except the major problem of open door is it doesn't account for the key factor in pricing real estate......amenities. Two homes in the same comparable area, with the same square footage, bedrooms, baths, etc, may have wildly different values based on amenities. Tech is great, but it doesn't account for things an appraiser would use to value a property."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie wood will be a goat 🐐 my goal is to accumulate 1000 shares of arkk.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So they’ve been saying open will be carmax of houses and with the power of the easy they will take the housing market by storm.

However, look at how the housing market is now. You put one up for auction, and you get flooded with cash offers 10% above your listing price.

Why would the selllers list their house on open? Can someone explain this lol"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Check opendoor website and try to look for house to buy. I think stock is overpriced.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Cathie and ARK.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"She also grabbed even more of Tesla,  and Teladoc which are imo much safer bets and provide better roi."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC are on the brink of violent moves. Pay attention you fucks 🚀🚀🚀
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what you saying is , buy calls for June 8th"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know nothing, but what about rates rising as a discourager to buying a new home?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ibuyers temporarily suspended buying houses in 2020?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Question based on having done zero research :  are Opendoor and Compass competitors with similar platform / product / market or are they fundamentally different in some way?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen anyone you know bought from them?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right so I did some analysis on this a month ago. I did this after Luke Lango recommended the stock, he makes some great picks. Its a company that will most probably grow in the future, and 5 years from now be a major player. But it basically all depends on if peoples buying habits shift towards IBuying houses. I wasnt to sure, so I only opened a very small position. Basically broke even so far, however tbh, expect this shit to fall a wee bit more. Good stock, bad time."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank God she did that!  I feel validated!  I am long and deep into OPEN. It pains me to see it I. The red in my portfolio day after day!  😝
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gay?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And she also bought shit ton of PLTR to fuck us over??
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish she would get out of Dkng and into PENN
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point i wouldn't be suprised if she's just using stocks as deposits. She puts yuge amounts of money into stocks that seemingly just won't budge
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying a home? Is that something boomers do or something?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I look into buying a house prices go up 20k. Housing market is downright broken right now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie you bring me the wood 😳
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie Wood is so hot. Like have you seen this lady? So *hot*.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had OpenDoor come over to assess my in-laws house. They make selling a house as-is so fucking easy. All I had to do was walk a dude around the house over video chat with my phone and answer a few questions. 

As boomers get old AF and need to downsize/move into care centers, there are going to be a lot of opportunities in the residential resale market. 

OpenDoor's offer was significantly less than Zillow's. When we didn't sell to them, they continued to text increasing offers after the deadline date (not wasting a good lead!). I'm not sure how the selling side of their business works but they appear to have the ""buy low"" and side of their model worked out."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you see that home sales were very low on that last report? Huge competition for these platforms but not a whole lot of homes to sell. Also the past 2 days the market was closed being a weekend...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually think she may get this one right but this year will very likely serve her an ass kicking.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol Cathie Wood. the bag holding queen
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the same Opendoor that does restaurant reservations?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">However, 2020 revenue was hit hard by the impact of the pandemic as ibuyers temporarily suspended buying houses

Err, 2020 was the hottest real estate market in at least a decade.

Do iBuyers not buy in hot markets?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m confused. How is this related to GME?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"She’s always been Buying OPEN nothing new here

From what I’ve seen lots of DM open and PLTR buying"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes, the ""you've never heard of me, but I have 50% market share"" pitch. Pass. Me thinks CW has introspected, and decided that she is a champion of lost causes. I will pray for you all."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"And even if this is a good buy, OP’s tl;dr is to buy calls expiring in June. Either buy shares or leaps ffs"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But isn’t open door going to be very successful if people are trying to get rid of their homes in the case of the housing bubble? It gives them a digital platform to do so
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"New home sales by builders are facing their own issues as well, supply shortages and rising material costs are weakening affordability value that they tend to offer."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot Opendoor has 1 million daily traffic vs zillow 260 million lol.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Biggest thing IMO, builders around here are buying out Home Depot’s and other stores for OSB and 2x4s. Their suppliers are having a hard time getting them. Not including the wood being 3x, pvc, electrical. Just fucked. It has to pop soon."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there is a housing shortage and open door is a middle man they will make a shit ton of money, this isn’t a problem."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll tell ya what, to build (well have someone else build my house) I have to pay 100k more than the bank says it's worth... that's a housing problem. Prices were pre pandemic; now I'm scared to look."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also offer sh*t for prices and charge higher fees then a normal realtor.  It's designed for people that HAVE to get out of the house.  When the RE market crashes, they will be out of business because they won't have enough margin. The same as other i-buyers and discount brokers that were trendy years ago."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Through careful deliberation (which mainly consists of me smoking crack all night), we have determined our TSLA price target to be 44k by next April"""

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A strong housing market doesn't bode well for ibuyers. They are buying sight unseen homes at significant discounts with plans to flip the home
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s long on Pltr she ain’t buying weekly calls.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">  Why was 2020 a bad year when it was a boom for everyone else?

I wondered the same thing. Real estate has been insane after a short pause early last year when covid first hit. I work in real estate and had my best year ever in 2020. Blaming Opendoor's shortcomings on a bad market is doubtful."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"ARK has Tolstoy-novel size pages of research on their site, covering everything they invest in.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She's probably more intelligent than you so no... you're not the same at all.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, your balls aren’t as big as hers."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Difference is RKT netted billions last year.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just everything on the market being down?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did too, then sold for GME."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Opendoor has the largest ibuyer marketshare at 50%, all its competitors have significantly less. 2020 revenues declined for this entire sector as ibuyers sales went down with the covid anomaly. Opendoor's business model is more exposed to the ibuyer market. The upsides and downsides should impact it more than others."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Opendoor usually buys the house from the seller  in a cash deal, and they charge the seller significant fees for the privilege of getting quick cash for the house. Opendoor listings are usually fully owned by Opendoor. (Based on my experience in my limited area.) I don’t think they’re doing well at the moment because the housing market is insane. They will do better (maybe) when there’s a lot of inventory available. I say maybe because they also have a habit of not doing repairs, and overall condition/amenities may not be as competitive as spiffed up properties in a buyer’s market. Also they are notoriously difficult to deal with if repairs are required for the buyer’s financing to go through."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no you didn't
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're completely different markets and valuations, you can always diversify too"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will never happen. OpenDoor isn't the first Ibuyer program. Companies have tried iBuyer models for the last 15 years, it never works out for any of the companies which is why OpenDoor keeps reporting losses."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie has said time and time again her investment in Palantir is long-term.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Referring to the last 2 trading days
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Hot market” means seller power is higher than buyer power, ibuyers do better in the reverse, when sellers are willing to accept a lower all cash/quick settlement/ no contingency offer from a known entity."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it’s averaging down. She has a % for each stock in her portfolio and when the price drops, she has to buy more to maintain the percentage value. If the price increases, she sells. Simple"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She has been buying PLTR since $14
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who cares? I love dipping with Cath on PLTR at every opportunity. I hope to retire with my tendies from SkyNet someday. Far away from here.

if that's ""shitting the bed"" then why are you investing ?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically a good chunk of her portfolio is valued in growth solely so the fundamental crowd hates how ARK functions, in addition to the spac/tulip mania we've come quite far from valuating a company by the books so the nay sayers do have a point"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, so did the entire market."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah it might have shit the bed, but this retard Ape is going shopping on Ark products that are on sale!!

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, I just wanted a bit more leverage with the risk to reward at these levels. Shares and leaps def are the way to limit that risk if you prefer."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If there’s a housing bubble people hold onto their homes because their homes keep rising in value
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh you can’t compare their models. The problem with Zillow is, while their leads were good, they had been pricing themselves incredibly high, which worked. However, their main client (realtors) are now watching Zillow go into the iBuyer market - effectively competing against their main customer base. They NEED to succeed in this area. One other thing I don’t see mentioned much often about Zillow is their brokerage status. For them to become buyers of homes and then sell them, they need to be licensed in every area they plan to do business in. 

I work in the industry and while I don’t know what their status is on it, I can say that we’ve looked into the process on being licensed in every state. 

As it compares to OpenDoor, they have tons of value because of the element of disruption, the technology and ability to tour a house when one chooses to. No one is perfect but OpenDoor’s model offers something most others don’t."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maaan, i'm trying to build a raised garden and I can't find 2x4's (that aren't top premium, which I don't need) anywhere. Might just cave and have to use bricks.."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you in regard to the supply chain problems.  A shit-grade 2×4 is $8 now compared to about $3 a year ago, and if you go to the electrical section the shelves are virtually bare.  

I have about 4 HD stores and 3 Lowes within 15 minutes drive and they are all like this.  Had to order some electrical boxes online from Walmart which look flimsier than what I normally use.  Took two weeks to arrive and I only got the message to pick them up last night.  Got 10 instead of the 2 I need now, project delayed 3 weeks+ now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t limitations in supply chain and therefor reduced housing inventory result in continued increase in home values and not a pop? I don’t know the answer. Just curious your thoughts. Housing prices do seem aggressively extreme at this point, but I live in an area with limited new housing and so everyone is selling their trashed split levels from the 80s for half a million."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s OSB?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A housing shortage and a seller's market aren't necessarily the same thing.

In a seller's market, a seller can make a killing (houses get offers incredibly fast and as there are many offers, the bid is usually much higher than what the seller is asking for).

In a given market where there's a shortage in housing, that means that there is literally not enough housing for people to buy.  I could name 15-20 real estate markets in the US that have housing shortages with pre-qualified buyers but nothing in their price range.  When there's not enough housing for too many buyers, the bubble forms.  These are all incredibly hot - top real estate markets that we do business in (please read, we do business in all markets but no one wants to do business in the middle of Iowa (no offense Iowans)).

So how is this different?  In a housing shortage, the only way to get more houses on the market is to build them.  No ibuyer sells new houses - those are ALL sold by the builder in retail fashion.  The people that sell houses for builders are not real estate agents but they are employees of the builder."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well it works both ways, high demand in a strong housing market means higher activity in transactions and higher prices for sellers/buyers. Opendoor does both."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the comment. Opendoor seems a bad bet to me. Maybe CW gets a kickback.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,BUZZ. Just buy puts or short it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buyers are wholesalers. So I do a little wholesaling on the side so I know a little about it. Except 2020 the real estate wholesaling market there is no inventory to wholesale.

So what a wholesaler does or an I buyer in this case is they find a motivated seller who is willing to sell their home to them for a huge discount.

The formula is 70% of house value- repair cost- wholesaling fee.

The wholesaler then turns around and assigns the contract to the flipper cash buyer and the wholesaling fee is their profit.

Now ibuyers are wholesalers except everything is done online. So instead of offering 70% of home value they might offer 60% with a contingency that the final buyer gets a walk through.

Now your probably asking why somebody would be willing to sell their home for so much less then it is actually worth.

Well that's why it depends upon finding motivated sellers. These are tax delinquents, facing foreclosure, in need of significant repairs, etc. Your helping them by being able to close quickly and as-is.

It might change for wholesalers once the foreclosure moratium is lifted there might be more inventory then, but I've heard they are just going add the unpaid loans onto the back end and restructure them and if we have a bull market well then that means less inventory. 

Wholesaling and I buying is best during market crashes when a lot of people are losing their home.

Google Jerry Norton he is a big wholesaler or biggerpockets.com if you want to learn more."

If it's a bull market plenty of better ways to hustle. 

If we go into a crash I think they just going extend the foreclosures. 

Like wholesaling homes helps people who are in trouble and can't sell the traditional way because the house needs to much work they don't have the cash to fix it and they need to close fast.

Otherwise their is no point selling your home for 30-40% less then what you could get putting it on the market yourself. In this market I don't think even the crappy homes in need of major repairs need wholesalers anymore. Stuff is selling cash in couple weeks in some markets to regular buyers not flippers.

The Facebook group I'm in house flippers are asking wholesalers if they have any deals it seems like they are all desperate to find deals."

You can't compare earnings reports as apples to apples because Zillow and Redfin have multiple businesses wrapped up in there. It'd be like trying to compare AWS and GCP by looking at the total earnings reports from Google and Amazon. It'll tell you nothing since those two end up looking like noise  hidden inside the other businesses.

Zillow's eyeballs and revenue have nothing to do with what they're competing with Opendoor on. So OPEN isn't ""losing"" to Zillow in the iBuying space. Sure, they're losing in the consumer home search space, but they aren't even trying to compete."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know admittedly little in this area, but wouldn’t make sense that their earnings are declining throughout 2020 and into this year since way less people are selling homes in the pandemic? And if that is true then wouldn’t it follow that as more people get vaccinated and the economy bounces back more people will be selling and buying homes and thus their revenue would increase.

Like yeah it’s a gamble but i think it’s logical."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ken Griffin can eat a bag of dicks. The reason poor people making money causes inflation is because the system is designed to ensure that no matter how many dollar bills the average person has their total wealth must never exceed a fraction of a percent of the lazy assholes who sit at the top of their empires and blame everyone else for problems with the economy.   When poor people become too wealthy rich people simply print more money and give it to themselves.  They don't have to deal with the fact that they made a bad bet on the stock market when they have infinite money cheat codes.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Y'all going to *trust Ci*tadel?!?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL he said the tweet of an ice cream cone caused the stock to double...or could it be other hedges coming with atomic bombs
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t inflation good for stock market and bad for the economy? Biden admin have to try to make gasoline ***dirt cheap*** to fight off inflation.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who gives a shit what Cidadel thinks..

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">The fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years. It represents a dynamic where certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds. You've taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.

I can't think of a better way to put into words the era of boomer investing drawing to a close."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The HF's are clearly full on retarded. Read the last paragraph. The ice cream tweet will studied for years.? WTF Meanwhile the whole of the internet fully understands what happened here. The HF's are being caught thinking like it is 1996 and have no idea how to modernize. The managers are old and the ones who are not were taught by dinosaurs.  The retail investors are in control now. That meme ""I am the captain now"" is now quite literal. They just showed the entire table their cards and they don't even know it. GME & AMC will be the tip of the iceberg. Keep it up apes!!! This is the beginning of the revolution!!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It does say they were up 5% through feb. their performance runs a bit counter to the idea they’re short. Or maybe they’re actually long??? Lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My pearls are fully clutched.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL! The inflation stuff is nonsense. Giving money to rich people doesn't cause inflation except in the price of stocks, private islands, private jets, etc. The middle class causes inflation and a few stimulus checks isn't going to fix the hurt that many people experienced throughout the pandemic. The treasury has said as much.

I wonder if this inflation talk has anything about the massive amount of short interest in the market these days."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like that retail trade has picked up in 2020. It is a sign of the oppression against workers - 2020 job loss and furloughs opened up time for people to trade. That scares wall street. That can explain why Universal Basic Income scares WS and the 1%. It is even alluded to in the first parts where the stimulus checks affect the market in a way this CEO is scared of.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out the pinned post in the GME thread, there’s a lot of good DD there. It explains how short sellers create synthetic shares to short a stock, that’s why there’s more shares of GME than actually in existences which is the price is going higher. If you watch The Big Short, they basically renamed CDOs as ETFs."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is just the sentiments of the rich. When it's high they are happy and when it's low they are happy. It's also the sentiments of retail.

Now that number is up to like 9 mil. Regardless of if GME goes to the moon or not, you're probably going to have people getting high off of possible gains and ""we did it leddit"" and probably going to invest in whatever fucking half assed DD that comes onto this subreddit regardless of if they fucking read the DD or not.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's clear, you end up with sociopaths who take those resources for themselves. They need cheap labor and they shift the economics towards extracting the resources as fast as possible. Pretty obvious. The money they make doesn't go back in to the economy(the pay for the slave labor is just a guise that ultimately gets extracted back out through rent costs, food costs, etc which all funnel the money back in to the sociopaths hands).

Places were these resources don't exist are not attacked by the sociopaths because they are ""worthless""."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo the Aladdin TV show had an episode on inflation and a guy had to buy bread with a cart of gems. Funny how it's stuck in my head for so many years.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure since there's no proof of that. We know for sure though that they somehow created tons of fake shares.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Prove that? Wtf? It's literally proven by a 140% short float and institutions owning more than 100% of GameStop. Those numbers prove it alone. Do you want me to break into Gabes office and read you his transaction records or something?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,🍌🍌🍌🚀💎🐵
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your description of the hearing was way too damn accurate.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He doesn’t know that. He’s a retard, just like he says."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,proof is in the dark pool not retail
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think most of that volume is market makers hedging for changes in delta. Just my opinion.

Someone triggers a sharp price movement, and MMs carry it one way or the other and we see high volume on the charts."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, basically. In theory. Remember the shorts are able to artificially increase supply though which allows them to dilute the shares. If they cannot drive the price down enough(using whatever means they can, even illegal/unethical) then they end up making the problem worse. Shorters lose when the price goes up. When people come in to buy the price guys up(demand)... shorters do not actually increase supply though except through FUD. What happens if people don't fall for their bluff.

&#x200B;

E.g., No different than in poker with a guy with a pair of 2's and goes all in trying to bluff and gets called on it and loses everything. That is what has happened unless the shorters can somehow fabricate enough FUD to drive people out, but if you know they are bluffing then how will they drive you out? (now, if people start selling to take profit they end up helping the shorts and that could end up creating a problem, but if there are enough buyers they will just come in and buy up the stock knowing they are going to bank in the end).

It all comes down to how long the shorters can keep this up vs the buyers. If the shorters have more money they can keep playing this came and eventually drive the price down enough to either cover(possibly at a loss but not terrible but they probably hedged enough to make a profit) OR the buyers have enough money to keep buying the shorts bullshit and once the shorts can't continue the stock will moon and all the money the shorts put in is now taken by the buyers.

At some point the equation will return to zero sum and the winner gets the winnings."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But I bought 2.16 shares 1 month ago! That definitely contributed!!!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Institutions and Algos just compare darkpool history to the chart including the dark pool options amazingly it correlates
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong, most institutional investors do not trade the stock. They end up losing too much in the process because they swamp the market. If they are going to trade to take profit they would do it in bits... unless they are playing the game and taking sides.

&#x200B;

It's not to say that some institutions are not playing the game, but I'm just saying that it's not all institutions. There is absolutely no reason for them to buy or sell in such large quantities in such short times unless they are trying to get out or in or trigger some event.

Mainly what we are seeing is HF's battling it out. The longs vs the shorts. Retail is just there to pick up the scraps, but in doing so it makes it harder and order for the shorts. Retail has around 7% of the stock, that isn't insignificant. Some longs may get out and take their profit, no one knows what is really going on.

BUT, If GS gets its shit together, the stock is still valuable and this is really the crux. Is RC going to side with retail and turn GS in to a powerhouse or is he just going to hype, then make profit, then run away? He has a tremendous amount of power to send GME soaring and that will trigger all kinds of cascading effects that could send GME in to unheard of levels."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no proof of whales and I don't believe anyone's prop desk or risk management teams will allow betting with retail. Most of the crazy volume I've seen is from market makers which is because they are rehedging due to calls that retail is decidedly buying.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The GME situation sounds more like a IV situation. The IV on GME options changes drastically on just single dollar moves so hearing a call fluctuate from $900 to $2.5K sounds about right honestly. 

But as far as doing limit orders.. I’m unfortunately stuck with shitty robinhood. I’d leave but they’re the only broker I have rn that lets me sell options. I’ve had my TD for a year now nearly and I still can’t even do covered calls. But anyways...

Doing a limit sell on robinhood is extremely risky. 
1. The algos will absolutely front run you. As soon as you change the bid/ask, hundreds of other bids suddenly appear with your current one, making it so that you don’t get immediately filled and it’s up for chance. 

2. The premium on my option wasn’t accurately being shown since the chain was frozen. I had an idea of how much my puts were worth but I didn’t want to be unsure and overbid or under bid and never get filled at all. Robinhood does not cater to giving their users the “best fills possible”. Yes or no."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good points on both sides all around . Hm. Lots of thinking to do.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think what makes GME such an awesome holding is that all parties involved have a *sizable* contribution to the daily trading and ownership of the stock. There's less than 70 million shares that exist. The amount of volume traded in a normal day is sometimes more than the twice the total shares outstanding. That's why the movement is so crazy, and that's what is going to continue to drive price action. its fuckn lit"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Either that or long whales buying. But no fkin way its pure retail
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why it settles hard
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, nice"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think most of the high volume events are market makers hedging for delta.

But sharp price movements leading to changes in delta might be triggered by some whales. They know MMs will carry it the rest of the way."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, do you think market makers are just free flowing bots scanning the market or do you think they're owned?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same with Fidelity. Lost 50% of profit because I sold right before a peak before a big sell/short and it sold half way down.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha.
I’ll pray your portfolio grows to the level you can get a proper broker that’ll let you sell options."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a measure of caution, I would funnel new money into a different broker. This, of course, is my opinion and definitely not financial advice."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chances are they caused the collapse or had insider info. For all we know they installed someone in Enron to cook the books so it would fail then they could come in... or there was never any cooking of the books and they created this after the fact. That is, they shorted enron in to oblivion using FTD's and naked shorting causing it to go bankrupt then they came in and cooked the books after the fact. The same could have been done with Leeman Brothers and others during the 2008 crash. Or it could be a bit of both. 

The point is that these fuckers are screwing over humanity by manipulating everything.

Go check out Judd Bagleys videos, he has other examples of companies being bankrupted intentionally by using shorts as does the Wall Street Conspiracy documentary(The 1.5hr one)."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short float is what percentage of outstanding shares are owed back. It was 144% at one point, which means that short sellers had to return every share plus 44% more."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thinked for you. Buy GME
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">There's less than 70 million shares that exist

Are we positive?  Because institutional ownership here says its over 110 million - https://i.redd.it/2w263turtsp61.jpg

I remember the gamestop statement said they could sell shares, have they done that?

Not trying to spread FUD, I'm all in, just curious on what's going on."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The volume doesn't tell you how many shares are being traded in terms of float. If just means people are trading, but they could be trading back and forth with each other and nothing actually changing. X sells 1M shares to Y. Y shares 1M shares to X, repeat. (sorta like a game of hot potato or musical chairs)

&#x200B;

Clearly the short interest should be close to zero. Some think it is 200%+."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail holding shares is definitely a huge factor though. Without that, we wouldn't be seeing the volatility like we have now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, it depends on the supply. if the supply is constrained then retail can significantly change the price. You can bet some whales are going to get in on the action, but there is no reason why they would buy all at once(costs them more). But there is a game being played and where it stops no body knows(well, I'm sure some know)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Market makers work for the cboe providing liquidity in the options market. They do this by profiting on the bid/ask spread and maintaining a delta neutral position.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Saw it happening. Beautifull.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Such a bad case of sugoma.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I eat the fish 

(I like the stock)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"no worries. trading on GME is highly active, as such, the institutional ownership tends to change hands more frequently than the 3 month period they go in between reporting. Look at the date those funds reported, many go back to December. 

Using institutional ownership is sort of a lagging indicator (tells you things after they happen). 

GME's earnings report last tuesday said their were only 69.75 Million, and yes, they also said they reserve the right to offer more shares At The Market if they need to, but don't have any plans or expectations of doing such for AT LEAST the next 1.5 years, but probably longer"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"just means that there are 70 million real shares outstanding, the rest are synthetic"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Back your claims up. Close to 0? Based on what exactly.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. That helps making the stock super volatile by limiting free float. I still stand by my point that retail did not DIRECTLY cause the spike throigh buying. Rather someone non-retail did
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That and the price would almost certainly be sub $40.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Market makers may work for the CBOE but many large institutions and banks have them as well
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not suggesting not Fidelity.
Not advising too."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good to know, thanks!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,so basically the reason intitutional ownership shows 110m is because some have reported while others havent? so it is actually much less just not all reported at the same time?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No moron, you totally misunderstood.

The short interest \*SHOULD\* be 0% when 100% of the stock is owned. It is too risky otherwise. Else we end up with what we have(we end up with more stock owned than exists with any bull run potentially causing huge losses for shorts).

That is, when the float is 0 the short interest should be 0 to prevent massive risk to the shorts(or at least limit it to a few percent).

&#x200B;

The short interest on GME is anywhere from 18%(on yahoo) to 40%(when you add up total owned from institutions and others) to 200% or more(if you start looking in to the FTD's)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldnt you say it’s likely though, that retail caused that someone to jump in and cash in on this,
 once retail got the ball rolling?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of institutions that follow delta neutral strategy? What is your point? 

When retail buys a call, the person selling the call if they are a market maker they buy x amount of shares according to delta to remain delta neutral.

Weeklies=high leverage."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure, the same thing is true for the reported short interest on the stock. Right now, TDA tells me it was 18.54% as of 3/15/2021. But, that honestly tells us nothing because it does not include the price action from $180 to $120, back up to $200."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every stock is owned 100% , minimum. This is with 0 SI.
As shares get loaned out - ownership rises over 100% - always (someone buys the stock from the short).
In essence, naked short selling begins at over 100% SI, since there’s no possible way for these shares to ever be physically located.

Long GME, stay blessed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue is that shorts are creating a false supply. A supply that doesn't actually exist. If 100% of the float is actually being held then there should be no possible way to short because you are technically creating more shares than could exist. It would be very risky since the shorters are selling the shares which means that the when they are bought up the price could increase. They have to short more to try to drive it down. Brokerages should prevent that kind of risk. Of course if shorts intentionally are screwing it over and using many methods to manipulate it then they will drive the stock down. But it shouldn't be allowed. Now when it's like 150%... what the fuck. They are essentially counterfeiting at that point and not actually just ""borrowing shares"". The whole point with borrowing shares is that there will always be someone who is holding so you can temporarily borrow from them without them selling resulting in double selling(and counterfeiting). When it is over 100% and the float is small and most are holding you are not borrowing shares to sell, you are fabricating them to increase more supply and if more buyers come in then you just made things worse and are artificially diluting the stock price. It looks like it is going down but it's actually going up. The more this is allowed the worse the problem gets..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I meant that it is held. (that the volume is very low or 0) Cause clearly all stock is 100% owned by someone ;)

What I meant was that when 100% of the stock is being held(not being traded, volume = 0, which probably never truly occurs) then it becomes more risky for shorts. The less *real* volume being traded the less likely the shorts can cover their position(since fewer sellers) which means that if demand increases the stock can spike up significantly causing severe losses. 

Naked short selling can occur at any time if it's simply using FTD's to fabricate shares. Gamestop has around 1M FTD's a month that are reported."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine if these same investment banks and their hedge fund clients opened short positions the days before in some of these companies. 

Those fuckers would have made millions if not a few billion. 

It would be interesting to see who opened new short positions last week in each company. Something the SEC should be doing. 😆"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont think too much into it. More than likely they lent that margin to Bill Hwang in some capacity (that fuk that got 80b liquidated) and they unloaded it on Friday when they decided he wasnt good for the money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think that companies that got the short end of the stick with that sell off will want to get revenge and buy a shitton of meme stock?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus! It's an easy Google you morons. The majority of the shares were sold of because of the new SEC rules regarding Chinese companies, it happened pre market and had a buyer lined up didn't even touch open market.

 Also the other smaller portion had to do with a hedge fund being margin called. They sold of the Discovery, viacom positions that were up 45%"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This would require them to have people's interest in mind
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They don't have to since they were acting as the broker for the company who owned the shares. It's been in the finicial news since it was such a huge unusual sell off. If you have a Bloomberg terminal you can see who the broker is and block size of the trades so everyone has the ability to know bust must of us normies don't have one.

Insurance companies make money on what's called the float.

That's the time between when they collect the money on to when they pay it out and what they do with the money as investments go. Can't say how long it will be until profitability most insurance companies take a long time. Root did have tremendous growth and with the pandemic ending that growth should accelerate. As a data analytic company though each 9 month iteration their pricing models based on telematics become more valuable and in the future they would be able to sell that to big name insurance companies as a software as a service.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think shitron just stole your DD and other's and just ran with it. Whatever I like the stock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"and their is literally no reason for it to be shorted. I get it, covid happened and people stayed at home. The vaccine is here though and people are playing the reopening trade now. Plus insurance might be a mature industry, but $ROOT is not an insurance company they are a Tech company. That is why the major buyers at the IPO were Tech investors. They see the innovative potential of $ROOT. 

Why is the #1 determinant of traditional auto insurance pricing models a person's credit score, that is why insurance is so much more expensive for poor people. 

Data analytics and telematics is going change that and make insurance rates more fair for everyone!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The CEO of Palantir is very weird. I think any data science driven company you are going have very fucking weird people. 

I understand tesla already has their own datasets I don't know what price modeling they have done, if they have. I know they talked about tesla insurance in the past. 

Having a better more accurate way to price out insurance is going be very useful to bigger insurance companies. I see $Root as potentially taking a small amount of the insurance world themselves and then doing SaaS for the bigger insurance companies.

I'm not planning on holding longterm cause this is wallstreetbets and I have ADHD the attention span just isn't their for me as soon as this is $60 by April 16th I'm going sell, I just know right now looking at it as a tech company that is going revolutionize insurance pricing models by using a data driven approach they are undervalued. 

Some of the biggest tech companies where at the IPO including Dragoneer. Dragoneer didn't just buy at the $27 IPO but also bought at the $17 dip, and now it's $14..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So is citron, but where do you think they got the idea from?

They got it from wallstreetbets. Just type in $root DD in the search bar. Tons of DD going back to December.

This is our play."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He doesn't, he stole it from wallstreetbets imo. Tons of other DD on here."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"$LMND tripled in price on a ss in December, and $ROOT could too."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can go through 50 states but their product sucks. Geico, Progressive and others are undercutting them and have better service than ROOT."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I'm understanding correctly, homeless people who recycle cans from the trash make more money than this company?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll stick to gme shares and spy, ccl puts. thanks for the contribution though, good luck"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have root right now, and it's honestly amazing.  

It's like $75 a month when every other provider wanted to charge north of 125. I rear ended someone last year, and they paid out to both of us immediately, took me one week to get my car fixed. Deductible was $1k, but i can get a $0 deductible if i pay like $20 more per month. Still better than what i could've gotten at every major insurance provider for that amount."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was a 24yr old white male my insurance was almost $400 a month. Would you rather have your rates determined by your credit score, age, race, and gender or by your actual driving behavior.

Telematics is growing in the automotive industry, and after a few iterations, GIECO, Progressive, All-State, Statefarm are likely to outsource their telematics to whoever has the best datasets. The future of the insurance world is they are likely to use a data analytic company like $Root to develop their cost models.

Your thinking of them as an insurance company, instead of a tech company. Each user they get now grows the data sets. After a few iterations of adjusting the pricing models they would be able to outsource their analytics to other insurance companies.

Their ""customers"" aren't just the customer but the product as well."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Homeless people recycling cans also make more money then tesla
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man I'm still holding my gme shares and I think spy puts going print this week too.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If their underwriting makes financial sense, the other big players will simply copy it and ROOT is done.

Right now, if I want insurance today, I can buy from State Farm, Geico, Progressive, whoever... I will be insured TODAY.

If I buy from Root? Download our app, enjoy a 14 day waiting period, and maybe get $10 off the competitor's rates.

LOL. What a business model."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly sounding just like homelessness with extra steps. Why even bother with the insurance bit and lose millions ever quarter? No sense.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Each iteration takes 9 months and leads to further reductions in loss ratios. 

Your right the big insurance companies are likely to copy root in the future, and that's a great thing. Root will be able to handle the telematics for them. SaaS. The data $Root is collecting is very valuable.

Traditional insurance price rates based primarily on credit scores, but also gender, age, where you live, what type of car you drive, and then driving record.

Telematics and data analytics is going revolutionize the insurance industry and lead to fairer more accurate pricing."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most early stage startups are not profitable for a long time. Actually I don't know many companies that turn a profit in the first few years. $root IPO'd in 2020. 2019 was pre-ipo. Almost every company that's talked about on this sub is years from profitability. Actually I lied I think tesla did turn a profit this year but is still selling something crazy like 1000xP/E. When you are in the growth stage it's better to put cash in long term growth. Right now in the broader market their is a rotation from tech to value as inflation fears abound, but $root is oversold imo. Their growth in one year during a very bad year for driving is crazy. Post pandemic their growth will be higher. The datasets they are collecting along the way is also going be profitable to big name insurance companies. The insurance side once you have the customers and are not investing in marketing is not capital intensive so inflation resilent. On the tech side though the analytics is going led to SaaS to bigger names."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Telematics are tarot cards. 

Easily faked or abused. (Turn off your phone before doing your aggressive drives). 

Once they are faked enough (and they will be because there is a financial incentive to fake them) then the game is up and we go back to non-tangible data that is extremely predictive anyway."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"2%? What is this, financial advice for Boomers?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,March dips bring April rips
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Used to be a saying about nobody makes money in the stock market between May and November.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"since my birthday's in June, stonks telling me to suck a dick"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no understanding as to why September is that shit

Edit: Jesus Christ many informal replies thanks guys. Am a europoor and our fiscal year starts different times. Makes sense. I love you all"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax returns?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY 420 this April not a meme
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY 420 on 4/20 because we live in a simulation and the players are going wild with the meme mods
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've had this feeling, I don't know much about stocks but my birthday is April 9 and there's contracts for that day so I bought a call for that day. Here's for my 22nd birthday!!

EDIT:
I've never gotten so many upvotes!!!! My phone has been blowing up. APE-RULES"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Since I’m still very new to the market what does this mean because April is my birthday and if this is good news trust me I could use it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Volatility in Feb/March probably creates buying opportunities in April.  Not sure how this year will go since last April was pretty solid lockdown.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I’ll buy in Feb and Sep and sell in the fall. STONKS 😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watch out for face ripping gains or what?

Oh no!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait to rake in that 1.75% return
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aries is a very bullish sign.

^^^This ^^^is ^^^not ^^^financial ^^^advice ^^^and ^^^I ^^^am ^^^not ^^^a ^^^professional, ^^^everyone ^^^here ^^^is ^^^an ^^^actual ^^^retard."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So buy a lot of shit in Feb and March, hold through April, start looking to sell in May, buy everything back in June, sell again sometime near the end of July, buy in August and Sept, and sell everything in November. GOT IT."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This will be especially true for South African stocks and ETFs.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This would have really helpful if it was shared two months ago ✌️😐
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Its called APE-ril for a reason.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"...but what is the distribution of the average monthly returns? Also, May and July look book better (post-election years)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Post election years SUCK! No more elections
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh so this is the meaning behind that green day song
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Past performance is not indicative of future results. $GME to $15000
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Noticed this while looking at SPYs 10yr chart.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell in May go away is the expression
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting. Am I reading this correctly that it makes sense to sell all stocks at the end of July and rebuy at the start of October?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,September is bad because everyone knows September is bad. The short sellers know so they short. The investors know so they don't buy.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just amazed at how many people actually pay attention to their birthday. Is everyone in this thread 6 years old?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape-ril*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this chart saying you can actually time the market within reason?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY puts.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's because it's the next logical wave of spending after Christmas. People free up some money a few months after spending a lot on the holidays. 

Retail stocks in particular do well this time of year."

OOH! OOH! QUARTERS! We're afraid of the reports that come out!

Oh, and in August/Sept everyone's on vacation and it's nice outside so fuck stonks.

Trees better.

🦍Come back inside when it's cold.

But for real - like Ray Dalio says - and he admits to being a regular dude ... kinda:

History repeats itself. Study history, get an idea what will happen. You will fuck up. Learn from your mistakes, don't fuck up next time.

I'm an ape so don't listen to me."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn now seeing this market will tank 2% on Monday lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that’s the market and GME has a negative delta, wouldn’t that mean GME would do the opposite of the market"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So I should buy shares of SPY ETF or VOO ETF and hodl them til May? Is this the way?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LETS FOOKING GO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks go 🆙🚀 GME flies to heaven 👼
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I would love to buy again but I don’t think I can afford the current price of gme. Hopefully some low stocks get a good raise.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this post! Stonks goes up (finally in APRIL)!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/20/2021 = $4,202,021/share"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a low spender this makes me think I should try to stock up on buying power cash until mid September. 

Hodl everything else while resisting FOMO plays."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear the moon is lovely in April 🚀
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,4/20
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha my birthday month looks like a capsized boat.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank goodness. We need it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta be football season... Everyone betting College, NFL and playing Fantasy??? Notice the big dip at end of Aug that coincides with first week of CFB. 💰💰💰"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,those bars are almost bigger than my boner
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So that means GME wont take off until later in the year when they need to crash the market to find the tickets to the moon.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's an Easter theory. People in mostly Christian countries tend to get sadder and affects the market until around April or end of March when resurrection bring in the Joy back and it turn into market optimism too. 🤔 best one to fit besides may be tax season.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,April = 4 = quad witching?!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That's like a good 10 min session for GME.🚀
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,March losses will turn you to April bosses
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,FunDip StockRip
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Out for a rip bud

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s when Wall Street goes on vacation to the Hamptons
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell in May and go away but remember to be back in September!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,November looks pretty fucking great from this chart
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, DD checks out."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,its just a market cycle. optimism after march because tends to be the end of market corrections. then things get over speculated and come down. the cycle repeats. its normal really. it makes sense that the last months of the year tend to be good or not drop as long as an economy keeping growing that should be the case. just my 2 cents
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sandbag the numbers in Q3 so you can blow away Q4 and collect that sweet, sweet performance bonus."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause its my birthday and stonks hate me :(

Bad Moods."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Because 9/11
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"because it's school, even stocks dont like school >:("
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,fellow ass eater
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Might simply be that it's the end of a fiscal year for many large corporations. Accounting and audits and so forth.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,End of fiscal year for government and alot of companies just a Guess
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's likely people getting sticker shock from their summer vacations, which puts a lull on shopping, travel, eating out, etc.

It's also the lull before the holiday buying cycle begins."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it the harvest time of year
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Europe basically goes on vacation from end of July through mid to late September. I'd bet that has something to do with it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,End of the fiscal year
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"tax refunds in april boost commerce

kids going to school in September = Parents relax for a few weeks and ignore responsibilities/are back from vacations and spending frugally"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everybody goes back to school, so everyone is spent from late Aug spending?

Just a guess"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not shit, it's just buy"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've heard it's because many businesses use it as the end of their fiscal year so a ton of books get balanced throughout the month. Guess who pays for that? Bagholders, that's who."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because Congress goes back into session. New laws, new ideas = uncertainty in the market.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling stocks to pay for your kids college tuition, maybe. Likewise, lots of people load up their portfolios for tax credits. Add the tax returns used to buy stock, and you have a party!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My guess is most companies including DoD fiscal year end after September. Just a guess..
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So October and November can be that much better.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,End of fiscal year?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS!!"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,9/11
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cuz 9/11 is bound to happen every year. Cramer logic*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t seem to be a consistent thing, September has just had some really bad outliers over the years. 2008 recession and in 2002 were both around -10%. 1986 and 2000 both saw major dips in September too I believe."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, why do you think the song is called ""Wake me up when September Ends?"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of business sell less in septembre due to the end of the summer holiday (a lot is spent in the holiday per family so family have less to spent in this month) add to it the start of school which mean new clothes shoes and book and school fee for a lot of us citizen) again more money spent by family but not in all the market) so company feel it in September just an opinion
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks start to get their seasonal depression.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because everyone is sleeping until september ends, like the song dictates."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Because ist cash out Time for the Q3 trades at the wallstreet
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"First the carmakers started their model years in September after retooling over the summer. When TV networks came along, they started their season in September to take advantage of the carmakers advertising their new models. Now even Apple updates iPhones in September to have a good supply for the holiday season, and the video game companies do the same. Stocks tend to peak on optimism before the time of new model introductions and fall quickly on the reality."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"God bless the europoors, they humble us all"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those rentangles are towers. What else has fallen in september?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,eggs and rabbit futures
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL no. It is pretty clear. Ape-ril
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginning of the Fiscal Year?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s this April and does she have a single Brother
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax Day is in May this year.....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,FAANG earnings April July Oct Jan.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Taxed but no returns.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably yeah. People taking out long term capital gains at the start of the year and paying taxes means more less buying and more selling. Then the market rebounds back to where it was before.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We share birthdays ! Looking forward to april !
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Here's to hoping your call prints.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,April 4th! Happy birthday 🎈 also have calls on the 9th

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention April this year is looking like when inflation make start taking hold. That was even before Ever Given blocking a major international trade route.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually if all the beta talk on here is accurate, GME seems to correlate negatively to the market.

So if it dips I'm guessing the standard advice that will be given is BUY more / HODL?"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking maybe it had something to do with earth signs.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is that?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I just heard last night that they just refloated the ship and travel has resumed already?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gimmie $tickers to look at please!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"How would South African equities benefit if the ships get rerouted?  Even if they pass by the cape of good hope they're still passing on their way to Europe / Americas. It's not like SA gets to charge them for the passage like Egypt does with the Suez.  

Even if they did get to charge for passage, that would be a benefit to only the authority charging them.  South African equities won't be affected by ships sailing by the coast.  This isn't the 1500s when sailing ships had to stop at a port on their way during a trade route."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. We should just pick a guy and stick with him till he dies.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel this way about JPOW speaking. Put a sock in it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's right in their name man
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well obviously apes won't leave. Couldn't live a day without cheering for loss porn and the smell of tendies."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell in May and go away.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get a cash advance of all available credit on all your credit cards, talk to friends and family about getting some loans,  next talk to “payday lenders” (super easy to work with),  then talk with your bank about a $25,000 “working capital” line of credit.  Once all that is done open a “margin” account on fidelity or TD Ameritrade (easy interface, perfect for beginners).   Robinhood offers immediate 100% leverage but they’re assholes so don’t even talk to them unless it’s to tell Vlad he’s a crook simp bitch with a stupid haircut. 

If done correctly and under the strict advice of an online gambling forum, you should have anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 in “dry powder” to begin day trading.  

Beginners should start with iron condors, butterflies and selling naked calls to get a handle on market movements.   Do these for 3-4 days, a week at tops, that should get you ready for day trading TQQQ and Tesla with your entire account.  

Good luck! You got this!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro like it's not hard. I opened by brokerage account by calling my families contact at Chase. Then with a quick $100k from my pops I managed to turn it into $1.2m. It's super easy dude, just work hard like me and you'll make it bruh."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Working with European co workers sucks sometimes because at any given time 60% are on holiday during summer projects. And they don't typically work on holiday. American sector is so exploiting of their labor force. I have worked significantly 4 out of my last 6 vacations. Props to them though
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A summer vacation of 8 weeks? Teachers maybe. The rest of the workforce half at most.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am I missing something?  This sub is traditionally bullish, so stocks going up in April means less losses, not more"

Don’t believe me then go meet my baby mama.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Such wisdom. How does one acquire this knowledge
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only advice, the only advice ever, is to buy and hold then wait then buy more and, wait for it, hold that too"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have acted on this theory. Made a 10X on SPY puts on a GME rip couple weeks back.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Youre misinterpreting the data. A negative beta simply means that there is an inverse correlation between the market and GME. It says nothing about a causation. Beta is just the covariance between GME and the market divided by GME's own variance. Its a backwards looking value, and you really cannot use it to predict future values without context. 


As for why the beta was so negative; it probably has more to do with GME's initial gigantic rally happening  during a market downturn. That one massive spike in price was probably enough to throw off all beta figures, looking at charts alone. (Im too lazy to run any numbers to calculate statistical significance.) You could make the argument that GME caused that correction with its rally, but I have serious doubts and dont think thats the case. There were other market concerns (speculation with interest rates and treasury yeilds among them) that were shaking overall investors confidence. Unless you can provide some solid evidence otherwise, Occams Razor makes that the most likely scenario. So, no a market upturn does not mean GME is 100% gonna see a downturn (or vice versa)"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I don't know how the US workforce doesn't just collapse from the stress.

Here in Sweden, you have to have 4 consecutive weeks vacation sometime during june, july or august. It's in the law. And if you get sick, you can cancel your vacation and take sick days, effectively saving your vacation for a later date.

Also, why would you work during your holidays? You're being paid to rest, not work. This is the same stupid (sorry) logic as working unpaid overtime. Why? Unless you own the company, you shouldn't be doing more than what they're paying you to do."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"not quite accurate. They are doing multiple things to free it. The plan to offload the ship is in place as a fallback if they are not able to free the ship before they can get the cranes there. Due to the impact of this they are throwing basically everything into fixing this problem no matter what the cost of even if it will be needed, including getting a crane there. Thing could be free before the cranes even get there for all we know."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's [this](https://bankruptcylawnetwork.com/the-sabbatical-year-and-the-forgiveness-of-debts/) wherein religiously-observant Jewish people essentially liquidate debt-based assets prior in order to adhere to the debt forgiveness aspect without taking losses.  If a debt-based position is exited prior then the cash is ok to hold on to through it, but debts have to be forgiven when held at that time.  Probably also why market crashes happen around that time: if the market is already teetering on the brink of collapse having mass-selloffs like that pushes it over the edge where it might have lasted another few months otherwise.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Have they considered putting the ship in reverse ?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro that shit is there through end of April at the earliest.  Have you seen the plans for moving it?  They have only two shots to refloat it tonight and Monday night at high tide and if that doesn't work then the plan is to unload the containers one by one with specialty cranes.

There's already a backlog of 600+ ships waiting to go, not to mention the 50 ships per day already scheduled to pass that will be added on daily unless ships start passing around the cape of good hope.

That said, betting on South African equities based on this event is a pretty dumb idea, even if ships do end up routed around the cape."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Max a week? Lol no less than a month.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean that they are going around the Cape of Good Hope, around South Africa?  Because the Horn of Africa is not near South Africa.  It's on the east coast near Somalia and Ethiopia, south of Saudi Arabia and Yemen."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why? the ships dont enter south africa
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except they're not. And modern ships don't need to stop in SA, like they did 100 years ago. And they sure as fuck wouldn't sell cargo there, since it's bound to EU/China/SIN anyway.

But otherwise, sure."

Unless they drop everything then."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a little correction/clarification, not everyone in Sweden will get 4 consecutive summer weeks of vacation.

The law states that you need to get at least 25 days of vacation per year (which will be 5 x 5-day work weeks). Most people can take several of the weeks in the summer though, yeah. But the law is just that you have the right to that vacation, not that you need to get it in the summer."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Four consecutive weeks?! Maybe. In about ten years. IF I’m lucky. Until then I can take one week. But even then...it’s tough to decide if I should take an entire week or maybe spread it out a little over the entire year. Fuck man.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because if work doesn't get done within expected timeliness, monthly targets are not met. This means the company thinks it is not being as profitable as they wanted. They dock employees pay or use it as justification to not in increase merit based wages. On an individual level, if you are constantly performing highly and you do not go above and beyond just once, it reflects in management comments. I work as an engineer in a consulting setting so typically we strive to help our clients and provide customer service beyond reproach; so we are expected to take the brunt of the load to make them content with our work."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"At my work (UK large bank) I work 35h a week as a full time employee. I can choose to work from:

5 x 7h days (1h unpaid lunch), normally 8am-4pm or 9am- 5pm. 10am-6pm and 7am-3pm are offered but not common so depends on specific department and role - and reason for request (i.e. childcare reasons = more likely to be approved).

4 x 8.75h days (30 mins unpaid lunch), normally 8am-5:15pm and get an extra day off each week. Loads of people who do this choose either a Monday or Friday to get a long weekend, or Wednesday to break up the week. 

When I hear about some americans working 80h+ weeks it seems crazy. Burnout and stress must be common?"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's stuck diagonally end to end because the ship is longer than the width of that part of the canal.  Look at satellite photos.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Except they have to pass the horn of africa on their way to the Cape of Good Hope.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Some cargo will be dumped for cheap in SA because it will spoil before it can get to europe after this delay. But tbh I doubt that benefits SA enough to justify going long on SA ETF which mostly consists of banks and telco anyway

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It really is. It's fun to zoom out to look at the oceans and discover how many ships are out there at any given time. You also realize how important the Suez is when you zoom out from the Ever Given and see the hundreds of boats sitting on either end of the canal.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually mentioned this to another broker last week that there would be a good chance for some extra volatility chances this week. There are many folks in the industry who take this week coming off to spend time with family. The week or so before holidays tend to have increased movements.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly that's what I do, when I'm in between jobs I take 2 to 3 weeks off. 

Like if I get an offer, I push it a month away if possible and then I immediately put in my 2 weeks. That way although unpaid I have 1 to 2 weeks where I can reflect and wind down. But then again after my 2 weeks are in im basically in shut down mode. 

I think its true what they say about employment and dreams. You have to keep working jobs you hate to realize the job you like."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's coarse, irritating, and gets everywhere?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well not in shipping you aren't.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m shocked by the amount of boats/ships out there!  I figured there were a lot but being able to see them puts it in perspective.

2 out of the top 5 biggest congressional recipients of Cannabis lobbying in 2020 just so happen to be our President and Vice President. Bernie Sanders is also among that top group. When federal legalization happens, it won't be the Canadian companies set to profit off it."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The United States weed companies are far superior to the Canadians.. just look at the numbers. Why would anyone on earth think that any of the Canadian LPs are better than Curaleaf?? Because they’re high on their own bias
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone please tell my man who MO is invested in, and where they are based out of. 

Bless your heart, dumbass."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"And ""Big Tobacco"" like British Tobacco? 

The company who just put 200m+ into a Candian company.... Oh ok. That big tobacco. 

Jesus you people make this easy. Lmao"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re a jack ass and you clearly don’t understand what is going on, you’re letting your own bias draw the conclusions for you... It’s OK though don’t beat yourself up for it 99% of the people on here don’t understand the way that the weed industry is going to play out. You really think that the United States is going to let CAN cannabis companies come in and take over when the discussion is focusing on social equity right now?? You’re a joke"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets," Agreed, so my question is why does VFF rarely come up in these conversations . From my DD I can't figure out why it hasn't been included more often or more well known. Seems legit. Yada yada. Not a financial advisor in the least bit."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I have no idea what this guy is getting at lmao
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My own bias? Well, I mean I have 5 years of sales and management experience in a tiered recreational marijuana industry, so I wouldn't call it bias. It's called experience. 

And I clearly explained how the US legal marijuana industry could look like New York's. So yes, 99% of people (those who can read) **DO** have an idea of how it's going to play out. 

Also, CAN companies aren't trying to ""take over."" Their best case scenario is thousands and thousands of new stores with shelf space, and open borders. 

Per an MSO themselves (Curaleaf), open borders allow them to open a few manufacturing and production centers so service a massive region of people. Without the vertical integration model, it's very cheap to expand. 

This is what LPs are positioned for. Also if NY is a model for national Legalization, then there will be an unimaginable amount of stores opening across the nation. All will be targets for CAN companies after reform. Much cheaper expansion. 

You're ignorant."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because most of the focus *should* be focused on the companies with the most potential. Not to say VFF won't do great and all, I just don't see them as an industry leader like a company like TilAphria will."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take your “favorite” Canadian cannabis company, if there can be such a thing, and compare their numbers from last quarter to any of the big four US multi state operators... fucking joke."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Trulieve is the most profitable weed company in the world. Curaleaf is the largest weed company in the world... and you’re an idiot
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for that imput, I do also like APHA/TIL very much for reasons you mentioned above and lots of reading :) definitely is likely for the market to open nationality. It's being grown all over already. We all know so much good will come of it. And it's very taxable."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get you, I meant the OP’s post doesn’t add up to me

Edit: I realized that all of OPs listed companies are US based so now I have no idea what this guy is getting at either. Lmao what is this thread"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats the bull thesis for them keeping 50+% market share in an open legal market? Lmfao
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know it’s hilarious the bias towards CanLPs when they clearly are at a disadvantage on every front except their home turf 😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not going to be an open legal market. the United States isn’t going to fully legalize marijuana for several years, we will be lucky if we get decriminalization and it’s a states rights issue the borders are not going to be opened up freely anytime soon for Canadian companies to come in and start selling their weed. All of your conclusions and assumptions are false or incorrect and all you are is a CanLP pumper..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol eventually there will be an open legal market. There is no question. Regardless if it comes from federal level, or state level. 

Also, let's be clear, the borders being opened are not the only way for LPs to enter the US market. The only thing stopping them from currently owning US marijuana companies is the threat of being delisted if they do. Once MSOs are allowed to uplist (or shortly *before* they do), LPs will be allowed to purchase whoever they want. 

And instead of spending millions and millions to expand State by State, they will be able to make smart purchases based on the coming national market. Also, while Trulieve has been opening up store number 70+ in a single state, TilAphria has been creating a ""monopoly"" in the EU, which according to Curaleaf has more potential than the US. 

Also, there's no secret sauce that leads Trulieve to make a bunch of money. They aren't a great company. They are just one of a few of existing companies in a very very large market. 83% of FL's medical marijuana market is owned by 5 companies. Aka- an oligarchy.  Soon, they will be just another company within a large industry within a large market, aka - a free market. 

Dipshit."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"New York legalization is not as bullish for the current operators that are already maxed out in the state as it is for the Canadian companies that have absolutely no exposure there at all yet and have no clue when they’ll be able to have exposure?? It’s more bullish for them?? What are you smoking man? Gimme a break. Really shitty DD and advice for people!! “Don’t buy the companies that are already operating there making money, Buy the companies that have no exposure there yet at all on the hopes that they will sometime in the future” 
.... ok dude"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, a clear signal against oligarchies is a bad sign for companies who rely on oligarchies. Lol what's hard to understand? 

Also, the guy leading the federal reform for marijuana, just so happens to be from the state that just shit on oligarchies."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">""Trulieve is the first and leading medical cannabis company in the state of Florida, the third most populous state in the United States. Its vertically-integrated ""seed-to-sale"" operation has approximately 51% of the Florida market."" 

Yeahhhh, that's gonna go to shit reallllly quick. Lol but have fun believing it will be business as usual for them when legalization time comes. 

Legalization is gonna fuck them right in the ass. No hemp lube included."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Numbers don’t lie and I’m pretty sure Trulieve has made more money on its own in profit than all the Canadian licensed producers have at this point combined since their existence... think about that. Those companies up there have spent billions of dollars accomplishing nothing.
2021-03-28 19:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Battle of the Fallen Giants: ViacomCBS vs DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC. (A shallow comparison of them both.) BLUF: Both of these stocks are knee deep in the streaming wars. They both fell sharply last week due to a hedge fund liquidation. Read more about that in the link below. Over the past 5 days, DISCA fell 46%, and VIAC fell 51%. Both have a bullish sentiment, along with their pros and cons.

>[ViacomCBS, Discovery plunge due in part to forced liquidation of Archegos Capital positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html)

Below is a 3 month snapshot of both stocks, along with SPY just for comparison purposes.

[3 Month view of VIAC, DISCA, and SPY](https://preview.redd.it/8qhzft9xesp61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e655fb4a233038e41f0122327e3f763f9a3601)

Both VIAC and DISCA followed each other rather closely in terms of percentage gained. Even with the recent drop, had the stock been held, both would come out beating the market.

**Profile Overview:**

[VIAC is approx. 18&#37; larger than DISCA.](https://preview.redd.it/u0xhj70yesp61.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5124890c20f75a651950f10fd820578eb93f8c50)

**Brands:**

[VIAC Brands](https://preview.redd.it/u38uz250fsp61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a68fe0ef84f167f1b5669b05ff34154bab14a61)

[DISCA Brands](https://preview.redd.it/stf1r1vzesp61.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e102639753862679e28b9db8619a821bf8c6248)

**Profitability:**

https://preview.redd.it/dmmkpgy3fsp61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a735ab5a2608ec4ba38c11429c06cd2d3e8cb47

DISCA comes out ahead here. They both have a rather decent profit margin, but DISCA has a whopping 24% advantage over VIAC.

**Momentum:**

https://preview.redd.it/lm5e6jq4fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e245da1875ed75731ddc6fed5d8a64aae9a3b25

Let's skip over the 1 month price performance, as this has been explained via the first link provided at the top.

DISCA comes out ahead in the less than 6 months, and the greater than 1 year price performance. Meanwhile, VIAC is the clear winner in the 9 month to 1 year price performance. Overall, both performed well recently, but DISCA has been consistently in the green.

**Income Statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/638r7ng5fsp61.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67ae40ae70845b7ba971bdc1c6699017eb8684d

VIAC's revenue is the clear winner here. They pull in more than double DISCA's revenue. They also come out ahead in every other faucet.

**Balance Sheet:**

https://preview.redd.it/t17gusa6fsp61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86a682e7a11bf08a3500f886aec5a323cc8c36b

Now, their balance sheets. Both have a nice chunk of cash on hand, which should give investors confidence. VIAC does hold more debt, however, they also recently announced that they are going to issue more shares, which should give them a boost of approx. $3B. DISCA, as of writing this and to my knowledge, has not released any statement concerning the issuance of more shares.

**Short Interest:**

[VIAC Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/2sdrhb27fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8eac76c2537f90575b9a6719148d29550f919)

[DISCA Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/h7oep358fsp61.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb55327034fa06f346ec3f6abbf9d23fe259ac3b)

[VIAC Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/) \- VIAC, as of 15 March, has 18.9%, a decrease of .5% since February 26th.

[DISCA Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/) \- DISCA, as of 15 March, has 29.7%, an increase of .6% since February 26th.

Overall, both of these companies have provided growth to their investors, even after the drastically sharp decline. With the recent decline of the NASDAQ over the past month, it's a bit of a toss-up on which one will be better in the long-term (imo that is.)

**Positions:** NONE in either of these companies. However, I am looking to buy into one of these two, after the market opens tomorrow.

EDIT:  Dividend (See Image Below) VIAC has a dividend, DISCA does not.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man. Good shit.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two problems - 1) obviously any short interest stat is useless now. They were just handed a massive gift on Friday 2) both of these stocks went on a parabolic move, now we know largely due to an overleveraged whale and his call buying. He blew up. So where’s the marginal size bid now? 
Not saying it can’t bounce but definitely don’t look at a chart and say “oh it used to be at $100 It can definitely quickly get to $80 again” (using VIAC as an example)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I will be buy call options in both for 4/16 around the 60 strike based on early market premium adjustments.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely hopping into DISCA tomorrow. Told my dad to as well. Can see a huge recovery since that hedge fund had sell off a shit ton of their shares in it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really like disca at around 35-40, previous increase was too quick IMHO missed the quick hit on friday, will be looking to purchase if there is another moment of weekness."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good stuff OP. I had purchased VIAC last year at around 27 and sold at 60. I had put a dent in my wall banging my head as I watched it climb to 90. 

Good time to get back in, imo 



Not financial advice."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I could see DISCA rebounding and showing some recovery,  but I am staying away from VIAC - big issues with offerings, debt, and profitability of streaming"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol faucet....sorry, I like the DD just that made me giggle"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought when VIAC was stupid low last may at $17.50.  I sold covered calls for $10 each when it hit 60 last month, to lock in my profit for a long term cap gain.  And it kept going...and going.   Didn't get my strike to buy the calls back Friday.  I'll likely have to pay more to disappear them tomorrow.  But I'm good to let it ride a bit upward again now that we know at least part of the reason for the sharp downdraft was a margin call/forced liquidation."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Going with viac for the divvie! I’ll buy a lil disc just for growth potential tho
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have call option for viac on 4/16, I hope the stock rebound as quickly as it fell. Thanks for the details bud. Lots of opportunities here"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"An EBIT Margin is the operating earnings over operating

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just thinking of the services that everyone I know are least likely to pay for and discovery is top of the list followed by viacom. Even though they could bounce back I just can't like the stock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the checking it out.  What are your thoughts between the two?  Which do you think has the better short potential?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Beware IV crush
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have had a bad string of luck with weeklies.  I think mid April to mid May is a good move.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA, imo, has the better branding.  I honestly haven't looked into the price of their subscriptions, or the amount of subscribers.  

What if there isn't another moment of weakness, and quickly climbs past $50?  Are you going to pass on it?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC does have more debt, and they are diluting their shares to gain $3B in funds.  That being said, this news has already broke and will most likely be priced in.  On the other hand, DISCA has not made any such statement.  And maybe they wont, as they do have a bit less debt and better profit margin atm. This is kind of what has me conflicted between the two.  Maybe I should just ask the wife which service she prefers and run with it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whoops!  Eh, let it ride.  Thanks for reading it!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, I completely missed that part and meant to include it. Thanks. I'll see if I can add that into the end."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"April 16th gives you time.  It took VIAC about two months to go from the price it is at today ($48), all the way to its peak of $101."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am extremely biased towards Disney's streaming platform, and hate cable.  However, I am not going to have 20 different monthly subscriptions eating away at money I could be losing in the stock market instead.  I understand your sentiment."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd disagree with viacom with the NFL
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck man. Looks like both are solid plays. I just re read everything again. Short potential? DISCA. I think. Lol god damn this is some mind rattling DD. Making me think of a bunch of potential outcomes. So im not sure.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If one were to buy a call currently in the money, would that alleviate the possibility of IV crush?  That could be a safer play, but would cost more, correct?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I assume it is going to take way longer to come back then it fell, but all depends on what the option prices are reset at."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Other fish in the sea, i'll wait untill next earnings to see if anyone is actually using the service. I want it for a long term hold 3-5 year min, but don't want a sack of crap if the launch tanked. That's why im targeting prelaunch/launch time price."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the same boat, maybe wait and see - thanks for posting!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost pulled the trigger on two of these but I am not 100% sure the block sales of shares are done. I will be watching next week to see if theres any more shake ups or margin calls on hedgies.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'd want to calculate the extrinsic value vs the intrinsic value.  But yes to avoid IV crush you can buy ITM, or smarter yet would be a debit spread to almost neutralize any IV crush."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, as well as buying an option with later expiration"
2021-03-28 19:19:22,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry QNX + IVY might be the next Android + Google Mobile Services Blackberry as a third-party software provider has the best shot at building an industry-standard vehicle software platform because they do not compete directly with the automakers. 

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,BB learned from android eating their lunch in the smartphone business. Now the berry is on the other foot.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the reason I’m investing a shit ton into BB. After the IVY partnership, I’m convinced this will finally be my ticket to buying my own house.

I’ve watched every panel about the future of IVY from BB Execs, and they are purposefully being vague about everything. One thing I liked a lot though was that after they announced their plan for IVY, they mentioned there was a significant number of OEM’s showed a ton of interest with one OEM asking for a workshop on how IVY is planned, prior to xmas 2020.

Considering how they dominate their market in 19/25 of the major EV producers, I think IVY could be MASSIVE. Obviously nothing is set in stone, but I really think there’s some deep fuckin value here.

Oh, and it doesn’t launch into cars until 2023, so this is a LOOOONG play"

Speaking of countries there are 7 governments from the G7 and 18 from the G20 that are backed by Blackberry. This is the level of security everybody wants. BB's QNX powers 175 million cars today, from 14 automakers Audi, BMW,  Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota and Volkswagen. Now with Amazon we are talking about a future with innovation, not only for its electric cars (Rivian) but for Amazon's Prime Air delivery services. BB's intelligent vehicle data platform (IVY) will be integrated in every drone Amazon is gonna use in its delivery service. Not to mention the United States Air Force is already into Blackberry's Unified Endpoint Management and Security since September 2020. I'm talking about military and civilian applications with a great projection for massive revenues. I'm very confident BB is gonna hit big time this year and incoming years."

     ev's and self drive capabilities are valued very high by the market righ now and any company that even has a hint of collaboration with these ev's are experiencing valuations far exceeding their intrinsic value. its only a matter of time before the market wakes up to blackberry and they experience the same valuation bump that is afforded the other ev players. 

ev is huge rn, bb will have lots of news regarding vehicle integration for evs. no way this can go tits up.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"research is so 2017. the market hasnt been reasonable for awile now. speculation is king and ev speculation is the current gold standard. is this a bubble? absolutely. can money still be made before it bursts? i hope so. does research and intrinsic value have any bearing on the current stock market? not particularily. will research and proper valuations rein supreme post bubble? most likely. does that mean shit, right now in the middle of a bubble? fuck no. welcome to the casino. im betting it all on black......berry"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ivy is just nearing completion. BlackBerry and Amazon are just now opening it up to developers. Its brand new.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So your argument is to not try to project future numbers and compare that to current valuation because the stocks have gone up already?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay. Why will it be a money maker?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So your reasoning is basically new = good?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"no.  my arguement is that future projections are so broken and grossly overestimated, especially in the ev market, that eventually(if the bubble doesnt burst first) blackberry will also experience this gross overestimation. simply being associated with evs is enough of a catalyst in the current market. this is a bubble. fundamentals dont mean shit in a bubble. tesla's valuation is the most obvious proof of this. herd mentality is all that matters in a bubble. ev bubble + blackberry's potential ev exposure = profit. i dont need to convince you, i just need to wait for the herd.  not financial advice."

2021-03-28 18:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Biden's Infrastructure Plan and BLNK moon potential? Preface:

- Not trying to draw attention away from GME right before take off. Pos: 200 @ $80 avg 🚀🚀 and 💎✋
- I realize that not every play or high short interest is a squeeze...

But serious question:

- Biden will be proposing an infrastructure plan next Wednesday, March 31 and there seems to be speculation that a significant portion of the 3 to 4 trillion dollar plan will be devoted to clean energy initiatives, including the electrical grid, charging stations etc. I realize this could take months if not longer to pass and the final results could be quite different but could this create some potential for companies like BLNK?

- BLNK exhibits conditions that are similar to GME in the sense that short interest is quite high (Short % of Float is 37.99% as of March 15) and the float is relatively low 30.87 M. Again, I realize it is not the same situation as GME as there may be other variables at play but just curious as to  any opinions and thoughts on this?

No positions yet.

Thank you all."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't know anything about CHPT but BLNK finicials are brutal. Also the whole prospect of EV charging companies being the new gas stations over looks the fact that 90% of the time people are gonna be recharging at home during night time. Just like a decent business but nothing world changing. Since electric charging is alot more basic compared to gasoline distribution its likely to be highly fragmented business.

Those whomst blazed the trail of making an impact because lambos are great, but making the world a better place one ape a time is how we can truly die happy knowing we use our wealth for good unlike the leeches on Wall Street. 

I cant donate much rn but ill be picking up trash on the beach weekly so I can hop on this helping train w my tiny contribution. It ain't much, but it'll be honest work. thank you guys for the inspiration. Ape together strong 🥲

EVERYTHING about the stay was absolutely terrifying and awful. Everything except one awesome memory. I remember them wheeling in a TV and a N64. I had IV's in and I couldn't even play without making myself feel sick. I remember teaching both my mom and a nurse how to play mario and telling them one step at a time what to do and each of them beating their first ever levels in Mario. I remember it so fondly I'm tearing up now thinking about it. All the memes aside this will make MANY childrens' days and stays much better. I remember the feeling of getting to ""play"" that game in the middle of all the awful more clearly than I remember all the awful now. It has been a long time since then and I am STILL very thankful for the person whoever they were that donated the system to the hospital. I know it was donated because I've been back there and gone through the same office to donate myself. Anyone that does something like this for children in need gets instant great karma in my eyes.

My daughter has had two stays in a children’s hospital.  It is honestly one of the saddest places to be in the world, and I wouldn’t wish a moment in there on my worst enemy.

Thank you to everyone who has been making these wonderful donations, and bringing some brightness to a bunch of sick kids who are going through so much!

After I collect my GME tendies, I’m going to make sure that my local children’s hospitals are well stocked!"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GD I can't wait to do this!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing your epic use of tendies!

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That is awesome Thank you for sharing! POWER TO THE PLAYERS!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a fyi, don't buy new. 
If you're going to GameStop to support them and give them profits buy used. I know I'm going to get shit on but it's the truth. 
GameStop has a higher profit margin on used items than they do new."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking legend
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait you went inside and bought stuff instead of praising the store on your knees outside?!?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Plot twist: it’s just a scalper advertisement campaign
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Expect good karma to come to your way OP.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,OP has a big pp
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,POWER TO THE PLAYRRRSSSSSS AND SHAREHOLDERSSS WOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been watching from the sidelines for the whole ride. I am proud of you guys
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I will do this if GME blows up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Genuine curiosity, do we vet these posts or can any scalper get this clout? I'm just a little out of the loop is all, and y'all know how the internet is."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome.  I’m in Atlanta, how can I help"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully no sticky fingers in Atlanta
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,what if people just buy this shit for the karma and then return it 🧐
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You're some upgraded ape power bruh
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless your soul. Those kids will love and appreciate this gesture so much. Bless you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"With everything going on, you guys are amazing. It really does give me hope that we cAn do better."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, now the Nintendo CEO can assign more 💰💰 to his hedge fund shorting GME. 

Just kidding, great work!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the countertop
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is super nice! 
Not to be a wet blanket but don’t forget to save enough cash to pay that short term gain tax bill and get a letter from the hospital acknowledging that non-cash donation because you are probably itemizing your taxes this year."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y'all think you're smart investing in GME, but I'm about to go balls deep in NTDOY with how much of this shit you guys buying."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here goes nothing, can I have either super mariod odyssey or mario kart? I already own a switch lol"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A Nintendo Switch bundle package that doesn’t include Fire Emblem: Three Houses? What a rip-off
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow that's awesome
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You cats are good people.
:')"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What a legend 😎😭
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to tell you guys but some hedge fund CEO’s etc are quite big philanthropists. Sure some of it is PR and possibly a way to raise more money (is that much different than what goes on here at WSB GME?) but it’s a bit interesting to see you guys acting like you are all so virtuous by giving stuff to needy people (or apes).  Got a long way to go to catch those greedy hedge fund bastards. 

2019 article:  “Bill Ackman [Pershing Square Capital Management], who is worth $1.1 billion, is also one of the most philanthropic hedge fund managers: He’s already given away about $500 million, most of it through his Pershing Square Foundation.”

[source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.worth.com/the-10-most-powerful-hedge-fund-managers-this-year/%3famp)

500 million kids from one CEO.  Pony up boys.  Pony up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Shouldn't this be posted somewhere else than here?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously...do children's hospital need or even want video games? Someone who actually works at one please tell me.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In other words anyone who criticizes wallstreetbets must hate sick children.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice ad, cocksucker."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if any of these will be stolen later on, by like Karen attitude parents. Just my Eastern European mentality I guess, sorry. Or does the hospital staff over there have the ability to manage and keep track of these extra comfort items?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those switchs look like they are made of gum
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumb question. Instead of giving kids play games wouldn’t it be MORE beneficial to get more shares and after it’s all done donate to open a NEW wing with the best equipment and help so kids can possibly LIVE through problems the current hospitals can’t handle? Your money, up to you but if I was giving the option to give joy to a few kids with video games or save kids lives to ENJOY life that’s a no brainer. I know I’ll get hate but I don’t care. Live over games imo. You can outfit the new wing with all games then. FULL VR physical therapy with the badass vr treadmill things promotes more physical activity and gaming.

Wow you people are really selfish pick me girls after all. LOOK AT ME I GOT ALL THIS SHIT FOR A HOSPITAL IM SO NICE AND GENEROUS! PLEASE LOOK PLEASE UPVOTE! Load of shit. If you people really CARED ABOUT KIDS and this is the ONLY way you can show it, god I hope you don’t have any kids. FYI nice flex on how much disposal income you all have. Some people went through the shit in 08 and still aren’t back to where they were but at least you can flex for attention."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder how many karma farmers are doing this for internet points and then just returning the unopened stuff.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this comment will be lost and it may be irrelevant... GameStop and pretty much every retailer has little to no margin on new video game consoles. If you’re trying to double hit on your generosity buying as much of this shit “used” would be better. 

GameStop will profit and the hospital will be happy regardless of if the consoles are new or used."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's great, what does it have to do with WSB?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it. Huge respect.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So is the plan to buy all GME shares then convert it into a shareholder owned nonprofit org that helps children?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Eight kids fighting over Minecraft
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do and don’t say

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is amazing! I love to hear that this community is giving so much back to children's hospitals.  You have inspired me.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome! I hope you bought 2 copies of Mario Kart so the kids can race eachother.  Some of my favorite gaming memories are battling siblings and friends on Mario Kart 64!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do u know if they still make donkey kong? Asking for an ape friend?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy's a legend 👍🍌
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My heart is so full seeing all these WSB traders use their GME earnings to do stuff like this. I could honestly cry from how sweet this gesture is. Those kids will be thrilled and the social workers will be so happy to have one more option to keep the kids spirits up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The good ending
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,this goes out to all of the haters that say traders are lazy and don't contribute to society in anyway
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what separates us from them (HF). Never forget that.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That is amazing. There is so much wealth in the world- this should happen more.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the hedgies, and the share price. If anything good comes out of this, its stuff like this. Straight up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,did you see any of the melvin guys dropping stuff off?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes are great
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,time to short the stock 😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't Gamestop make their employees wear plastic bags as ""ppe"" and told their people to argue with cops about them being ""essential workers"" the second lockdowns happened?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good for the kids, I lost my car my house and my wife BC of game stop.

Good thing I pawned my gun or I would be dead. 

Fingers crossed I come back as a sick kid and finally enjoy some game stop."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That's awesome but I think some of the girls might feel left out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Should’ve bought some fucking books. But nice!! Good on you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I always see these posts and think about how if I was a sick kid how fucking pissed I would be to get a Switch Lite
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm happy to see that the alternative to food stamps is now charitable donations instead of lambos.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Id love to do something like this too but I missed out on game stop waiting for amc to moon so I can donate to cancer foundations my mom has been battling stage 4 for 4 years now. Someone tell me what the hedgefunds have ever donated
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re going to CHOA, take something for the nurses as well, COVID restrictions withstanding."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bobby?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so did u sell your shares?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve never seen such amazing retards!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your kindness
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg THIS !!! 🥰🤩
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The employees had to been wowed away when they ran you up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah man! That’s so amazing that you could do that you’re going to bring so many smiles to kids faces!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You and other like your selfless self are amazing and inspiring. I'm exited to do the same once my tendies come in.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for what you did here. Hopefully these kids will be able to recover nicely, thoroughly entertained. I hope they heal up. 

Also, unprompted politically motivated side note: I hope these kiddos are able to vote freely and easily in their future. The Governor is the devil."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are an Angel my friend
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This was the first post I saw this morning and what a way to start my Sunday. I love this community.  💎❤️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah we could reinvest in the stonk....but giving it to kids is a good idea too.  <3 <3
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You people doing this are awesome. When I cash in my tendies, I'll follow suit!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this sub is about eating hedgies while saying kids n apes?

Love it here"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And I have a hard time finding a switch. Lol. Good job my man.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you! 

Seriously, this shit restores my faith and humanity more than anything I've ever seen.

🥰🚀💎🙌"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome man. Well done. I was there for a night with my son two weeks ago. That’s a special place. It was awful being there for one night but seeing the families that you can tell are there/will be there for an extended period of time made me grateful for my son’s health. Those poor kids need as much joy in their lives as we can provide. Kudos to you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome! Treat yourself to a Banana Daiquiri!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You can put this on your taxes next year as a tax credit.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey I’m in the ATL, warmed my heart"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me happy. My mom used to work there when I was a kid. I still have her duffle bag she got from the merger when they became Children's Healthcare.  It was a good hospital with good people. I hope it still is.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So awesome!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,When apes make money they give back to the community. When fundies make money they give bonuses to their rich employees.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is crazy, you guys are fantastics."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me tear up. Ty for what you have done. I hope to give back one day as well. 🙏🏻

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good work. Maybe your wife’s boyfriend will let you have sex with her now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is amazing. Well done! The post made this retarded ape tear up a bit.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nintendo stocks about to fucking fly
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know this sounds selfish but god I wish I had those games
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone down at Children’s Hospital of Atlanta is gonna know CockInAClock does it for the kids.

Jkjk, I only tease. This is a great thing you’re doing. If I had spare money, I would do this."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t you have to SELL to realize the gains for this?

🤨"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"More much needed kindness done by people here who made a buck on a stock, than the usual fucking useless rich folks."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The news needs to be running stories like this. I think I've seen half a dozen or more posts similar to this one, where a knuckle-dragging ape took time away from exploring the jungle to give back to little chimps less fortunate than himself. 

If nothing else, GameStop has a HUGE marketing opportunity, so let's hope they see it as well. 

Either way, well done sir, you've been promoted to Kong in my book."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You all are Awesome.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 2 younger sisters that have both spent significant time at CHOA. Thanks for helping out a place that's really making a difference.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol hedgies’ interns don’t work during the weekend to downvote this and this immediately goes to the top of r/all. 🤣🤣 Thanks OP for doing this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's why I'm holding. i really believe that all of us can do so much good in the world, if we just had the financial capabilities. as soon as we all go out as millionaires, the world will be slightly better than it is now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It must be nice living in a country where these would not get stolen by the staff and other people...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m so jaded by assholes who go out and scalp things and clear shelves that my first thought was what type of shitty shelf clearing is this, turns out it’s the best kind of shelf clearing, good on you for doing it for a cause."

If anyone looking for ideas there are plenty of children's homes everywhere...years back the wife & I gave out gift cards & little gift bags at a kids home, it was a rewarding experience,  after all, they can't help it if their parents sucked...

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously we know why people do this.  Just putting a smile on those kids faces will remain with you the rest of your life. I know the heartbreak these kids suffer. My sister died at 10 years old with medulloblastoma. When I went there one time the TV and game systems weren't set up right so I hooked it all up for them. Every kid in that room was my best friend from there on. They just needed a distraction from the pain and suffering. Wish I could've done more, but they thought I gave them the world in that moment. God bless you apes for your big hearts."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate that we live in a society where acts of kindness are left up to random people because the multi-million dollar for-profit children's hospital refuses to spend $1000 on entertainment options for their sickest kids.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"From buying a zoo last week to bringing some much needed Christmas holiday spirit in March to kids in need.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is *the* way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job guys, keep it up"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s wholesome until the joy-cons start drifting.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,enough to make a grown man cry
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Any donation ideas us peasants that only made a few grand from GME?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Such a great gesture. I hope they get used.  The gaming hardware at our hospitals sit in back rooms because then people would need to handle it and manage it.  No one wants the responsibility.  Possibly even more so during Covid times with cleaning these things.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,TFW you wanna shit on GME bulls but they do cute shit like this...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Please say its from GameStop
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"CHOA has been consistently good for me and my family, I was treated there as a young king and they treat my daughter now for her minor problems her doctor cannot handle. You’re awesome OP, and I can’t think of a more worthy recipient."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing the lorts work 🙌🙏🙌
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How long until someone incorporates wallstreetbets into a full-blown 501(c)3? The world’s most retarded charity.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You cant tell them it's from cockinaclock on reddit?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Please tell me you got donkey kong?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that's what I'm talking about!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point, it would be criminal is Melvin didnt throw in the towel, stop doing shady shit and allow the stock to hit the 469k/s it is supposed to be. Imagine all the good we will do for the world?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love you apes.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"See, this is the difference betweens apes and hedgies. They make tons of money for themselves and give nothing back and you apes make some monies and give some back."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing the tendies work! Seriously though this is an amazing gift I remember having to stay a month in the hospital as a kid and being bored to death because they only had one system and 1/2 the time it didn’t function this will make many kids stay bearable in ways I can’t even explain.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a treasure u/CockInAClock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are the man, like actually"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kindly deeds, done for free.  
Kindly deeds, done for free.
(whispers) 

Kindly deeds and they’re done for free."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome. Well done brother! 👌🏻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,God bless you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is anyone buying Nintendo shares at this point? I've not seen it mentioned yet.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just amazing ! I wish I could upvote this all day 🙌🏼
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When in doubt, buy the entire display.

Well done 😄"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB has done more successful philanthropy off of this Gamma squeeze than pretty much the whole non profit industry.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The time when poor kids help helpless kids more then billion dollar companies... Hmmm
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tangential question: When things like these are donated to children’s hospitals, how is it handled? Is there a room where all the consoles are located and it’s first come first serve? Does one child get a console for a week and rotate?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think what you're doing is awesome and I commend you for bringing joy to children in dark times, but as a non-American, can you tell me why hospitals need donations? Isn't your healthcare privatised and very expensive??"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A kind ape. A loving ape. An ape for all ape.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo these kids are gonna are gonna be so damn stoked. I just got here and I already am impressed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,CHOA!!  Well done sir.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow. You're a Saint! Good stuff, fellow ape!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Man you guys are doing so much.  It's awesome to see.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,still waiting to see how hedgies have been contributing.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes, those sick kids aren’t gonna know what hit em, rock and roll"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes funny for reddit awards. Fair trade man lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Which I had this many gains so I could do something as well.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly if people keep doing stuff like this I’m never selling. This is what the world needs. If I take off on this ship with my fellow apes you best believe the first thing I’ll do is buy some games for the kids in my community.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy Toledo I LOVE IT
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait to be able to buy GameStop gear and donated to the Children’s Hospital in Santa Ana California when AMC 🚀 blast off to the moon! 🦍✋💎🚀🌙
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to be that guy, but sword > shield."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Still waiting for my GME tendies so I can do the same 🙏🏻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You the real MVP.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those poor children are going to be exposed to Super Mario Sunshine. Haven’t they suffered enough?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the endless amount of money and kindness. We invest in this amazing stock, use money to buy the stocks merchandise, give it away, repeat. When you buy it boost sales.They report a higher sales.Win,Win,Kindness,"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you guys make money though. I would like the money
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,all the love to you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Take my upvote and go make kids happy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you god damned apes! We'll kick Wall St to the curb while we fly to the moon!

You are a gentle ape and a scholar. Those little chimps are gonna smile from ear to ear and fuel us to go even further beyond."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,KAWAIIII
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the best community.  I remember when I was 12 I had to get my appendix removed, on thanksgiving day.  So I was eating jello while everyone was eating turkey.  But when that nurse rolled in an xbox 360 and gave me a controller, that day wasn’t so bad.  You guys are truly doing a great thing.  And I love this community."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow. As a GameStop employee I must say transactions like that are once a year. Makes their whole weeks KPI's good.

More importantly, you're doing gods work. *Thank you*"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is such a wholesome post 💜happy Sunday!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Suggestion for next wave of good deeds - reaching out to local schools and paying off the kids’ lunch debts. Maybe setting up some monies to help some kids get food at school. Saw a post on another subreddit that made me quite sad.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gods speed retards.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg dude I think I have the same house layout, there are a million like it in ATL."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is there no flavor for these posts? I want to be able to filter for them.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How can we verify that these are actually making it to a hospital and people aren't just karma farming?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hasn't my Nintendo stock gone up from all of these types of posts? 😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love this, but fuck, man. Welfare is not the responsibility of the people, it should be under the state. Unless you're a Keynesian retard and stuck in the 1960s, Hayekian theory clearly states it's fine for the state to assume the role of a protector of the people while keeping the market free."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I say we all challenge each other to do the most we can with our gains!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s very kind of you.  👍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are amazing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I want ducking tendies 🙌🏻💎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Kids in homes getting more in one day than i make in a year....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’d never see some rich POS doing something nice for common people. You will be blessed!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Big Dick energy right here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the apes!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,God bless you brother
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless you fren
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That's so sweet.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude a new switch lite costs 219€ in Germany at GameStop (259$)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just imagine what Kenny could have done with all his money that he spent trying to destroy things. Bravo to you, it’s because of people like you and the ape gang that we even have a society. Someday ole Kenny will finally understand how much time,money and power he had at his fingertips, he used it to destroy us but destroyed himself in the end. It’s gonna be lonely."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the players!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What character, what generosity , what username"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My man's spent 2 grand on the switches alone. Porbably another 1k on games. 

You are an absolute king"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,God bless you playboy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I see the real winner of the GameStop saga is Nintendo. Power to the players!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the most exciting part about the idea of coming into some money for me. Having the freedom and ability to hand others some money and gifts without worrying about my future, what a difference it makes. I don't even care if it feels good for me anymore, I just want to be kind and set an example more than anything at this point. The rich need to start caring for their fellow human beings and giving handouts before the poor start knocking on their doors desperate and angry."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this is a something I can get behind.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that’s what I’m talking about! I see Hella Pokémon
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There are heroes among us!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if these acts of wsb/gme generosity will make the news and if they have please share
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey why not send me one! :(
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn't afford the regular Switches? Broke ass
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And here I can't even find Smash Ultimate at my local places...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Its shit like this that gives me hope. The amount of good karma we have amassed by simply doing good things. Good things come to those who wait. We got thism for 2008!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"CHOA is well deserving of these, bravo sir!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This community has done more good for the planet in the last year than Wall Street has done its entire existence.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn. The generosity of apes is astounding.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Very awesome! Maybe take the price tags off before
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yay for the CHOA love, they’re wonderful!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tendies for good!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish AMC would break open so I can go donate a bunch of Blu-Rays! Still holding and rooting for all you GME apes!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s amazing to see the good things people here are doing for those who are struggling. Don’t expect we see this type of compassion with the slapdick Wall Street shit stains. This is a reminder of why you are all better people than the elites who only want to get richer while keeping others down. Play on playa!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way! Every time I read through the messages, I enjoy seeing Ape teaching Ape, (I also learn something new here each day) soon we will develop new tools and option trading activities to bust this wide open!!! 🚀"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are the most awesome human I’ve ever seen
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,that's awsome.. great job.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome! Currently broke but own GME shares. Plan to do similar things once we get our tendies. Looking forward to all the good WSB is going to do after the squeeze has squoze
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the players!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome!!!! Baller move!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I couldn't give less of a shit if I lose everything in GME. I've seen so many donations to kids in hospitals and I've adopted a gorilla. That alone was worth this whole rollercoaster and I'm proud to have been one of you smooth brained apes :')
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolute respect to a retard king
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice of you. This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you're the reason why I cant buy... oh nvm, That's nice, thank you!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i wish my name was clock
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,DAYUM  those are scalper prices too...   thx for giving back ...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow finally someone with a smooth brain. Helping people, not monkeys! THIS IS THE WAY 😇"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is definitely the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would be nice if there was a way to mark those as property of the hospital so they don't go home with any unscrupulous employees.

I can see those Mario 3d all Stars games showing up on eBay right after March 31st."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your house looks identical to mine LOL.

Same counter top, same backsplash, same door/window to backyard and same cupboards.

Not only did you do an amazing thing for charity, but you also confused a fellow ape - this is trippy"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve spent and donated more than I have into GME. Well done bro.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,dope
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I spent a lot of time in CHOA as a kid, fortunately nothing as severe as so many kids have.  This is such a really nice gesture!! <3 I'm sure this will bring some smiles to some faces!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!! 💎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what it's about!!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh it's time to sell? Okay, I'll sell now. 

I didn't know we were selling, my bad guys."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Damit apes ROCK!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME shares for scale. 

I ain't paying my rent that's like 10 GME shares. 
Definitely not going to college that's like 500 GME shares.
Groceries, no way. One GME share."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a thing of beauty you beautiful ape
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,YOR LEGEND
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the children!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is inspiring. Buying another stonk
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Aw man I would offer to help you on Monday since I live in the area but have house inspection that day!! Thank you for your kindness & I too will be donating to CHOA soon! http://www.choa.org/donate
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the hospital decide which children to give these donations to? Genuine question. Naive retard asking!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is love, GME is life."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do this with unrealized gains?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell stock to buy these?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow. great, dude"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But where did you get the money from? Did you sell your gme stocks?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take the price off, it’s a gift."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know this kitchen. If this is who I think it is StruDawg you better text me!!! ❤️❤️❤️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the players! And power for our rocket fuel. Apes to the moon. 🚀🦍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those Joycons won't even last a month sadly.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could get a switch in india..
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have to say you are better than most parents.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man all you autists be inspirational as fuck 

🦧🦍🍗🌖🚀💎🙌"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont forget, you can also spend your points on donation to extra life or make a wish.   I wish there was a way to donate points for magazine subscriptions.  I'd send subscriptions to places with waiting rooms, libraries, schools etc."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,could someone please ELI5 what all this is about? i’ve been trying to follow it all since the beginning but i feel like i’m trying to interpret a different language from context clues.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"15 Switch games? That's at least like $40,000."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lessssssgoooooo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What the f
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is cute, and sorry to bring up negativity but Nintendo is a shit company. They make great games and we can’t really avoid them but damn this company isn’t grateful to its fanbase. Fuck em"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone, stop giving awards, and use that money to do the same!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a normie who doesn’t understand the stock market. But seeing y’all donate to children and save the gorillas over the past month has been really heartwarming. And it also helps that rich people are losing their shit. So good job!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had the money to do such things :) very nice of you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just ostensibly the best subreddit community, you can't change my mind."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, good sir... please have my wife."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This mans got all the good games
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done ape!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This. This is how we change the world.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But what’s in the bag?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Does buying it online better because e-commerce?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Get it you ape 🦍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure to take those price tags off
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I never get tired of seeing this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sweet. Keep up the good work guys. Remember hedges could do things like this all the time but don’t.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,http://WeAreNotFuckingLeaving.com
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg CHOA is gonna be so excited
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your retard powers are healing the world 🙌💎 truly a hell of a Monke

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing! God bless you!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We need more cocks in a clock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The name of that children’s hospital? The Moon.

Jk, but this is awesome!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m confused, if we’re supposed to be holding....how are people buying things “because of GME”?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you picked up BotW. Best 100 hours I ever played in a video game.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Mans invested in $KRMA
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a 10 piece tendie bucket!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That is amazing!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such a great idea, maybe paying it forward will help your stock but even if it doesn’t it’s going to make the day of some kid whose been dealt a shitty hand"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Retards helping retards
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your a Pure SILVERBACK you beautiful primate 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sir, are a god among men"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Paying it forward. Awesome...Ape Nation ❤
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Epic dude! Those kids gonna have their best day ever!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"25+ yrs ago I was that sick in in the children's hospital who was in/out so much I knew all the nurses by name and who I could sweet talk into giving me more pudding. The rental time I had with the super Nintendo/Sega Genesis (think the old TV/VCR cart in classrooms) was godsend. I was just a kid gaming, not sick kid, not a kid whose lungs were fucked six ways to Sunday, but a regular kid. 

You're good one OP, you and everyone who has donated games to children's hospitals."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done you generous ape 🦍the world needs more apes like you! When the stock moons back to 250 I’ll be able to do something similar!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Shouldn't Gamestop have done something by know while they have the attention of a nation like this? I'm pretty unsettled by the radio silence tbh
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Mad respect
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing stuff right here!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We love to see it! Good on you 👏🏻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy it online not in store! They are transitioning to e-commerce. Let’s ramp up their e-commerce sales numbers!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is uniting so many people and I am HERE FOR IT.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta love gamers sticking together and helping each other out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just awesome. Nice one all those doing this. Retail investors are not only helping children, but adopting gorillas! 🦍 and at the same time some profit is being put back in to GameStop. Do the hedgefunds ever have a heart to help others or just themselves?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is too wholesome
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is truly the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You should tag them in this on Twitter! They recently started interacting with customers over there.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doing the Lords work, brother. Good man."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is awesome, normal people make money and give back while most billionaire assholes basically just take from the poor. We all need to keep doing stuff like this as long as were capable"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We should all be buying something from gamestop
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I think Q1 2021 is going to be a blow out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, you are good monke 🍌"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm here for the pregame thread!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, i love it when people give back! Thank you guys"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y’all GME apes not fucking around, huh? The real Robin Hoods are right here!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The real Robin Hood. 💎🙌🦍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is how you flex! We as retail traders should try to set a standard for others. We are not the big guys who are super greedy. We make a little bit, donate and pay taxes...And stimulate the eco instead of destroying companies and jobs for $$"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very wholesome, be abundantly blessed."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was a child I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and had to be hospitalized for weeks. Some of my best memories was the nurse wheeling in a Sega Genesis so I could play Sonic the Hedgehog. It really helped me feel better during an extremely difficult time, thank you for doing this OP. As someone who was that kid once, it does make a difference. 💜 Extra-Life and Child’s Play are both great charitable organizations that help with this if anyone’s interested. 👾

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My sister in law spent 2 years there fighting childhood leukemia (totally in remission now for several years). My son spent the first year of his life there fighting neonatal lupus (8 years old now and totally in remission). I took my daughter there when she was 5 to be evaluated by a S.A.N.E. nurse (it was just a scare and nothing bad actually happened, thank God). I'm about to take my newborn there to have his congenital hip dysplasia treated with a harness by their pediatric orthopedic doctor. CHOA is a wonderful place with absolute saints for nurses and the best, hardest working doctors. As someone who has spent literally years there, thank you so much. Distractions like this make your stay there so much more bearable. And the quesadillas. Those are on point."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you think they won’t be taken home by hospital staff or even ever get in the hands of patients?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might have not been a Nintendo switch but today a person in front of me at a Dunkin Donuts drive through had a Gamestop bumper sticker and paid $20 towards my $5 bill. The cashier tried to give me the $14+ dollars in change but I ended up putting in more money towards the next person's order. My point on all of this is that Apes are spreading their wealth to others while HedgeCucks try to run businesses into ground and leaving people without jobs and destroying lives. This movement is starting to grow bigger and bigger. First we donate towards Gorillas, then sick children in hospitals, then the world! If anything, I feel thankful and proud towards DFV and all my Ape brothers and sisters. We are on this mission to the moon and please believe that we're going to be taking more than just us Smooth Brains there! This is the way! 💎🙌🚀🌚"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Money well spent; these kids are going to the Galaxy! 🚀 Super Mario Galaxy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is what most common folk would do with a come up. I know that if I somehow strike gold ima give back to the kids too. Good shit op
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is super wholesome, but a real hero would have given them GME stock certificates 😉"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"that is awesome generous bro! Don't know how much you made off GME but that's one of the nicest things you could have done.

I can't imagine how hard it must be to have one of my kids in the hospital for something serious or how hard it would be for the child.

Getting a free switch could literally help their mental health and that could actually help with their recovery..awesome job!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Brilliant

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow there are a lot of 30 day old profiles with no discernible post history or presence on Reddit that are extremely upset about this donation.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to do something like that, but I don't have enough bananas to do something like that.

Shouldn't we try organize a collective buying from gme and distribute them to different children's hospitals in the US and around the world?

Make it WSB goal to get a game for every bed.

Wouldn't that be unbelievably cool?

It will also help the cause 🚀"

I’ve been struggling with my own health issues and being able to play on my switch makes my life a million times easier. I’m sure you know just how much you made these kids happy. You’re absolutely wonderful."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,RESPECT !
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is AWESOME!!! 

When I was a teenager I had to have surgery for the first time and I was terrified. Thankfully the children's hospital I had it at was amazing. When I woke up I was holding this teddy bear someone had donated and it was so comforting and it felt really good to know someone was thinking of me and the other patients. I'd hug him every time the pain got bad.

Seriously, it means so much when you're sick and scared to have someone do something just to brighten your day. I actually bought my Switch because I had to have knee surgery in 2019. I've had a lot of surgeries in my life and having something to distract myself made the recovery much easier. I healed faster because I was able to relax and focus on recovery instead of how bored I was. You're going to help these kids so much!!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,CHOA is amazing.  I was there unfortunately this week with my 6 y/o daughter (Broken Arm).  The Nurses and doctors were amazing.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This IS the way. Make sure to tell them the Apes said hi
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a great human ! Peace compadre
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Thank you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The irony being that hospitals are filled with people due in part to companies like GameStop refusing to take the pandemic seriously because $$$ > Life.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonderful. They are going to need a wheelbarrow to help carry your nuts around
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Technically this is a gain.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping GME will shoot up again so I can do stuff like this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You folks doing this for kids and helping guerillas really warms my heart.
I just want you all to know it"

Excellent work,keep it up."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely love the positivity coming from all of this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this culture
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for doing this for the kids. Just shows what a compassionate caring group this is and how money should be spread around and shared.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you find those for 199.00?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll admit I’m getting pretty tired of the incessant GameStop posts on this sub... missing discussion on other market moves..

But this type of thing? Send them through 100x a day. Never will get old."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yay!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t see those fu***ing hedgies doing this! This is why the people need the money so we can do stuff like this. This is nothing but pure happiness.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is amazing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is Why We like the stock
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They got burgers with branded buns there too! I wanna go!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in film and tv in Atlanta and so I know a lot of people around here with throw away money who got in on this shit 

I wonder if I know you"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GAMERS RISE UP
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,2 games per kid? That's epic
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,❤ Much respect!!! 🤙
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Better call their IT guy first!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice how you got Super Mario 3D All-Stars before Mario’s execution on March 31st!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Outstanding.  Amazing staff doing absolutely amazing and great things.  So cool to see this.  Apes Strong Together and we like the stock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Plot twist he bought empty boxes for thousands of dollars
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what’s up! Yes, power to the players big and small."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"those kids are gonna love you man 🙏🏻 

my gf’s doing her preceptorship for nursing at CHOA and i can’t wait to hear *all about* how they react... 

**cheers, ~~mate~~ ape** 🥂🦧"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend. Thank you for doing my what many of us with we could!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You fucking guys are an inspiration.  The giving on this community is wonderful, I'd almost bet the hedge funds and MM aren't this gracious.  If they do, it's most likely to gain tax advantage."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The marketing team at Game Stip is really milking the shit out of this lmao
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Only one copy of BOTW is a bold choice. I guarantee one kid will hog it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,ay Minecraft
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I really appreciate all the effort and though we have been giving to charity and charitable causes. Children (and apes) deserve it. The sour note is giving this to hospitals. They charge a whole lot of money and should be able to afford it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a child or in a hospital, but I’d take a copy of Pokémon if you’ve got an extta"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,they gayest kind of redditors have taken over this sub. what a shame
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop fucking selling to do shit like this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever heard of the saying, “easy come, easy go?“ this picture is communicating to me that you forgot the value of money and You are letting it go irresponsibly."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does this sub think kids *only* want nintendo? 

I’m not bitching, the kids will love them. I’m just poking fun at all the posts being Nintendo stuff. 

Idk about children’s hospitals but when I donate to group homes I donate digital codes and some places are cool with them (most do want physical. But if you have Minecraft codes you can find a place)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what all of the apes should have done. Don’t get me wrong. Yay for gorillas, but had y’all gone and just spent money at GameStop and donated the items to children’s hospitals or whatever, fuck it even KEPT the games, you would be doing yourselves major favors. A little late now that earnings have come and gone but maybe for next time? Apes together strong, still not that smart tho."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this have to do with the stock market?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it too late to take the games back? If you’re donating I’d suggest grabbing a memory stick and downloading digital games to the switches. Then they won’t have to deal with anyone arguing over which game, any games disappearing, or kids being confused about upset about a game not loading bc they don’t have the cartridge and not realizing how the system works."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of you must have bought gamestop at .05 to have had gains like this lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You rock! I get weepy thinking of those angels apes fighting to grow old! 🦍♥️😻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn I was half- expecting a scalper hate post, but you like the opposite of those guys"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape love will win this battle! Thank you for reminding me what to do again as I Ape grunt in the fight with HF’s! It’s what we do during and after the battle that counts!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are people giving gamestop massive business again? I could have sworn gamestop was as antigamer as a business could get.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve gone full retard
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So y'all sold your shares? Thought we were diamond handing this shit?!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How many shares could that have bought ? Doesn’t seem like a priority right now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape leave no ape behind. Tendies for every1.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s worth more then truck....on that table.... 🤦‍♂️ lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not American, so might be retarded, but aren't US hospitals run for profit with exorbitant life destroying fees. Surely they can afford to buy their own shit?
 If you're going to donate games to the needy wouldn't you be better off finding some under funded orphanage or a charity that helps kids off the streets?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Are ppl doing this for a tax write off?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Send me one please
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something I've always been curious about after seeing the first Switch donations. How does this work, technically? Each Switch can have 8 user accounts. For 10 Switches that's 80 accounts. The saves are stored to the profile. So if Child A plays Pokémon Shield on Profile A on Switch A one day then to continue playing they'd need to sign out Switch A again. But what if Child B played Minecraft on Account B also on Switch A and thus already had it signed out? Child A would have to wait. Sure they could sign out a different Switch and a different game but then they'd have to keep track of which account on which Switch had their progress. Does it work like a library system? You put in for Switch A and when it becomes available then you play whatever game is available to play (since there seems to only be one copy of each game)? I feel that waiting for both the right Switch and the game you want to be both available at the same time would make this a bit frustrating unless they're just playing and starting new games all the time. 

I feel the best way to do this would be to buy a few multiple copies of games. 3 of the real popular ones like Pokémon and Minecraft, 2 of the less popular ones so that if multiple kids want to play the same game there isn't a huge wait. 

Anyone who works at a hospital with gaming devices or knows someone who stayed in one want to chime in on how this would work logistically?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s in the bag!?!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Would love to see what kind of altruism these HFs putting out 😤
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those kids won't be so happy when the Nintendo ninjas steal their copies of Mario 3D-Allstars on the 31st.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Children's hospitals must be overflowing with switches now. More GME'ers than sick kids.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I should invest in Nintendo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,":)

Kids are gross and clumsy...you need some cases - maybe they are in the bag."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What is this godmode
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,At first I thought WSB investing in gamestop was quarky and funny. But keeping a business alive that has a history of screwing over the players is just sad. The first thing I think of when talking about gamestop is how they fawk over people trying to trade in games then charge ridiculous prices for used equipment and games.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,just don’t give them any water
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax write off.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like wasted GME dip to me.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We might as well buy Nintendo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so everyone is aware, selling new hardware doesn't help a retail store."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't see BOTW in that pile of games
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,0/10 no Monster Hunter

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why did yall back such a shitbag company? 

Of all gaming companies gamestop has to be the biggest most shiesty greedy rip off of them all."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Are people just 1 upping how many switches they can donate to hospitals now?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have had your shopping spree before the earrings report.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know a lot of great people that work at CHOA I second this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use to drive a NICU Ambulance for CHOA, and I have nothing but respect for the Nurses and Doctors who work their emergency room, they save multiple lives daily.

Plus the Cafeteria is amazing."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had shit like this as a kid when I had to do extended stays in the hospital for severe asthma. Instead all we had was one N64 we had to share that only had one game. Hospitals also wouldn't accept donations like what OP is doing since it was seen as unfair since there wasn't enough for everyone. Always had to bring my own stuff to stay occupied.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a PGA pro for years and one of my best memories from that was being able to go down to CHOA. We’d get them to hit tennis balls all over that room and just go wild. Seeing those kids with wires and tubes all over them just having an absolute blast smacking a tennis ball off the wall was just incredible. It wasn’t much but I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I heartily agree!

I spent months in that hospital for asthma-related issues throughout my childhood. The people there are amazing, and having awesome nurses really does make or break the experience, especially when one is so exhausted and feeling awful and terrified. The long days, weeks, and months really do eat at the patients and parents, so any source of happy distraction and fun is like finding cool drinking water after wandering through the Sahara. 
Thank you so much for giving CHOA those Switches and games, OP!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My mom worked at CHOA for 25 years as an x-ray technician b
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Had to take both my kids to Choa when they were around 1 month old. They both some some kind of stomach bug and kept spitting up and having diarrhea, which is incredibly dangerous at that age since you can't really give them water, so they had to be hooked up to an IV and we couldn't leave the hospital until they were able to keep a certain amount of formula down over consecutive feedings.

The staff there is beyond amazing, whatever their hiring process is, they really know how to pick the people that truly care about working with and helping children. On top of that, the entire hospital is so cool. They have a DVD and book library with options for kids and adults, a bomb-ass dining area with actual good food, play areas for kids, and beautiful gardens and statues outside for you to walk around in. Honestly, I didn't want to leave when my kids got better, lol."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree. Great organization.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree. Great organization. They do so much to help their kids.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they have a Ronald McDonald house?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is such a humble comment. Makes me happy.

And isn't the whole idea to keep holding? Wouldn't that mean these posts are celebrating people who don't have diamond hands?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that this ridiculous sub is doing some real good for our communities. So beautiful to watch.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But serious question- shouldn’t the focus right now be to buy as many shares as possible..like wouldn’t this be more apt for when the squeeze has squozen?

Lots of rich people do good things for the community. Lots don't.

Look at the number of users here now. Humans are humans, and I would not be surprised if the % of rich people who do this kind of charity and the % of WSB users who do this kind of charity were about the same.  
I will say though, I am talking about rich people and wsb in general - not hedge funds alone. Hedge funds are prob bigger cunts than your regular rich person."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I already have 2 shares spared for that purpose
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How about you raise the bar and go for $500
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about you contribute some now, you have the money to invest with and these kids are just trying to survive..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this idea a lot. Maybe to we can put a list together of all the children hospital across North America and and spread this information across this subreddit. Then put a fund together to get Nintendo switch’s for every kid in each of these children hospital.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that's good for 3 of those reward keychains and a $5 off voucher for your next purchase.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They probably don't, but I wish they started offering t-shirts now, something like the ""Apes together strong"". Or hell, just ""I like crayons!"". I'd invest in one."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Children Hospitals usually take video games as donations because it helps keep the kids happy and gives them something to do while they are having extended stays

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, because Reddit karma is what’s important here right? If someone did that, that would be messed up. Try having a positive attitude."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hospitals may have regulations on what they can and cannot accept for donation.  I would not be surprised at all to find out they don’t accept used handheld systems.

Plus, the TVs in individual rooms are typically small and are usually relatively inaccessible (often they’re mounted high and in a corner).

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Canada. With the exchange rate it’s only like a $10 difference ($259.99 here) but the psychology of seeing $199.99 makes it feel so much cheaper
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They'd try to bankrupt an orphanage if it could make them money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds would short a charity if they could
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not trying make light of the donation or anything. After all, $3M is a significant and much needed amount of money to help children. But, you’ve got to also look at the numbers as well. Steven Cohen is a [multi-billionaire](https://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-cohen/?sh=304296c363f8), whose firm was found guilty of insider trading (which is bad), loosing 1.6 *billion* dollars. This $3 million donation, which is less than a single percent of his worth, is the live-action equivalent of that Simpson meme about the kid saying “I’m helping!” While OP, assuming that each game in the photo cost $59.99 each, gave away roughly $4,000 of goods. Reasonably assuming that they made a few thousand dollars from the GME trading, that would equal maybe 50% or more (possibly slightly less) of their earnings. Their name won’t be dedicated or even remembered. 

Again, not making light of the donation, but his “donation” has all the markings of a PR stunt and nothing more."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. But there were  people complaining about the donations to adopt animals. They said that it was taking money away from the squeeze lol. Imagine being that much of a douche.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It sounds like something you should relate to a fair bit
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Insecurity? When i give in charity i don’t tell people about it

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So these posts without positions....just basically taking their word for it that they’re making this profit?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I never called him an asshole.  I guess you don’t save money for a rainy day and that’s not my problem.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, give it all away, re read it slowwwwly. Donate the gear to children’s hospitals, or.... if you’re an ass, keep it. The idea is that it helps perpetuate the success of the stock, and subsequently your success and ability to donate more. Like.... a circle"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm bringing it up so that anyone else that donates may consider multiple copies of the same game rather than 30 single copies so that the kids can actually enjoy playing a game they like more often that once every two weeks when it's available to use. I know you see it like ""they fuckin' suffering and dying in a hospital they should be lucky to play one level of Mario, who cares if they ever reach the second"" but as someone who used to wait months for the next Animorphs book to be available at my library I'm just thinking that if you're going to donate games think about donating multiples if the game is really popular amongst the kids."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree! CHOA staff always go above and beyond.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are surprised/disappointed that you can't buy stuff at a hospital which are unhealty/toxic for you?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, we had a room full of Legos and stuff like that, but I remember us all being too exhausted to really play with them as kids. Was around the same time as yours too. I was doing better until I hit adult age and then had a completely different issue pop up that hospitalized me for 3-4 years, but overcame that too and am doing great now. Hope you're doing well as well! Being in the hospital as a kid truly sucks hardcore."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, Ronald McDonald house is the shit. When I was in the children’s hospital for an extended time they put my parents up in a beautiful room right next door to the hospital and it cost nothing. What an amazing service. If you ever need a charity to pick, pick them."

Bezos on the other hand is fueled entirely by greed. He has kept almost all his money to himself, and refuses to sign ""The Giving Pledge""."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I hope none yet. That kind of money arriving unexpectedly should be sat on for a while before making any impulse purchases/decisions. It’s really easy to blow through huge windfalls, and so IMO, it’s important to nothing with it other than set it up in some accounts with some reasonable return rate, and just sit on it while you make some plans with an expert.

Afterwards he can of course donate as much as he wants, but making the conscious decision to not make ANY impulse based decisions is likely a great way to help exercise one’s restraint and let your brain catch up with your new reality before accidentally screwing yourself over somehow."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We write the documentary. We will mention it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If I made that exact donation (the OP donation) it would account for 50% of my wealth. Truth of the matter is I’d consider making a donation like that. I’d like to see a multi billionaire consider donating 50% of their wealth as it would cause some REAL change
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A few things. First, this is a great example of moving the goalposts. Hedge fund managers don’t do this turns into a calculation of *a* donation vs net worth. Then because this hedge fund manager didn’t donate anonymously you ascribe ulterior motives. But if he did it anonymously then the initial narrative would be intact. One can also ascribe ulterior motives to all the donation related karma farming here on this subreddit. Also worth nothing this wasn’t the only hedge fund manager who made a donation to children’s hospital I pulled up in my search. It’s just the first. His total donations to the hospital now exceed 1 billion pounds. 

Finally, I disagree that he did this as a PR stunt. His wife runs that children’s charity. He did it to get laid. What’s more noble than that?

Edit. Regarding the sum of his donations.  I switched to a separate hedge fund manager. Here’s the article about the billion pounds donor also donating because he’s trying to get laid

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/05/hohn-charity-donation"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dunno man, as I say, humans are humans, so those rich or wealthy people out there doing the big charity work just for the work would be doing it secretly without the big media splatter, so we would never hear of it anyway - except maybe from the receiver - and a google search does show LOTS of such people."

They are questioning if the people posting should be praised. They are questioning if it isn’t against the subs mission, against diamond handing. They are saying that we shouldn’t acknowledge or praise this post if they purchased these gifts for a children’s hospital by selling their stock. 

It’s a ridiculous thing to say. The OP bought gifts for a children’s hospital, who the fuck cares if they sold shares to do it.

There is nothing to “understand” unless you are looking for a reason to hate.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of gains I make from the squeeze is going towards donations over the course of my life. I’m obviously going to set up ways to make myself financially independent but all the money I know I won’t need or spend is going to go towards donations. I don’t need to be a billionaire if I can already afford the things that make me happy so the rest of the money I don’t need (over time) is definitely going towards enriching the lives of others and helping out communities that really need all the help they can get. That is much much more that Wall Street has and would ever do.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"i dont know about the Microsoft accounts, but I have 2 switches and buy only physical games because of the way Nintendo handles digital purchases. What's really annoying is DLC as it's treated just the same as a digital game. So the short of it is that when you buy a game (or DLC) it's connected to your account. You can have 1 switch marked as your primary switch. Any user on your primary switch can play your digital purchases, but on your secondary switch only your account can play those digital purchases.

So in my case I have switch A (primary) and B (secondary). If I buy a game on my account, then my kids can all play the game (or DLC) on switch A, but only I can play it on switch B. Now consider multiple kids and multiple games. Let's say kid 1 wants to play some digital game and kid 2 wants to play a different digital game at the same time. I have 2 switches should be no problem, but doesn't work as the kids can only play my games on switch A. With physical, no problem, just pop the cartridge in to switch B. You could of course split digital purchases up among multiple accounts, but when you have more than just a handful of games that becomes a frustrating mess as well. Solution? Physical game purchases only in this house, but there's a lot of DLC I'd buy except buying the DLC causes the physical games to end up functioning like the digital versions, so I don't bother buying anymore DLC after finding that out. 

For your case if you mean you have 2 switches and 1 kid, just mark the switch that your kid uses as your primary and then they can play any of your games and you of course can play your games on the secondary."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no way to know what OP’s true net worth is, but I think it’s safe to assume they are not a multi-billionaire. While percentage of worth isn’t a good indication of whether a donation is in good faith or not, judging by this hedge fund managers actual worth, the fact that they are naming something after him because of it, and the fact that OP won’t even be remembered for their donation, makes me lean towards not believing that this donation is anything *but* PR."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Imo we shouldn’t be determining how good people are based on the amount of money they donate.  Not everyone can afford to donate but that doesn’t mean you can’t be a good person. I highly doubt they’re better than you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you against donating for your whole life? Btw I have no issue with people that are, but just curious about the reasoning if you have a lot of extra cash.

But I've almost 3xd my initial investment over a few years, made some money during COVID, etc. I've definitely started donating because of my gains, and imo it's the lowest effort way to feel good while objectively helping people.

Like seriously not even a moral argument here. Just anytime stocks have been rolling and I'm up a couple k, I usually throw $100-200 out to the food banks and it feels fucking great. And yeah add in the write off benefit and it's even better.

Idk man at 30yo seems like one of the cheapest ways to feel good and/or help people, I'm not the helping-at-the-shelter type lol. I'm faaaar from a half mil and the donations feel like nothing compared to the gains. I don't judge but if I were a billionaire imo it's like being at the end of an idle game where you have so many resources you don't know what to do with them... Seems like a shame not to try to feed some people or something lol"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s almost like the person who posted the article as a retort, missed the point entirely..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This multi-billionaire (assuming he has 18 billion in net worth, which it is much higher, but lets assume) gave 0.01667% of his net worth and gets something named after him. Not all of the 3 million will go to kids, as this can also be used to help pay worker over time (maybe a little), but mostly to building costs, furniture for the administration, and who knows what else.

OP (let’s assume he made $10,000 off of the stock, which is much higher than average for the GME payout, but lets assume) made a 40% donation in goods. They get nothing. And their donation will go towards the kids directly. I suppose the admins can play the Switch Lite’s as well, but I doubt they would.

It’s not about assigning “scores,” it’s about people who donate such a little amount, write it off for tax purposes (which they will do, even though they don’t need to because they pay basically nothing in taxes anyway), and get a building named after them for it. 

And besides, I made sure to write that I’m not making light of the donation, but pointing out that what this hedge fund guy did isn’t the same as what OP is doing."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This particular donation, if my math is correct, would have accounted 120% of my monthly income. I donate, but mainly to disabled veteran organizations, and mainly in the double digit realm. I don’t make nearly enough to even come close to what yourself or OP has done. If I had an award, I’d give it. Might burn y’all’s name on a wooden plaque if you’d like. Best I can do. 

Edit: Plaque instead of plague. Oops."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, there is zero way to know *why* any hedge fund manager does anything unless you’re the person in question. So, unless you are the person in question, you’re assumption that he *didn’t* do it for any other reason other than for PR is wrong. History is chalk full of examples of how a person or entity told people they are doing something (or donating) for one thing, only to have it discovered that it was for a different reason altogether.

Also, what “goalpost” did I “move?” I can only assume that you mean my glorifying OP for their donation while downplaying this hedge fund managers own donation. There is a very real precedent of a person or entity donating a very large percentage of their wealth to a good cause being shown as either foolish (think lottery winners throwing their money left and right foolishly and bankrupting themselves) or as near sainthood (think Bill Gates, who has donated a very large proportion of their wealth to various charities or other causes among others). I am pointing out that while the $3M donation was good, as it covers the smallest amount of his wealth it is ungenuine as he could have done more. And that is not me stating that everyone with wealth should give a significant amount of their wealth or nothing at all. That is me stating that OP’s donation is more genuine than the hedge fund managers, because of the amount OP probably made from GME (no way for me to know, which is why I based it off of averages) was enough to make their donation more meaningful.

The other person you mentioned is a different ballgame. Donating to a family members “charity” is iffy to me. I know nothing of this charity or it’s moral compass, but I can state that charities or hit or miss. I recall the big charity called Wounded Warrior, with whom I have donated some of my small income to back in the day. It is a charity that helps wounded service members and their families. A very noble goal. I stopped giving to them when it came to light that they were only giving 5% or something like that to those veterans and pocketing the rest (like the CEO or CFO buying lavish mansions and yachts and such). I’m not accusing this particular charity of the same, but pointing out that this has happened.

Another possibility other than “getting laid” is that he donated the money to escape taxes. Donations are taxed differently all the time, less than regular income. Just a possibility.

Perhaps I’m being cynical with this. However most people with that much money, with very few exceptions, do not use that money for any other reason than to make them more money. At least from what I’ve seen."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly what it is.

That's just fine. But I've seen a ton of posts similar to this, often directly saying or at minimum implying they're giving back from the profits they've made or something similar. I'm not trying to put OP down for doing a good thing. Idk how else to tell you that, yet you keep calling me rude while being extremely condescending. I'm just trying to get a better understanding and if I'm misunderstanding, that's fine. I'll accept that, but I don't see why I can't even try to get that understanding.

You then decided to devalue the donation by 1) moving the goalpost from “don’t do this at all” to “OP’s donations are worth more because it’s more as a fraction of their net worth” (paraphrasing). 2) ascribing ulterior motives. Which you now acknowledge is a just conjecture but one which you decided to engage in

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s fair and I agree. A lot of people are quick to judge others but not themselves. I personally don’t think we should be praising anybody for doing the bare minimum. I wouldn’t praise a normal person for giving a homeless person a dollar, like I wouldn’t praise a multi billionaire for donating a few million to get a tax write off. But I’m not knocking them for it either"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I totally understand and feel the same way. Literally doing some research as we speak, I don't think you could go wrong with any of these: https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=topten.detail&listid=18. Charity navigator is great, there are plenty of others like it as well. My goto has been my local food bank, since I live in a city and there are tons of homeless people here. Ah just checked and it's in the high 80's, it's not bad but I might do some additional research.

Let me reiterate to anyone out there-- this is a $$ subreddit, definitely don't feel pressure to donate. Make your tendies in peace. But if you have the extra cash, maybe try throwing out $100 to see if it makes you feel great or shitty lol. If you're the former like me then it's a bit of a win-win situation and would highly recommend."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much would one have to donate to not be judged? That depends on the person making it, obviously. Bill Gates has donated a substantial amount of money to various charities. It’s not a very large percentage, but more than most other billionaires.

$3M is a lot of money. And I am glad he donated it. But judging off of his record, this appears *to me* to be a PR push. Most billionaires, with very few exceptions, use their money for the sole purpose of making them more money. Good PR, by the way, translates to more money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which is common practice from what I’ve come to understand. Not in all instances, sure, but they do it far more than they should be allowed to do, all for the sake of making 120% more money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. That was autocorrect on my part and I didn’t catch it.

Ok, let me handle it a different way. It’s all about appearances.

The first person you cited, this hedge fund manager, had a press conference or had a statement put out (or had the children’s hospital put it out) stating that he, the man who is a hedge fund manager, made this donation. And because of that he is going to have something (a building I believe) named after him in that honor. So, I can safely assume that this donation, which happens to 0.01% of their wealth, was a calculated donation. The amount was set, it could be written off for tax purposes, and they got great press for doing it. It could have been more, but that doesn’t matter, right? It only matters that they did it, and, most importantly, they were *seen* doing it. 

OP, on the other hand, posted that they were giving away $4,000 worth of Nintendo Switch games and consoles to children in Atlanta. They did so on an anonymous website to an anonymous account. 

I do not know OP. I think it’s safe to say that you do not know them either. Perhaps a few people really knows who OP is. But for the most part no one does. They didn’t have to do so. They are not getting anything named after them for doing it. Unless the hospital tells the local news they *may* get some coverage on the local Atlanta news. 

It is well known that this hedge fund manager (who I can’t remember the name other than Steven) has multi billion dollars. It is known that they are a hedge fund manager. It is known that they are giving money to this children’s hospital and, because of that, they are getting a building named after them and heaps of positive press. It was a calculation.

OP has none of that. In fact, no one but themselves  know that they made any money at all off of the GME thing. They didn’t have to spend that money on the Switches and games. They didn’t have to donate it. They did it **not** as a calculated risk/reward PR event, but from the kindness of their heart. How can I possibly know this? There aren’t any rewards for doing so. OP isn’t a billionaire that sorely needs the good PR. They more than likely sacrificed a good portion of their money out of the desire to help the children. Their only PR they are going to receive is from here on Reddit and *maybe* from the local news channel, which will provide them with nothing more than cool browny points to bring up in conversation. 

So, yes, I glorify OP’s donation while downplaying this hedge fund managers. It’s not the same. It’s not moving any goal posts. There aren’t any goal posts to move. One was for PR, the other was out of the kindness of their heart."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never asked *why* OP bought them. Also, you literally never said it doesn't matter how OP paid for it. You basically just called me demented for even asking if people (of which I never even specified OP) are selling out to do these great things and if that doesn't at least slightly go against the hive mind mentality of holding. And as for assuming, you're the one constantly referring you OP as ""he."" Idk if it's a man or woman. Idk who OP is and maybe you do, but otherwise you're actually the one making assumptions.

I think it's a great thing that OP did. I'm really not trying to make this into a big thing, but I can see this is clearly going nowhere and you're not willing to have a calm, reasonable conversation. That's fine.

2021-03-28 05:00:03,wallstreetbets,"Move over UWMC, PFSI is the most undervalued large mortgage company **First, a summary:**

PFSI is significantly undervalued when comparing to competitors. Their financials show that their stock will *literally be free money* (after \~1 year).

***Just a note: UWMC and RKT still have good potential for short term speculative plays since their short interests are high. This post is only talking about mid to long term valuations among large traditional mortgage companies.***

**Introduction:**

With the recent feud between RKT and UWMC, I decided to take a closer look at a few other companies in the mortgage sector. I was surprised to find that PFSI was at such a low valuation compared to competitors. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI) is a company that does mortgage origination and investment management services. They were founded in 2008 at the heels of the mortgage financial crisis and they are based in Westlake Village, CA. Currently, they are the 3rd largest mortgage lender. They operate in both the direct-to-consumer channel and the broker channel.

**Financials:**

PFSI has a market cap of $4.73B on sales of $4.56B, and a net income of $1.65B in 2020. They also have $3.4B of equity at the end of 2020 (see their [10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001745916/ef9f38e8-9bdd-48a2-9a09-3cc22e4832ac.pdf)). This means that if they make $1.3B profit in 2021, it's P/B will go below 1 for the current stock price. $1.3B is a 21% downside to their 2021 earning numbers, and I think it will be pretty likely they make this much since the housing market is still hot. The consensus EPS forecast for 2021 is $19/share, and with 71.77m shares outstanding, that would already be $1.36B earnings. Usually for sectors like mortgage, the outlook and forecast are pretty conservative as well.

**Stock buyback:**

PFSI recently approved an increase of their buyback program from $500m to $1B, $350m of which is already used before end of 2020. This means that they are going to buy back another \~15% of the company at current valuations.

**Comparison to competitors:**

*P/E:*

Here I've only compared a few larger cap traditional mortgage companies. I excluded companies like RKT, LDI, TREE, etc because they have different business models with online lending and their valuations cannot be compared with these traditional mortgage companies.

**Risks of housing market downturn:**

The major headwind to mortgage companies right now is the prospect of rising interest rates and a housing market downturn. However, we know that JPow said the Fed interest won't move until at least after 2023. The mortgage interest rate may creep up a bit but won't go up wildly for next few years. This means that the risk to mortgage companies is not substantial. The lower EPS is already included in the forecast. Furthermore, these few biggest mortgage companies are still gaining market share from the big banks in the mortgage sector, and I would expect this to offset the loss in overall business somewhat.

&#x200B;

Positions: bought 150 PFSI shares to start. I'm also holding RKT shares and leaps for its growth potential and squeeze potential (see my past DDs on RKT: [RKT's Road to S&P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/), [why RKT is not a mortgage company with an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/), [Catalyst for continued housing boom this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8tg5w/rkt_catalysts_for_continued_housing_boom_this_year/), [RKT's growth story shows up in its financials](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/))"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC dividend is about 3X larger than PFSI. UWMC is tech focused, with turn times faster than any other company. They grew rev by 720% YoY. I’ll take UWMC higher dividend and higher growth trading at 45% off all time Highs."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"First RKT, then UWMC and now PFSI 🤡"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of my thoughts.

The first thing you miscalculated is the P/B of UWMC. It's actually 1.05 (so lower than PFSI). -->  [UWMC PB Ratio | UWM Holdings - GuruFocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pb/NYSE:UWMC/PB-Ratio/UWM)

Regardless, looking at the numbers. This is the assets that they have: ""Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights)."" --> Mind you this is from my DD that i gathered from the financial documents of this company.

UWMC's Market Cap is 12.81 billion USD at a price point point of 7.93. 12.81/11.493= 1.114. So the website is slightly wrong. Probably because it took it from when it was even lower.

UWMC has a dividend of 5.04%, whereas PFSI has one of of .96%.

PFSI had net income of 1.65B in 2020, whereas UWMC had net income of $1.37B in Q4 2020 alone, and a FY Net Income of $3.38B.

Let me be clear that the analyst estimate hasn't been updated when they state a P/E for UWMC of 1.27 dollars per share. It's more likely to be 2.42, for a forward P/E of 3.29. I can't be assed to find the P/E ration by manually counting it right now. Just divide the shares by the net income later.

I have no quarrel with this ticker, but I thought I'd clarify some things. I see no reason why it wouldn't be a fundamentally sound deep value play. 

Out of curiosity, how much is the value of PFSI's mortgage servicing rights? It should be listed under assets."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think that either RKT or UWMC hold/service much or any loans. Vs pennymac who does. Any thoughts on risk here when mortgage forbearance goes away? Seems like origination is a safer play than servicing.

At least my last 2 loans were passed on to pennymac for servicing, both at super low rates. While rates are this low, isn’t pmac just taking on a ton of exposure with little upside?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC holder and bullish on housing. Thanks for the write-up. Definitely something worth looking into, seems like a good value play."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stopped reading at ‘after ~1 year’. That’s why im in uwmc, which also sucks right now and will have to wait months for it too prolly"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a mail man, and I deliver more Penny Mac than than any other mortgage. I actually had one UWMC the other day it was the first time seeing one."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What part of 2008 history don’t these fools understand. A mortgage company will crash hard once the froth is gone.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no....not another one
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is interesting. Their EPS are extremely healthy. Surprised they don't do a split
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I miss the rocket on UWMC from 10 to 11 dollars?

Glad I only put in for 5 stocks just to fuck around. It is a good reminder to just hold on to that people are fucking retards around here and their DD can be shit. Maybe it will go up eventually."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, short squeeze potential is what stirred the interest, but now this is a value play. Seems most people claim to follow DFV for value plays except they are only looking to make a quick buck. Nothing wrong with speculative plays but their fundamental thesis really doesn't align with that of DFV."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"you do realize the book value used for P/B calculations is equity = assets - liabilities right? Here you only list the assets, but fail to account for the liabilities. The actual equity listed in UWMC's 10-K is $5B, and 12.98 / 5 \~ 2.6. The numbers before were wrong because UWMC went public with a SPAC merger and that fks up the numbers.

What's your point regarding the net income? Sure UWMC is a larger company, but its ratio is worse than PFSI.

Also, you got a source for the $2.42 EPS number? Consensus EPS for 2021 is $1.32. If you think they will beat it, what make you think PFSI won't also beat it? They are in the same market"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"PFSI's service UPB is $200B vs RKT's $400B, I couldn't find UWMC's breakdown in their 10-K. So you are right in that by percentage PFSI does more servicing than RKT. The total delinquency amount rate is 12% up from 7% in 2019, and for RKT it's 4% from 1% in 2019 (RKT pride themselves in servicing good credit mortgages though, they even show in their 10-k that their average credit score is in the mid 700s), so there is increased risk but not a ton from before. With covid forbearance, most of the increased delinquencies should end up ok as employment ramping up, but because this is unprecedented so it's yet to be seen how it will turn out. 

Like I said in the post, interest rates won't go up significantly until after 2023. With PFSI having these ratios, I think I would be confident buying for next few quarters at least."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you misunderstand. The stock is undervalued now and can go up anytime. The 1 year was referring to if it somehow stayed at current prices after 1 year then it's market cap and its equity value becomes the same and all earnings after that is free money. The stock price won't stay the same because people will anticipate this and buy the stock price up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the meantime, UWM giving out a monthly “thank you for your service” of $0.10 per share"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's actually market price per share/book value per share for price to book ratio. Regardless, i know what you're referring to, but you've miscalculated it. The price for UWMC isn't 12.98, by the way, it's 7.97. 

As for the SPAC, I would hope so, as it gave the company 925 million dollars. 425 Million, and a further 500 million in PIPE.

As for the 10-K, it's fucked because it's the GORE SPAC. You can see the 425 million number I've mentioned. The better form to look at is Q4 2020, as it also does the full year. From their investor relations.

\^\^ This takes into account the money they got from the SPAC. You can get this in the investor relations or looking at their Q.

Here is their debt:  [United Wholesale Mortgage - UWM Holdings Corporation Announces UWM’s Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results; $1.37 Billion 4Q20 Net Income and Declares First Regular Quarterly Dividend of $0.10 per share and 11 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/f956ea6f62ec46caa106cc45f0681e9d)

The senior notes are 5.5% Senior Notes due 2025. I do not know if they are convertible notes.

I hope this clears things up.

As for consensus EPS. Their targeting .40 this upcoming quarter, but Matt Isbia is targeting a number that is much higher, and recently confirmed on Mad Money that he's on track to meet the range he gave. So yeah. But i'm tired. It's late, so i'm heading to bed. As for PFSI beating or not beating it. I'm sure they too will beat it. The mortgage industry is on fire business wise at current, but i like UWMC''s CEO and I think he's going to make a killing."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. Thanks for the thorough reply. I’m pretty bullish on housing at least for this summer. Even if rates creep I think it’ll just get people to FOMO. Shit is too crazy where I am and ramping up for the season. Got another to dig into now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"the price in price-booking ratio is price/share divided by book value per share. If I take out the (per share) for both and it's market cap divided by total equity, which is exactly what I was calculating - market cap of $12.98B divided by $ 5 B equity (this $ 5B already includes the SPAC proceeds, since the UWM equity is only $2.37 B per your screenshot). So you can see that their ratio is not as good as you thought."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Price to Book Ratio | Market to Book Value | P/B Formula | M/B Example (myaccountingcourse.com)](https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/financial-ratios/price-to-book-ratio#:~:text=1%20Formula.%20The%20price-to-book%20ratio%20formula%20is%20calculated,outstanding%20that%20are%20trading%20at%20%241%20per%20share.)

It's not price/share divided by book value per share. It's quite literally Market Price Per Share/Book Value Per Share, or more simply total book value/total market value.

I know that Equity=Assets-Liabilities. I'm just saying you've only calculated 5 Billion in Equity, however, you're not counting mortgage servicing rights or mortgages at fair value. Hence, what we're counting things differently.

Shareholders Equity=Retained Earnings + Shareholder Capital. If they're retaining more mortgages that's not retained earnings, but it is adding to the balance sheet.

Honestly. Shareholder's equity is total assets and total liabilities. You just take that from the balance sheet, as i have.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The normal mode of operation is that Friday trends follow into Monday when the close is strong. We may see it but it also may be a profit taking point mentally for many. I imagine the market churns between 3900 and 4100 for some time before going higher because you need FAANG and the other S&P sectors to participate at the same time. I think funds gave been washing out retail from FAANG for the next leg up. I’ve got QCOM and AAPL calls for June and May and I think they’re about to rip. You’ll likely see the reopening names get punished whenever FAANG goes off then them catch up as retail and WSB chase behind the hedge funds.

To make money you don’t have to be first, but you have to be before many. Be early, this is just my thesis."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very solid summation right here. There may be more volatility in short term due to manipulation (can go both ways though), but long term I think this is the best play in the market. As you said, downside risk is mitigated by buyout potential (at > than current market cap with near certainty. Can't imagine management selling an asset that cash flows billions for less than $20B with recent launch of streaming they invested heavily in). Also mitigated by their non-streaming financial base. The legacy company provides billions in cash flow per year which they can invest in new opportunities as they did streaming. 

Also, relatively high short interest which I've we've seen can catalyze upward price discovery (no pun).

Also, a literal famous rocket ship (space shuttle) is called ""Discovery"" - think of the memes lol"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 8k losses. You got 3 years of write offs. Easy.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you respond how do you rebound?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro xom shoulda just did meme stocks Atleast😂

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You doing it right! GGz!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what you get for still using RobinHood
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Try selling options when you make a big haul. A lot less risky
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Talk about depressing lol 

Alright I got a joke though... two fish are sitting in a tank when one looks at the other and says how do we drive this thing"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"man I'm so sorry,  maybe try only playing with profits?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my gourd
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There was one guy recently did the unemployed yolo. I liked that

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you like the 5G? I've had it for a few months. Kind of inconsistent compared to 4g speeds
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Set limit stops and lock in profits dude.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why no post of the loss?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't get this, such conflictory information. In always screenshotting to show my friends how much I'm losing. How can I take profits if I'm always down?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually a pretty good rule
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Even a screenshot can cost you money. What if in that split second the price went down from when you screenshots then you just fucked yourself
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Give that guy with the 30 day refund a call... where he at?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gold.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao go drop a like on my “weeklies are fucking awesome!!” Comment haha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, remember the 45 DTE is the time when Theta becomes exponential so not really smart to hold beyond that point... well unless you got balls of steel of course"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂 gold.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Man for reals I got emotional and didn’t want to sell like a fucking noob.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've learned to set OCO orders to sell at a 30% loss or 100% gain, in case of spikes"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me on Fri, $3k to $77k (took screenshots instead of profit) to $6k still holding with my diamond balls hoping it doesn’t expire worthless!

Screenshot = Profit"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing I may add is that the positions would hold up end of day one and then the stock would drop off the table very next day oil made a very weird dip last two weeks and it seemed to be manipulated
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This!! Unless it’s shares or leaps gtfo with some money and live to fight another day instead of taking -99% worthless options
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no next Friday..  market is closed 4 day trading next week.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Never stop trading. This is financial advice and it is terrible.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I also believe I’m addicted.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you good sir/whore. I’m glad to be here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,lol nah that’s fraud.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tehe
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well we know it’s not the tendieman
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf... (confusion)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this. I was really sad yesterday.. but I handled it like a champ and I’m back on my horse. 

I’m not giving up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oil is hot
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so too
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re so goddamn stupid for never taking profit. It’s just astonishing.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I never got into the selling part.. found it riskier..
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The big oil plays were held to expiration yes.. I was praying for a damn rebound but it never came!! The 20k loss was a average down move from 10k to 20k which quickly loss so I had no choice but to hold. 


The 10k play loss came very quickly as I bought it on a Wednesday.. bad move I know. Was expecting to recover as it did late Friday... .50 short of my calls haha MM’s had their way with me."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,??? Can I ask why??
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Most brokerages send their data to clearing houses though. What do you use?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s in there.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub will break far more than they make.  Just wait until they figure out that the HF are really the guys over at Thetagang taking their money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I quickly realized this is the reason I should buy more than 1 contract. I would be up by a good margin, then let it ride on the chance it would go hirer. If I had more than one, I could sell half and let the other half ride."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">toxic

This is WSB not r/investing"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why you buy shares.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This..... I was up 58k on yolo GME calls, but I held and got felt the IV/Theta crush even though the price recovered. Took a 9k loss instead. I would have sold, but some crazy personal shit happened and I never set an appropriate stop limit."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe his drug dealer wanted to have a word with him before we ask him anymore questions
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What?? Lol absurd!! Who is this man??
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Say that again but more slowly please
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gold?  Retard, you can't even afford potting soil!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Never sell at a loss” was never actual advice, it’s just a godawful notion that’s being used to groom the GME bag holders"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. I'll set that up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s all relative. In many cases this would save me nicely. But my best ever return was over 700x. Not gonna see that if you’re selling at 2x
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is good advice

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a cousin fucker 🦍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I plan to put in another 25k in and just use the 1.9k to play yolo, believe it or not, I almost came back on top big time this Wednesday, I had heard about people burning Nikes in China, so I wanted to buy puts, but because I used all of my money was in a Carnival Puts (9k which I bought 2 hours ago), and I had only 1k of instant deposit left, I just bought the 1k worth of on Nike, I swear if I could have liquidated the 9k to buy Nike(stupid pdt rule), it would have been 70k the next morning at open, I ended up losing the Carnival puts but the Nike puts paid out 7k, you can only imagine my frustration.  These rules are so stupid, it’s not like I didn’t have money in the bank, just couldn’t transfer it into any stupid brokerage account right away, what a big fuckery!  My advice to my people is to always leave some cash just in case.

I’ll be back, will a massive comeback!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just kidding lol. Stay positive man!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Boo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dawg youre not done
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know!!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m switching.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I’ve read all brokerages send their options order flow, but robinhood does both stocks and options purchases. Way worse."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thetagangers are big supporters of WSB endeavors.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t even wsb anymore. 

It’s just fucking r/all"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guy took drug money and lost it in the stock market, made a thread asking if there’s a way to get a refund lol so he could pay his dealer or something."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s no worse off than you, friend"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Date to Expiration. The last 45 days are when the contracts start fluctuating in price, like a heavy cocaine user's personality fluctuates when they are high or sober."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I have certainly sold at a loss but nowhere near the loss that could have happened. Or 'if you don't sell you never lose anything'.... ummmmm.... yes, you do. Never get emotional about stocks. The house almost always wins. Short squeezes are rare and to just keep believing that it happens 2 or 3 times to the same stock is only belief not thinking."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell half at 2x and never blow up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"One Cancels Other.  Meaning if one condition is met it cancels the other side.  On Robinhood for example if you set a limit sell and then try and set a stop loss order, they won't allow it saying you don't have enough shares.  They only allow you to set up one order.

OCO orders let you set up both sides, and you don't need to manage them as much (and it removes emotion).  With options I want out if they dip below 30% loss, and I'm happy to sell at a 100% gain.  Sometimes if there's a steady move up I'll change the OCO order to a 10% dip from where it's at (maintain profit), and increase the other side another 50% or so (which is then 200% of original)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m stickying this to my phone screen. 

Always take profit! 

Might order a shirt or 2 as well. I have so many amazing screenshots on 6 figure positions that I exited at a loss is concerning. I’m like 16 out of 19 were I enter a trade, go up over 100%, and sell at a loss or expires worthless. Once on AMC, i when $140 to $16k to selling at $50... smh! I wasn’t even mad."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not so bad after too many yoloes without an exit plan. 

My goal today before next week is to come up with exit strategies. 

I need to graduate from this sub... I hate my wife’s bf. He’s old, fat, bald, worth over $50M and dated her mom a few years ago. Her mom didn’t cash a million dollar check he gave her to marry him."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it was funny to watch. Because the month before I was banking off of wti crude small spike upward. Just didn’t make sense these pst two weeks.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Alabama has entered the chat
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Make it happen. That PDT rule is just another way to keep tards like us from getting rich too quickly.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok who’s there?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I now understand the question had me stumped there brother/whore... I will recover I will first begin with leaving robinhood... 
after that I will buy some more weeklies starting Thursday April 1st. For the fowling week."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And I’m definitely not done.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder why 🤔😒
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, your mom is fucking /r/all"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know bro, the good days are over."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the story was true, he'd be WAY worse off."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is exactly what ive been looking to do. i recently switched from RH to TD so ill have to look for this in the conditionals. thank you so much for the info, super helpful."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's weird but it's a common mistake. I sure did it enough times.
Anything over 30% is good enough to get out of. If it's going parabolic... Watch it with your sell order ready and waiting and hit that button at the first sign of weakness.
Remember, if you made 30% profit on every trade, you'd be fucking rich inside a year."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I stay away from oil unless it’s just for a quick scalp
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will!  When I first started, I didn’t know there are rules and stuff like that, and I was hitting it every time, until I got stuck on that shitty stock BB, lost time and money on it.  And when I got smarter and realized you gotta “hit and run” when you make some profit, it was too late, every time I made a profit on the day I bought, I couldn’t sell the same day only to watch the money got snatched away pre-market and sell at a loss at open.  For a straight 2 weeks it happened every fucking day!  I’m sick of this shit now, I’ll do the 25k thing on Monday and hopefully in a few weeks I can post that come back story here!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Boo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They may come back when GME goes back to normal and all these fuckers lose their $18 and go back somewhere else but I fear the funny people have just left. I’m hanging around to see if it happens but who knows.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I have exited with 30% on half my trades this year, I’d be so rich right now. My dry powder is a lot less now so it’s getting harder to be up 6 figure per trade. I’m still getting over 100% to 200% on most trade so if I figure out how to get out, my fortune will change. 

My entre is golden, my exit is shit!

Edit: I’m not buying the top either, just holding too long. I ride it up and then down. Volatility in the market obviously taking my ass to school."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I follow this strategy quite a bit and those gains add up quick.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess scalping is what I did when I made the 45k I did last month. It was awesome.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your story sounds like your position sizing is too big.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. Radley?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I visit less and less.  This will probably return its former self at some point but right now it’s GME bets.  Which is fine, enough people are into it.  Just not for me after that initial run."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ditto. So embarrassing, in retrospect. I have to start all over again. Guess what I WON'T be doing this time..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both? Take profits at some point/interval you set beforehand. Leave the working $ until you're ready.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Scalp is like in and out within a few minutes. You did more like a swing. Regardless it’s all stupid terms, Congrats on your gains bro!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,All options
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know how knock knock jokes work? I say boo you say boo who.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did that once last week and it felt good for once. I’m getting there, I think!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hehe thanks man will be back for more one of these days.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you crying?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck bro! Happy trading
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is op crying.... oh yeah it’s because he lost a bunch of money.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,CSP on GME? That's **way** to retarded for r/thetagang
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How the hell have you not been margin called? You are $12k under your margin maintenance requirement.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Getting all of the ""back to $40"" exposure and none of the ""to the moon"" exposure is a pretty bummer deal imo, but that premium is delicious. Good luck."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling CSP on GME.  Nothing can go wrong here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correction: I’m not short Sundial Growers. I meant to say my portfolio is my pretty much 100% GameStop, with a tiny bit of Sundial Growers. Too retarded to get the title right...."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact, currently if you buy GME at whatever price and sell deep ITM CC the Theta on the position will be multiple times higher that the Delta. It seems aaalmost arbitrage. You make money if the stock goes up, goes sideways or even down slowly. You lose if the underlying goes down very fast but even then you can possibly roll your positions down and farther out and probably even come out positive anyways. The only other stock I've noticed you can do something similar is TSLA but the ratio of Theta/Delta is a bit less than GME."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I am comfortable selling CSP at $40, but definitely not $200, way too much of a gamble.  Good luck with that play."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just stupid with extra steps

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooh ooh aaah aah🦍🦍🦍 The way this is
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I swear theres at least 1 or 2 geniuses a week doing this same shit. Works for a while until it doesnt and you blow up your account. Get out while you are ahead. You cant predict GME.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is dark mode for the app, you should try it"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing the same thing and hoping I get assigned one day :)

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been doing same thing.   First time selling Puts.  Been profitable thus far.  I have no issues buying more GME anyway, so long as it doesn't screw up my avg of course.  hehe I screw that up enough on my own without any assistance. :P"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally can’t go tits up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,you're gonna regret this play one day

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Put? For real?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when the big boys flash-crash it down to 75 again? They have the firepower to swing both ways and wipe us out.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought your puts. I use the increased margin when it goes south to buy more shares and move my puts up whenever it moons. Stoped measuring my account in cash and started measuring it in gme shares. A few more good swings and I should be up to 100 shares from 2 a few weeks ago
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are on 79k and so close to a margin call it hurts to look at.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,*too

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. This literally cannot go tits up. $GME is going to the moon, and I’ve bought my ticket."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I always sell CSP on stocks I'd like to be assigned at the price I want to buy if it's not there.  It's usually just free money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What broker do you use ? because td won't let me sell cash secured puts right now. I will start another account and eat some more bananas 😜
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a sundial put I bought for real cheap. Expires on 4/1. Strike price of $1 and break even of .87. 

I bought it when it was like $1.50/share and it has just stayed at .01 value since like 5 hours after I bought it. Has not fucking budged even when the share price went down to like 1.10.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL  I have two whole shares of SNDL on RH because I wanted it to appear on my Positions screen without having to hunt it down.  Now its all I have in RH.  Decided to leave the pocket change so they have to maintain the account for a whopping 2.44 

F RH!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How are they not just getting exercised though?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How can the theta be higher than the delta if the CC you’re selling is deep ITM? Is it because of the high IV?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I sell less than 140s. Last week was nice cause I could get some money out of the 95s. If it goes above 250-300 I switch to buying puts.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, nice. Collect some tasty premium while you HODL. Why the fudge not? We apes are evolving."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you do this, are you selling contracts on all of your shares at once, or do you stage it out to maximize volatility?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, your broker won’t let you write a CSP on a meme stonk if you do not have enough cash to buy the shares should you get assigned.

Happy to share knowledge with a fellow ape."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy getting assigned when its under $100
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking bowt rolling down to like $170 but I have to pay a bloody debit...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d love to hear your explanation as to how selling a CSP has the risk of an infinite downside. You’re a little confused my friend.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He sold them.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're selling puts, yes? So if the price gets slammed back to 75, even briefly, put-holders exercise and you get assigned?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m not doing ITM like OP. So far I’ve been selling OTM far enough to avoid unpleasant dips. If I get assigned on a flash crash below 100 it’ll go up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This retard on WSB talking about hedging his long position of GME with puts. 

Sir this is a casino."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,*Ironic*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Vega gang for sure.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The NLV is $79k though...

Regardless this guy is on the brink of margin call and doesn't even have much leverage if GME pops to $300"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’ve been doing the same. No where near ITM though.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What is extrinsic value?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is going to buy options with large amounts of extrinsic value just to exercise early. Even if they did, he would be profitable on the trade and could then sell the shares or a call."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"then why would you play theta gang? If you know it is going to the moon buy calls. Theta gang doesnt profit from large swings

selling puts says “I think GME wont drop”. Buying calls says “GME is going to the moon”. Why not make the plays you already believe in?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol how are puts moon tickets?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dude. Just create a vertical spread by adding a super cheap call at say, strike 20 for the nearest expiration. Pay a few dollars for the 20 strike put and sell it after opening the spread if you want it back.

**Key is to open a spread bc for some reason TD won’t recognize the creation of a spread using two separate orders.**"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fellow ape, I use Interactive Brokers (IB). Never had any issues with them. Back when RH stopped buying $GME, IB merely stopped margin trading, a more modest response."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Td didn’t let me either while I had margin account (with plenty of cash & untouched margin).   
Switched to cash acc, no problems since."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta will get cha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you said you don't have money to fuck around with makes me say No, don't touch anything. 

This is gambling, don't put more money in than you can afford to lose."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who is Edward jones? pirate captain?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I roll them to a farther date once they start loosing most of their extrinsic value. 
It wouldn't be beneficial for an option buyer to exercise instead of just selling the contract when there's still time value still left in it. So it rarely happens."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, the IV on them is really high so theres alot of extrinsic value in the CC you sell even the ones deep ITM. 
When it get close to expiration just roll them to a farther date and keep on collecting premium. It doesn't seem to work on the other high IV meme stocks (other than TSLA). I'm assuming because the stock price has to be in the hundreds plus have high IV aswell. 

I've literally doubled+ my net worth with this strategy selling GME going into earnings my average buy price for GME is 140ish and I've been selling around the 100strike CCs weeklies and by weeklys. The day before earnings I sold all my CC a month out to lock in that Theta but GME has stupid high IV even after earning so cool I guess 🤷‍♂️😎"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great question, Friday I did all. I’m not sure I will do that again but playing it day to day. I am hedging upward explosion with a near DTE contract. Premium paid is less then premium received on sold calls. Probably a better way to do this, but working okay at the moment."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. I know I’m retarded, was just making sure I wasn’t stupid."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I will.  Ill LOVE that.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the OPs #'s.  He has 4 puts @ $200 .....  Those could already be exercised, lol."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And we ether win or lose. My longs go to the moon or my shorts pay off my car. Or it goes to the moon and my new puts pay off my mortgage. Or my longs go to Mars and my new puts let me open my restaurant.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You must now commit sudoku
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like you’ve honoured them.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He sold puts. If gme goes to 300, he wins."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He sold cash-secured puts. The margin req is already at a maximum.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been theta ganging GME since January and as long as you’re okay with getting assigned, selling FDs even brings in almost 2% per week. Selling weeklies closer to the current price yields 3+% per week. Check my post history for my positions and overall gains from it. 10/10 would recommend theta gang on GME.

Edit: “full time theta gang” since January. Held shares since October."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well the IV is sky fucking high and premiums for contracts are through the roof  


If GME keeps trading sideways only the theta gang will make a profit so in reality I think its a great move"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When they get assigned, and at $200 strike price they definitely will, I’ll own the stocks. I just wanted to collect some premium before assignment, that’s all...."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a **short** put  


so basically you are writing the put contract to some degenerate and you receive the premium that they paid for it. Look up CSPs (cash-secured puts) for a good explanation."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah so thank you I'm learning so much.  Now can I do the spread without a margin account?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there any downside to just having separate orders rather than officially a spread if you end up with all the same strikes/expirations/etc.?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not true, I am with IBKR and I could not purchase GME on a cash account when they decided to turn off the buy button."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t IB the one where the boomer CEO went on CNBC on record to insult the stock and complain the whole thing was an attack on wealthy people?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent. Thanks Boss💎💎💎👐👐👐🦍
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"THIS!!!  TEN BAZILLION TIMES, THIS!!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlesss you want to be rich... then YOLO into GME and BB and see you on the moon, bud!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right on. Thank you for being honest.
What if I said that I have $1k to play with?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol! I guess it's just a local gig. They buy and sell for dumbasses like me. I assume they're doing the best they can with what they have, as they only profit off of my profit. As it is, I'm currently in some mutual funds thing, I think. It is very low risk, and of course that means a slow grower. $4k three years ago is $5500 now. Not bad, I guess. My EJ guy wants me to continue to foster that account before spending money on other shares. But, I feel like spending about $1-2k and getting kind of aggressive with it. Take a short term loss for a long term gain? But I have NO CLUE what I'm doing, what to look for, how to trade, etc. I'm just wishing I had been better in the loop before the big Game Stop happening."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. Nice job, man. I’ve been selling weekly OTM but I’ll take a look at that strategy some more. How many DTE are you usually aiming for and how often do you roll them, if you don’t mind me asking?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are an entrepreneur. Thank you for sharing, kind sir. Here I was thinking selling deep ITM guarantees assignment...."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand what extrinsic value is... what's the extrinsic value on GME April 1 100c?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I complete sudoku using online clues?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn't win that much though. He would win a lot more if he just bought the stonk
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if it goes down to $150 he's **fucked**
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"but that sounds more complicated than buy and hold. I don't think you understand the ""retard"" and ""ape"" portion of this equation."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I was selling 140/150/160/170's last week getting !!!!12%
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It is a great play if you expect it to trade sideways. OP said they think GME is going to the moon though
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt it be cheaper to buy shares at a low price instead of buying it for more and recieving a premium?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can. Obviously, the trade needs to be fully cash secured though. 

So, say you sell a bull put spread with strikes 120 and 20 for $500 and -$3, respectively. You’d need:

100 * $120 - $500 + $3 = $11503

Total acct liquidity should be at least $11503 (plus commissions) to make this specific trade.

Just, you know. Keep in mind GME could tank and you’d get assigned"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No but with TD you wouldn’t be able to establish the trade in the first place
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Random. That never happened to me. I received an email from IB saying that margin trading had stopped for a bunch of meme stonks but nothing about buying restrictions. I have always been able to buy meme stonks.

Hold up, I have the pro version. Maybe the standard version is different."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I'm very new to stocks so I don't want to give shitty advice. But I just so happen to have almost exactly 1k to put in and play with.
I played around with options and stocks, won some and lost some. Came out even. Then dumped all 1k into GME at $162.

I just really believe it will go up. I don't have any sources or DD to back it up though. I just like this subreddit and this stock. 🤣"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"(Strike price + premium) - underling price = extrinsic value

My broker, Tasty Works, is showing 123$ of extrinsic value on those at this moments (its the weekend so obviously is can change drastically on Mon)

Edit: 123 - 453 is the spread"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re missing out on free money. Just sell otm calls at crazy prices. You can still make 200-600 per contract
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I missed the dip at $120, so I’m kinda creating my own dip in a way if u think about it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooo ooo ooo brain is trying to wrinkle...thank you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have pro too, did you actually try to buy during that time?

edit: Here's a screenshot when I tried to buy on that day: https://imgur.com/PB23lKv"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea where you're getting $123. Using GME at close and mid price for the April 1st 100c you'd get $0.45 for extrinsic.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the downside to selling cash secured puts at all the crazy low strikes that it'll almost certainly never hit? Hadn't even considered it until now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Naked calls on GME? Found the Melvin employee.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im too fucking stupid to understand how these options will print, sadly..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I had the same issue
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess you’re right, gentle ape. No, I never bought at that time because I didn’t have any cash (my 3 personal loan applications were still pending....)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have IB and i was unable to buy GME in late January
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What source are you getting your prices from?
My broker may be inacurate at this time.
April 1st doesn't have alot of open interests and the speads on the calls are a little wide... plus you know.. it's the weekend

Reading elsewhere that could present good buying opps in Discovery and more.

The best buying opportunity is still with GME, atleast in my uneducated and usually incorrect opinion."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fund liquidations, especially of that size, do not happen overnight. It usually takes place over a 6 to 12 month period. Redemptions are suspended and the fund does not open new positions and gently closes liquid positions and begins trying to close out level 2 and level 3 positions for the best possible price. Partners in the fund, assuming it was an open ended fund, are advised of their distribution schedule which is usually a big chunk, like 50%, within the first few months and then periodic payments of several percent there following until about 95% is distributed.

I'm not saying a huge fund liquidation doesn't ripple through the markets, but it's a far cry from the total dump a lot of people are speculating about. If anything, a huge fund that can move the market in such a major way would have an even more protracted and orderly wind up than a smaller one."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fascinating *evil laugh* we all know the correlation must be tied to GME

The stocks were all down on Tuesday, big drop on Wednesday, down more on Thursday, and another big drop on Friday but we're expected to believe Friday was the block sales?

This smells like the news wants us to believe that it was a 1 day thing and that everyone should buy the dip.

Reality check, VIAC is actually at the price it should be right now. Look at its historical financials and its historical price chart. There was no reason for it to be at $100.

This might be the domino that falls."

As if there's another"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The hedgefund is called are Archegos, and the stocks affected are:    
US companies - $VIAC and $DISCO, Chinese companies - $VIPS, $BIDU, $TME"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When everything blows up, GME will go into play somehow."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing. A splash like this always creates ripples. If they hit the wrong boat (like any of the major holdings of maplelane Susquehanna citadel wolverin or Melvin) then this will trigger the meltdown.

If any of the investment banks affected by this explosio. Considers rising the margin for everyone of the funds they serve as prime brokerage, then we see another splash. If it is one of the ones Melvin is using, it could be meltdown.

Morgan Stanley is one of archegos' prime brokerages and also deals with melvin"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have nothing to do with GME, but the exact same day all their assets were sold GME took a 38% drop and no other stock did the same...  call me paranoid but that's some mystery then"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How about TME? It rhymes with GME and was part of the 10 billion sell off.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,well isnt citadel the clearinghouse for GS or something?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your right to doubt this is a normal liquidation. Between Dec 21 and March 12th, these dumped stocks changed:

IQ +65%

VIPS +63%

TME +45%

VIAC +150%

DISCA +146$

If that is a failing HF, they really screwed up elsewhere.

I will also say that GME dropped similarly the day prior to these being dumped (it was actually in AH). If you are curious, it was up +1064% over that time period.

Its possible that GME took them down.... ..... ...... ................................"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thinking this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's in the article. Archegos Capital got margin called and had their positions forcibly liquidated because they were way over leveraged.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the article

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The best gains are always at the very end but personally I don't think there's much room left to run. I'm slowly shifting away from the hot stocks and moving into the low PE DOW or NYSE boring companies. Once Biden hikes corporate tax rates is when the real correction will start.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I hate that term lol. ""Oversold"" doesn't mean ""undervalued."" It was just way overvalued before."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They don’t hold GME. They went belly up so now they sell. I didn’t recognize half of their holdings.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, they peaked like crazy on the five year lol.  Looks like ATH zooming out. Yeah fuck this piece of dogshit unless you really think people are going to jump on that streaming service.  Discovery’s peak was the bad touch as far as I’m concerned"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that GME has dulled our senses so much that 35% feels like a boring ass tbill return

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"i mean, we aint nothing but mamals"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery Channel fuk
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strongly disagree about Discovery. The most-watched tv shows on cable are on TLC (90-Day Fiance, etc.) and HGTV right now. Discovery owns both of those and about 30 other channels, and now the only way to watch them if you missed them on cable is if you pay for their brand new streaming service.

They already have 11 million subscribers and much of their content costs next to nothing to produce. That means super high margins. Right now DISCK has a p/e of under 20 and a forward p/e of \~10 with very solid opportunities for growth. Meanwhile, Netflix is losing subscribers and has a p/e of over 86, and Disney is not even profitable."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,By discovering things? Duh
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ads and subscriptions. Discovery plus is going to be a hit
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling ads
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, I saw the drop on a bunch of stocks, and wondered what the fuck was going on. Going to be yoloing into Tencent Music monday for sure. Free tendies."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, theorizing a buyout isn't my sort of play.  There's obviously upside there, I just don't want to bag hold and say ""there should be a buyout any day now"" as my bull thesis.  If I were to seriously consider picking up DISCA, it would be for the e-learning side, which I may have to look into more after seeing this.  [https://www.discoveryeducation.com/](https://www.discoveryeducation.com/)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the more I think about HGTV, the more Discovery+ seems freakin’ genius."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What he is saying is buy GME to hedge
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No no what he's saying is be ready to jump ship at any moment. Constantly be on edge because you'll never know what's coming. Pack that bag and hang half out the window ready to run! ^/s
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t. The tunnel is in the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cboe Skew Index is very high at the moment. This represents how big market players are preparing in event of a black swan event. Not the best indicator but it usually is very high before a downturn

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Figging so deep
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not going to let Melvin fail, just look at what happened in January. They margin called the Asian hedge fund because, well it's Asian. Wall Street is racist lol."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear that, any good articles on this and how to trade it?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously I was talking about the day that it took the market down 2%. You know, the one in the past that actually happened when hedge funds sold their long positions to fund short covering. 

A short squeeze on one relatively small stock should not be able to force a deleveraging across the entire market. The fact that it means that the market is inherently fragile and that the depth and liquidity of the market is not very good, all of which are not good signs."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at QQQ on the monthly
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,All time high maybe
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They might have deleveraged before missing the margin call.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sell calls when you think something is going down, you buy calls when you think it is going up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,sorry lol. viacom and discovery
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,$50 calls paid off well when VIAC hit $41 on Friday. If it goes back down then I would load up again. But I don't  think it'll drop to $30 or lower. The new price targets that many analysts are throwing out are at $58 and higher. $45-$55 should be a solid floor.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Peeps don't realize how interconnected a lot of these big banks and hedge funds are.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of the biggest mistakes I've seen on this sylub is the belief Melvin was ever a significant hedgefund and going ""after them"" was going after ""the man"" which is why people who were at $350-500 were surprised at how it dipped to the 50's so fast despite increasing volume. And who are also still holding.

 At least going after Citadel makes some sense, though everyone is doing it wrong."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">If they hit the wrong boat

Pun intended?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate on what you are taking away from this u/beateride
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Please confirm this strategy with an 8 ball!!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GS is the clearing house for Citadel. GS is the whale 🐳 while citadel is a 🎣
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A whole lot of things are possible, including algo and momentum strategies magnifying movements.

This sub is fixated on hedge funds. Everything bad is a hedge fund failing. Everything good is a hedge fund screwing you. Hedge funds are only a modest slice of the market and it sure as shit isn't Wall Street or any of the major etfs, mutual funds, and institutional money. For all we know this is the Saudi Sovereign fund raising cash since Aramco is getting drilled (pun intended).

Hell, hedge funds fail all the time. You just don't hear about 99% of them because they're private funds by definition and most are a lot smaller than this sub thinks they are. The street makes money off you if you win or lose. They're the ones that are really fucking you. But sure, it's the evil hedge funds that are the real enemy."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this man helped write the Hunt for Red October.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm afraid of using leverage too. There is always someone who has more leverage."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This begs the question of how many funds are overleveraged? Michael Burry did mention the ridiculous leverage in equities right now. Perhaps this is systemic breakdown being played out due to macro economic conditions?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That explain Goldman Sachs as well?

But I can't imagine actually *watching* it over streaming. Granted, I also don't pay for it and almost certainly wouldn't in its current state."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, although I’m not sure how well it will/won’t do. Personally, I think a lot of the other streaming services are better options and I don’t think CBS’s streaming service did too well.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not right.  Delisting and banning Chinese companies from certain investment accounts came from Trump.  The deal that allowed Chinese companies to list in the US without meeting accounting standards came from Obama/Biden.

I have long thought the path is set and there will be no substantive deviations from it regardless of who's in charge. I'm pretty sure the Pentagon are running the trade war strategy.

Occasionally well performing funds will go into liquidation if the head PM or founder is backing out. That's usually in the OM tbh. The only thing I can think of is a massive fraud is breaking and they are running for the hills while they still can. Nothing else makes sense for something that large and performing not terrible.

I do get that under collateralized margin could have a domino effect through the portfolio if called. But even that doesn't usually liquidate entire positions but rather enough of a portion to bring the positions in line.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done ape.. well done. Bananas all around 🍌🍌
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good old gme, it came out of nowhere in the form of a fucking rocket to the moon, hang tight apes."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello. It’s me. Since you are reading this it means I have made it to the ape kingdom. It has been a grueling few days, wading through the battlefields of karma, but I have made it. The streets aren’t paved entirely of bananas here, but it is as close as my eyes will ever see. At times my nose gathers whiffs of burnt ape hair and as much as I try and believe it isn’t true, apes have been burned here before, but none seem in dismay. Ever since I’ve arrived, I can tell the apes have found a way to prosper, a way to rebuild. I have made it to the front lines and I am here to stay mother. I am inexperienced and may not make my way back home, but please know, I did this for a better tomorrow for all apes. I wish Pappy Ape were still here to see this... this was his wish, to be here. Well, this is for him!

P.S. Jim Cramer doesn’t lick the lint between anyone’s toes but his own.

Humph! I am here to learn apes! I will not drag my feet or slow you down. I have been lurking in the shadows, trying to communicate with you all, but now I am past the gates and am here to serve! I have taken mother’s savings and currently have 12 @ 164. I was also able to average down last week. Other than averaging down, I’m not sure what else my ape brothers and sisters are talking about, but hopefully I’ll learn. Tendies for all, young and old!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,OMG that made me laugh!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at that little GME ape run!

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"MSNBC is political news and might mention it as part of coverage but CNBC is the network that is in bed with the hedges and doing everything they can to kill momentum behind GME.

Other than that (and the like 20 seconds of black screen at the end), loved it!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we make a thread where all of these meme trailers get sent to and voted on by all of the people on here? Top 30 get aired in every amc as trailers before the movie plays like the Alamo does with older films? Upvote this comment if you wanna see it happen 💎🦍🚀💯

This is actually loads better than some ""Please watch my reel"" crap which came across my desk like daily. 

and before anyone assumes a television producer is somehow ""cool and glamorous"", unless your name is Bruckheimer, Bochco, Murphy or Lorre, trust me, it ain't. lol"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is more like a retarded person who also happens to be a world class powerlifter
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No exit strategy. Nice.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Made it even better haha you belong here
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,To make you feel like less of a retard I only recently learned that GTFO is not Great Thanks For Organising and FML is not Forgot My Lunch.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love it! Post credits scene on a meme.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,made it to moon and back at light speed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciated the dead air. Really built up the suspense for the final reveal.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the video. I gave my free award
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh you cut it, dragged the extra to the right, got hungry, ate some crayons, came back to add that great music and then hit convert!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Could of made it paperhands missing the rocket.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Set your out points!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it. I was wondering what happened to the dude as he just dove under the bleachers at mach speed. It helped bring closure. Fuck, that to hurt."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That was the best bit 😂😭😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Where best place to buy gme
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i thought he actually did it on purpose until i saw his face in the last clip
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why be sorry you fit right in here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oi you’re a fucking smooth brained ape nobody’s perfect eh
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the black screen followed by the one second of them at the very end. Only very smooth brained people would stay to the very end.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess you like me bought at $350+
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it just simulates the weekend."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"well. i know most of us here are a bit retarded; but my guess is possibly OP - who said he did this. my DD is weak tho, and this isnt advice. i just like the stock."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did it, not gonna grab somebody's else meme and claim authorship, that's like extra retarded even for me."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time tell them it was intentional, or at least a happy accident.  The ridiculousness of the length made it better."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,All good fellow ape! Solid meme. Poor execution. You’ll get ‘em next time.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh god the things i laugh at

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😻😻😻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s the comment that saves OP.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I would give award but I am poor
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What's that?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme is only exit strategy:)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I lol'd
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I forgot my lunch today, FML"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"See, you DO belong here after all!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,wait.....FML is not Forgot MY Lunch??
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice DD
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This should become a trend, a little extra for the patience"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that sums it up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,*My dildo enters the chat*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the support, i appreciate it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Only apes saves apes
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,For now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Define poor. Like... Not much money? Or leveraged to negative ♾?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I never understood how people spend money on awards on reddit. Don't these people have food to buy? Or bills? Or more gme?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"wtf is an exit strategy, though?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Feed Me Lettuce?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The latter <3
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but we also have wives who have boyfriends with deep pockets."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont buy that but got plenty for change from alienblue to reddit app. I think I got free reddit premium for 3 years or something like that and each month got you some award currency
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer giving them cos I get too embarrassed if I ever get them
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe Google Rewards credit? I have about 15€ laying around that expire August and don't really know what to do with them. Even if it's free money, I still don't like the idea to pay for things in games hahahahaha 

(Also got youtube vanced, so no need to pay for youtube premium)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's when your wife's bf pulls out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buttery popcorn
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,BKFL
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohhhh. I see.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife’s bf never pulls out
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They literally walk around the house and do chores connected at the privates
2021-03-28 02:21:09,wallstreetbets,Every time you dip I buy more. I like the stock 🦍 🦧 
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had your money to buy more. I will keep buying my two or three shares at a time so I can act like I’m a big 🦍.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's ""the best available price"" mean? Market order??? Take the time do set a limit and you'll never get burned 👍"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you possess 30k but use market orders....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"$40,000 do far and you're broker have you a 🙂?? 

Transfer out of RH"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Get the fuck off robinhood you windowlicker
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off robinhood
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Commend the attrition but I sold what I had and moved 200+ shares to Fidelity. There was plenty of time to do so and it’s a strict cash account. I suggest the same
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Which broker is this? Is it a broker?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that's alot of K's, happy you like the stock!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time you buy GME, robinhood lends out those shares to shorts, because you don’t own the shares at robinhood. You’re working against yourself by letting robinhood use your money as their own leverage. Go to a new broker."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Whichever app this is sounds really cringy.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood bad. GME good. Ape confuse.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,screw robinhood
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tired of gme
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest is unprecedented. Why shouldn’t the returns be unprecedented? I’m holding GME for 7 figures.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,samsies
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"HOORAY


But for real oh oh ah ah!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put my hand upon your hip. When I dip, you dip, we dip."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Market orders on RH. True YOLO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"don't underestimate the power of retail jungle apes

they all have shit loads of bananas in the ape treasury box"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I dip, you dip, we dip?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Turn off instant settlement if you haven't! 💎👐🚀
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,assume this is robinhood with the emojis. fuck robinhood
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"biggest smoothest brain action I've seen so far.

&#x200B;

you no ape. you retard."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I dip, you dip, we dip 🚀🌕"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,good ape
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,MOASS IS HAPPENING. THEN.MARKET CRASH
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Market orders for high volatility stocks.. This is the way!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"on a scale of 1 to ""if i don't get out from behind this wendy's dumpster now i am NEVER going to get out from behind this wendy's dumpster"" how sore are your hands and throat?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody know about gamestop dividends?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you dip, I dip, we dip......"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this stock!!!!   40 shares and going strong!!  To the 🌙
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe if RH stops you from selling when the stock moons, you will learn... Or maybe not."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I only got 2. I call them one and the other million(mil for short)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,When will you retards learn to use limit orders
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time you buy via RH(and waiting squeeze) you are idiot
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol buying at market price.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please don't annihilate me, I am going to be straight up- I have a small a count with Edward Jones. I don't know a thing about any of this. Does anyone have the time to clue me in? Give me some tips? Should I get EJ to buy some GME? Please don't annihilate me, I am going to be straight up- I have a small a count with Edward Jones. I don't know a thing about any of this. Does anyone have the time to clue me in? Give me some tips? Should I get EJ to buy some GME? Or Blackberry? I don't have any money to fuck around with, it would be huge to my family and my savings if I had a small win! *edited to add Blackberry"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Big fucking balls fellow Ape!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THEE WAY!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It took me 24 hours each to transfer two separate batches of GME shares from Robinhood to Fidelity. I started the transfer last Monday. You won't miss the mooning if you do partial transfers.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,RH be like.... we still have enough idiots loving our app. Let the IPO continue .
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how all of these orders and screenshots are still from Robin Hood accounts. Way to follow through and stick it to the man
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quit buying market price, put in a limit"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you dip I dip we dip , I put my hand up on her hip 🍻"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad to see some apes still have iron balls, we are together with you all"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What broker is so unprofessionel, that they actually believe sending emojis is okay"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have like 500 dollars for the stock market and people here chucking out 25,000 like its nothing"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You still use Robinhood???  You realize there are much better options?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still on rh?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't come crying when robinhood takes your tendies.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is this and are you chatting with a bot that is doing a terrible impression of being a broker
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,RH.   Bro
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude has 5 grand and is using freaking Robinhood. What a joke. Even worse, he’s buying GME."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop using RH
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck rh
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice emoji-backed app, which is it?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck with robinhood when the squeeze happens
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya on that one, my savings of $1200 are in GME atm. Then i see these guys and im like ""the fuck.....""

Just sayin, if i had 20k or 30k to mess around with...... 

it would be in GME too 🤣"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,20k USD. Let’s go. All or broke.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hate to say it. But I have to keep working and buying GameStop until I can afford to retire. Wont be long now :)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It takes all of us. I’ve seen people post $50k buy orders. I’m in for $8k and I’m tapped out. But consider this. After the moonshot we will all have a lot more capital to invest. And that makes us even more dangerous to the establishment.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I went from 3k to almost 140k and I’m 21 from January and now I just put in 25k. There was a lot  money to be made if u joined wallstreetbets after October
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you. $2.5K here. 1K was my saving 1K loan from my parents and the other 500 was what I scraped together with what I could do without
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ditto
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here 😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same i had like 15 shares, Apes on here have like 1000 shares and more. LOL"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"After lockdowns got lifted I was horny af and spent $1000-$2000 of my fkn savings per week on stuff horny dudes do and by the time I learned about GME I was dead ass broke. Fortunately I had 2 full credit cards and emptied them all on $GME. As I was also newbie af, I quit my job too cause I thought we will have landed on the moon by now. Now I have to find another job to stay afloat till moon landing! 🤓🤪"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You start work of age, save, it's called discipline"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao me too bro. Our time of getting loads of shares at $40 is over. It’s the big ballers’ time now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"this my friend is what we call  ""dumb money"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s how retard make big green crayon on map
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He really is ape.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats wrong with market orders?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had the kind of disposable income to play 40k, hell I wish I could afford a KillTeam."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't assume it's disposable income, many people like me are putting life savings into this because of our confidence and all the signs that point to our favor"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So...I am also on RH still.  I basically aold all my other stuff on RH and bought on a separate broker, but GME?  I'm scared to sell there and buy elsewhere because of the volatility, and ai've heard the transfer takes so long that I could miss out on mooning.  Plus I have at least one partial share.  What do?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm on rh too
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately it's bitch boy Vlad's app
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What about Webull?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It‘s a virus... don‘t click on the link
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a dip next week
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not bro
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No kidding. If my broker texted me a smiley face I would gtfo so fucking fast lol.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I can't believe people are still using robinhood. What a joke.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Consider this, if everyone on this sub had $1200 worth of GME (well, closer to \~$1290), we'd have 100% of existing shares. GameStop would be owned by WSB. Of course some people can't buy any, others throw in a $100k, and some shares are already owned by the actual shareholders on the board. The way I see it, the shorts are already rekt, we just have to prove it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s always someone richer than us. For example that grandpa that went $900K yolo on $GME was freaking impressive.

And these dudes that post $100K-$500K loss porns like it’s nothing. 😂"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,$13k here! All or nothing.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stay real it's game stop not BRK.A
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME moons, rest of the market crashes, you can take your profits, keep 40% as cash to pay taxes, and flip the rest into [total market index funds](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/) that will be deeply discounted. [VTSAX](https://thepowerofthrift.com/thriftygals-money-strategy/) or FZROX (and maybe FNILX / FZILX) if you're with Fidelity. If you have at least [25 times](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/) your annual expenses invested, and the market bounces back, rather than going to zero in an end of modern society scenario, you will be set for the rest of your life."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,140k off 3k? what the hell did u buy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I've done retarded things in my life. However this is THE most retarded thing I've seen. You belong here"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Big risk brings great reward. You will struggle now like we all have before. But we made it this far. Who knows what the tide will bring tomorrow.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll help clear a lot of this shit up:


Why robinhood? Options with no fees. If you want to buy 1,000 OTM FDs, robinhood is legit the only place to do it. Will cost you a fortune anywhere else. For shares? There's no good reason to use robinhood, and it's honestly fucking stupid as robinhood has garbage fills. 

Why market orders? Why not? If you're talking about shares of a popular stock, the bid/ask spread is probably a penny. It really doesn't matter. Save your limit orders for low-liquidity shit with massive bid/ask spreads. I've been trading for a long-ass time, and I always use limit orders for options, market orders for shares. 

OP? Retarded. He thinks he bought the dip when he actually bought a stock immediately after it rallied from 120 to 180 in one fucking day. It's the exact opposite of a dip in the most extreme way, to the extent that it could be used as a textbook example of the exact fucking opposite of a dip.  I'm honestly fucking perplexed as to what led him to believe that 120 -> 180 = ""dip."" It's fucking perplexing.


Hope that helped."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also soon to be called ""Big Money"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing at all.  Pretentious people think the stock should come to the price you want.  But if you believe a stock will moon, buying at 0.3% higher price won’t matter"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Really don’t understand this. if you’re buying during the day it will be executed instantly so what’s the big deal?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You could put in an order and have it spike at that exact moment. This shit is volatile and on top of that it’s supposed to moon anytime now. Putting in a market order could have you buying at an insanely high price suddenly.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No bot?  Sad Bulgaria noises...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. I don't play with margin or with life savings, disposable income is what I play with on account of being so dumb that if I lose it then it won't ruin my life."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you really are going ""foodstamps or lambo"" then you truly are retarded."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh honey
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why this is so bad? Especially if you’re buying during trading hours?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,make a fidelity and buy a few shares as a back up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"partial transfer  
i) transfer all the whole shares, leaving behind the fractional share - partial transfers are faster than whole account and leaving behind the fractional share will also avoid slow downs

ii) ask fidelity to cover your 75$ fee, they will"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt the same way but my stocks including gme transferred over in 3 or 4 business days from RH to Fidelity for me.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer took 3 business days for me. (RH to Fidelity)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do not sell GME, only transfer. It's easy and fast to transfer to Fidelity. It took me 48 hours total. Afterwards, call Fidelity to take margin off your account."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who tf cares if they use emojis.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I won't tryandstopyoubro
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Trash.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV is on etrade I heard
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,dear god not again
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fortunately, it's not real, so that's a load of my mind."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This confirms my bias. I am a happy 🦍.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumbass here 

Wouldn’t it be better to represent this in # of shares owned per wsb degen?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"We already own the float, IMO. Perhaps even >100%"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Majority of sub count is non-traders here for the memes and loss porn. Participation rate much lower.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I won't give a number exactly, but I have at least 1200 worth, there's the possibility that retail owns a bunch of stock that may not actually exist, so retail is holding the right to sell a stock or more even if the actual share exists or not."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those guys arent just diamond hands, they're diamond balls too 🤣🤣"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need more burner accounts so you can upvote yourself more than once bruh... hahahah

Y'all make it way too easy"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you read the article or the original Trinity study? 4% comes from the fact that over many decades, 7% was a conservative average for market increases. Live off 4%, leave 3% in to cover inflation so that your savings grow with you. The Trinity study covered 30 years because that was the scope of the study. Here's a Tl;dr from that article to help you,

> This brings me to a critical point: this study defines “success” as not going broke during a 30-year test period. To people like you and me who will enjoy 60-year retirements, that would not be successful – we want our money to last much longer than 30 years.

> Luckily, the math in this case is pretty interesting: there is very little difference between a 30-year period, and an infinite year period, when determining how long your money will last. It’s much like a 30-year mortgage, where almost all of your payment is interest. Drop your payment by just $199 per month, and suddenly you’ve got a thousand-year mortgage that will literally take you 1000 years to pay off. Increase the payment by a few hundred, and you have a fifteen year payoff!

> In other words, **above 30 years, the length of your retirement barely affects the safe withdrawal rate calculations.**"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think it was just robinhood? You think there is an ethical reason to use a particular broker? Yet you call me ignorant? Lmao. 


You know who blocked the buying of gamestop? Everyone except fidelity. Literally every broker, except fidelity. And why didn't fidelity? Because they just happened to own a massive % of GME float by random happenstance, so they weren't at risk. If they didn't, they too would've blocked the buying of gamestop. If you think they wouldn't have, you're being naive.

None of these brokers are moral entities, they are all risk-averse for-profit corporations. Next time, maybe ameritrade will own a bunch of whatever meme stock is in fashion, and they will be the only ones to not block a stock.

You don't know what you're talking about. If you're using fidelity because you think they ""had your back"" or whatever, you're an idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. If they didn't just happen to own like 20% of gamestop due to random happenstance, they would've blocked it too.

If you think I'm gonna sit here and pay $300 in fees instead of $0 for a particular play, because ""fidelity had my back,"" well... I'm fucking not. Because they fucking didn't. No broker gives a shit about me, so I will make each play on whichever platform is the most beneficial to me. I'm looking after myself, not some massive corporation. And if you think you are some sort of hero because you choose to pay unnecessary fees to a bunch of rich fucks, then you're a fool.

There is no moral broker. They are all greedy assholes, and none of them give a single shit about you. Use whichever one has the best features and saves you the most money. Bottom line. That's why I buy options on robinhood, stocks on TDA, and have my retirement accounts on fidelity.

EDIT: and for the record:

>Especially when fidelity provides the exact same benefits as you said

No, they don't. Fidelity does not offer fee-free options trading. That's literally my entire point."

I’m saying you place a market order say two days ago, yeah maybe it’s fluctuating 176-178 and you place a market order maybe you buy at 178 but it’s not that big of a deal if you believe in the stock going up. But if you stop and place a limit order for 177 and it zooms to 200 you’re kinda fucked right? Then you have to go in and try a new limit order? So I’m just confused"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read both. It's a common misconception that the 4% applies to any retirement but it only applies to 30 year retirements. It's the difference between leaving an inheritance for your children and not doing so. One needs to define what ""barely affects"" means when one says 30 vs 60 years ""barely affects"" the calculation. It's absolutely critical to build context around that number, and to define what that 4% means to make a sound decision. People such as yourself throwing out 4% like it's a hard fact for everyone everywhere is nothing more than ignorance and in the case of the article you're quoting, willful deceit.

I disagree wholeheartedly with the article and I agree completely with the trinity study authors."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"But with the volatility of GameStop it just seems silly to think you’re getting the “best price” at that instant by setting a limit order when it’s gonna go way fuckin up or way fuckin down within the week, and if it goes way fuckin up after you set the limit order it won’t be executed and you have to buy in higher anyways"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It *is* money go bye. At least, not much more complex than that. Might as well mail Citadel a few hundred $ in the mail after every purchase.

Robin Hood, specifically Citadel with Robin Hood's permission (I'm not sure RH has a choice) rearranges the actual purchases behind the scenes. ""Market price"" orders are entirely too convent within that scheme.

They can unload unfortunate purchases on this person (who must be fake). They'll also do it with limit orders, but then you'll bend over just a little instead of all the way."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mail them money? You aren’t giving any to them, you’re buying shares at a slightly higher price than you’d prefer (to my understanding?). 

And if GameStop can go up 60% in a day or down 30%, for example, what difference is 0.03% of where you got in lol. 

The first sentence of your last paragraph meant no sense to me."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m up big so Id say pretty good so far, but I’m also not placing them as it soars upwards lmao"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"> slightly higher price than you’d prefer (to my understanding?). 

Or A LOT higher price. :)  You'll absolutely have no control over it. The fact that they use PFOF does involve giving it to them. 

Read up on RH's Payment for Order Flow, as that seems to be a gap in your understanding. Enjoy. 

Also, I allege that OP doesn't really exist and that these messages are fake, but that's besides the point."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bid ask of GME sometimes is off north of $3 a share. The spreads can be huge with GME right now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"looks like you’ve got 14 shares based on post history.  In the future when you’re moving 100x that, you’ll care a bit more about the limit vs market order"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Post history isn’t accurate anymore, have more than double but yeah it’s not 100s or 1000s. 

And maybe I would but again it seems silly at least in terms of GameStop to care about a couple cents on the share when it can move over $100 a day lmao, important thing would be to get in while it’s dipping not get in for an exact price you want then fuck it up and have to redo it and end up getting in higher because your limit never triggered, in my opinion. 

Clearly you see it differently, I don’t think it’s as big of a deal but whatever. Good luck make money this week 👍🏼"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A few thoughts on volatility drivers for UWMC...

ER is estimated to be in the last week of April. 

June should be the next dividend, which should bring some volume from the dividend hunters, especially if it is near it's current price or lower.

Biden Administration gets the mortgage down payment subsidization into action(or just announced it)

Pissing match with Quicken intensifies (real crapshoot on how this effects the stock)

I think there's likely a good play on call options in here. I'd favor the June options, myself unless I was just trying to make a quick buck. If you think it's about to start a reversal of it's downward trend, then any near or ITM should be profitable as long as you cash out quickly. Holding shorter dated options longer could result in a theta and IV crush if it trades sideways for a week. If it trades sideways for the week, the prices will come down with IV and give a better entry point for OTM calls."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,11...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a pretty sweet entry point. If you're getting cold feet on it, I bet you can sell for a small profit at some point on Monday. Of course with that cost basis, the annual dividend alone will be a 5% return and if you start selling the monthly $9 CC on it you might get another 3% return each month (assuming it stays in this range). That would net you a 41% return in total for a year of ownership. And if that CC gets assigned at some point it's close to a 15% return at that point(so almost 18% return total in 1 month). 

I know it's not as sexy as a 10 bagger, but outperforming the index consistently is still a win. There are a ton of ways to play that entry point for profit from where the market currently is. You could even sell a long deep in the money call if you wanted reduce your potential for loss and just ride the dividend until it get's assigned."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest is unprecedented. Why shouldn’t the returns be unprecedented. I’m holding for 7 figures
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"And this is why if you IPO, you are handing the keys to your companys future to the sociopaths at Goldman Sachs.  When the CEOs phone rings, and it's from Goldman, that phone gets answered.  And when the GS rep says you need to betray your customers, slit the throats of half your staff, or you're going bankrupt tomorrow, they make sure you are forced into a difficult position with zero good options.  If you're not willing to offer the growth on their investment they think is possible, they will dump your stock and put their money somewhere else."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk to me in smooth brain....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Man fuck Goldman Sachs. All my homies hate Goldman Sachs
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck 'em.

But the only dip im buying is FUBO. 

Fuck the other inflated boomer stocks and chinese fuckcompanys. I dont trust them any more than my fucking neighbors cat which is shitting on my lawn every day."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So I need more liquid to buy... got it!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,must have been an internal trading. How the hell did they know these stocks would sink on Friday?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,do I still buy puts on discovery or viacom
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So these people would rather pay money so people can't make money off stocks than actually gain income?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They know something is coming
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Rumour has it they're looking to buy a crypt0 exchange to move into that market. Wonder if this is related.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re freeing up capital to buy virtual currencies is my thought.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedgies shorting GameStop - it's not panic if you're the first out of the door. Better hope you're not the last ones holding your odious bag of excrement once the music stops...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Watching my dozen GME stonks burn down the financial world like....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,BIDU did tank 14 pct before recovering end of day on Friday
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dahmpeet.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,6.6 huh? Lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahaha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Normal adjustment.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s always such good information until some unironic retard claims it was related to GameStop somehow
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy the dip?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You remember the beginning of the big short? Mark Baum: “Let me ask you this: What company treats its customers that shittily and succeeds? Fine ok Goldman”
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it insider trading if the organization does it, not an individual within the organization? Serious question."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be a very 'them' move.  They know from their giant basket of fines that they're big enough that the government doesn't have the balls to ever fine them anywhere near close enough to make a trade unprofitable, no matter how blatant and illegal it gets."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You think they would be caught front running? That's pretty easy to prove.. Doubt it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There upside for the entire market as a whole but the Chinese companies could be screwed due the increasing political risk.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fk me if it is, because I been buying the dip🥺."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pre-Covid, Viacom was 40$. For no reason whatsoever, it shot up to 100, before falling down to 48. If I had to guess, VIACs true value is \~48 (I still aint buying tho, not my cup o tea).

Why you would consider 65$ a serious dip Idk; still seems overvalued to me. Do you know something about VIAC I dont? Looks like just another shitty boomer company. A year ago there was some good DD saying to buy VIAC (which I ignored) when it was at **24$** a share"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya love to see it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why this is good?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it’s let’s see what happens it’s not like there’s a float anyways
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/goldman-sachs-group

As of the end of 2020 Goldman Sachs owned over 920,000 shares of GME. They've made a fortune on GME so far. I'd guess them dumping shares during some of the squeezes caused those massive crashes right after."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe not directly. Does this have anything to do with DTCC new rule to keep DTCC posted on positions daily rather than monthly? DTCC demanding collateral earlier than anticipated can hurt over leveraged positions that might have paid out if allowed to play out longer.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You dont know that. Its entirely possible GS liquidating is actually what caused ACM to get margin called. GS acts as a clearing house for Citadel, and Citadel has a strong presence in HK. This IS connected, whether or not its correlated is a different question that we dont yet have the answer to. Also ACM got hit with 35 billion in margin calls, GS liquidated 10.5b."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The first thought I had when I found out about the stuck boat was that it was probably deliberate.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Stanley Hudson isnt so bad.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fax lol but it’s bad timing none the less...plus sus af
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So don't  short GS? Hmm I suppose it all depends on whether your average investor will understand the nuances of the issue or if this will impact confidence in GS.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything is connected, fellow ape. It's a matter of dots."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought more COVID = stocks go up? As evidenced by last year.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not. It looks like it's related to the possible delisting of Chinese stocks, and Chinese tech stocks are now in a bear market. Best guess is a fund balls deep in chinese stocks took a huge loss and got margin called."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,yes... gotta follow all the lines though... may be an escape hatch though

And it'd be super counter-productive. They're getting paid to sell this shit at good prices. You think they're going to drive prices down and make the deal worse for their clients, get paid less, and (again) get less business in the future?

They're greedy but they're not idiots. Usually."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd think you would have a better case for market manipulation than for insider trading, but even then you'd have to prove intent (which would be difficult).

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Any idea what the margin call was for?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for being a bit clueless, but why did they do this?

They made money selling the margin-called assets to a bunch of unsuspecting clients as OTC deals?

Does it look like they were pushed to this or they just saw the opportunity to not get screwed and took it?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There wasn’t a float *before* Redditors started buying it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sucks because I've been seeing a lot of posts of people not showing the ticker name of their positions and we're supposed to assume it's GME. We can hold gme and buy other stocks at the same timee

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad good DD is so difficult to find with all the GME GME GME going on...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you go deeper on point 2? Did they sell the shares to their clients? Of what?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Re #6: Wait I'm confused there. They ARE a bank, how does that saying work for them?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The market cap is below 20B, meanwhile NetFlix is 10 times that. With their new streaming service, they might be able to generate more than 1/10 the number of subscribers than NetFlix while the cost of generating the content has to be much cheaper."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely disagree. It's on sale right now because GSX and BIDU and other Chinese Tech stocks dropped and a firm got margin called and was forced to sell Discovery. DISCA/DISCK has the most-watched shows on cable television including 90 Day Fiance (& all of TLC), and all the HGTV home renovation shows (in addition to their nature stuff and the 30 other channels they own).

They already have 11mm subscribers to their new streaming service and their content costs close to nothing to produce. They are profitable and DISCK shares have a  P/E under 20. Compared to Netflix's P/E of 86 (and shrinking subscriber base) and Disney's... complete lack of profit DISCA/DISCK looks like a solid deal and is poised for some solid growth considering they literally just started their service."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,lol yeah who even watches that stuff?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have always been weary of Chinese stocks.  

That firm took down their website.  rip."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhh, yes. Just placed a buy order for Mondeeeee. 

What kind of dipping sauce do you guys like?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GS might not have but I'm sure some family & friends made out like bandits.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screwing the client is applauded amongst traders, the sales team deals with it"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure they made billions and the SEC will give them a paltry fine of $250k and tell them to behave.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea bud, the SEC is really stepping things up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">front running their own clients?

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be kidding right? They literally did all of those things.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"First time tracking Goldman? They never get sued for scamming, and if they do they profit mightily. I recall they scammed a country’s retirement fund and nobody went to jail and I think the fine wasn’t the millions."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what they want you to think.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just give another fund the heads up and let them do it with the understanding that they return the favour one day.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t tell if this is sarcasm or not
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the same company that insured their AAA rated packages to fail. And got 100c in the $ when it all went south. This absolutely is the sort of company that would do that

hahahahaha"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Shitydell was fined for front running recently.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"plenty of banks and financial institutions over the years have 100% fucked over their clients and it became wide spread on the news. Yet people still use them. They would see a dip, say ""we're sorry"" get a fine that amounts to a slap on the wrist and then do it all over again."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Usually being the operative word there loll

Who knows"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet they did. JP Morgan made billions spoofing orders in the silver market, and they got fined a tiny fraction of the profits they made.

I bet the same thing would happen to GS. They could profit 1 billion by doing that type of insider trading, and get fined 100 million. Net profit of $900 million."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They literally did this in 08 with mortgage backed securities. The ceo of Goldman looked real uncomfortable when senators were reading internal emails talking about the ""shitty deal"" they were selling their clients"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You miss 2008?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are kidding right? GS has been caught doing all kinds of illegal shit over the years. They have been fined billions of dollars... and yet they continue to do it. This means they make far more in profit doing it.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is there not intent when they buy puts before selling off these shares in a bunch that big? Are they going to say, well I just smelled my ~~loss~~ piss today and it smelled like puts?

Edit: slelling/autocorrection"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"At worst they'll pay few million $ in fines,cost of doing business."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This broke my heart
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is how it works. When these lunatics are fined or fuck up the tax slaves ALWAYS pay in some form or fashion. Either they pay through bailouts, increases fees, CPI increase, having their 401k's, pensions, etc raided, etc."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because it was off market, doesn’t mean it was to a Goldman client.  They can deal in large blocks anonymously (or not) with other large players.  And going off market to get the best price is in the best interest of the fund that got margin called, they get the best price for their stocks.  And they go off market to not move the price, because they had to move a lot of volume, otherwise creating downward pressure, for reasons not really relating to the underlying value of the assets needing to be liquidized.  Just because its “off market” doesnt mean its to their client.   It could be to their clients too though, and suspiciously timed puts, etc etc, so im fine with perpetuating the vampire squid meme.  Game on."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they weren't sold on the open market, why did the stock prices tank?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Goldman sold it to whoever wanted to buy. hedge funds, other market makers etc get no sympathy from me. They would turn around and do the same to goldman or rest of the world without any hesitation."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably the usual thing people get margin called for; borrowing lots of money and losing it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Likely that many Chinese stocks tumbled over the past month after revelations about shoddy bookkeeping and fears of delistings. Check out BIDU, down almost 40% from the last month. And:

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. I sold half high and left the other ones open to see how it plays on Monday
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. they package shares into blocks, it's usually worth anywhere from $100mil to $400mil per block, depending how many shares they include, then send it to the trading floor, guys in the trading floor pick up their phones and start dialing pension funds, hedge funds, investment banks, etc and start offloading it. Usually someone they already know, not cold calling, so, clients. If they want it gone fast they can offer a discount of say 2% or 3% from the spot price and for a client it looks like a good deal, until they realize they're dumping this thing hard and the actual price is going to be 50% or 75% lower."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That's like reddit asking why The Weather Channel exists. It wouldn't if it wasn't for it being on all day in elderly households and old folks homes.

... you can't  do that with medicine.  It's literally a life and death situation (except for cosmetic ofc), so as long as that GS  question exists: ""Is curing patients a sustainable business model?"", private medicine is fundamentally immoral to me."

... Or something like that. It's so easy to BS your way out of that one that no one is going to bother pursuing it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There was definitely intent. The thing is the court can't prove it. That's how rich people rig the system and get away with crimes.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all supply and demand in the end. When supply > demand price go down. Not selling on open doesn't mean the extra supply doesn't exist, it just introduces a delay in price change."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the people buying it off the open market no longer needed to place orders ON the open market to buy the stocks. It decreased the demand from these large buyers. Some of them may have even sold some on the open market as well.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GS weren't selling for a lower price than the market price, what incentive would there be to buy a set quantity from GS? Why not pay the same price on the open market for however many or few share you want, or not buy at all (which is the most likely thing that would have happened)?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I was hoping it could’ve been amc/gme. Start the rush to the exit!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. I made like 4k doing this and then lost it because I fucked up my timing.  Really wish I was still holding on to my 80$ shares from January I literally cringe thinking about how I didn't take profits when it hit 480$
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s how I look at it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Already banked big gains on VIAC and BIDU. Hoping calls drop a bit lower for IQ and GSX, otherwise just filling up on shares."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,people have been buying huge blocks of VIAC puts for weeks. Its been squeezing and finally broke after the company did a $1B convert and $2B stock offering earlier in the week.  This person shouldnt spread misinformation like this its not helpful and just highlights how little they know about whats been going on in the stock
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought puts and sold calls in $VIAC because it clearly went stratospheric. Then I  got in long yesterday. Nothing to do with insider trading lol. Just common sense/a gamble.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,nothing is beyond the pale anymore. You people are fighting the old battle; its open season now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've always thought fines should be a set % of income
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They allegedly stole/scammed 4.5b and paid 2.9b and change. Sounds quite lucrative to me. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/goldman-sachs-to-pay-3-billion-fine-foreign-bribes-1mdb-probe/
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit that was good!

Will you be my lawyer the next time shit goes down?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So that means you can only prove intent if there's like an email from an exec to a trader or what?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They'd have sold for less than the price at the start of the day, but a lot more than they would have had GS (or whoever) just sent out market-order sales. Lining up buyers mitigated the price impact but didn't eliminate it.

WRT the CBS shit the price impact was probably unavoidable though. The selling fund could probably take some credit for driving the price up to those levels in the first place, and no surprises it came down when they unwound."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,hm...hopefully the delay hasn't been fully played out yet and the stock continues to dip next week
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,because by buying a large position on the open market you'll cause an instant price rise and end up paying way more than you would have otherwise.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,And sharks are fish.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a movie about a similar situation, it's called ""Margin Call"". The movie takes place in 2008 and the blocks are mortgage bonds. Check it out if you have some free hands on your hands."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"2000, 2008, etc.

Clients will keep coming in. Everyone wants more money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Slice it how you wish. People can make money being bears or bulls. Only 0.000000001% of people make money on 30-40% OTM weeklies.

It smells like dogshit to me that this guy bought over 4,000 contracts at ~$0.48 each on a whim. Yeah, it was over extended, and yeah, WSB isn't the entire market, but I figure a play that colossally stupid would be posted up here. Forty eight cents. With that IV? Theta was in free fall against those puts. I'm having to flub a lot of math because my dumbass can't figure out how to get pricing data off historical chains, but I'm gonna plant that in the 5-10 DTE range on purchase. 

Three month bull run and this guy hops in hours before it goes -50%. I'm standing firm on my dogshit call. If he just yoloed and it hit? Congrats and fuck him.

I'm skeptical that someone with $200k to lose on a play like that would be using Robinhood but what the fuck do I know. My dumbass buys options with >90DTE and sells under 30DTE."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So do you think WSB shining a spotlight on fuckery changing the way this all works behind the scenes?

A part of me thinks they are realizing their dirty laundry is being more freely aired now more than ever, that millions of eyes are watching every move. One (or ten) reddit post(s) later and it could blow up on the national front."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The question is how much. If they’re getting caught 10% of the time, a 50% fine would only reduce their profits by 5%. I think 100% forfeiture of profits at a minimum plus an additional fine relative to their damage to the market."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even that wouldnt fix it. 10% of a poor person’s income is way more vital than 10% of a millionaire/billionaire.

If you take 10% of someone who makes 10,000, they lose way more in quality of life than if you take 10% from someone who makes 10,000,000."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They got fined 2.9b for moving around 4.5b that was stolen by third parties. It's all in that article, they weren't the ones getting the 4.5b."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, read it how you want I guess. I see it as a few employees going rogue and costing the company a lot of money, you see it as business as usual and *making* the company some money. I think Goldman front-running on this deal is unlikely, and you think it's likely.

So we should bet, right? Between now and this time next year, if you link to a WSJ article in which the SEC accuses Goldman of front-running this deal, I'll adopt a gorilla in your name. If in that time you *don't* find such an article, I hope you'll do the reverse."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. These people are professionals at getting away with financial crimes.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the difference between skimming and scamming. And everyone in the organization knows it, so they never ever have to write an email. They just get rid of you for *not* doing it when you had the chance. If you can bake an extra fee into the transaction and make the company money, you will get a promotion. They have a million little psychotic minds trying to figure out how to take little bits here and there without having to disclose it. Fuck you if you are not on the take."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a new investor, I thank you for your breakdown in smooth brain terms"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">I'm skeptical that someone with $200k to lose on a play like that would be using Robinhood but what the fuck do I know.

You're skeptical he would be using Robinhood with that amount of cash, but you also think that this dude is well connected and has some insider information and also trades on robinhood?  


Seems legit."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It has blown up; nobody cares nothing happens. The emperor (govt. & society) have no clothes; all their threats are empty
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's far from.perfect but better than what we have now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I don’t think Goldman was frontrunning it, I was merely saying how funny it would be if they did do it. From a moral perspective, I heard that their employees are leaving them in droves, and I’m personally wondering why. As far as front running articles, it would take years if not a decade+ to find out if they did any frontrunning as the SEC would be buried in paperwork. The SEC may be a big entity, but they are nothing compared to how many attorneys Goldman can afford to hire. I believe the term is “drowning in paperwork.”"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll take the bet just to see one of our family get adopted. You’ll have to remind me though, my memory is awful."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You look at Wells Fargo and TD scandals - those were comparatively people earning minimum wage that felt obligated to scan people to keep their jobs. Those banks didn't say scam people, but it's obvious that the employment metrics could only be met by scamming people - they didn't have to say it overtly.
At Goldman, you have a bunch of coke heads earning better part of 7 figures salaries and you're telling me you think they'll take the moral high ground?
Maybe they'll do something more subtle, less blatant, but they're definitely putting that Insider info to excellent use for the sake of meeting/exceeding the next quarters metrics."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you both should adopt gorillas cuz they’re cute and endangered.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I agree it'd be funny.

For anyone else in the thread who wants in on the bet, I'm only taking one gorilla but the burden is only ""accusation"" not proof :-). With all the posts telling me I'm being naive (and all the gorilla love in the sub) I'll be disappointed if I don't get one taker."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I’m trying to save money to contribute a small desalinizating water producer for people somewhere in Africa, clean up the plastic islands, clean and recycle plastic from the rivers of plastic in Asia, and someday I hope to contribute money towards fighting corruption internationally(people preventing third world countries from developing)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Find a better bet to bet donations on. Personally, I plan on making contributions based on my personal civil beliefs, and not that of a community on the internet. This sub has contributed a lot to me and taught me how to open my perspectives,  but at the same time I’m not trying to get caught up in mob mentality. Imo if you think you’re rich and  have enough money to worry about taxes, you likely have enough money to set up your own NPO so you can do your own philanthropic work while ensuring the funds aren’t abused by the execs in those NPOs(gorilla fund is likely okay, but look into the fraud related to some other NPOs)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"We get AMC to $1000 and I’m adopting a gorilla, I’d do it now but all my free money tied up at the moment lol 😁"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s dope. Great ambitions.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t really consider it ambitious. It wouldn’t take much to do any of that, and making contributions to your own NPO is the rich way of evading taxes while doing charitable work and getting credit for it. Even contributing $500 a year to your own NPO might go a long way in the long haul, and you might even be able to pull donors who believe in your mission as much as you do and contribute time or money. Always try to achieve your dreams no matter how big or small. Remember, “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” The saying can be applied in more ways than one, and I believe the stock market providers that kind of opportunity if you can make sense of the trends."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest is unprecedented. Why shouldn’t the returns be unprecedented? I’m holding for 7 figures.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh we’re posting micropositions now?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only people who made money swing trading were people who were scared that X was as high as gme would go, then got back in at lets say 120$ or whatever below their sell price.

I daytraded to get my average down 1-2$ at a time or more if lucky, then missed the rocket and averaged up 10$ so now i just don't bother. Fuck you, I'm in it to make a profit, but yeah, daytrading is the one surefire way to have losses on a stock that only goes up (doesn't have to be gme)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop fucking swing trading if you're really trying to help the cause. In addition to buttfucking yourself, every time you sell your shares to make that $10/share you're allowing a shorting hedge fund shares to close their positions. 

I can tell you're extra retarded b/c you're using Robbinhood but it's never too late to educate yourself and find a real broker."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Now hold

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Normally I'd agree, but now that Cramer said, I don't know anymore."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i was at ej also.... Fidelity is a step up. i do not regret transferring. they also have a great training videos. worth a look.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The ghost of Adam Smith throws up in a his mouth a little bit every time he visits this sub.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Is
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you do a full transfer only RH is frozen.

If you have money in fidelity you can buy / sell all you want while the RH transfer comes in"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you do a partial transfer, only the securities you are transferring will be frozen and they'll only be frozen in the Robinhood account. At least that was my experience."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I just recently transferred all my $GME and more to Fidelity, leaving I think Chargepoint on RH, and my Robinhood app was completely normal all from the day I made the transfer up until like 5 days when I woke up and almost shit myself seeing my RH app empty, but then saw it all in Fidelity. Was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Glad I got it done last week/the week before when I did."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"call fidelity and ask them yourself, then you will know.  

fidelity: (800) 343-3548"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's obvious that you weren't burned by Robinhood then.  Fidelity's fees and commissions often amount to around $0.70 each option, a little more than TD Ameritrade, whereas RH charges $0.02 so it's a matter of principle.  Robinhood's fuckery in January cost GME holders a lot of money.  I watched helplessly as they froze AMC trading and my options lost about 75% in a few minutes.  That right there overshadows all my savings from RH options trading."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well for one thing Fidelity never halted the the buying of GME like TD Ameritrade, The Sheriff of Nottingham (Robinhood), Webull, Charles Swabb etc. But GME aside, Robinhood is notorious for having outages at worst times which have caused their customers TONS of money, this isn't their first blunder. Also they were somewhat recently fined for not properly disclosing to their customers that they make money  via payment for order flow to market makers like Citadel (or something like that).

That being said, the Robinhood UI is the smoothest and most pleasant trading experience I've personally ever had. I'll probably still use them for some trading activities post squeeze but not for significant holdings.

An important factor to remember is that although Robinhood  is a household name, they're far from a big boy broker. They have around $20 Billion under management, whereas Fidelity has about $5 Trillion under management. If the DTCC raises deposit requirements Fidelity just pulls the money out and slaps it on the table like pocket change.

In my own personal experience it's like pulling teeth trying to get robinhood to respond to support requests, but I've never once been unable to contact Fidelity in a reasonable amount of time during business hours, and don't even get me started on the great customer service. I sleep soundly knowing my GME shares are in good hands.

The only downside to Fidelity is their UI is pretty garbage and has an annoying learning curve. Even so, I trust that the ""sell"" and ""buy"" buttons will always work like they should.

Take it all with a grain of salt like anything else, I'm just an ape that started taking trading seriously within the last 6 months."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe Fidelity is their own clearinghouse, meaning they don’t listen to anyone else. Where RH was pretty much told to stop trading because it was costing big hedgies lots of money. Fidelity don’t care about the hedgies since they don’t take direct investments from them. They aren’t going to screw you over just because someone tells them to in order to save them money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Where you been?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just wake up from a coma?  Robinhood is the antichrist.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It took 5 business days for me. I had the same fear that you do but then I remembered that the squeeze will likely last several days. Also its better to take your chances with transferring than trusting robinhood to execute your trades during the squeeze, I'm very confident they're going to screw people over as usual."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They are cheaper in places where they don't get used much
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find it so annoying how an obvious joke became WSB boilerplate in the memestonk era.

The **only** people who would have to disclaim liability like that are licensed professionals and those disclaimers do jack shit; they're just words, the actual unethical conduct is what matters, as DFV will surely find out in the coming months."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I just like the stock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Today I learned I was a skilled investor for the last month. I averaged up and had to put more money in to get back to my original shares. Realized I'm too smooth brained and now I HODL.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In theory Charlize could be my wife and Margot Robbie would be my side piece.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis is all about luck. Some people are just born with it. Then there are people like me who are cursed and no amount of DD or tech analysis will save me from the stock doing the exact opposite of when I sell or buy. No matter the stock.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is difficult to predict with technical analysis though
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is not a crystal ball.  Otherwise, some genius out there would be a trillionaire purely by day trading."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't need technical analysis for that... you can just yolo-it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They could do this with any stock in hindsight. Are you 10?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats also the exact opposite of buying and holding.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bigger chance off getting synth/naked/ IOU shares that cant b used to cover. As far as iknow
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">Someday itll pay off pretty big

Or you'll hold and keep buying the next big selloff that never comes back up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the general thesis around this is that everyone holding is what will help this thing gain traction. Why help them for pennies on the dollar?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had to bail tbh... when young high school age teenagers start coming up to you at work talking about yoloing their check on it, that’s what we refer to as dip 30"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Average intelligence?

C'mon son..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Drunk trading is the way. Buy the shares and forget you have them the next day
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't know who is on the other side of the sale, but selling at anytime 'could' help a HF cover for that one share. That is why they try to drop the market, trigger people's stop losses, so they sell at the stop loss price and HF scoop up cheap shares to cover.

If we could get a united front of no day traders, no sellers, only buy and hold, the squeeze would happen faster in theory."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,THE
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sparta
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good idea, thanks for the number!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"RH's fuckery caused so much drop on all my options. Absolutely infuriated that they are still allowed to continue to operate. 

NOK is a ""hard to find"" stock? Excuse me? LMAO"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This right here, if you were going to ride in an airplane wouldn’t you want to go with the one with the stellar record or the one that looks cool but crashed and burned several times."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man,I find it un fucking believable that after all the fuckery of RH people are stil using the GUI as an argument to stay. What the hell makes this Vaseline UI so important ? It is the gateway to your narrow assholes."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,When did TD Ameritrade halt buying? When RH did I went on TD and bought more shares instantly. Maybe I just missed the window where they closed it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity also makes it way easier to get in and out of trades, with much better order fills"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"But Robinhood stopping buys screwed everyone not just Robinhood users. Unless everyone moves out of Robinhood it won’t matter what brokerage you’re in, it will happen again if they stop buying."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You just made me so fucking hard when you said $5 Trillion under management. So happy my transfers got completed last week.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,fmr is also one of the biggest if not the biggest institutional long holder of gme stock :) fmr is their institutional side
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good point, actually. Hopefully I get the email saying it's been set up soon."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you swing trade for example half your shares and only when it starts going down from a + side why is it a bad idea?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You should diversify that portfolio
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Luck doesn't exist. If you fail everytime it means you don't have the skills yet, not that you're unlucky."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My friend I believe it’s more emotional than intellectual. It’s human nature to sell when we’re down to avoid further losses because our more risk averse and ancestors survived more than the risk loving ones, because there was so much uncertainty in the world. It’s like how we have a reflex to look away when something comes toward our face to protect our eyes, but a trained boxer can keep eyes on the opponent while being punched in the face. If you let the risk aversion natural bias creep into your decision making even just a little, you will hurt your gains. On the other hand if you hold stocks to bankruptcy you’ll lose all your money so idk bro. It’s hard. But stocks always go up and down, if you always wait you’re losing to sell then you will cut your gains at best or lose money at worst"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's way too volatile and manipulated, whoever manages to time a peak is a lucky man, nothing more."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"False.  Day trading has actual ceiling (albeit very high), but eventually your trades are so large the orders won’t close and or will move the market. Thus, you would have to find multiple technical trades simultaneously (not possible) or hire other trades (become a company)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,found resistance at 40. Found resistance at 113... With each successive market manipulation Shitadels tactics get weaker and weaker.. They NEED to drive the price down to $5-15 JUST TO COVER
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay melvin. Spoken like a true retard who has no idea what the company is fundamentally capable of. They just got an analyst upgrade to $175 and people are starting to realize what GME is capable of with the ecommerce transition. Meanwhile this is what we've been saying the entire time.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I trade, my goal is to make consistent daily profits. If you have other goals, that’s your prerogative"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you see what happened from 340$ to 170$ last weeks? Our holding will do little to help bring that closer. If I can daytrade myself to make smaller profits (i've made 10% daytrading on friday alone), it means I can buy more shares from my initial input, making me more money, and as a side bonus bringing the squeeze closer.

That's my thesis and I've seen no good counterargument against it yet. If the short interest is well over several hundred % as people proclaim here, why wouldn't I just as well ride the waves, netting me more shares in the long run?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The retard's dilemma: do I make money investing the stock market, or do I play an asinine conspiracy theory game with internet culture war apes who think they're fighting some kind of imaginary battle against billionaires?

What's a retard to do?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't need some pep talk from a dude who's been here a month and literally only speaks about GME.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,SPARTA
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,WAY
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omfg, I totally forgot that detail of not being able to look up BANG stocks unless you had the direct URL. Holy shit you're right that the manipulation is more than just liquidity."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brokers are boring and all about making serious money. So UI is really the only way you can stand out and you're suddenly better than all the boring old guys who make money surely and steadily but didn't bother with the fancy bells and whistles.

Now the thing about Robin Hood is that they failed on the under the hood stuff. The boring boomer money changing hands side. They halted trading. They have no customer support. They had liquidity/money problems they passed on to you. They have conflicts of interest. The CEO personally has conflicts of interest and saved his personal net worth at the cost of ""customers"". There are lawsuits. Allegations of CFD shenanigans. Basically things that are problems even if the only way to use them to trade was by going to their office with a suitcase of money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty shit excuse unless that app is the ONLY DD someone is doing. The moment you are using other sources the smooth app doesn't matter. 

My broker's(WealthSimple) app feels like 💩 but idc, it works and all the information I want I just get from TradingView"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s like , well , in principal I don’t like the desert eagle to lay around for grasps for my children , but I find it such a beautiful piece I lay it besides the children’s switch in the living room with a silver bullet next to it for my viewing pleasure."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not everyone halted buys at the same time and to the same extent.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"&#x200B;

i have a couple long puts on 0.50 in 2022 i bought as a hedge in case of being decimated by boomer nuclear option #598475983473847534783090 at the beginning ,forgot about them, for the last couple weeks  TD has 

&#x200B;

\#1- claimed they don't exist beyond the  hovering info panel

&#x200B;

\#2-most honest- flatly said 'no' and that they refused to sell my options, and call this number if you have a problem with this, when i found i could start the order some convoluted way with an old link and the symbol for the specific option.

&#x200B;

\#3-since, they show up in my portfolio, insult me , by existing and even being worth a whopping $17 at peak never to see again value lol

meanwhile at a nother broker, i find some disturbing patterns and pseudorandom errors reversing their stuff, and leave a message or a half dozen politely for the ceo and most of the board via office and cell. silly things like multiple indicators that accounts trading gamestop were targetted for pseudo random errors etc in everything from internal transfers to the market data being fucked with to tws delivering bsods and firewalls denying access at peak trading volume while institutions still had access...and their written response refuted none of it completely and added more concern by documenting an option to force a specific location that could be used to get around the restriction from the firewall if this happened again. so this is the link that would have dodged some ""random"" deauths and errors apparently, specificaly its the ip2loc parameter

 [https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?RL=1&ip2loc=off](https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?RL=1&ip2loc=off)

&#x200B;

wonder who would have already had that, i got it after being contacted via phone by the office of the CEO and a man who is apparently where the buck stops for the entire platform in addition to being the 'upper management liasion' per resume. i think i was right about at least a thing or two. beware on any platform short of vanguard. they're doing the same shit this time they just aren't boasting about it. TDA still though, is posting a 'list' , on which GME is the sole member. look it up.

&#x200B;

also mirroring the daily shortdata and consollidated shortdata at [ftp://ftp.virus.delivery/pub](ftp://ftp.virus.delivery/pub) and adding other shortdata i am finding as i find it, ibkr has a site i'm mirroring next with several sources it seems. the data on my ftp there now is from the source and goes back to 2009,every day, short, short exempt, and total volume. they dont charge for it;) but i always forget where they keep it. personally all the DD i require is personally being aware of the level of ongoing concern this has shown at the top as i now have personally witnessed. although i know what a cornered animal does and i suffer no illusions about the direction we're going. this will be a brutal fight yet and they are fighting for their existence, and i feel just the same. lol they can take my gme by paying the price, or they'll have to pry it from my iced out dead hands"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the fear is that RH won't allow you to sell or will have some sort of outage during the real short squeeze.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The more people stop using robinhood the less it will screw other people if rh fucks up again. Even during halts the price was very volatile, you could buy low and sell high in the few day period before it dumped completely. Basically doens't matter if everyone got screwed or how much, the people who can't buy are worse, even if you don't want to buy, you want to be able to buy."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's a bad idea for you to try to manage *any* of your own money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is actually true for the most part… unsure why it was downvoted. Extremely successful day traders, the one who make ten of millions, and yes they exist, have liquidity problems. It’s hard to buy, say, 100k shares of GME at a given price. So they have to purposefully downsize kinda like you said. Even if they know a trade is gonna 10x they can’t really buy $10m of stock and let it happen… just not possible. So, you’re right. Other retard is retard."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I know why this was downvoted. How dare you bring reason and facts into this discussion
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Who ever downvoted this should reverse their vote
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now you believe in analyst upgrades?

Funny enough once the analysts conceded on TSLA and raised those price targets the bubble finally started popping."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh 'if you ain't from my hood you can get from round here' - Project Pat
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, the unpopular opinion of trying to make money on wall street bets."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you, downvoted guy. Here for financial freedom above all else. Swing, scalp, hodl, short... what ever works"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  It's fucking hilarious that you're downvoted for being a normal, rational investor instead of a Qanon memestonk retard.

Man this sub has gone to shit."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are people downvoting you? WSB really doesn't like people making money huh. I guess they are made they are down 40% on GME.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,you greedy bitch.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Swing trading and adding to your position is the way...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm already wearing my bicycle helmet and Ryan Cohen molded strap-on, so I guess I'll take the imaginary battle against billionaires."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I don't care about GME movement, I just want money"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Horse
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker is my swedish bank. Only closing price price updates. No market orders. No bells nor whistles at all. I watch yahoo finance on the second monitor and put in limit orders when i want, that's basically it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Except a desert eagle works when you need it to.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Did they limit the number of shares you could own and keep buying or straight up halt all buying?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""whoopies, too many people log on app no work"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i was thinking that when you do that only if you sell at profit and promiss yourself to not buy again unless the price drops  then you basically lower your average price for shares while increasing the amount of shares.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess we'll have to wait and see. Buy puts and show me your positions and then we'll talk.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the downvotes are not because of trying to take profits, everyone wants that, I think they come from the fact he's not understanding the larger play."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well we are free to vote as we like
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB is now some hivemind commie land.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers 🍻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,*I'm a pirate and pirates don't pick teams*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,he's right you know
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,you're getting gaped open monday my guy this has 100-125 bottom all over it before it gets better
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tits
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good pointT *name checks out
Edit: respect the autism"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But then you have even more shitty joke stonks...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already made some money on GME puts, right now the risk/reward isn't the best. It looks like it could dip to \~100-120 next week, but it will definitely keep bouncing as people here light their money on fire."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand the “larger play,” as you call it. I’m reframing it in a way that draws out its absurdity from the standpoint of making money. That’s why I’m being downvoted."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just cackle every time I see a tankie here talking shit about capitalism while trying to get rich quick on memestonks...what the fuck, man?  We had tankies when I was a kid too, but they made their own clothes, ate nothing but beans & rice, and lived with 30 other people in shitty coops.

Commies these days are such capitalist scum..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,these major swings wouldn't be happening if the majority of us weren't holding. Ya retard.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,PointT*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aha well  while waiting it moons. How I see it is the investment I put is lost. So i divide it into two. Half is used to average down whenever it goes down and the other half stay untouched. I only have 19 shares so that's what I will do on Monday. Sadly my current avg is 200 so I have to wait it goes above 210 or so and then sell and hope it goes down  to go back up again. 

That's my strategy now it may fail miserably if it never goes back to 200 but then it goes to rule one : my investment is already lost"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree it will bounce around in the short term and I'm not stupid enough to buy calls, so I'm holding my shares at $45 avg. In the long term if Cohen does what he's said he plans and they complete the ecommerce transition I can see it hitting $500+ easily in a few years."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You think holding for orders of magnitude return on investment is a bad strategy for making money?... in that case I'd say your viewpoint is absurd rather than the other way around...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"it doesn't matter if the trader's goal is anti-hedge activism by way of hoarding shares away from the shorts in order to inflict maximum damage to them, or if they just want to maximize the volume and appreciation of their own holdings: the ladder attacks will continue as long as *those who know and who are known* can afford to stage them. 

It takes a very small group acting in concert to temporarily fuck up the spot chart. The volume chart says regular apes are is still holding. I'm not kidding myself that our actions have much influence on what the whales do to each other. If you can pick up shares in a dip, you should do it. If you don't have any other cash or securities left, the only way to continue accumulating shares is to swing them. The end goal is still to get more of them into the hands of apes, although of course it is riskier, it is in the general interest."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if it just returns to the $4/share price it was trading at for most of last year, before all this memestonk stupidity took off?

Do you retards ever think about that scenario?  It's by far the most likely scenario, you know..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So far I’ve made money every time it’s gone on a run. I’m not worried about not making money on your hypothetical order of magnitude return on investment. The difference is that I’ve been taking profits along the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In this case you can always put the sell limit to half your avg so in my case i didn't lose too much.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you say hypothetical explains everything. You don't understand the larger play.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL!  You retards are so fucked.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"We’re playing different games. I’m not an investor, I’m a day trader. Bottom line though, the difference between you and me is that I am fundamentally skeptical about my or anyone else’s ability to predict the future, so I focus on realizing profits wherever the opportunity presents itself. I am skeptical about the possibility of the GME short squeeze even being allowed to play out by the political powers that be, given the potential consequences for the rest of the global economy. Maybe you’ll be proven right though. In any case, good luck."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It is always a gamble nothing is ever sure when you are trading stocks. Especially volatile ones.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I respect your skepticism but not, with all other due respect, your hipocrisy...

If you are skeptical about predicting the future you should be equally skeptical of your own ability to identify ""the dip"" and ""the peak"".

I'm a ""buy low"", ""sell high"" trader myself, but GME is a different animal... It's volatility is off the scale... For a good reason..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't need a memestonk retard to explain to me how investing works.  

It doesn't matter anyway, because soon enough, none of us will be able to amateur trade, after you fuckheads got scammed and continue to double down on your childish internet stupidity.

Get fucked, retard."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your pretty hostile. Sounds like you just had some puts expire worthless.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  Yes, the entire world revolves around you and your retarded memestonks.  I'm just bitter and jealous, but also I'm a paid secret agent sent by the billionaires, so of course that's the *real* reason I criticize you retards.

I wish I didn't know that any of your useless fucks existed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep throwing your money on weekly puts and eventually one will expire ITM. 

They can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or I could just steer clear of memestonk retardation all together.

There *are* other stocks, as it turns out."

The new 3 trillion infrastructure plan will be unveiled in Pittsburgh next week, which is music to the ears of American steel companies. Since taxpayer money is the piggy bank for this endeavor and, if you know anything about government contracting, you would know that the “Buy American Act” is serious business. It pretty much means that taxpayer money of this scale must be used to benefit reliable American industry/workers such as Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)

CLF has been on a buying frenzy these last few years, with its most notable purchase of ArcelorMittal USA and its subsidiaries in December 2020. This has allowed for CLF to cement its place as the largest vertically integrated, flat rolled steel producer in N. America. Another huge plus for all that infrastructure money coming down the pipe.

This is where Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) might just jump off the chart. As boring as steel is, it's everywhere, we need it, America is literally built on the stuff. With everyone chasing SPACs and other highflyer tech companies it's often the ones left behind that surprise us the most, and this could be that golden goose that finally gets your wife's pesky BF out of the house. After all the cyclical market is said to be the new investing landscape.

Steel is also the type of commodity where, if its supply chain or one of the underlying components (coal, iron ore, oil, labor, etc.) rises, the end result will lead to a rise in unit cost which also equals $$$ in the pocket of share holders. Further, the vertically integrated structure of the company this only helps increase profit margins.

In 2020 alone, CLF increased its work force from 2.4k to 25k according to ""Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) - Share price, News & Analysis - Simply Wall St"". This company is clearly ramping up for something big and it's definitely not bankruptcy. All signs indicate that with the right investment you could buy your very own Wendy’s, and the best part is the option prices are still low. Very low as a matter of fact.

Based on all factors considered: EBITDA, other financials, insider share purchases, FOMO sentiment, 3 trillion in infrastructure spending..... I'm going to call it that CLF trades for $26/share (minimum) by  April 17.

**Bonus Fact:** For every 1 trillion in infrastructure spending - according to a study from Georgetown University by Carnevale & Smith - 11 million jobs will be created by 2027. That's 11,000,000 x 3 = 33,000,000 jobs! Looks like us apes might see that SPY 420.69 sooner than we think."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,CLF employee here. I’ll note the 2020 increase in workforce was a result of the $1.1 billion acquisition of AK Steel.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to give this fellow confirmation bias, but I work in the custom fabrication sector. Due to the container shortage, lack of domestic supply and the silent ramp up of the economy there is a massive shortage of all steel products right now. A couple of months ago a major supplier here in Canada had almost zero inventory of flat sheet at long products. This definitely sounds like a good play, as America looks to ramp up domestic production. Basically any steel company would be a good play right now"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just asking out of curiosity- why would you think US steel companies would be the big winners of Bidens new infrastructure plan instead of green infrastructure companies?

No China since 2009 or so, tho most of the couplings come from China. We do come across domestic pipe but its mostly foreign companies that have put in mills here. Basically, the domestic mills got together and tried to sue the foreign mills out of the market so they just said screw it and built mills here."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you want to look at is what steel companies are the most leveraged. Nucor is a great, well run steel company that will do well, but is it leveraged? No, it's a walking giant. When you have steel prices as high as they are and an infrastructure bill on the horizon, you want to go for the company that stands the most to benefit, not the one that will sit comfortably no matter what. I look for leverage. Who has made recent, strategic acquisitions? CLF and X are both prime candidates. Couple this with a massive undervaluation of the stocks and you've got a big recipe for success with them. 

Go with Nucor and you'll still win, just not as big."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They own their own iron ore productions means and are the largest steel producer in the US. They will benefit more from a US infrastructure bill than any other company.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"$CLF last did an offering in early February. It diluted by 5% to pay off debt at that time. For comparison, $X (United States Steel) had to dilute by 20% just a few weeks prior the $CLF's offering.

At that same time, $CLF offered bonds at around at about half the interest rates their current bonds were at.

Since then, there has been no stock issuance or high interest bonds. In fact, the CEO spent over $1M buying stock in the open market two weeks ago. Those stating that $CLF is currently offering new high interest bonds or currently doing an offering are straight up lying.

Of course, one is free to believe whatever they want on how much a company that is literally printing money from high steel prices plans to screw over its investors. But such statements are personal speculation and are not facts.

[This is not financial advice]"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"CLF has already issued the new shares and used that money to pay off high interest debt. It is positioned to succeed moving forward and has gotten what debt it has left to low interest levels. Buying up ArcelorMittal USA was perfect timing, especially with Biden's ""Made in America"" push coupled with the infrastructure plan. If you look at Biden's Made in America decree, he specifically calls out steel as being a requirement for domestic production for government projects."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The also have been on a buying spree of entire companies and company interests to include its purchase of ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel interest of I/N Kote, 40% interests in I/N Tek, etc.  This company is poised for a break out and this infrastructure plan is the catalyst to do it. So yes they went on a shopping spree and now have some debt.... but what they purchased has only expanded their market reach and capability."

Since I’m already overly self-critical, I looked back, and yeah, they may have a point. So I decided to go get some receipts. After spending the night huffing paint thinner, I grabbed some receipts (citations in brackets \[ \]) and have updated my price targets. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: (at the top because I hate when you have to read the whole thing before you even realize there is one)

Bull Case : Henrik Fisker is a great car designer that had a run of bad luck, and the partnership with Magna Steyr will give him the manufacturing experience needed to complete a car.

Bull Price Target: $14.64 Based on Toyota’s market cap per car produced and Fisker’s 200,000 car production target

Bull Odds: 15%

Neutral Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but doesn’t understand engineering, manufacturing, or production of a car. His ego will push him to micromanage the design/build of the car (again) and there will be production delays, manufacturing problems, and cost overruns.

Neutral Price Target: $3.66 Based on cash on hand ($1B) assuming they can maintain current cash balance by selling cars at break even.

Neutral Odds: 55%

Bear Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but is also a narcissist and unable to take direction from people with more experience. The deal with Magna Steyr will fall apart, and they will run out of operating capital without ever delivering a full production run.

Bear Price Target: $0

Bear Odds 30%

**Combined Updated Price Target: $4.21**

&#x200B;

I know, I know, you’re sitting there chewing your evening crayons saying, “That’s pretty harsh there fib, seems like you just have it out for the guy. A car company is more than just one person. You can’t just bash the guy and call it DD.” Well, you may be right, but when there’s no car, no financials (Q4 2020 and FY 2020 results went out as a press release, but 10Q and 10K missing from SEC database), I need to rely on trust in the people running the show. Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I’ll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy…it’ll be hard. 

&#x200B;

Buckle up, this is gonna be looooong.

&#x200B;

**Quick Background: The Early Years**

Fisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \[1\]

Design experience, but doesn’t show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.

Does some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company – Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \[1\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.

**Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**

Henrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it’s his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car – the Fisker Karma – that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster. 

The most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn’t the only problem. “Pressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker’s original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma’s performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.” \[2\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn’t let anyone change it.

“On more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold” \[2\]

“The company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‘not necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price…but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.’” \[3\]

“As the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn’t even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.” \[3\]

“’Beneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,’ said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.” \[2\]

“From 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.” \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023). 

This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That’s got to hurt.

So, man that’s a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let’s see…

**Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**

His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn’t it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL…VLF…VL…VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the “F” for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]

As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]

Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?

A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.

Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?

A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.

It’s a short back and forth, but there’s a lot in there to unpack. I just don’t have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn’t sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure. 

Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems. 

“We have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world’s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.” \[4\]. 

Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware. 

He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.

“We also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that’s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.” \[4\]

He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I’ll refer to his “vaporcars”. 

**Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)** 

Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We’re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates. 

In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017. 

So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:

“It’s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it’s very expensive to make, it doesn’t have the power, and it doesn’t work below zero,” said Fisker. “We have cracked all three of these areas.” \[5\]

In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]

“This isn’t just a lab test; we’ve actually built the batteries,” \[5\]

They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:

“To date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved—Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson—have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.” \[7\]

From the same article: “But it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.” \[7\]

Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. “For now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. “We are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.” He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.” \[8\]

By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\]. 

2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?

**Chapter 4: Foxconn**

File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled “Pear” concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of “Apple” in the press? This truly baffles me. 

**Chapter 5: I’m Exhausted**

I’m so tired of writing this, I’d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik’s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there’s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member). 

**Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**

I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla’s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that’s at the lot down the road.

&#x200B;

Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can’t decide what value they add other than the name on the front.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO. You have this long ass DD on why this company will eventually fail and your positions expire in a week. one of the most retarded posts I've seen in a while lmaooo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,O boy. Where is that dude from last week who said he was buying 100k worth or some shit because he believed Fisker was a $58 stock?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a 150k long long position on this and really was hoping for some good DD to convince me to sell but this was just a whole lot of butt fuck nothing besides text on a screen

The only argument you actually made is ""Based on Toyota’s market cap per car produced and Fisker’s 200,000 car production target the stock is worth $14."" This is still a hilariously oversimplified way to value a company. A better comparison would be Tesla trades 6.5x 2025 revenues, Nio 3.25x and Fisker currently less than .5x. Meaning if it hits production at just a 1x multiplier it is worth $40. Downvote me all you want - you have no clue what you are talking about - you just write paragraphs on Fisker's old company which has literally nothing to do with the current company and battery problems that Henrik already addressed. 0/10"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Back when you kids were still in diapers and Fisker and Musk started their respective companies I thought for sure Fisker would come out on top since he actually had experience in the car manufacturing world. Boy, was I wrong. Personally, I have very little faith in Henrik Fisker. But I'm an idiot, so don't listen to me."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,“Be fearful when they are greedy... be greedy when they are fearful”
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man I read his Wiki page when the spac was announced and from that it seemed sketchy. Didnt look into it any further but I wish I did. If you fail at making 2 car companies, you’re failing on your third. 

Do you think your puts are too close in dates? When the market starts realising which EVs are legit and what’s bullshit this thing is dying. Only thing is that I don’t know how long that will take. Great write up!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,OMG this is the most compelling DD I've ever read. I need puts and I need them (checks watch) Monday!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg, I don’t think I have read that many words to come out with absolutely nothing in my entire life. I want my shit break back!!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy DD man good shit
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been eyeing puts for FSR since october. Now Ill be buying them Monday at open
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Apple is gonna partner with Fisker right /u/Itsme_eljefe ?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t read the rest but you sold me at 4.21 price target. I’ll dump 20k in monday

Edit: JFC IT’S AT $18 I’M NOT BUYING IN"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the delightful DD and calling it as you see it. Mr Pups and I were chuckling while I read parts out loud. Another Bricklin.  Sounds like Fisker should just design pretty car statues, since his won't be functioning often."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Really like that we’re looking at the psychology of the leadership and not empty promises that don’t show up on time.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you even trade? Short term puts that I've had since the stock was $23 that I'm way up on.  I'm not short selling cuz that shit can blow up in your face.  Plan to add longer term puts if the price pops so I can get them dirt cheap.  That's how it's done.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Right here. This report is garbo and makes me finna buy more
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, if you're comfortable with Tesla's current market cap and want to use it as a benchmark, then I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do to convince you.  Revenue projections are meaningless without a product or sales, and maybe the .5x is the market telling you that no one else trusts them either.  Good luck with your longs."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't call it butt fuck nothing it seemed like it did a pretty good job discrediting the fisher himself
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Be retarded when they are stonks, and stonks when they are retarded"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"some are greedy some are fearful, always."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plan to add as I go.  Been riding these since the bear flag broke down on the 12th around $23, plan to close them out for a profit before expiry.

Keeping the puts short term since the market may agree with me yet, and still may pop on some well timed PR. I'm too risk averse for short selling, and not about to go YOLO on puts just for the hell of it. Going to add some leap puts soon, but waiting to see if there's a pop coming up that lets me get them for super cheap."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What. The. Fuck?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, having short term puts when ALL OF EV is selling off will work out. It has nothing to do with FSR or your DD"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Glorious. Looks like we are all on the right sub.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck with your puts. On the bright side if I am wrong least one fellow autist will make some money
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in on the pop as well (hopefully this week or next). Kindly update if you take a leap. 

I hope they figure it out years from now but this bad boy is going south before it gets a good bonner."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just out of curiosity what happens if you’re on a cash account so have no margin available to exercise? Do most brokerages sell your options?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just record live Monday morning and go “guh”.  It’s a cheat code.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol and SPY has a 50% overnight margin requirement, which means op has about $3.2M and is borrowing about $3.2M on margin.

If SPY opens down 1%, op loses $64,500 and the margin call grows to roughly $34,000. 

He has enough money to come out of this fine, it'll just be a stressful weekend."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What better way to never sell
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I did that with a fraction of Beetcorn in 2018.  Found it this year. Pleasant surprise.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I can trade outside regular trading hours. But SPY being an ETF I can only trade on pre-market hours on Monday"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The closed day is Saturday, then?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brokers can choose not to. If the account doesn't have the funds then the broker is perfectly within their rights not to exercise.

At TDA they have a margin team that decides what to do in these situations. Margin is also shorthand for ""loan"" and the broker puts themselves at risk by exercising an option that no individual is likely to have funds to cover.

Poor bastard. Every $1 that SPY goes down before he can sell is $16,000 out of his pocket."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You have until 5:30 PM on Friday to call your broker and tell them not to exercise ITM options.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m curious though, if you don’t have the cash to cover the margin requirement, wouldn’t they just immediately call those shares away and close you out?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Many brokers don't do this AFAIK.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude I’ve been thinking the same thing, Nasdaq listing is gonna be such a game changer.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My name is Of Your Choosing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has $3.2m why the fuck does even $100k matter to him

Edit: I'm retarded. Please read /u/CosmicQuantum42 below

> He doesn’t have $3.2 million (probably).

He has $3.2 million in SPY stock but owes his brokerage some amount slightly less than $3.2 million. (The profit he made on the trade which is probably a couple of percent kind of thing, maybe less).

I can’t be bothered to go read the actual numbers but let’s say he exercised $3.2 million in options and owes his broker $3.15 million. Ordinarily this would be awesome: a $50k gain in an option trade.

BUT the problem is that he hasn’t made that cash profit yet because he’s still holding all that stock. Let’s say SPY falls 2% over the weekend which is a real plausible thing that could and has happened. Oops now his $3.2 million in stock is only worth $3.136 million. But he still owes the brokerage $3.15 million! Now he has to come up with 0.014 million or $14k out of pocket! His winning trade has become a loser and he might hypothetically not even have $14k of liquid assets to pay his broker back with! And that’s a 2% loss. Bigger losses have been known to happen and this kind of thing can crush you.

This post is a cautionary tale about playing with fire with options. If you don’t want to exercise your option SELL IT and make sure it’s off your books at expiry time. Otherwise you’ll might either get into this guy’s situation, or lose any profit you might have gained through forcing an expiry of an option that was worth positive money."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What better way to let your positive options expire?...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">Beetcorn 

Beetcorn?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How? ES futures are open at that time so probably they're doing so at no risk and big margin.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve learned they have a tight risk management group, and usually have eyes on things like this and they certainly take their cut."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A broker with proper risk management would
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,so in other words you don't have TD Ameritrade which lets you trade SPY starting Sunday at 8pm????
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well technically if your options that you bought are in the money at expiration than you would be making money.. so it means his trade went ok though..
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’ll be fine. Even if he has to sell ~15 shares at a loss to cover that margin call. Which is unlikely because SPY rocketed up, and he won his tendies with his call price. He can just hang on to ‘em and sell above his strike. Or sell cc’s at $1 above his original strike if he’s desperate to get rid of them"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It just seems like terrible risk management by TDA on behalf of their client. Been mulling this scenario over today and yeah you're totally right; he could get completely taken to the cleaners here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He had 160 contracts? Damn
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How would they make those decisions though? Insane number of options + barely ITM -> no exercise and lower number of options + very ITM -> exercise?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's not assigned, he executed.

Rather, his broker did on his behalf"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im glad I fpund this onformation out now and not after I had an open option contract. I really need tp learn about options...

I know the basics of buying/selling calls/puts. Dont know much about greeks besides theta..."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"RH says they will in their terms and conditions, but it's up to each institution as to how they want to handle it. 

The shit will hit the fan if SPY either drops dramatically or gains dramatically right at open before he can liquidate. :)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I initially got in when it was around $1.50 but didn’t hold. Went back in at $4.00, did some trading and made a big bet before the latest ER. Gladly so, I’m looking to add to the position. 10x EV/Sales with 30%rev growth YoY and a $0.50 valuation per user is cheap. Price is discounted because the company is seen as part of the E-Sports industry, which has a very small TAM, but these guys are monster add platform in the making. At the same valuation per user as Discord it’s a $100 company"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just googled it and realized it isn't as common of a term as I thought

watch for sharp reversals during 2-3, especially if they continue sharper 3-330, and expect that last 5 minute uptick.  Especially when options expire.  They want those people who will be shaken out of their spots that are 'destined' to be ITM to sell them off cheaper to other people + shorts wanting to get out of their positions before the weekend.

Unfortunately I sold my 292.5's 20 min before close, but held my QQQ 312's straight to the end.   Had 8 arkk 112's closed out early by IB because I don't have a margin account + not enough cash to exercise them... I wish they would just leave them, I feel like they do it when they want to make the cash off them.  I think I'm going to bitch at them heavily on Monday because they can see my history of trading on the last minute, I don't want to set up margin because of the amount of times their terrible UI made me almost short sell something by accident.

Anyways it was a good op ex .. That was a much much sharper reversal dump than I'm used to, but you could feel the market being artificially suppressed 

the prior couple week's bear market didn't run opposite as much because there were actual catalysts, but at this point tech health and financials are all being held down artificially; they are low enough.  April will be a great month and those short sellers know it, they don't want to risk a gap up on Monday.

it sounds complicated enough that you'd think it couldn't be just called opposite hour, but it is actually so common you may as well.   Market down during opposite hour? Buy calls at the low unless there's a damn good reason that isn't already priced in.. And vice versa."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He doesn’t have $3.2 million (probably).

He has $3.2 million in SPY stock but owes his brokerage some amount slightly less than $3.2 million. (The profit he made on the trade which is probably a couple of percent kind of thing, maybe less).

I can’t be bothered to go read the actual numbers but let’s say he exercised $3.2 million in options and owes his broker $3.15 million. Ordinarily this would be awesome: a $50k gain in an option trade.

BUT the problem is that he hasn’t made that cash profit yet because he’s still holding all that stock. Let’s say SPY falls 2% over the weekend which is a real plausible thing that could and has happened. Oops now his $3.2 million in stock is only worth $3.136 million. But he still owes the brokerage $3.15 million! Now he has to come up with 0.014 million or $14k out of pocket! His winning trade has become a loser and he might hypothetically not even have $14k of liquid assets to pay his broker back with! And that’s a 2% loss. Bigger losses have been known to happen and this kind of thing can crush you.

This post is a cautionary tale about playing with fire with options. If you don’t want to exercise your option SELL IT and make sure it’s off your books at expiry time. Otherwise you’ll might either get into this guy’s situation, or lose any profit you might have gained through forcing an expiry of an option that was worth positive money."

To back this up, the brokerage auto-executes ITM options at expiry if and only if the account can support execution. It looks like his account just barely cleared the margin requirements."

I don't know what brokerage you have, but this is exactly what people should be asking their actual brokerage..

When I have a question, I literally call up TD and ask them exactly what I need to know and they tell me. 

this is how i know things like 24/6 ETF that trade and open on sunday at 8pm and you can trade after hours till 8pm (shares only) and that you have 1 hour and 30 minutes to call in after the market close to exercise your options or tell them not to exercise etc.. 


things like that."

2021-03-27 23:04:29,wallstreetbets,"How to profit from the Suez Canal What the Suez Canal means for the Tanker market

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically CEO Robert Bugbee of Scorpio Tankers and Insiders of North Atlantic Tankers, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in Scorpio Tankers to play product tankers and Teekay Tankers LTD. to play crude.

Edit: I forgot to add that Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa.

Edit 2:

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.

Edit 3: [positions](https://m.imgur.com/a/VuAchGi)

Edit 4: it seems the ship has been refloated, disappointed but as I said I was already bullish on tankers before the Suez Canal situation. The product tanker market supply is tight and demand has is only growing. As more time passes and older ships get retired, the supply will only continue to get more constrained because no one has been building new ships anymore.

There is still a 300+ vessel traffic jam at the Suez Canal which will cause delays, I’m not sure what will happen but I am still confident there will be an upcoming bull run for product tankers"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did some research today, hope it's of use to any fellow apes looking at profiting from the Suez Canal closure.

**Tide tables:** They have until Wednesday 31st to float the Ever Given with neap tides of 2.1m. After this date high tides drop dramatically until after the 25th of April.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:** Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed around the Cape of Good Hope as yet. 

**Location of crane ships:** If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks. Remarkably a suitable ship, the Saipem 3000, is currently located in the Red Sea en route to Turkey via Suez. There are also 3 similar vessels currently docked in the Persian Gulf."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is buying those options. If you look at them they are as flat as the stock, with no bids, and ridiculous asks for $5 each (probably trying to catch dumbasses exactly as you describe), while the last transaction was at 10 cents. 

But realistically it's risk that prevents you from doing this. Right now the last sale I see on July 16th $45 calls was for $.05 ($5). Let's say you sell 1000 contracts at that price since there's a moron out there willing to buy them. You've made $5000, and you think you're pretty smart since it's impossible for it to make money. But now your risk is bigger than your balls, at $100k/dollar the stock moves. Basically if it moves a few pennies you're going to get margin called. If investors decline the deal (still possible I think) and Traton ups the offer, you're going to lose your tendies. You're trading a little money that's probably mostly free, for a huge risk and you won't stop feeling nausea until the deal closes OTM and you're off the hook. That's if you can even find a buyer, which doesn't seem likely."

2021-03-27 22:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Peruvian elections and why I'm shorting SCCO As you degenerates may know, copper has skyrocketed thanks to the Chinese demand. This is not expected to last as Chinese regulations melt the demand, so the price is probably going down in a month or two.

Now, this doesn't seem like a good reason to see why the price of Southern Copper Corporation would go down, but just keep that in mind with what I'm gonna say next.

SCCO's copper supply depends heavily on Peruvian mines. Although they hold mines in Mexico, their biggest mines are located in Southern Peru (hence the name). The situation there for Southern and other mining companies is pretty bad in some places as rural locals and environmentalists oppose anything mine-related. One of their biggest projects, Tia Maria, has been stagnating for five years, and the people opposing the project have voted for politicians with an anti-mine stance since 2015. 

In 2016, in the same region that the Tia Maria protests started, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski won the vote due to his half-assed remark about consulting with the people first (in other words, no mine). Eventually, this man would become president and, like expected, nothing would happen. Now the political scene in Peru is facing the same situation, but this time it will be even worse. 

The biggest candidate in the polls for the 2021 elections (EDIT: Elections are on April 11) is Yonhy Lescano, a nationalist who sternly opposes Tia Maria and another big project for another company and plans to regulate the mining industry. You probably know what this means for mining investors and the already existing companies there. 

The second candidate in the polls, George Forsyth, doesn't really have a stance on the issue, so we can expect the project to stagnate too if he wins. The third biggest candidate, Rafael Lopez de Aliaga, also opposes the project. Of all the candidates I only know one who's in favor of it, and it's very unlikely that he will win. The rest have half-assed opinions that will also end up being a ""Nah we'll keep you waiting for 5 more years.""

If candidate Yonhy Lescano wins, that will be the end of Southern Copper, and I bet the price will tank. The decrease may be similar if another candidate who shares that stance wins, especially because the demand bubble appears to be close to bursting. If the price goes (or stays) up, SCCO would be missing out on huge revenues, which will disappoint investors. If it goes down, well, the stock is fucked."

There are even precedents of political violence happening in other places due to projects like this, which means that even if the winner decides to support Tia Maria, it will be impossible to start it and it will ruin their political career (other politicians will do it for us).

As a reference, the price of SCCO's stock went down from 35 to 25 during the protests, which turned a bit violent."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What? A low book value per share means the company has less equity per share, so that's bad and means the company is overvalued at a given share price.

Also, the book values are fked up because of the merger. If you look at their [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-089716/), UWMC had $2.3B equity on Dec 31, 2020. If you look at their [10-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-014601/), the post-merger entity had $5B equity.

$2.3B /  1.63B shares = 1.41

$5B / 1.63B shares = 3.07

So actually UWMC has a pretty low book value per share, and compared to the industry (PFSI at 47.23, WD at 39.04, ESNT at 34.5) UWMC is considered overvalued. RKT is comparable to UWMC at 3.11"

1. Media story of a gust of wind is a factor but somebody f'd up big. 

2. Ship was going 13 knots, when is should have been going 8 knots. It ran aground hard.

3. look at the pictures front anchors were not dropped, basic shit to stop a ship before running aground that should have happened.  

4. Look at the red paint at the bottom of the ship at the bow- that should be underwater. Just think about how much weight just was raised by about a one story house. There are 20,000 of those big containers on the ship. 

5. Several high tides have already happened, the moon is full, that means the tides are going to get higher until March 31, if it's not out by then, shits going to be there for a while. 

6. Potential for an even bigger fuck up is not unthinkable.  To build these huge ships they make them just able the handle rough seas. Since the ship is aground front and back though they are going to need to pull one or both ends out kinda sideways. It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:**  Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no  vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed  around the Cape of Good Hope as yet.

**Location of crane ships:**  If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be  partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few  crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting  containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks.

# TL;DR

The USMCA, a North America trade agreement,  was in effect as of July 2020. A railroad merger between US, Canada, and Mexico is in process as of March 2021. The legislation largely considers economic changes since 1994 to allow for greater competition and counterbalance against Eurasian influence.

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**

\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**

\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**

\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? *(You are here)*

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*

\- Do we understand incentives vs. bias? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*

\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The USMCA

[Cross border trade flows](https://preview.redd.it/zqk4vehrolp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9433daaf8831146c5a2cdaaa1476660abdd0bc95)

The USMCA seeks to incentivize various sectors, with most notably, auto-manufacturing. The reason for this is clear, as the industry is orthogonal to critical supply chains in North America:

1. Cloud computing, IoT, and AI applications
2. Energy management and utilization.
3. Operational efficiency in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and logistics with automation.
4. Theoretical advancements in financials, digital-trade, cybersecurity, and cross-border trade flows.
5. Research in biological, material sustainability, and genomics.
6. Quality of life.

Considering the consequences of furthered development of the above, I would disagree with economists that believe that the USMCA is an ineffective piece of legislation. The reason being is that these advancements have a consequential compouding effect for change over time. Unlike the economists Thea M. Lee or Robert E. Scott of the Economics Policy Institute, I actually have experience as a Mexican-American laborer, rather than a perspective written inside of an ivory tower.

Improvements in cybersecurity and financials, for example, may produce changes in cannabis agriculture, which in turn would increase stability in Mexico. Ideas like these are covered more closely in my Square DD, but it rests as the basis for my disagreement. Mexico is a nation that is ripe for change in a period that strongly seeks change in the global frontier.

# Mexico

[Mexican-American industrial-tech relationships](https://i.redd.it/bw7f5fcnolp61.gif)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kznlwgv26mp61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=b584ba641f082bf1c41d9983e3d7b935519a2e48

Mexico is clearly a nation that warrants many different opinions, as its former governments have failed in a spectacular way to contain the effects of the American drug war. In my view, it’s an issue of economic surpression, where the incentive of black-market goods is far too strong and causes a non-trivial slowdown of national progress. Trust falling amongst the working class, in a capital system, is dreadfully painful thing to experience with respect to economic growth - the clearest and most visceral being the subject of illegal immigration. A reader may be surprised to hear that Apple Pay has only been available as of 2021 and that just about half of Mexican citizens are underbanked. Put simply, NAFTA and USMCA are quite literally worlds apart in terms of progress we have been in the past 25 years.

Ultimately what this means is that the way to combat it is by overwhelming the black-market industry with strong labor participation. This is effectively agreed upon with the three nations - use Mexico as a proxy competitor to China and as a means to improve international flows like chip and labor shortages. It is also a strongly stated goal by the Biden administration, Federal Reserve, and Mexican administration; we need to achieve higher labor participation.

At the same time, America is incredibly bullish on the industrial-technological ambitions of Southwestern states like Texas. This is no coincidence, since the states are structured like an economic battleground with tariff incentives where northern Mexican States and southern US states are experiencing a strong period of trade flow synergy with energy and industrial capacities.

They're capital-intensive, heavily unionized, with some make-work rules, heavily regulated and long competed with a comparative disadvantage vs. the trucking industry, which has a very efficient method of propulsion (diesel engines) and uses free public roads. Railroads have long been a terrible business and have been lousy for investors. We did finally change our minds and invested. We threw out our paradigms but did it too late. We should have done it two years ago, but we were too stupid to do it at the most ideal time. There's a German saying: Man is too soon old and too late smart. We were too late smart. We finally realized that railroads now have a huge competitive advantage with double-stacked railcars, guided by computers, moving more and more production from China, etc. They have a big advantage over truckers in huge classes of business.”

>“We said railroads were no damn good. There were too many of them, they had truck competition. And we were right; it was a terrible business for about 80 years. Finally they get down to four big railroads, and it was a better business.”— Charlie Munger

The intent of the railroad is to consider these ambitions and capture the trade from end-to-end.

This comes at a time when organizations like Shopify is one of Canada’s largest financial service providers, or organizations like MercadoLibre massively distributes basic banking services to Latin America and where organizations like Tesla completely transformed multiple sectors.

It also comes during a rather revolutionarily competitive era, where vehicle technology ranging from rockets to traffic flows will produce unknown economies with respect to automation and quality of life. The fundamental equation here is to bring Mexico up to speed. Using this framework, it is clear to understand why North America is driven to produce an intercontinental railroad. Global trade, as a function of COVID and technological advancements, is experiencing a paradigm shift where cross-border flows, consequences of peace, and other societal demands will effectively never return back to normal. The merger is a representation of such a change.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is huge opposition to oil sands development in Canada and Alberta. Companies are also less likely to make huge capital investments in long term oil plays with the rise of cheap green energy and carbon pricing. Current operations continue to produce because of huge costs associated with shutting down, but there is hesitancy for new projects. 

Crude by rail will continue until expansion pipelines are complete, but with the current pipelines under construction Canada could have a glut of pipeline capacity until 2030 and beyond. 

US production will likely displace Canadian production in the short to medium term. Unless green energy is a complete flop and economies revert back to oil, Canadian oil sands aren't having a revival."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,CP split 5:1 coming soon
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree there would need to be a serious supply shock for there to be increased demand... yes canada, and perticularly quebec, have a lot of opposition to more development. However all that has to happen for development to pick is a pick up in demand as alberta is the only player that really matters and they put all their eggs in this basket (oil prices around $100 a barrel). There are however, several reasons to believe that there will be a supply shock in the next 1-8 yrs, it is possible there won't be, but you are really talking about a perfect world with no conflict and perfect environmental implementation if that is the position."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both of these are trading at very high prices. Did you find data on how the shares of these companies are going to be merged? I'd like to hop into the cheaper one of course, which would automatically increase the value after merger."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the heads up. Adding it to favourites for later.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canada sells 99% of its oil to the US. US oil production has surged over the last 10-15 years. Unless Canada finds a magic market that wants heavy crude and can process the crude it will sell at a heavy discount. There's hardly any heavy crude production in Canada and the rest is in the US. Refining capacity takes time and big money to build. A lot of green energy is far cheaper per k/wh to build than investing 10 B in a refineries and then another 5-10 billion in a new oil sands project.The biggest hurdle to Canada's oil success is US production.

I think Alberta and Saskatchewan should invest in value add facilities to turn o&g into plastics and other useful materials."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,damn Michoacan is actually fucked I'm sorry
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's obvious that alberta should diversify in their own interest. It's also obvious they aren't, and that that is bullish for the railways should the price rise sufficiently, which while genrally unlikely to be sustained over the long term due to environmental shifts in production and yes american production, is highly likely to occur of periods for periods of time in the next 1-8 yrs as demand will rise sharply before droping off again."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how you would execute a Covered Call to a smooth 🧠🦍. Not financial advice of course...I’m just 53 shares away from my goal and got burned earlier trying to make the CC play.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah why not a roth
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll stream it on Gwitch.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is up to the purchaser of the call to decide whether or not (and when, if early) to exercise the call. 

If you've sold a covered call, your only choices are to

A) Let it expire worthless out of the money

B) Let it expire in the money, likely ensuring exercise

C) Buy back out of the call early, freeing up your shares

And yes, not financial advice."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol..Maybe I could get. Good enough to run missions with my son in some of those shooter strategy games!! Or virtual reality, would love to try !!!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You get taxed on the way in, sucks if you make a lot of money and your rate is higher. A standard ira taxes you on the way out, when you make zero. 
Edit: clarity"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The bad kind no one likes, apparently."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The kind where you don't pay taxes now but do pay taxes later. If you expect to be a low earner in retirement, that's okay (eg Wallstreet gambler living off interest).  It's only a bad decision if you expect to make more money when you're old than when you're young (eg scientist doing consulting work after their academic career is over, which is what a lot of reddit imagines themselves to be)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess a Roth would be better, huh?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok! This is where I got confused. Way back when I sold a covered call @39...price was around 50...Got profits (2 or 3k) Bought shares immediately :) price dipped all the way to right around 39...I couldn’t afford to exercise :/

From the research I did initially I thought I was selling someone else the call? Yet it ended up in my account at the strike price ($39) is this always the case?

Sorry for all the late night or early morning questions...I really want to understand this."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,how do you have so much $ to buy?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">Even during the squeeze, whenever it occurs, I have zero intention of selling all of my shares.

You seriously need to rethink this. Could mean the difference between finishing 2021 with 3,500 shares or finishing with 15,000 shares.

If your goal is to own >35,000,000 shares, you need to make moves like cashing in on the squeeze in order to come even remotely close."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"are you pulling in like 20k a week in premiums? I've been focused on making money selling CCs (it's been great) but don't have as big a position as you. You gotta be crushing it, I hope"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting even during the squeeze you wont sell. What is the plan?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a smart IRA for you if your current income is in the ballpark of where I think it is
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Or- why not pay taxes now and invest the post monies in GME and ride that 🚀to Pluto? No taxes on the gains..or I understood the whole thing wrong?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao brah idk I was just adding more criticism since everyone has something to say 😂 but maybe Roth is better lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a small business owner and independent contractor in a thriving industry.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a really good plan, the selling and the buying.

How has it been going for you during these up and down swings so far?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pulling quite a few shares per week in premium, yes."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"To own GameStop.

Edit (for clarity): I cannot own GameStop by selling shares. Gotta buy shares to accomplish my goal."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It just depends on what you want to do in the long term.  Like, not making money for tendies right now, but like what do you want to do when you're old.  A Roth IRA is for if you expect to continue to make money when you're old, a traditional is if you expect to stop making money at some point.  That's why I used those two examples.

I am in the camp where I expect to make money til I'm dead and so I use a Roth IRA, but that's just the field I'm in.  If you're in a young person's field, it's smarter to put in your money pre-tax now and pay a lower tax rate when you're old pulling out from the account."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,wow 2 jobs at once? what industry? i was a contractor also but obviously wrong industry...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold half at $340 and re-bought at $220 on the same day for one of my more successful trades. Not the best but certainly increased my position.

Some were able to sell at $300-500 and re-buy at $40.

Imagine selling 1,000 shares at $400 and buying back 10,000 shares at $40."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"you don’t have to day trade my guy, just sell a share or two after the top, and then use that cash to buy way more shares when it comes back to earth. i believe in what you’re doing but i think never selling any is not the move."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But it is pretty clear that after the squeeze the price will be way below the price during the squeeze. You would earn more shares by selling during the squeeze and rebuying after it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hence the title. My bad.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you. But you’ll never get my shares :)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well played, I think.

100% of my business goes to GameStop."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's the same kind of job.

Sole-proprieter LLC. 

Sometimes my company provides a multitude of services; sometimes I get booked individually when someone else is managing.

Just depends on the client's needs and scope of the project.

The rest is a secret for now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, glad that's working out for you!"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"do you only have 2 stocks you fucking retard? no, you’ve got plenty. and selling one share at a mil would net you plenty more shares, but if you want to be literally retarded about it, be my guest"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla didnt have a real short squeeze, just a gamma squeeze."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, if someone loves what they do and aren't not hurting anyone, I say go for it."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I love this comment."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof.

Still, selling for $1,000 and then watching GameStop never be worth less than $1,000 again would leave me with exactly 1 share further from owning this company.

Perhaps you are a psychic or maybe you are from the future. But I am stuck in time, so I'm gonna keep at my strategy.

Can't own a company by selling shares. Gotta do the opposite!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like GameStop.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what I do and it’s been pretty explosive for us since everyone has been staying at home and realizing they hate their house haha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,then sell for a loss. if the account value doesn’t matter then the price you buy at shouldn’t either
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Just like GameStop.

Yes, the squeeze up to January was a Gamma squeeze. But selling during the first squeeze and rebuying after it would have worked well, wouldnt it? And nobody knows if there will be second squeeze or not and if it will be a real one or a gamma squeeze."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes a lot of sense! Glad someone's doing well during all of this chaos.

However, I do not work in an industry that was boosted by the pandemic.

Quite the opposite, in fact!

But business is popping off like crazy now that folks are getting vaccinated."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell? 

I think there has been a misunderstanding."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are so close to understanding my strategy. You have even outlined all of the reasons why I am not going to offload my shares during any squeeze.

We're just seeing different patterns with the same information available."

A bunch of these articles get posted on schedule to coincide with the planned dip made by intra selling of micro shares. Melvin Capitol throat fucks the ""news"" site with money and some drops of money cummies lands in the wallet of the starving screen writers wallet.

So all these people posting one share Yolos and other dumb nonsense, I get it cause that was me a year ago."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just as much people lost money thou. It was assumed Bill Akman wouldn't let Hertz go under because he was a major activist investor of it.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I spent a lot of time in hospitals as a kid in the 80’s 90’s and I also remember the nurse wheeling the Nintendo and Atari into my room to play. I used to love the playrooms that had systems too. Only thing I had to look forward to when I had surgery was knowing I got to play as much as I wanted to. Thank you for doing this!

1.) The child needs that NOW. And it selfish to wait if you can afford it now.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow Washingtonian. Good on you buddy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly how you push GameStop’s value up without speculation. Imagine if every member on here spent $50-$100 on game stop every quarter? If you guys seriously want game start to go to the moon, we have to start shopping there. Usually their first quarter gets the lowest numbers, imagine if they have record-breaking sales this next earnings report, that would cause the stock to go flying. Not only with a bunch of wall street bats people jump on board but skeptics as well as institutions will get on board. Also hedge funds love making money, I would not be surprised if some of these hedge funds are secretly buying a game start shares. I would not be surprised if a large bank or hedge fund is the reason for that dropped from 349 down to 198 in a matter of 30 minutes. They basically got in at a very good time and once it took us they dropped off all their shares which was probably in the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands, and tanked the price and reaped their profits"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We all need to band together and find another heavily shorted company and buy it up. When the short squeeze happens again then we all sell and take our profits while the hedge funds bleed. Of course this is market manipulation and currently it’s only legal for hedge funds and Wall Street to manipulate the market. But we need to find a legal way to do this. I saw a penny stock that was shorted around 400% over the float! We need to buy that up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, this is fantastic. I remember being hospitalized for a few weeks when I was a kid and the hospital had a bin of VHS tapes and that's it haha."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I just say something to you fucking apes? The switch lite sucks. Stop buying them. Nintendo is using very shitty hardware and the stick drift is ridiculous. 

It’s very nice what you’re doing, and the intent is probably Good. But the reality is that you’re buying pieces of shit that will cause a dying kid to lose his fight against Ganon because the right stick thinks that no input means full input right and you can not switch out of cryosis even though you really need magnesis to defeat thunderblight ganon.

At least with full sized switches they can just swap out the Joycons or dock to a TV and use plug in elite controllers."

When can we get back to Capitalism? Let's let that piece of s*** company die like it was suppose to.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"For tax year 2020, you can actually deduct $300 in cash contributions regardless of taking the standard deduction. Cash contributions under 250 do not require a receipt. 

While the federal rules is you can only deduct your charitable donations of you itemize (with the excerpt of 300 dollars), [some states do permit taking the deduction](https://www.uscharitablegifttrust.org/tax-treatment-of-charitable-contributions.php). And some states do give you a dollar for dollar credit for your donations.

So if OP really wanted to, he can just claim up to 250 with out the receipt. If he lives in a states that allows him to deduct property contributions regardless of taking the standard deduction or not, he can range the deduction.

Now for the apes who donated to save apes, those count as cash contributions, if you donated 300 or more, save your receipt, and check to see if your state allows you to keep on deducting.

But consult with your tax advisor before taking any position. And accurate documentation is your responsibility. 

Usually people give out of the goodness of their hearts, and taxes isn’t really a first thought, so if you have the means, spread the love!"

People often don't know how tax brackets work, but the counter of ""you can't lose money by getting a raise"" is also not _always_ true."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? Even most of the other responses to my comment are people like ""yeah, but actually, technically, blah blah blah"" because apparently people don't realize it's a 2% difference for the higher tax bracket.

And give me an award TO DA MOON"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes if you want to work overtime just do it at the end of the year. Or work for a company who can accurately estimate how much you're going to make every year and can tax you accordingly.

I personally don't work overtime because I can make four times as much doing my own business on my time off."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean there are other options for that, ie power of attorney, so I wouldn’t say it’s strictly marriage related but you bring up a good point."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be one socially illiterate dummy. Good luck out there.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can tell it’s something you were told rather than learned lol. Even under the highest income tax in the US ($1,000,000+ @ 13.3% California, ~$600,000+ @ 37% Federal) of 50.3% (RIP state tax counting against Fed), you’re still paying $0.50 rather than saving anything when you donate. 

The next bracket below is 2% less for federal below the $600k mark & 1% less for <$1mm CA, so if you’re making $1.1mm and decide to donate $100k, congrats, you just took home $50k less and now you’re only paying 49.3% at the top instead of 50.3%

You see what I mean?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">If I'm $2000 into the high tax bracket, write off $2500 against my income, I'm no longer being taxed a full 25% against that $2000 because for all purposes my income no longer exceeds that point. Sure, I didn't get $2000 back, but if I spend that $2500 and don't write it off, I still have to pay 25% on $2000 instead of, say, 20%, which is a hundred bucks I'm not losing.

What you're not getting is to achieve not paying the tax on $2,000 you gave away $2,500. You do not come out ahead in that situation.

>You can do this here in Canada not just by buying shit and writing it off, but by putting money in your tax free savings account or RRSP, meaning you keep the money AND pay less tax on it, then pay a smaller tax when you withdraw it later

That's not what we're talking about, and yes that could be a good strategy, provided you don't think you'll need the money until you retire, and if it's like the US you're basically just passing the buck from my understanding. You'll still have to pay tax on it, just when you withdraw it from that account."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You get taxed on the total you make so irregardless of when you make the money you are going to pay the same.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please read my other comment where I explained more context.

Also, not American. Taxes work differently.

I can shave money off my income putting it in a special account, keeping the money and lowering the taxes I pay on it to zero while also reducing my income (and then getting taxed significantly less when I use it, or in the case of a TFSA, literally never paying a dime of tax on it), or by writing away home office expenses (ie. the new GPU I bought last week anyway), reducing my income to a lower tax bracket, therefore paying less on the income that went to that $1000 purchase.

Doesn't have to be a donation to reduce your income."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't have to give away $2500, what you're missing is I'm saying that if the stuff that you're writing off against your income is stuff you needed anyway, you're spending what you already would have spent but taxing that in a lower bracket. Therefore, writeoffs are far more useful than people here are making them out to be, because if you write off *enough* (and not giving away any more than you would have otherwise), you will save back a potentially significant amount from that.

For example, at least here in Canada, your computer is an office expense. I can write away a new graphics card and push myself all the way down into a lower bracket, getting some return off of that but also reducing the taxes I'm paying on the income I used to do that.

I'm not saying writeoffs are magic, but what I am saying is that the examples I've seen in this thread of people saying they're just a minor return on something are missing that you can significantly increase that return if you do take advantage of them smartly.

At least here in Canada, withdrawing from the RRSP is taxed at a much lower rate than your income, which is why it is a common strategy to avoid taxes by contributing *just* the right amount. And a TFSA is never taxed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um. No.

My check is taxed extra, as in a higher percentage is taken out, because my work thinks I make double for all my checks. I only made double for... four of them.

And my statement from the IRS saying I overpaid my taxes tells me otherwise."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Final taxes, yes, tax withholdings, no. If you make a bunch of money on overtime at the beginning of the year, they're saying you'll get more withheld as they assume that's your regular income. You get it back the following year in a tax refund, but it can still screw you over before that.

And then, while not mentioned here, there's also the issue of hard cutoffs for various social programs. Things like food stamps or housing assistance often just have a cliff threshold where if you go over it the whole benefit is scrapped. So if you get a raise that bumps you over that limit but _doesn't_ make up for the benefit money, you're losing money overall."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If you meant certain pay periods sure you might see less money temporarly but it all gets evened out when you file for the year.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Understandable. I generally assume people mean overall taxes after filing so makes little sense to worry about when your making extra money in the year as it gets averaged out. Your right but we were talking strickly taxes here.
2021-03-27 21:10:44,wallstreetbets,"$BB - 3/26/2021 - Technical Analysis and Earnings Sup ya'll, it's me again to get my weekly fix of confirmation bias.  


WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED THIS WEEK ON THE CHART:  
Still confirmed to be disconnected from WSB... for now. This is good. Drastically over solid on Thursday and saw a retest of $10 USD but got rejected. As of writing this, I would have to say \~$9.00USD is the bottom and pending reversal. Using a line starting from October 30th that touches Jan 5th, March 5th and today we dipped under the trend line, recovered, and then dipped under it again. I hope this doesn't act as resistance otherwise I'm not sure how far down we'll sink. Financials come out after hours on March 30th, so we could slide a bit more until then.  


THINGS TO LOOK FOR ON FINANCIALS:  
\-Sale of patents to Huwaeii  
\-Facebook Settlement  
\-EBIDTA Positive  
\-Revenue  
\-Debt  
All the obvious shit. I shouldn't need to remind you dinguses but with all these things in mind, this could be a very strong earnings play for those that are not in or are looking to get in. I can with strong confidence currently say all of these things will be higher than expected.   


WELL, WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SAY THAT?:  
Because I have my opinions and opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.  
But also:  
\-Massive recent hiring postings on at BB for

\-BB IVY Innovation Fund  
[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy/innovation-fund](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy/innovation-fund)  
This means they're willing to front/invest their own cash and prove their product works and is worthy of investment. Spend a little bit now, retrieve it later in subscription-based licensing and also purchase of applications, like an ""app store"" but for cars. One application that comes to mind immediately is hours-of-service apps for commercial truck drivers, but that's one main of several I have.

Lets now look at the chart:  
1 Hour:   
RSI - Massively oversold on Thursday, no surprise we had a dead cat bounce. I am also curious as to why everything rallied in the last 90 minutes across the market, not sure what to think here  
\-Bollinger bands - Tight af. Looking for breakout after that downtrend  
\-50 DMA - I'm sad we didn't hold above the 50 DMA but it's fine, it tried but ultimately lost. A expect a retest soon after financials.  
\-Trendline - as I stated above, closed Friday using the major trendline from October 30th as resistance. I'm not too concerned about it because of financials but we shall see what the financials bring  


4 hour:  
RSI - Almost oversold, on the low end. Lots of room to move up  
Bollinger bands - Thursday we oversold and did not respect the bands and got a bounce, otherwise again our dead cat bounce. I like this because this broke the falling knife.   


Daily:  
RSI - Healthy, below center. Has the room to move up or down.  
20 DMA and 50 DMA are completely in line with each other currently and have been since March 12th. I'm interested to see how this plays out. We're trading below both right now so eventually, this has to break.  
Bollinger Bands - Tightened up as best as it can prior to financials, expecting a breakout from the bottom. 

Not much else to report. Financials should be sexy. DYOD you idiots and do not take this as financial advice because last week I shit my pants playing Fortnite.

Take care"

2021-03-27 20:32:22,wallstreetbets,"Tools used to navigate the market Everyone fell in love with RH because of their clean modern interface. They introduced millions of new investors to the market with this. They achieved this by limiting the amount of information you see. RH shows the bare minimum in part to keep their app looking clean, but also to enable rash decisions they can capitalize on.

To make educated and informed decisions one needs to gather as much info on a given stock as possible and act accordingly. RH does not enable users to do this. Rather, they have treated the market like a casino with the design of their interface. After all RH is a business and the house always wins. There is plenty of articles online that dive deep into this. 

One of the biggest problems I see is in their lines graphs. Their graphs contain no keys. They show a particular stock price over an arbitrary amount of time which gives the impression that a stock is moving  more or less then it actually is. This enables users to act from their gut rather than their mind. Think of keys on a graph as resolution. Like looking at a mountain from 10ft away versus 10 miles away. Your perspective changes based on this. Without the keys there is no resolution or context to what you are looking at. 

I love casinos as much as the next guy. If that’s your bag and you love RH casino then more power to you. You do you. However, this is not a favorable approach to navigating the market for me. As much as I also love RHs UI more than any other brokerage tool, I want to see and interpret real data to drive my decisions in the market. 

My current approached consists of using Fidelity for slinging stocks and Yahoo Finance for checking my positions. With Fidelity, I have confidence that I’m not gonna get screwed with buying and selling restrictions on stocks like $GME which keeps happening with several other brokerages regardless of who is really at fault. They also have great customer service. I have never had an issue getting a hold of them and receiving answers to my questions. Try that with RH. With Yahoo Finance, you can link all your accounts and dig into real data on your positions which trains you to look at factual data and make informed decisions. 

My hope for the future is that someone can develop a clean and modern interface similar to RHs without compromise in the data department to enable users to make informed decisions. Maybe it’s out there but I’ve yet to find it. 


TLDR: I’m probably more retarded than anyone here but choose to stay away from the Carole Baskins of brokerages aka RH, so I can make retarded decisions without becoming tiger snacks."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,RH uses behavioral science techniques.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck RH
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,robinhood needs to open source its api and create a platform for data analysis like thinkscript.  TD would only need to expand on what they already have.  bring algorithmic trading to retail.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mathematically, IMHO, stock price graphs are shit as the y-axis doesn't start at $0.00, so ""apply whatever magnification is required to make the stock look like it is moving""."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you retards think of CashApp? Seriously, I'm retarded"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to burst your bubbles, but the full service brokerages hold for best price trades for their clients.  It's why you get kicked down the line.  Money talks, free gets the end of the line."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This could be liquidity adding orders (orders only inside robin hood, clients selling to clients). It would make sense to encourage internal sales, even if it delays the customers order, by doing by default what many brokers let you if you want (IB has a version of this with power fees, cause it costs them much less)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be really cool actually. From RHs standpoint, how would they benefit from this though? 

That’s literally their biggest saving grace. At this point, who would even bother using RH if there was a comparable interface from a brokerage that wasn’t shady AF. 

There are several brokerages out there. One of them just needs to step up their game and create a modern app with great data analytics. The problem IMO is that the stock market is a complex subject and trying to jam pack all the info needed to sail through it effectively is likely just too much for a small phone screen without the app becoming bulky and unwieldy. I feel like there has to be a better balance though. Where exactly do you draw the line between a clean modern interface and useful tools and data analytics."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly my point. It is no way useful. Might as well ask your dog for market advice at that point.

Update: Dog says hold. ~Continues licking his balls~"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that's just like... Your opinion, man"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"robinhood benefits by increasing trade activity.  more transactions to pinch pennies off.  having the data public may not be a disadvantage to the holders.  they could sell subscription based access, but it defeats their “free the market” culture.  they still profit from gold and margin lending, and whatever other shady shit they do.  personally i wouldnt mind paying a bit more for api access.  a $10 platinum would be 1.2% or less on accounts over $10k.

TD has done an amazing job of cross device interface with thinkorswim and thinkscript.  you can write a custom script and immediately pull it up on your phone.  its constricting in its access tho, for example you cant pull the volume of an option on the underlying without hardcoding it.  the market is complex, but data is simple; people understand scripts, they just need access."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Etrade had problems one time and it wasn’t filling orders. I sold at a lower price than when I originally wanted to sell but couldn’t be filled. They reimbursed me the difference the next day without me even messaging or calling support.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean exactly?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm on etrade too. You can ask for the level 2 realtime quotes for free. They just ask for some extra info.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where you said that Fidelity has a new app called Spire, this lead me to understand that there are multiple apps. I am ignorant af and just wanting to get started. The only thing I think I know is that I don't want to use RobinHood."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh. So if you open up a fidelity account (an individual brokerage account) you can use either app to buy or sell stocks. While there are two fidelity apps, they both would just be interacting with your one account. So for instance, any stocks traded in one app would reflect on the other. So with fidelity you have two options/apps that can be used for trading stocks from your one account. 

I would recommend just downloading both and see which one you prefer. Maybe you end up keeping and using both because you like certain features of each. Maybe not though. 

With the main fidelity app I think you have a little more control and can see a bit more info. 

With fidelity spire you don’t see as much info but is a little more user friendly as a result. 

Fidelity app:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fidelity-investments/id348177453

Fidelity Spire app:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fidelity-spire-save-invest/id1451961415


These are links to the apple store. Not sure what phone you have.

IMO there isn’t an app that even comes close to being as user friendly as RH, so I wouldn’t even think about that. Don’t even try to compare anything to RH and you will likely be better off. As you’ve prob seen in the comments there are several other options for brokerages. The post just contained my personal preferences based on the different apps I have tried. Everyone is different though. Learn what’s best for you. Just some things to think about."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for taking the time to put all that out for me!
Any negative reference I have made about RH is from what I've been seeing others say about it. I take it that you have a more positive perspective?"

**How does it work:**  I use Python to stream (Reddit and Twitter API) and store tweets and comments containing mentions about stocks.  I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

**What is sentiment:**   It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

[here](http://imgur.com/gallery/vyg92Nz) is a sample of the sentiment analysis I posted when Boeing's engine failed on UAL flight.

Is it 100% accurate? No! The program misses out of nuanced sarcasm. But when you are analysing 100's of comments the issue is not very prominent enough significantly change the results!

**Is the program public:** Yes. I have shared the GitHub repo for the code (pinned post in my profile, if mods allow I will update the GitHub link here). You can use it yourselves to track the stocks you like."

Over the last week and especially on Friday many companies: $BIDU, $IQ, $TME, $VIAC, $VIPS, $YY and many others faced lots of selling pressure from what is now being rumored to be forced liquidation of at least one highly leveraged hedge fund- Archegos Capital. Seems that they were trying to raise cash quickly last Friday to cover losses on highly leveraged trades and got margin called yesterday by GS forcing them to sell billions. Some estimates I've heard are over 10B sold across the board.

 Another hedge fund manager has been fined by the SEC for insider  trading. Bill Hwang, the founder and portfolio manager of Tiger Asia  Management and Tiger Asia Partners, agreed, along with his firm, to pay  $44 million to settle charges of engaging in two trading schemes  involving Chinese bank stocks. Altogether they were accused of making  $16.7 million in illegal profits. The regulator alleged that they sold  short three Chinese bank stocks based on confidential information they  received in private placement offerings and covered their shorts with  private placement shares bought at below market prices. In a separate  scheme, the SEC accused Hwang and his firm of trying to manipulate the  prices of Chinese bank stocks with the ultimate goal of collecting  higher management fees from investors. Hwang was one of the first hedge  funds seeded by Tiger Management’s Julian Robertson. In August, Hwang  announced he was closing down his fund."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked on the GS trading floor for 4 years.  There are two parts to this, Archegos is jammed up in insider trading again, news will hit in coming weeks likely.  Additionally, GS does a rebalance every quarter.  This is unrelated to GME.  However the strange thing is GS shut them out in one shot across the board.  They generally exercise something like this in small strategic positions to gain as much as they could.  One large basket trade is unlike them.  They were in a hurry to offload."

I think I have 2 main questions that I want answered to help me decide for myself:  


1) Does the runup in these stocks prior to this past week mean they were overvalued prior to the crash and are they now merely at fair value?

2) Is it reasonable to expect a greater drop in the prices, or is this a fire sale situation leading into a sharp V-shaped recovery?"

There simply was not enough share value covered on Friday in GS to match that number. I also imagine that liquid capital takes a working day or two to be available for margin calls.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A fraction of a fraction of whats to come with AMC and GME
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this affect AMC? Should I be buying a lot more or just more?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So?... BUY MORE GME?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they are trying to get everyone back now just an opinion why did tesla go down so hard is it because elon Twitter game stonk?  I wonder ? Just a thought
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Does that mean that buying one of those stocks would be a good call?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy VIAC or DISCA??
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The only one I'd be willing to buy is Viacom. I'm sorry but I do not buy Chinese stocks. Can't trust the government there. Look at what happened to Jack Ma
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm buying VIAC & IQ...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy that DIP 🚀🚀🚀

I got burnt Friday putting some cash into TME when it was hovering 18. Thought it might've been the global min and then it just dumped again loooool"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking the same. Every time DISCA climbed it would rapidly drop. Until the fund is fully liquidated this could rollercoaster more.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Potentially a great time for a super low ball limit order
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"i see that bigass 4.5M candle in afterhours on VIAC and DISCA.

but i heard those are just sales that were done during the day, but processed after hours or some shit.

if those block sales were done during after hours, the price would have sunken."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a friend that used to work for Bill.  This guy is the ultimate WSB degen...he told me that this the third time Bill has lost billions in this type of margin call..however in each previous instance after crashing he was able to turn several million into billions.  Friend also gave me some insight that his fund had abt 15B which was leverage at 5X...he lost a good portion of that 15B(good portion being his personal money) in one fucking day like 90%...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,One. Of. Us.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"he may have taken some extracurricular wsb classes

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like Arch*went*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was huge news.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2021/3/25/bb-china-mulls-new-state-backed-firm-to-oversee-tech-data-report

For these tech companies, data is the biggest thing they have. After this was announced, all the chinese tech companies sold off massively for 2 days straight. I guess this archegos autist mustve been leveraged long these names since the friday selloff didnt seem to make much sense to me"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It was the end of the quarter. Funds rearranging.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You $200 GME shares are not worth $200
They're just worth $200 under certain condition that also include you not selling them and other people want to buy them.

If that changes, you might get $50 or less"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how these types of moves happen and it has nothing to do with the underlying companies, and the when people went in on gme for a similar move the tv heads were all ""but what about fundamentals"". Like, what part of fundamentals wrecked the stock market this week? None. It's a game on top of a game, and it's okay to play those secondary fundamentals too."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is how Bill Hwang got from 15 million to 15 billion (1000x) in first place, by appling stupid lerverage. His mistake was not dialing it down once he got to billions."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA is the only solid play imo. It’s a growth, value, and short squeeze play all at the same time."

korean churches are the biggest long con"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"a lot of it was on hopes of their streaming services taking off, which hasnt exactly happened yet."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means there was going to be no natural opportunity for shorts to cover (particularly on Disca that has 30% of float short, billions in FCF, and a compelling growth story) and one had to be manufactured"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agreed. The story doesn’t really make sense.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting that 30% of float is short on Discovery. They were just approaching fair value given their growth prospects and financial base before this manufactured selloff. Interesting LOL
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"before you BUY the dip, find out WHY the dip. And dont just believe the first thing you come across that gives you confirmation bias, because lots of what is out there is designed to just that. The profitability or popularity of their shows doesn't neccesarily translate to the stock price evenly. Im suprised people arent dumping all their chinese stocks right now - there is a lot of tension building right now."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly would be careful buying anything right now. If more HF’s get margin called it could tank the price of the entire market
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo, no. I did some research, looked up some news articles based on the rise and dips of the stock and it looks like since the GME fiasco in January, the stock has been heavily manipulated by Wall Street. Even at its current price, it doesn't look like a good buy from numbers in their earnings report. [Here's the DD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/megnpl/hedge_fund_rumored_to_have_gotten_blown_up_forced/gsjvw4u/)"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s frightening.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah it’s not the reason, look at block trades and they match the price action to the T. Political tension has been old news for weeks/months now. They recent crash in growth caused them to be margin called"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This doesn’t explain why many Asian stocks were not nearly as affected, such as alibaba, etc. Baidu got absolutely crushed"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not quite thay dramatic but i have little doubt plenty of people/hedge funds are in for a terrible year.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their streaming service has been growing at a fast rate. They've got high debt but they've been paying it down since covid. Fundamental value, short squeeze potential, and a possible buyout are reasons I'm buying this dip heavy"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Assuming they do become r fuk, much of the market will be at a fat discount. It's like a bonus round multiplier for GME tendies"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They won't get margin called. They're too big to fail, they propped up citadel and halted action the first go around. They've all long closed out their shorts by now. They're making tons of money off this by now. GME can only undulate. There is no moon."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what I’m planning on. We will be even more rich and powerful. The only difference is we aren’t sociopaths.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you put on gloves and [ready](https://imgur.com/a/uV09Ta4) yourself.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems most or all these stocks rose sharply from Dec to March, and dropped off steeply this week. While we know their drop was due to the hedge fund blowing up, I want to know if their rise applies to their association with the hedge fund as well."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly the questions I have
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm definitely picking up some puts next week
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy at $3
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom isn’t a good company. Look into Discovery.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I consider the $40 to $50 range to be a good entry point for viac. It has strong support there
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,IQ for the low IQ folks
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I stopped out of IQ before the free fall. Opening new position again on Monday. It’s a long hold. Eyeing BIDU for a swing as well.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fake news, 3 years to comply before delisting considerations... also it was announced back in December, so not a single thing you linked makes any fucking sense. Think harder"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"you actually think this shit company Discovery is worth that much?

It was a $30 stock before the pandemic. Nothing changed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,GSX is supposed to be fraudulent. I wouldn’t touch it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah they got margin called this friday. But the highly leveraged stocks they were in started dipping last week and they were forced to sell to meet margin requirements, causing more selling pressure, and forcing them to sell even more and so on until they got margin called."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could the 300% run up be manipulated? Almost all of these stocks follow a similar pattern. Huge increase over the last 3 months, then they fall off a cliff.

Idk shit about anything but that seems suspicious."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That news got the ball rolling. It’s what initially triggered the chain of margins calls or the “long squeeze”
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's still holding above prices from January, a drop to $30 is scary 😨"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I would honestly wait a few days for DISCA. IMO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They may have to sell even more
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was leaning Baidu, but since I only have enough for a few calls on one stock, I'm going with DISCA since it's at least not exposed to the threat of being delisted from U.S. markets as a Chinese company. (Not that I think this actually matters for a few years yet)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,8 Billion in a single day is more than enough to cause massive price drops. Especially when most of these companies are worth around 20B.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's not a good reason to buy

what makes the animal stuff worth over double what the animal shit was worth in January 2020?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,funny you say that. there is solid DD suggesting this is related
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would avoid the risk with VIAC, nobody knows where this can go"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not slightly more OTM for TME, like $23 or $24? A rise over 3 weeks seems almost certain."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"How trading works is whatever you do, the stock will do the opposite."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well archegos is a asian hedge fund...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk about AH but i would say this has some relation to the nasdaq going from green to red back to green near day end. probably caused some panic amoung other hedge funds
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman Sachs lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The hedge fund bought more than they could afford using credit. The value of what they bought went down, but they still have to pay back their creditors. The creditors got nervous that they wouldn't get paid back if the value kept dropping, so they forced the fund to sell all their shit and pay them back. 

Problem is, the fund had *a lot* of shit, so selling it all at once actually caused the price to move. The implication is that this wasn't a move based on ""natural price discovery"" in the market, so the price will probably go back to ""normal"" pretty soon. So maybe consider buying calls on the things they listed. Or don't, since I haven't actually confirmed anything they said."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're serious, if you're trading on margin that's borrowed money. Whatever you bought with it is the collateral. Your broker is going to watch the value of that collateral. If it looks like it's going to drop to the point where its worth less than what you borrowed, you get a margin call, and you've either got to deposit more cash or they'll sell your shit to cover the debt."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,In this case it was hedge funds that had lots of long positions that got margin called. This one particular hedge fund was using over 5 times leverage.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not everything is GME or short selling related you dumb fuck
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only saving grace were the trade halts. Otherwise it would have kept drilling, especially when it was halted @ 2:30pm.

The momentum is still there. IMO"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those reconciled trade blocks happen in the 4:00pm candle, anything afterwards is usually a real trade."

For $5 a month, it's a steal."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not hardly. Discovery was undervalued at $70 at a comparative basis (not saying on a “real” basis j think that’s about fair value). The others, not so sure. I think this event will decouple discovery from the other hyped stocks."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"11m subs in the first 50 days and 4.9 rating in App Store with 120k reviews...

It’s a really solid product and they have a shit load of content (10x Netflix for example by last estimate) that is high margin and diversified. People don’t realize Discovery Communications is like 20 networks including Food Network, HGtV, Animal Planet, TLC, Science Channel, Magnolia, Travel Channel, Golf Tv, Motortrend, History Channel and others. 

And they were not sink or swim pre-streaming. They were doing billions in earnings and cash flow on like 11B revenue."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"3 years to comply, yes normally, however the issue with the NYSE stating it would delist some chinese companies was due to a President Trump executive order that stopped investors from investing in companies tied to the CCP military. This article simply stated that the drop in stocks were similar to when there was fear of delisting. The article didn't say that was why they dropped. Did you even read the article??? You really should as it gives several scenarios as to why this could happen and why not. It's simply an article of one mans opinion.  You really should relax lol. By the way, do you kiss your Mama with that mouth? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No probably  not. It was a knee jerk reaction. I did some looking after I said that but it’s worth what people wanna pay. It could bounce up Monday or Tuesday because of the big drop but who knows.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of hedgies claim a lot of companies are fraudulent- usually before taking a short position.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think partially, yes. Not necessarily manipulated, but also not simply just more people buying because they think it’s a good asset to own. 

The float isn’t very high, so it’s been a volatile stock. The recent performance pre-last week was partly the financial mechanics. The class A is still trading at a huge premium to the class C, and in a buyout they’d execute the same, so that’s irrational. That tells me it is still in price discovery mode with players rather than investors being shaken out or rebalancing. 

Insiders sold a good deal but not until the 60s before it peaked at like $77. After this drop Discovery released an 8k stating that insiders were not selling and were not responsible for the volatility. It’s clear to me executives are very bullish and playing a long game and have been for years with acquisitions, refinancing, deal making, and r&d/infrastructure/ investment."

Actually you may be right on it not going to 100 bc there is no more battle against selling pressure. But at the same time, there was a lot of blowing through stop losses.

They both finalized their share offering around 1pm and might bounce but I would give it a couple days to see. Bummed out about BIDU though really rooting for them"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly on this and same reason I didn't make a move Friday
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed on Viacom but disagree on Discovery. It’s a cash flow machine and crushing the steaming wars.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,When'd you buy those?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re kind of talking out of your ass with great conviction. I agree short term volatility could continue, but it’s a solid company and stock in pretty much every regard."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"For Discovery (DISCA), at least, they started a bull trend in mid November, traded sideways in December, then took off in January. But, there's some fishy shit that starts happening after January.  

On November 5th, during their Q3 2020 earnings call, Discovery unveiled their plans for their global streaming service to investors. They released the service to the UK on November 12. That's the beginning on the run up. December 2, they announce the release date of the service in the US. The stock is trading sideways at this time. December 22, it was announced Oprah traded most of her shares of her network (OWN), for a less than 1% stake in Discovery, giving Discovery a 95% stake in OWN. That started the rise in the stock. The streaming service launches in the US on January 4th. From there, it continues going up until Jan 28th, the GME fiasco which tanked the market. It recovers shortly after and continues rising until earnings on Feb 22.  

Investors were disappointed in the numbers and the stock fell until Feb 26th. Guess what happened on the 26th? Our great friends at Motley Fool posted a bunch of articles about Wall Street loving Discovery and why you should invest. It starts a crazy bull run until March 8th. On March 8th during after hours, CNBC publishes an article titled ""Move over GameStop: Discovery, AMC Networks are latest heavily shorted stocks to see huge 2021 gains."" The next day, the stock drops, but quickly recovers after. March 16th, the CEO sold off 199k shares which caused a dip the next day. It recovers, but on March 22nd, right before the market opens, Motley Fool publishes an article called ""3 Bargain-Priced Value Stocks That Could Double Your Money."" Discovery was listed as one of those three and guess what happens on that date? The stock starts to plummet. The next day, the stock gets downgraded by UBS from neutral to sell and the sell off continues.

It seems like it ""started"" with streaming optimism, but tin-foil hat me says it got manipulated by Wall Street after we fucked them in January."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check for them in ETF holdings, that may be the link there!

When GME shorts were hiding in ETFs I noticed a lot of random ass companies were seeing price surges for no discernible reason. Companies like Expedia or MIGI. It would make sense according to the theory that they go long in other ETF holdings while shorting the ETF itself to drop GME's price in feb"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so let me get this straight, buy when it goes up, then when it goes down, sell and wait. When it goes up again, buy, and when it goes down enough, panic sell. That's the most successful WSB strategy in existence, no?"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"> but these stocks started dropping on Tuesday not Thursday or Friday

Because the new SEC law is negative news. Of course it's going to drop. We're talking about the bottom falling out, which was definitely on Thursday night/friday morning would be because of the liquidation and likely means most of them will rapidly recover."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"BIDU, Tencent, PDD, and JD all closed green after dipping midday. Unless that was shorts covering, I think this is the lowest we go barring some huge negative China/US news. BABA and JD are near very strong support levels, $220 and $80 respectively."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,sure. But sometimes they are right. Go ahead if you want. But IV is sky high compared to viacom and discovery. Not as worth it to play the bounce.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Any concerns about the offering announced?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure you could argue that many of these stocks were overvalued to begin with but you can’t deny that the recent price action and billion dollar sell blocks are the main reason the price is down so much over a short period of time. The market has not *naturally* priced these stocks down at the levels they are trading at. Fears of delisting got the ball rolling in the chain of sell offs but i believe it has reached a point of oversold as of Friday, at least temporarily."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How fortunate it would be for them to be private they need extra advantages they weren't already born with.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I reckon if that were going to happen it would have already happened, but yes. There can be knock on effects from this sort of thing, and I'm sure more than one account found itself in a margin call in the fallout from this."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they're definitely right sometimes.  I remember a hedge fund announced that Enphase was fraud (when it was around 20 usd per share). They announced it along with their short position, and the stock dropped like 20% the next day. 

I'm not sure if enphase did commit fraud, but I haven't heard anything about it after they announced it that day."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not at all, it lines up pretty well with the companys planned post-merger deleveraging and investment in new content.

It's responsible for them to raise capital through issuing shares to make sure their streaming service stays competitive and they've proven themselves by producing sucessful original series for other platforms.

By 2024 they plan on spending 5B/yr on new content for Paramount+, so this is this was the right choice.

Just because the market overreacted doesn't mean the decision was wrong. 

There we're a lot of people trading the stock off momentum trying to make a quick buck. Lots of them closed their positions, while a huge fund blew up, and new stock was issued leading to a huge liquidity disconnect.

Once things normalize I expect the stock to recover."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think were both correct. My only point is that while this one firms selling may have had an effect on the price drop i wouldn’t necessarily call them buying opportunities.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, if anything, this has shown that there were possibly more forces at play on the rise for these stocks than we know.

It’s all sketch in the short term."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, I mean, aside from any initial inrush, is it really a good long term investment?

A non tech company with a PE above 15 is kind of something most people should avoid. 

If it crashes again this week (50/50 shot) it will most likely just barcode again afterwards, as it has done for a long time prior to the retail inrush it had.

Additionally, a ton of people are underwater on their shares now, so there is going to be downward pressure if the price does increase as people who saw red for potentially weeks/months start to get out the second they see green again.

There are better places for your money long term, Discovery was a good investment prior, I don’t think it ever will be the same caliber again. IMO, of course."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I get my press pass?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be right. I think that calculus is somewhat out of touch with “average” person behavior. They have some of the most popular content in the world (highest viewership channels), in addition to premier league, golf, motor trend, and Olympics rights in EU. 

People watch a ton of TV and consume a ton of media in general. That’s not changing with the advent of remote work (this is not going back to “normal” for a lot of huge companies). 

Their streaming service hit 11m subs in the first 50 days as of February 22 and has 120k reviews in Apples App Store with a 4.9 rating. Those are exceptional numbers."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. I was getting very uncomfortable with the rapidity of the run up. More financial mechanics than new interest. This recent event is oddly drawing new scrutiny which is good in light of the facts. More eyes on good companies is good for their investors. Shaking out speculators like Archegos is also good ha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Discovery is a tech company as much as Netflix is, with more content, higher margin production, higher earnings and cash flow (pre steaming) and a better UI/UX (imo). 

People like the Disney brand. The comparative valuation of Netflix and Disney vs Discovery given their recent phenomenal execution and launch of streaming is absurd.

If you want to argue the former 2 stocks are overvalued, I’m all ears but we are talking an order of magnitude difference purely based on perception, not numbers or prospects. 

See other posts."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did some research today, hope it's of use to any fellow apes looking at profiting from the Suez Canal closure.

**Tide tables:**  They have until Wednesday 31st to float the Ever Given with neap tides  of 2.1m. After this date high tides drop dramatically until after the  25th of April.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:**  Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no  vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed  around the Cape of Good Hope as yet.

**Location of crane ships:**  If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be  partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few  crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting  containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks. Remarkably a suitable  ship, the Saipem 3000, is currently located in the Red Sea en route to  Turkey via Suez. There are also 3 similar vessels currently docked in  the Persian Gulf."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Building a ship to withstand a massive hurricane and building a shit to handle being grounded on the bow and stern are different things. Big waves are a lot more forgiving than being run aground in a 220 thousand tonne ship there isn't exactly a safe lifting point the ships ok with resting it's weight on. The ocean is dynamic ground is quite static completely different load types.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"These ships are built for the not-so-violent waters of the Asia-Suez-Europe route (so thinner hulls), and are the largest moveable objects on earth. Their shape and size makes them more vulnerable to wind than sailing ships and you can't just hit the brakes with them. Their pure mass means that if you are moving at all and lose power/stearing, it's brace for impact, especially when the shore is just a few feet away. There's nothing you can do when things go south."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so seems like the latest attempt didn’t work -  however it will eventually - probably missed the boat ( no pun intended / maybe a little ) on exploiting this related to transportation of goods and schedules - however might be a good time to look into dredging companies as they need to dredge that fucking canal so this doest happen again... unless big oil decides to stage a little incident

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's possible but it's a lot more simple to assume the maintenance for the ship was skipped and the captain fucked up since the apparently lots power before crashing while going 5 knots faster than normal. I think it makes more sense that it's just incompetence on a small scale and not a something bigger but it would present a good opportunity for a lot of powerful entities for the suez to be blocked. 

For one China has been trying to get their land route up and running for a while this would be the perfect time to have the belt and road program they've been working on for years. Or it could be someone trying to fuck over chinese shipping or something else who knows. 

All I know is I'm betting this bitch stays stuck and possible even breaks up from the stress. Either way their gonna have to unload a decent amount of cargo IMO."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had enough for that much GameStop.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest is unprecedented. Why shouldn’t the returns be unprecedented? I’m holding GME for 7 figures.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooops.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it say puts?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The premium at expiration was hovering around 85 at the time. 15 more than my pay. I'll eat it and sell cc's and make fatties on the way up.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a put at 260, you gain the ability to sell the put creator 100 shares at 260 regardless of the price.

If you sell a put at 260, you sell someone the ability to sell you 100 shares at 260 regardless of the price.

So as a put creator you only make money when you sell the contract, and only keep it if the contract expires worthless or the contract holder chooses not to exercise for some ungodly reason."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"in that case he'd make money if it's over 190 since he said in comments that the premium was 70, but he'd have made the trade's max profit if it was over 260 yesterday"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold puts to open the position.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maximum risk is strike price diff - net credit in entering the spread. If stock crashed to $50 you wouldn’t want to sell the lower put because you end up being assigned shares that are greatly devalued. Why be assigned the shares at 150 when you can buy them at 50? With the IV on GME options, you technically could sell that put for a value greater than the loss on the 150 you get assigned but then you’re still stuck with 150s when price is 50 and it can go lower. Versus holding the lower put, only taking the loss of the max risk, then buying those $50 shares and riding it back up. That’s really the point of doing the spread in the first place, limiting risk, but that only works by holding both legs. People say oh I’m fine with being assigned shares cause my effective cost is lower which is true...until you use the cash you got from selling the puts. If it closes in between the spreads, you prob still gain but the gains are greatly diminished. Break even is higher strike - net credit. And if you try to be clever and sell the lower put when it still has value on 0dte because you think it will close in between, you run the risk of it shooting down in the final 1-2 hours (most brokers don’t allow or only allow 0dte until 2PM ET)."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thankssss

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know you could have bought back the options once the price started dropping a bit and it was obvious it wasn't going to hit > 260?  Would have lost some $, but less than overpaying for 200 shares. 

But since you have them now, perhaps a covered call to make some $ back?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"To clarify the option *PREMIUM* paid was $70 share / 7K per contract.

When the contract was exercised, OP had to pay $260 per share for the stock.  (@ 200 shares = 52K)

Subtracting the 70/per share in premium paid made his effective cost $260 - 70 = $190 per share.  (slightly above current market price)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,10% or more a week isn't bad dude
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling FDs more lucrative.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta gang is playing theta. Explore more strategies employed by its members before claiming you know everything.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""way OTM cash secured put spreads"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, the spread shrinks your gains, but if you are just selling a cash secured put at the right level you can definitely make around 10% a week with gme."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm theta decays fastest in the last few weeks. I'd say it's theta gang. Semantics.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"A cash secured put is selling a put options contract and your broker keeps the money you would need to buy the shares at the strike price if you got assigned. 

So for example, if you sell a 150 strike put, the ""cash secured"" is 15k in collateral, because you have to guarantee the ability to buy 100 shares at a price of 150. 

A spread, is where you buy another put contract at a lower strike price (say 140 instead of 150). Since it is further out of the money, you pay less for it than you receive for selling the 150 strike, and receive a net credit.  

The advantage of doing that is if the stock price tanks, say to 50, if you had only sold the 150 put and got assigned, you would effectively lose 10k ($100 x 100 shares). With the 140 put, you only lose 1k (you have to buy the 100 shares at 150, but have the right to sell them at 140).  It effective caps your losses at 1k.

The disadvantage is paying for the other put contract drastically reduces your gains from selling the original 150 strike put."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So you sell a put at $150 and buy a put at $140?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those PLTR calls. 
Goddam. 

Godspeed."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Be careful holding those GME calls any later then next week. Once they turn into weeklies theta explodes and they bleed value really quickly.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR is going to pay off.  GME probably a loss
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest is unprecedented. Why shouldn’t the returns be unprecedented? I’m holding GME for 7 figures.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are both printing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"23 shares GME @216, 380 shares PLTR @24, 1K shares BB @9.99, 180 shares SPCE @27

And F LEAPS, AMD July call that's bleeding out"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope they do. None of mine did. I just get shares now.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sir
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity. Get the FUCK of Robinhood OP!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The ui is too appealing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR shares are also structured so the founders can sell all their class A shares while still retaining full control of the company. And Peter thiel sold off a few million shares at lock up, but his various shell companies bought a lot more at the same time, so I’m not really too worried about insiders selling"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,AI would like to have a word with you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,it's a good company
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Work has actually been enjoyable since I started actively trading.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah shares are the way for PLTR.. But this expiry seems logical. A bit too logical for WallStreetBets 🙂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"good company, terrible stock"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell any calls on it?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, June counts as a long play so long as you’re talking about June 2026."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy’s.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just read Pfizer is cutting ties with Moderna over mrna vaccines. They said they don't need them and can produce in house in the future.  Don't know if it makes an impact for you.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are so negative on it?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It was on one of my news feeds.  Don't remember which one.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it but you need to look at the Chart I traded it from 109 to 180 sold and will rebuy the low. Just trying to help you.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought charts just work on stable stocks
 Biotech stocks are mostly driven by news"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a lot of work for someone who isn't Michael Jordan
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But are you a cat?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sadly people believe stuff with a single twit or a clickbait story and not even reading it. MJ would never short GME, That's not saying he wouldn't dunk over the shorty GME"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He shared a clubs ownership with gaybe plotkin which is good enough for me to know those two are in bed with each other.

Anyone who surrounds himself with proven fraudsters and insider traders (look up SAC) is the same trash in my book.


Shane on 23. This is a bigger fuck up than baseball or golf"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It sounds to me like Michael Jordan lost 500 mil and asked you to post here that he didn’t
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You also cant prove that he doesn't so
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,*after watching last dance*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Im pretty sure everybody knows MJ didnt personally short GME lmao
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao you had to clarify that you indeed were not Michael Jordan? how do we know this for sure?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is getting way too retarded
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You seem naive regarding relationship building in one percenters
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,On its face it makes no sense to begin with
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"So is MJ a GME retard or nah, because it be a lot cooler if he was"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,your tldr is too long
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The MJ fiasco posts made me realize how retarded all of you are and don't actually read shit. Some of you are embarassing
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a stake in this whole thing, but the paranoid distrust of the media is awfully qanon."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirmation. I am biased.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You just made me google Beyoncé divorce...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"MJ was a known reckless gamblers so i think that makes him a part of WSB.
There you have it you can quote me on it 

""Michael Jordan made billions buying gamestop stocks"""
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No need to take it personally
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope that he closed his positions so don't have to return to prosport again.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"wait, did the real michael jordan post this?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess we’re all gonna forget when MJ said “fuck dem kids”
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This example of Being duped really does explain a lot of Reddit’s political axes
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody cares about Jordan. Why is this even talked about.  


Dude thinks he can fly.  
Dude thinks he can touch the sky.  
Dude thinks about it every night and day.  


dude is a simp for flying"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was fishy FUD, Who can we make the fall guy who they like....MJ"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I've googled days before and it was saying that he was a Melvin capital investor and has lost money with GameStop. 

Even if he's Michael Jordan, he is a HF, though."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,NBA players have *way* better money management skills than us
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you not entertained?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t give a fuck about Michael Jordan either way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,If I don't do my research I dont really talk about.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So if Melvin is bankrupt Jordan can buy the dip on the stake in his team?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would be a lot funnier without the ""me:"" shit. You sound like a 10 year old that got a hold of their parents' YouTube account and is spamming shit in the comment sections"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really don't know (how can we?) what is going on but the article was written in a major newspaper so you'd think if it weren't true, he'd (or his rep) have released a statement of some kind refuting it. idk but I've seen lots of celebs clap back on fake news (unless he just decided to sue them or get them to retract/correct the story). I do think though that \*IF\* he was involved in a short, I highly doubt Michael Jordan would allow his broker/adviser, etc make HUGE risky decisions like that without getting approval...I'm pretty sure most wealthy people put their money in to invest in solid (boring) investments, not basically let them make risky gambles like it's a roulette table.

idk, either way, obviously he wasn't doing it personally, but (if true) allowed Melvin to do it for him, so yeah, it wouldn't be him personally."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it really so much the media ? I only saw that post HERE and I saw mob mentality talking shit about Jordan adding more validity to it .... then I clicked on an article read the facts which were lacking in any real confirmation that he had a position in GME or even anything to do with Gabe outside the team. But everyone was so eager to share something GME related for validation from the cult THEY don’t care to check it themselves
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I am Megatron
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like Forbes. It's neutral. I like good journalism. Emotionless. Facts. Most of the time however, I start reading any article online and it's far left agenda is not even hidden, it is displayed with pride."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put the torch down. I understand it is fashionable now, but witch hunting and burning people at the stake is wrong, barbaric and hypocritical. And forcefully controlling speech and thought isn't the way to go either."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,its called a straddle
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m from upstate NY and we don’t hate the tang up here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the only straddling going on here was between my wife and her bf
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No it's all true. Honest.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,no thats called a strangle
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,WRONG. Your wife and my boyfriend.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you considered that said business could be a sharply declining ownership stake in Melvin Capital, which may have been part of the deal when selling part of the baskets team? That’s pretty much the entire implication here."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could be, it could be not be. It’s a much more reasonable assumption to say not, considering how many possible investment opportunities there are, and you’re assuming he’s in one specific one."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You know every single business MJ has stock in?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely agree that it’s total speculation. But did he really go from “multibillionaire” to “billionaire”? Maybe some journalist will violate the hell out of his privacy and ask him. It’s just money.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hornets are an asset. Jordan is the owner. Plotkin bought a minority stake, his fund was fucked, so now he will probably sell his stake to raise money. There may have been a possibility of him buying the entire team which is out of the question now, but so what, someone else will buy eventually. The only way Jordan might be burned by gme is this scenario where he suddenly went fully retarded and YOLOed 500 million in Citron and his portfolio manager at Citron YOLOed 100% in gme shorts."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could’ve been the suez shipping company. Can I prove it, certainly not."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,500 mil of Jordans stuck in canal being eaten by hungry wabbits
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My grandfather uncles and father worked for Otis and have been ueic2 (or whatever the fuxk) since before I was born.  I don’t work for them and all but my dad is retired (2 more years) but all they do is talk shit about them. Short it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but BEARS take the window down. Thanks Humbled Trader, lol..."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard Ricky Is pretty bad
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just buy long calls in a month as it should recover from the dip this will cause right?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like my Dad
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is highly accurate. I am a master sparky so I get to walk around looking busy watching everyone else pretend to be busy while the rookie is busy.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Do the elevator have a point they can't be put in anymore? Like if they can't get an elevator can it be put in last minute or would they have to stop building long before?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point! Could definitely wait to play it that way too.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, they really counter-weight your ability to rise up through the union. Much difficult."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elevators are required by code in the US for most commercial buildings over one story. Everything else could be finished and the shaft could be left empty, but the building would not be allowed to be occupied until the elevator is complete. Elevators are built inside the shaft in small pieces, thousands and thousands of small pieces."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's definitely a more costly upfront to go long but seems a lot safer of a play to buy the artificial dip than to play puts on it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it so they can finish everything else but can't open until the elevator is done sounds like a nice pain in the ass
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually last summer I was on a job with this exact issue. Entire building was completed minus the elevator. Know what they did? The put Sheetrock up over the openings, threw some mud on, sanded and finished them and opened up the building"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Id say puts print harder because of fear. You can always sell if you feel the bottom has been hit then flip to the long side.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Home window shortages are delaying home builds up to 2-months currently.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds almost like way to many new houses are being built and we're ripe for another housing meltdown.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s not enough new housing right now. Atleast in Florida.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well those people came from somewhere
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,From renting homes and renting apartments.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,My point is if there what appears to be mass influx of people that new homes can't keep up with somewhere there's likely gonna be an empty home or apartment.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,COVID set builders back. The housing boom is more of a backlog of home buyers

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a casino, there are no stupid decisions"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on the family. Some parents start asking for rent when you turn 18 to flush you out.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna go big on Ford when it drops under 10 bucks.

Looking forward to seeing a new kind of thunderbird, but it's a long ways out i think.

If they can shift to electric, I see them as a bigger play than alternate Tesla competitors ( only from a car position, not batteries and storage tech)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford has been been on a downtrend since until Farley took over as CEO last oct. I’m confident that he’ll be able to turn this boomer around: EV initiatives in Europe, issuing notes to pay down debts. I think the next catalyst would be any positive news pertinent to the semiconductor shortage."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ford dropping to $10 would be great if I could average down before my account gets blown up from margin call.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Got assigned and I've been selling them the last few weeks.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably Ford as much as Tesla. Dont forget ford is probably selling most of their cars via financing (which is somewhat reliant on low interest rates) and they have an absolutely fucked pension liability that is sucking up their FCF for the next billion years and thatll only persist or worsen. You should check fords long term debt to long term assets ratio! Also if at least Tesla has a cult like fanbase, ford doesnt exactly have the same outside of trucks and a couple select models. Meanwhile Tesla is the poster child for electrification"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford and Tesla are both selling on credit, you think people buying Tesla’s are using straight cash? When rates are 1-2%? The rich buy on credit so they can put the rest of the money to work, the poor because it’s cheap to do so.

Lastly, rabid fans are just that, fans. Elon knew it too and why he wanted to make the model 3 no? Get a cheaper car out there so it’s a no brain der and you don’t have to rely on first adopter fans shelling out money.

All the farmers I know drive fords and roll coal.."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check long term liabilities bruh, ford is jacked to the tits"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you google the two terms above? If I issue debt, and inflation takes hold, and then I can now get short term treasuries paying more then the debt I issued, my debt value falls. I can literally take my money buy treasuries and the money I get there use to pay the debt, and then keep the remainder. It’s called a debt valuation adjustment, take a look at 2008-9 and you’ll see what happened as an example it’ll make ford more valuable not less. I’m over simplifying nut you probably get my point. On the reverse, inflation will make my cash worth less.

On your pension point, not sure if that’s inflation adjusted, I don’t think it is, so another win there."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont see how ford is going to borrow for less than a 10y treasury but ok
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you serious? Look at the 70s and 80s with the volcker recession. Treasuries were paying 14% 

None of what I wrote about as the 3 scenarios to drive all this is made up, all those events happened in the past. 

Again, Tesla has a bright future, they’ll make it through, but if what I stated happens they’ll likely tank hard, at which point I’d love to buy, till then I’m stuck with ford runner up to the ev race, could be Volkswagen, but like I said, I hate Volkswagen on principle.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well yeah if treasury yields go up to 9 or 10% (Fords last bonds sold with a 8.5-9.625% yield) then sure they can do this carry trade you speak of. And I'm aware of the volker recession and you're right yields might skyrocket it could happen and even might given that the Fed's expect inflation at 4-6% this year but going from 1.5 on the ten year to 10 would be a hell of a move. Btw I'm not suggesting Tesla wont crash as well it's clearly a volatile stock and is price on a decades worth of promises. Also why couldn't Tesla take advantage of the same dynamic ford would but with much smaller pension obligations and such?

Think about it, if the stock market was not manipulated why wouldn't all stocks remain at an agreed upon price until their earnings and then switch to another agreed upon price? Do a quick Google search for ""examples of stock manipulation"" and you'll see that everything that happened to gme actually happens to other stocks too"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Any fucking time
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hm interesting question. 

I don't have specific evidence to prove otherwise, but I don't think A.I. is used to create algorithms that trading bots run on.

Trading bots are only as good as the parameters they run on, and parameters are determined by financial analysts who work for hedge funds. 

To your second point, I'm not sure what the difference is between doing work and turning on algorithms. These are essentially the same thing. 

As for wsb vs a.i., I disagree. Markets move because it's whale vs whale. Retail accounts for less than 6%, although it's not insignificant by any means, whales are constantly fighting because they love money"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are entitled to your opinion! Although, I disagree. Volatility drives technical analysis. A lot of commenters seem to think TA works only under ""perfect conditions"" but the reality is all stock movement is driven by manipulation. Otherwise, all stocks would remain an agreed upon price until earnings and then would immediately change to another agreed upon price. Also retail accounts for less than 6% of gme volume. This is a battle of whales as all battles in the market are."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally a take that makes sense
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you have your terminology a little mixed up. Fundamentals refers to the current business conditions of a company. For example, the fundamentals for gme would be Ryan Cohen has a 10%+ stake in the company, the company has been cashflow positive over the past year, and the company is planning to move into the e-commerce space. 

My post is technical analysis, which refers to the general market psychology represented by chart patterns."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your sentiment is common here, which I find is interesting. I would like to understand where you get your take from?

My reason for phrasing this way is that all stocks are manipulated. Do a quick Google search: ""stock manipulation examples"". You will find that the examples that happened to gme have specifically named strategies for manipulation. You will also find these strategies are actually applied to all stocks moving up or down"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if short attacks have destroyed anything actually. I understand your sentiment to distrust blatant manipulation but TA (as well as any movement up or down) actually relies on manipulation. All stocks are manipulated, that's why price goes up or down. If there was no manipulation, prices would be at an agreed upon price until earnings where the price immediately changes to another agreed upon price."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah I actually agree with your sentiment. I tried to provide other points to prove my thesis but in the end you're right. It could simply go tits up or to the moon. My post is just one thesis of how things might be going that I backed with proven indicators, examples and analysis"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo same

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This^
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you much appreciated
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,i agree
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no, technical analysis can give you insight into *what* is being done and how it is being manipulated. The stock price still follows the normal rules, supports and resistance still matter on the chart, it is how the stock gets to those lines that is the manipulation imo. For example, the last 2 weeks we have seen an enormous spike in AH trading. Imo That is what has causes the movements in price we have seen. For this reason when looking at premarket volume can give you insight as to where the stock will go for the day. For example, Friday saw enough volume to make the price test resistance briefly before falling back down to support. With this context the days price action makes a lot of sense.

So yeah, any predictions based on tech analysis right now should be taken with a grain of salt, but it's still helpful information to have"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There is actually a lot of DD on the questions you are asking. I would filter by DD flair and just do a page search of the keywords of your question. You'll find your answers there
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course! I do have two suggestions for you: 

1. Base buys off of momentum ie. Low volume but price is growing, then buy. Low volume and price is dropping, then consider buying but understand it might keep dropping. High volume and price is going up, then you can buy but understand up trend is too volatile for a long position. High volume and price is going down, then stay far away.

2. Keep a trading journal that has your positions and the reasons why you made the action. Better yet, put your goals into the journal and every quarter analyze if your decisions match your goals"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Learned something new! Really appreciate the tips. I’ll take this into consideration when buying
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This market has clearly turned me into a cynical dick, because when I saw ""$BB earnings call this week"" my first thought was, ""oh shit, I almost forgot to buy those puts!"" 

I don't like it, but I'm still gonna do it. It feels like these days = ""good news... Oh shit, sell!!!"" ... ""Bad news... Oh shit, sell!!!""

Every time I get excited about a stock I own, I wish I would have bought puts. Maybe buy some just in case. It does weird things to your mental state not knowing if you want the price to go up or down. If it drops, take your put earnings to buy the dip, if it jumps, be excited about your value increase. I'm literally thinking this for the first time as I write this, thinking I might try it. I'm sure there's technical term for the idea that I just ""invented"", and it's probably not a good idea, so maybe don't do it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't play this earnings either way, but puts seems like the ""safe"" choice. The market does a funny thing sometimes though and does the opposite of what everyone expects."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it does. I think there are long trends that will sometimes reverse, and the last year feels like a consistent series of companies beating earnings estimates and then having their price get shit canned. My observations have been that this is much more common in non dividend paying companies. I don't have a large dataset, so this might not be universal, but between you and me, I'm not going to actually do this with $BB, but looking at the last few years of earnings calls for a few companies I've been watching had definitely emboldened me to buy a few extra puts in the next few weeks."

I recommend to family when it was part of eBay and Icahn got involved — eBay was dead money at the time, but it was clear what was going to happen once trying to compete with Amazon was given up

EBay is old school — lot of Bain tactics at play... and they don’t want to be a division of some growth company... but PayPal got incubated past needing them... in payments — they beat everyone; then scaled past Discover and Amex in an area that’s killed off or marginalized everyone that’s tried for 20+ years

Even now, newer players try to make a name and swim around them, find a niche or coexist.... they really are the big swinging dick in global online payments imo

It’s hardly a hot play — but that’s not what this account is for."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t pay off the mortgage to live in the house; I have other funds, income — including more PP (at higher buy in)

This was just meant as an emergency account to service the home — but grew to basically pay for it.

However - if I pay it off, I’ll qualify to buy another real asset (leverage) that produces income / rev at a favorable rate, with terms that are favorable.

So the money is still working for me, but with a bit of risk mitigation / diversification baked in for personal reasons.

I appreciate the post, Reddit at its best :)"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think “congrats, fuck you” is the “Pepperidge Farms remembers” slogan of WSB gain posts

Like when your friend Josh high fives you for getting that hot girls number — then punches you in the dick as soon as she walks by..

One one hand ... Fuck Josh

On the other ... you love Josh

Think my hypothetical wife and imaginary friend ran off together ;)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Isnt a paperwork shuffle worth not losing a lot of capital in the short term
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"With current tax laws, your mortgage interest probably doesn't put you over standard deduction. So if you refinance and take the money saved and stick it in VTSAX (i know, boomer) you make out way ahead over time."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"dude, terrible advice, investing in an index instead of paying down low interest mortgage = money ahead"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. By now a very solid play. Still has lots of upside IMO, once we are through the rough of the current high volatility market. But who knows, this may also be the new normal.

Also recommended TSLA to them @ $93. But I doubt that they bought either of my recommendatins ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, cool cool cool. Well done stranger!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have other capital/income — the problem is I want to be able to return to the area for my folks, so I can’t sell the place and move.

The thoughts kicking around is keep this, pay it off — which preserves everything and takes it out of the liability column for a new loan

I can rent it out, and don’t have to show that as income to make the bank happy— it’s uncommitted dry powder - and could cover the new mortgage on the new place 100%

Add a HELOC for emergency access

I get the terms I want on the new loan, which is more siloed

So it’s not completely sunk money — but it seems to be the best way to create cash flow advantages and secure the terms I want — and not wait 5 years 

The rates are historically low, about 9% of remaining my payments at this point would be interest. Taxes are going to suck — but less because of the pandemic

It’s not optimal — but makes everyone happy"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So if I buy stocks on a credit card they only need to go up like 25% for me to make money!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll talk to my girlfriend, thanks!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen. Smart ape. Do this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit where were you when i refinanced? Got a 2.5% 15 and it was the best rate I found in June.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That compounds daily
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Give it enough years and youll receive your guarantee than
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It was done intentionally so we can blame inflation on it.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate heist movies
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I am *never* gonna financially recover from this.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I have to call my broker"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you just might have lost $1400.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've lost 49% but HODL is the plan. Revenue growth is good, short interest is at 19%. At under 3B market cap some big player might want to acquire them."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of negative talk here but this could explain why FUBO tanked last week:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mer0gl/tiger_cub_archegos_liquidation_and_fridays_market/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dumped my Fubo when it went on that massive run up in December. The way I was looking at it was their big appeal is going to be integrated sports betting but as of right now that would only even be legal in a few limited markets. 

If that's your reasoning for holding the stock and you believe that there is a big future in that market then I would hold, I wouldn't even look at the price of it day to day though until they have integrated betting into the app."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, it's your dime-a-dozen ambulance chasing class action suit, the same shit you see on a million other tickers. There are firms that exist solely to troll for class action suits on any company who's stock drops in price. Inexperienced traders who don't know better would see lawsuit news and panic, most people should know better."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"YouTube tv is the same price. AT&T TV is higher.  Fubo is a replacement for cable. The price of all of these is higher than Hulu because of the number of channels.  My cable company charges almost double Fubo’s price for that many channels and a dvr service.   Plus I had to renegotiate a bundle price with cable every year which is a PITA.

You can argue there’s not a big enough market for this service and it will fail, but you can’t just compare it to Netflix or Hulu on price alone. That makes no sense."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am in the same boat. The fact that I feel so good about it has to mean I’m fucked.

Guess I’ll just buy more calls on Monday - with the low volume & the days to cover (all of the short positions) it seems destined for a gamma event. The Shorts b-holes will certainly be puckered if earnings blast away estimates."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,but all your calls are for tech/growth shit. THEY can tank without the market as a whole dropping. Honestly I think you’d be better off with ARKK puts as a hedge
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was thinking that I had to change it up a bit based on my portfolio. I also have more of a cost basis on spy calls in fidelity portfolio though so I got some cheap OTM puts on DIA when I obtained those. If it failed to break all time high it could dip hard was the thought at the time.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure we will see a runup at some point this week. Best of luck
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would worry about it going to -70k instead of -14k.
Buy shares, not options."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo I would make a decision Monday one way or another. Theta decay on weeklies is astronomical, those are going to be hemorrhaging value faster than you might expect if the stock price doesn't meteor enough to offset it."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah the one thing that is an absolute certainty is that weekly calls will get theta fucked.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some disca puts Friday, then the share price immediately started going back up. Im praying to the gods, old and the new, that its just a dead cat bounce, because im riding this bitch out for complete loss or astronomical gain."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Add me! I/bigdogdee6 I’ve been longing to trade ever since I found out about stocks at a young age! Of course getting rich always seemed cool but the idea to own a part of any publicly traded company always sounded so amazing and way more valuable to me my father always told me how important ownership is. Watching some of these companies I remember start up as a kid hearing about the speculation between them and then end up dominating the market like Amazon and google and so many more is pretty wild. When I first got my chance to get into the stock market at 18 I hesitated on investing at all until this year at age 22! I can’t tell you guys enough how more involved I would’ve been and where I would’ve been in the stock market now!

About me: A long time ago, I started paper trading and entered a competition on Investopedia. I had no previous experience with stocks, so I just started learning as much as I could.

Well, I ended up placing in the top 100!!!

I had no money of my own to start investing, but when I mentioned it to my ex-husband, he gave me $500 to invest and said if I made a profit, we would split it, but if I lost it, he would just take the hit.

6 weeks later, I had already doubled the money! But then my boss told me I needed to stop doing that at work, so that's where it ended because I was at work during market hours.

Months later, I heard about Google's upcoming IPO, and I knew it would skyrocket. I was itching to buy, but by the time it went public, I didn't have anything to invest. Now I wish I would have borrowed the money.

It was when I found wsb last December that I started trading again (I'm out of work right now, so I have the time). I initially diversified, but then sold everything to invest in Gamestop.

Compared to you guys, I'm still far behind in my knowledge and experience, but I've been excitedly learning a little every day! Now if I could only wrap my head around options..."

I want to be TRULY financially independent, not a wage slave to a corporation with schedules and dress codes and overly abused at-will employment.

I want to make up for 25 years of missing out on life and being miserable and lonely! I want to be able to stand on my own feet and not have my livelihood in anyone else’s control other than myself!

I want to be able to survive any upcoming economic crashes and inflation. 

I want to have potentially limitless gains (outside of commission based jobs, most jobs have either an hourly or salary pay cap that can’t be exceeded, even if you’re top employee).

I don’t want to be chained to any specific location.

I also NEED to be able to afford healthcare costs, indefinitely. Here in the US, those costs will probably keep rising too. Just because you have health insurance, doesn’t mean you can’t get into some deep debt.

I can’t stand the thought of investing only being for the distant future, like for “retirement”. I’m 25 and missed out on most normal parts of being young, I freak out just seeing old people now.

I don’t have a real plan on how to get my life where I want it in the immediate/short-term. I’m now facing multiple issues at once, some with a time limit (like health insurance being cut when I turn 26, and having to either have even smaller paychecks for my own or trying to get on Medicaid?)

Everything has piled up, nothing worked itself out like my young naive ass ASSumed it would.

I’m on multiple meds that may be responsible for my years of apathy and lethargy, among other symptoms. And I could potentially be suddenly unable to afford them after the year ends, and SSRI withdrawal? Pure horror, possibly permanently disabling beyond what it did WHILE ON IT.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you say? I can’t read either.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets say TLRY goes to 35-40. Do you think APHA will go to 35-40 as well? I always compare the mergers to Sunrun and Vivint. Pretty much they were raising at the same % and then vivint’s shares became Sunrun at the ratio 2:1 (if my memory does not play tricks that late in the night). I do not recollect how the options behaved back then. Any insights?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Highly regretti buying APHA and TLRY super high when GME was below 60$
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Why 0.83ish - smooth brain asking here. Did not look at what each stand at now. It’ because now they are at this ratio to each other?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged up and had to average down. Bit more than I wanted to do.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really,  I am new to the stock hustle.  I just see a possibility.

Basically the way I see it what you are trying to do is find a stock that you can put your money on that could make you money over time.  It is all about what price you pay and what price you sell at.

By my understanding the two companies are going to one.  It sounds like one share of APHA is becoming TLRY @ .8 to 1.  Which is about right.  I was thinking of buying APHA over TLRY but the average price of APHA is 17 and TLRY is 21 - 22.  If you take 22 x .8 you get 17.6.  So, they are essentially the same company right now.

The idea that it will go up to 35 - 40 is just because they are consuming the others market share.

But, I would say that I have been looking into the weed companies to see which one I might put some money on and one name that keeps coming up is TLRY.  There are a couple others that are mildly interesting.  But, just based a handful of deal TLRY has made I would say ( not financial advice) that TLRY is even money.   Meaning unless something out of no where happens the stock shouldn't go down much.  maybe 30 percent.

But, Making money on stocks is all about when you sell.  I mean 20 dollars now...maybe 3 years before it matures who knows.  If TLRY keeps doing good business....5 years from now could THEORETICALLY( not financial advice) be a 200 dollar stock.

It is all about when you buy and when you sell."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, the point is nothing is guaranteed.  At one point APHA was a 5 dollar stock and TLRY was a sitting around 14.  So, Optimistically 35 - 40.  Maybe it just jumps to 24 after the merger.

What I really see is activity and because I am not in the pit when I see activity I just figure OTHER people care about the stock.  So, if other people are in on it...then maybe there is something there.

But, it is all gambling.  I do not have a crystal ball and I do not have the sport almanac from back to the future."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the ratio laid out in the merger agreement, so it's technically arbitrary but it's what the legal agreement currently entails. The actual number has 4 decimal points but I only memorized as far as 0.83.

So if APHA is trading for less than 0.83x what TLRY is trading for than it's theoretically a discount to buy APHA - as long as the price you buy APHA at ends up being 83% or less than the price of TLRY the day the merger goes through.

So if on Tuesday APHA is trading at 82 and TLRY is trading at 100, I'm not buying because I don't believe the combined company has any business being an 80+ or 100+ dollar/share company at the moment or in the next 12-24 months, much less 4-6 weeks.

But I could see the combined company being a 25-35 dollar/share company in that timeframe, so if APHA is under ~21 I'm open to picking up the odd few more shares, if it were to drop under 18 with no major changes to the businesses and regulation I'd be confident to, for me, significantly increase my investment.

Likewise if in that timeframe before the merger APHA is on that <$21 range but it's more than 85ish% of the TLRY price I'll buy TLRY instead.

Not financial advice, I'm dumb as a bag of hammers."

 \*the 2.6 P/B ratio is calculated using the latest numbers from the UWMC 10-K, where it shows total equity of $5B after merger. using a market cap of $12.98B at close of 3/26, the P/B is 12.98/5 \~ 2.6 

I've posted this at other places but got no good answers"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will preface with I'm no expert in valuations, and I do invest by gut sometimes and then justify it afterwods. :) I think UWMC suffers a little because the recent merger makes it hard to compare long term data. I'm basing my valuation on the high level of growth we've seen In the last years from United mortgage compared to other wholesale brokers. This of course raises the question of whether any growth is sustainable in the mortgage industry as rates will rise, and presumably the real estate market will slow down over the next 5 years but I think in the 1-3 year range we will see large growth and yield. At the current price of UWMC I see a dividend yield around 5%. PFSI - 1.23% RKT - 0%. WD - 1.9% ESNT - 1.4%
I think next earnings report and dividend will be telling of what we can expect for the next few years from UWMC."

No luck today at high tide (1pm pacific time) to free Ever Given. Only dredging and pulling with tugs looking less likely to work, though it still could. If they have to start unloading it, that will be dangerous and take weeks given need to use helicopters.

Scenario A: They free the ship tomorrow or Monday just with dredging and tugs, traffic begins to return to normal within a week or so.

Scenario B: They have to unload a substantial portion of the containers to successfully dislodge it. In this scenario, “normal” is probably 3-6 weeks away.

In the meantime global fuel and oil prices can be expected to rise more.

I don’t understand the logic behind the warning at all though.  Do they assume businesses will not pass inflated costs to customers by raising prices?  We are already seeing rising prices.  So with out typing a yuge wall of text and to say it simply, I think Griffin is full of shit.

Also amusing how FT and Griffin threw out a little jab blaming retail for “inflated asset prices and valuation detachment and in the end retail will get hurt”. Haha 1. Since when has he cared about retail traders? And 2. fuck you Ken Griffin!  Eat a dick"

(Reuters) - British ministers have rejected a request from mining magnate Sanjeev Gupta for a 170 million pound emergency loan to prevent his group, GFG Alliance, from collapsing, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

GFG, a holding company for Gupta’s assets, was the biggest recipient of financing from Greensill, a British financing company, which filed for insolvency earlier in March.

The collapse of Greensill threatens carnage throughout the international financial system. Two massive world banks, Credit Suisse and the giant Japanese SoftBank, are up to their necks in bad debts from their billion-dollar financing of what was in essence no different from the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007.

EXPERIAN (1 week later): Your credit score has DECREASED 24 points.

The whole system is a farce. Live debt free and pay all your bills = decreasing credit score.  They gotta make sure you have a permanent shackle of debt your entire life, which is rewarded with a higher credit score.  The 'optimal' number of accounts to have open is apparently '5'.  Make sure you have 2 credit cards, a student loan, a personal or auto loan, and a mortgage to make sure you have an 'optimal' set of data for calculating your BS credit score. Fuck this scam.

He’s learned the language of wood. Similarly, my friends who have played guitar their whole lives debate the tonal superiority of Fender guitars from different years, and I can’t hear the difference.

I know where all of her freckles are, including some she doesn’t know about. I know that when she sleep talks, she’s either very happy or very stressed. I know that she starts in the middle of stories, then tells you the beginning. I know what she smells like after a jog.

Last week they said it would take 48-72 hours max and it has already been that long. They  are put the majority of their hopes on Monday when there is high tide, but if that doesn't work they will need to unload it. That couldn't possibly take weeks, which everything will just start to go around Africa instead.

That would turn a 3 day trip into a 10+day trip for a lot of shit. Some ships are already changing course midway from US because of this.. With bottlenecks everywhere already due to short supply of certain materials, this would be pretty devastating.

If I'm walking at night, I'm the one telling my friends to keep their voices down. I'm 100% aware of my surroundings, it's just that I don't give a fuck if I yell, because I'm in my own home!!!

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Boat needs to not be stuck so tech can rally tomorrow
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here the thing to think about: each of those containers on the Ever Given are the size of a semi truck*. There are likely 15k+ containers on that vessel (if it’s a standard, I think I heard mention that this vessel is larger)

So not only is it an issue of moving a crane there, but then they need to offload 15k semi trucks from that ship. Think about how much time that would take. Even if you can move 1 in 15 minutes (unlikely) you are at 156 days of non stop unloading.

Then, where do you put the freight? You need to get trucks out there to pick up the containers. You can’t just leave them there because then the crane will have no where to put them and need to be moved.

Ports are specialized because multiple cranes move the containers straight from the vessel to the rail (and a few trucks) so they can move fright insanely fast away from the port.

*A vessel generally holds 24k TEUs (Twenty foot equivalent units) and people usually ship FEUs (Forty foot equivalent units). Just like the name suggests, if you can have 24k TEUs, you can also have 12k FEUs or any mixture of the two. So imagine a mix of semi trucks (FEUs) and a mix of uhauls (TEUs), each one will take the same amount of time to unload. Generally there are more FEUs than TEUs, so I would guess the number for any given standard ship is around 15k containers.

Edit: here are 3 pictures I threw together that might help someone understand the size of this issue. Before clicking the link, think of some kind of standard CAT machines. Like cranes or something that you would see in construction. Then look at these 3 pictures. https://imgur.com/a/goSGZ8U"

I've stopped giving advice or even talking about stocks with family, there are way too many variables to consider, and I wouldn't want them to lose money because of me."

If the tank is empty, the male will skeet every available amount of potent sperm into the female and any space left empty will be filled with synthetic jizz that contains no functional sperm to make the female appear fully creampied. 

If the tank is already full, the male will then resort to a fire hose style ULTRA DUMP OF MEGA POTENT SPERM with the intent of his sperm outperforming the sperm of the previous donor. 

Female butterflies are really just getting abusively cum dumpstered during mating."

Companies are already paying thick premium for TSMC capacity. Building bigger/more fabs will take years. AMD is far from being the biggest fish in this pond. This is also the reason why they are partnering up with Samsung.

[https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/apple-claims-half-of-tsmc-5nm-production-capacity-for-2021.html](https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/apple-claims-half-of-tsmc-5nm-production-capacity-for-2021.html)

Intel's fabs are trash. They really underestimated 10nm and will not recover for a few years. That said having their own fabs allows them to push inferior product full of security holes(meltdown and spectre was nothing compared to

[https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-06-intel-chips-unpatchable-security-flaw.html](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-06-intel-chips-unpatchable-security-flaw.html)  )

as it is only thing available to consumers due to AMD relying solely on TSMC whose capacity is being fought over by all the big biders.

I also believe the Intel management does relize the fuckup the 10nm was and to prevent it they wanna have fabs near where the architecture/chip developement takes place.

Concerns over national security are not something Intel is in charge of but instead military going""hey we know it is basically impossible.. But the generals dont know shit and this doesnt cost that much more...""

edit: Also the US China trade war doesn't help either. Americans went kinda full retard over having to pay actual tax on electronics.. just like Europeans do all the time."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Acceptable.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,">Companies are already paying thick premium for TSMC capacity. Building bigger/more fabs will take years. 

AMD's got the money and the margins if they feel the need to buy more fab capacity. They didn't feel the need last year because no one could have planned for the coronavirus demand. Since then they've increased prices and therefore margins. I trust they know what they're doing so not even slightly concerned about that. As I said, they've guided for higher revenue, and they've also given margin targets you can look up.

>  This is also the reason why they are partnering up with Samsung.

1. That's an unsubstantiated rumour, you shouldn't state it like it's fact. 
1. NVIDIA's been using Samsung for their consumer GPUs - has not worked out well, has it? They still use TSMC for commercial GPUs. I'm not sure you really know what you're talking about if you're suggesting Samsung as a better option for AMD, all signs are that it's not.
1. That said, them being able to use Samsung is a benefit of being fabless. They can switch some production if they want to, doesn't mean they will. Intel doesn't really have that option, it'd murder their stock price if they switched CPUs to TSMC as they'd be signalling fab writeoffs.

>I also believe the Intel management does relize the fuckup the 10nm was and to prevent it they wanna have fabs near where the architecture/chip developement takes place.

Nonsense, bad design is bad design. For one they already have fabs in the US, and having the fabs nearby doesn't fix that problem anyway. It wouldn't even help them find these problems because they weren't looking at them. Spectre/Meltdown for example were theoretical problems Intel believed couldn't be compromised until they were.

>Concerns over national security are not something Intel is in charge of but instead military going""hey we know it is basically impossible.. But the generals dont know shit and this doesnt cost that much more...""

Haha, you really think Intel, the company still not paying billions in antitrust fines from many years ago, isn't lobbying based on any grounds they can? This is your first time on the Intel fuckery treadmill, isn't it?

>edit: Also the US China trade war doesn't help either. Americans went kinda full retard over having to pay actual tax on electronics.. just like Europeans do all the time.


I don't even know what you're trying to say here. Given AMD's products were sold out for a very long time I think it's safe to say prices/taxes aren't a problem."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go on investopedia and look up selling options. Specifically selling cash secured puts and covered calls.

For selling a CSP you are essentially writing a contract that says that you will purchase 100 shares of a stock for a predetermined price (strike price) at a later date(expy). You get paid a premium for the contract. 

If on expy the stock is trading above the strike price then the contract expires worthless to the buyer, you don't have to buy the shares and you keep the premium that was paid to you. If the stock is trading under the strike price than you are required to purchase the 100 shares at the price listed on the put. Either way you still keep the premium that was paid to you. 

A covered call is when you own 100 shares of a stock and you put those up as collateral when writing a call. You decide on a strike price and expy date. If the stock is trading above the strike price you are obligated to sell the 100 stock for the strike price. If the stock is trading under the strike price you keep your shares. Either way you still keep the premium the buyer paid you for the contract. 


I am running what's called a wheel strategy on GME right now. I am selling puts at s/p $160 and $111 and am selling Covered calls at $195. If the puts get assigned I use the purchased shares and sell covered calls at the same or similar s/p. If the calls get assigned I use that capital to sell a CCP at a similar price. Because of the crazy volatility of GME those premiums are ludicrously high and they depreciate in value very quickly. Sucks for the people buying them, but it's great for me.

With this strategy my profit comes from the premiums I receive from selling the options Moreso than the actual value of the underlying shares. As of right now I will net roughly $13k in premiums over the course of April."

2. Those that have not. 

I would argue that to make any type of financial judgement on Tesla would be insane if you have never done number 1. You are guessing at best and lying at worst. 

There is no real competitor to Tesla today, and if they keep moving at the speed they are today there will probably not be one in the future. 

Apple makes 20% of the worlds smartphones, but garners 80% of the profit. Tesla will do the same with transportation.   


If you really want to compare traditional auto makers to Tesla just look at the amount of batteries they make or purchase to determine how serious they are. VW is the closest traditional competitor and their 10 year vision is 240GWh of batteries. Tesla is talking 3TWh in the same timeline for just their own manufacturing lines not including purchases. One has vision, the other is attempting to emulate Tesla from 2018. You cannot give a future value of EV's or transportation as a service without seeing where the batteries come from....period."

Once there is a big enough market people will put more R and D and funding into electric cars. This is why hybrids never really took off. The cars looked like crap and drove like crap compared to ICE so there was no incentive for competitors to really come out with their own.

With electric you can kind of already begin to see the pivot. It's only really a matter of time. It's still slow to be honest. But it will ramp up exponentially.

I think people are too hung up on the cars and energy side of things. I will be the first to admit. If TSLA only sells cars and solar energy. They will never grow into their valuation. I'm banking solely on their software. Look at Microsoft, so they sell xboxs and some crappy tablets and laptops. Lets be real their biggest asset is their software and business tools. You think Microsoft is worth 1 trillion because of Xbox and Bing? That is what I am banking TSLA growing into. Insane software which basically is industry leading and cannot be beaten.

When Tesla has economies of scale and start producing sub $25-$30,000 EVs, no one will give a shit about VW"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"""So VW has been in China much longer than Tesla yet still sold less than them?""

They haven't started selling electric cars in China, you can't beat someone in a market that you're not in yet. VW has been involved in electric vehicle research and small scale manufacture since the 1970s, they never did was Tesla did for lack of money or will. What they were counting on was second mover advantage, a historically successful strategy if you look at how Japan took on global manufacturing. Tesla has created the market that VW is waiting for, and now VW is coming for it's 20-30% market share. 

""You severely underestimate the power of Tesla's brand, their huge investments in charging stations, and their added focus on selfless driving.""

No I don't, Tesla has a great brand. That will successfully allow it to survive and maintain substantial market share however it will never have the type of global dominance that it's current market valuation requires. Meanwhile, VW is trading at a discount. 

The point on charging stations and self-driving is just moot. VW has it's own research on self-driving cars and will have built 18,000 charging stations in the next 4 years and there's already 224,538 charging stations in the EU alone. So that's not a competitive advantage which is going to transfer to Tesla in the European market. This entire situation isn't about whether Tesla's a good company, or whether it'll survive. It's about whether it's market valuation can be sustained and whether other companies are comparatively undervalued. 

""When people in China are buying EVs, they don't have VW on their mind""

Again, VW has just invested a huge amount in Chinese production capacity last year and are planning on rolling out this year. Plus, they're already a household name in China through their various subsidiaries and historically have had a huge market share in the ICE cars market (sold 2.6m cars in China in 2020). There's a McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights report (2019) which shows that 70% of Chinese consumers prefer German automobile companies to other brands. There's a strong  preference there for German cars, and it'll translate once VW enters the market with gusto this and next year. 

""Neither do most EV buyers because Tesla is the face and rightly so. You only got upvoted because you're just throwing numbers and links at the end when your whole argument is garbage.""

Then debunk my argument. I'm getting upvotes because my argent is cogent and put together, all you have is put sentiment and I'm willing to be the reason why you're so het up is because you've been trying to find out a way to discredit my figures, and have failed. 

""But they're ""poised"" to get beat by VW this year, says a retarded German VW fanboy.""

One, never call me German again. I'm a Lancastrian. Two, if it soothes your ego to call me a fanboy sure, but I'm not emotionally connected to VW.

""Did papa Elon fuck you?""

Interesting. When you lose arguments do you often resort to homosexual fantasies? 

""I can't imagine being such a retard that I'd bet against him after billionaire funds have lost money doing the same thing""

They made the mistake of shorting Tesla, not a good idea considering it's investor profile is pickled brain apes.

""it's hilarious how much focus you're putting on European market as if it's bigger than the US""

Shall I quote you the Motor1.com headline ""Europe became the worlds biggest plug-in electric car market in 2020""? If you look at the raw statistics, sales of plug in passenger cars hit 1.4 million in Europe last year. Oh, and the biggest company in that market is VW followed by RNM.

""European carmakers are more reliant on the American market than American carmakers in Europe.""

Erm, no. Can you back that up with an argument or are you just going to continue dribbling shit out of your lips like a perverted geriatric with a scat fetish? 

""When Tesla has economies of scale and start producing sub $25-$30,000 EVs, no one will give a shit about VW""

Still dribbling shit I see. Newsflash, any mass manufacturer can get economies of scale! And VW has far more capacity ready to converted and built. 

In short, your brain is smooth as a pearl but not half as shiny. Your argument doesn't make any sense and you can't do even the barest of quantitative or qualitative analysis. So STFU or contribute some actual DD to the conversation.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[This you? Where's your stop loss buddy?](https://i.redd.it/ruxfxkg6opl61.jpg)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao please do not do that. Take the time to post some real DD. FUBO has taken off in WSB before, it will happen again."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes that’s me and I posted with experience and learned from it. Did I make mistakes, yes? Am I going to do it again, no. I wish nothing but the best for everyone here, cheers, have a great rest of your weekend."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, fair enough. I think it definitely depends on a case by case basis. FUBO dropped nearly 20% in one day on no news because a hedgefund got blown up and they had to liquidate. I think it's a perfect time for OP to average down if his DD is still applicable and he is still bullish on the very long term."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how you managed that.  I got stupid lucky and decided to buy a few calls before GME became national news.  Paid something stupid like $10 for a GME $50C when GME was trading at $35.  And bought some AMC and BB.  Then GME hit $300 something.  Not knowing what I was doing I exercised and then sold off at like $300, $290 and $270.

Ended up with 30 grand and decided to make it my options play money.  Lost a good chunk on NVDA when it shit but stayed about even overall cause I was playing MU LRCX AMAT DKNG and AMC.  Because you know like silicone chips and shortages.  Figured buy the guys that make silicone chip equipment.  Atleast I think some of those stocks do that shit.  And DKNG because like sin stocks are a good hedge for market down turns or some shit.

So I didn't make money for a while.  And I also learned how those stocks move.  I also learned if when the dip comes if you don't have any cash well then you are fucked.

So I waited for most of my calls to go back green and took barely any profit but got back to my original 30k.

Then I did some ground breaking shit.  I didn't buy anything until the shit dipped for a few days.  And when it did I just bought a little and kept buying all the way down.  I also started buying calls 90 to 60 days out with strikes around the most recent high.

So when MU tanked I bought it all the way down to $82.  Same thing with AMAT and LRCX.  Also KLAC which doesn't run like those.  DKNG is hella cheap now, so is UWMC, and some of the cruise stocks.

So I did that and now Friday happened.

And now I think I'm smarter than Warren Buffet.

So now I'm going to hold this shit for way to long until it goes red and expires.

And then I'll listen to my wife banging her boyfriend while I figure out if I have anything of value to pawn other than my mouth."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,that’s unfair literally every spac has crashed in the past month
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The traded float is 13 mill (alot of shares locked up until 4/26). 68% short interest on that float. Some really good DD on wsb. Company is a financial tech company. Shorts don't understand their proprietary tech is going lead to significant cost savings over the longterm. At the IPO there was some big names in the Tech industry including snowflake investor dragooner. Besides they paid $27 at IPO they have been buying the dip.. 40k Call OI added Friday when our frenemy Citron Research stole DD from wsb and posted it on Twitter. Shorts are valuating root as an old boring insurance company and not a tech startup. Lemonade a similar fintech insurance went through a similar squeeze and went from 58 to 176 in a month. There is two watermarks where mark to market losses will force shorts to start covering at 22 + 26. Gamma squeeze after that 40,000 calls with the highest strike at 40 which I expect we will get over that when the short squeeze starts equals another 4 mill shares to buy to cover calls sold. I expect additional fomo so 60 is really low balling it. I expect this to be a build up to the first watermark once we get to 15 the delta hedging from calls will help us get there."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what statement have I made that is over generalized?

I never once said ""In order to be a millionaire you have to be x amount of frugal"". The only thing I said that came close to that was in my first comment when I mentioned spending a quarter of your savings on a vehicle and that was more of an exaggeration to get the point across. I didn't mean it literally. 

 Really the only thing I've said is that the less money you spend the more money you have, the more money you can invest, the quicker you become wealthy. Which I'm guessing you agree with considering you're linking me fire subs.  

I was trying to make a much broader point about frugality , but I guess it did come across very specific. However, that's only because OP was making a specific remark about not believing that someone worth a million+ would drive a sub $10k car. 

So if we want to go back to your original specific example, sure, I agree that someone making $150k probably would be fine buying a $50k car. 
While I do agree you should enjoy your life, there's  a balance that needs to be established. Follow that enjoy spending attitude around enough and suddenly your retirement is pushed back 5, 10, 15 years."

**Tide tables:**  They have until Wednesday 31st to float the Ever Given with neap tides  of 2.1m. After this date high tides drop dramatically until after the  25th of April.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:**  Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no  vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed  around the Cape of Good Hope as yet.

**Location of crane ships:**  If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be  partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few  crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting  containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks. Remarkably a suitable  ship, the Saipem 3000, is currently located in the Red Sea en route to  Turkey via Suez. There are also 3 similar vessels currently docked in  the Persian Gulf."

Things that drive housing price are (1) availability of houses for sale and (2) the price to borrow. Both of those have conspired to drive housing prices up as housing stock for sale is very, very low and interest rates are negligible.  Consider mortgages at 3% vs 6% - you can by a 40% more house at 3% for the exact same monthly payment.  Since most people buy with a loan rather than cash, that monthly payment is what is the most important for buyers."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I might be drunk but I was thinking how did we get into this mess so I wanted to try to speculate on why this is all shaking out this year. I didn't know much before I caught on to DFV in December. After hearing Gabe talk in the initial hearing state he's been shorting GME for multiple years I thought sure they're in this game, hedges gonna short. Today I thought, why would a hedge fund take infinite risk with the equivalent of a yolo? It hit me, in April 2020 just after lockdown was real for USA they thought that this was it, their ticket to tendietown and tax free from the bankruptcy loophole. I purport that the hedges thought they had bled GME and the pandemic was the nail in the coffin (no sales for brick and mortar), without realizing that the best activity for bored people is what that store sells. Now it's backfiring hilariously and not going bankrupt, they should be left with the best loss porn ever seen. Anyway, 1265 @ 175"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I was a hedgefund and I knew other hedgefunds were in the same spot as me

Wouldn’t I want to be the first to cover? That will drive the price up and margin call the other hedgefunds.

Basically whoever gets margin called first pays the least, and choosing to pay first while you can “afford it” might bankrupt your competitors.


This is one post I’m hoping the interns read (will probably get slapped for suggesting)... but for real, hedgefucks, y’all should turn yourselves in and accept a manslaughter charge before you get 25-life"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did some research today, hope it's of use to any fellow apes looking at profiting from the Suez Canal closure.

**Tide tables:**  They have until Wednesday 31st to float the Ever Given with neap tides  of 2.1m. After this date high tides drop dramatically until after the  25th of April.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:**  Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no  vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed  around the Cape of Good Hope as yet.

**Location of crane ships:**  If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be  partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few  crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting  containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks. Remarkably a suitable  ship, the Saipem 3000, is currently located in the Red Sea en route to  Turkey via Suez. There are also 3 similar vessels currently docked in  the Persian Gulf."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"🎉🥳🍻2,000 👏🎊🎈"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Reply?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the award for 2000 goes to GP!

Edit: you bastard, lol. I wanted to be #2000 ;)"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried it a few years ago but the lack of data access to the public and latency plus TA being a myth make it quite impossible. I’m working on one right now to kind of just help me with what I do, just a bot that tracks VIX/options volume on SPY/change in delta on 0DTE options. You’re trying to make a trading bot?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure if it counts but I’m an electrical engineer right now but I worked with BlackRock in college mostly with MM algos. Not really trading
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No cuz I refuse to pay for API access
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Safe travels friendo
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,There was like 8 of them and a few voices yelling his name. He just didn’t even look at them. Not even a wave. Very sus.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. I do love to mortify him but I’ll only do that in front of other boys.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yw
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,America
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It says 1.9 for me 😔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine says 1.9 tho???
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canada post expedited parcel ASAP 🥵🥵🥵

But seriously, i give stuff away all the time. I want like a couple then I have to give away the remaining amount every time lol. My building loves me for this reason."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve never eaten a snickerdoodle 🤭
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"My fave snikerdoodle recipe is a weed one lol. 

I make very good doodles. I will offer up baked goods any time there's an unpinned gang up north of the border!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ewwww
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg it's deadly. I always need to keep the bits stocked up here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I TOLD YOU THAT IN CONFIDENCE

😭"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m 5’8” 😔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's true. Drives a Subaru, likes girls, minimal testosterone... Lesbian for sure."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm 5'11"" 😏"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a great way to pull an outfit together honestly
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I aim to please ✌️🐧🐧🐧
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What did I miss for this
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I will never do a face reveal after what you dropped Carrie.  I'm like a scuffed less gay looking troll version of you
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"🤣 

there’s more though, I need to finish the list 👀"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bunny plz 😩
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have way too much money on that stock for it not to be Starlink .. also, no SPACs 😭"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It won’t be but...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought we were friends
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s from *somewhere else*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Gluten free but without legal repercussions
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Olives have to stay ☹️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I forgot it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes bed.  If it's s extremely cold and windy and a hoodie doesn't work, then a blanket may come out.  But normally just khakis and a button up."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Give it a try.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the thin sheets give me anxiety.  I'd need a comforter combo to handle them.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I just google duvet and it was some anime girl with cat ears.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright carrie that's enough I can't take anymore of this 😭. I am vulnerable right now and you are pretty
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruhhhh you look like my grade 11 psychology teacher. Also best restaurant in the USA are the hot dog stands in time square. Unhealthy cheap food taste better than the fancy stuff.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg you posted more 🥺😭
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point. Deleting. Forget you saw me 😈
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it is. I do keto and intermittent fasting. For 3 years now.  Will never go back to the standard American diet.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey buddy ❤️. Keto and IF curb my appetite big time. When I eat carbs I’m always hungry. Sometimes I’ll go all day until 9 without eating and I’m still not really hungry
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,u/competitivebunny should be called competitiveowl 😐
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He's just deep in contemplating thought
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He got a bunch of treats after that because when I let him out in the yard, he listened and came back in instead of eating the random 🐈 that he saw running around that somehow got in our yard.  He was really disappointed about it tho."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I tried to start that before and couldn’t get into it...  I’ll try again!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Always
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanted to make a small bot that just automated wheeling a set of tickers I like.  It would probably be extremely easy since it's not very complex logic but that api access is just too much $$$
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Could be embarrassed? Unless they were saying it in a teasing way
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Look again?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Refresh bb
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😎😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg!! Buy some mix and make them right now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,^(not worth it)
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t you bake everything with weed up there?? 🤔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You don’t like snickerdoodles?? This is very disappointing Carrie 🤨
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to find around here. 😢 and I live near where it’s made
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,#Oops 🙊
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Well now he's told all of us *in confidence*. Your secret is safe with me... us.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re taller than me 😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Short stuff 💁🏼‍♂️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone is taller than FannyPackPhantom confirmed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck?!? You got me by 5”-6” will be looking for tall glasses of water now
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like he already[ deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdl9jj/unpinned_daily_discussion_thread_for_march_26_2021/gsitbd6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) 🙄 

But - we know he has a green thumb, fine taste, blep cat...the face reveal confirmed somethings wrong in Canada for dating as well"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,This is 100% impossible and I don’t think the picture really showed what I look like anyways. I’ll give you another one...brb...
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You still holding?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Removed. I thought the bunker was lawless lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s hilarious the mental gymnastics some holders are using to say it is. Dude got into an argument with me a few weeks back that it absolutely would be because this spac is retail friendly like Elon would want 😬
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😬 sorry. I held out but things looked grim after it wasn’t Stripe and spacs looked to be about to nosedive. I’d get in again if it hits NAV
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d remove that last bit just in case....
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay lol, I thought it was like regular crust with extra steps.  Gluten friendly for the people who like gluten!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was extra gluten.

Cause it's friendly to gluten."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny that's what my cat tells me too 🤔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"SMH.

Have you learned nothing from my shitposting?

It's all propaganda to help petroleum based pizzas to catch on ~~fire~~."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I wear a clown suit to bed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You are trolling
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait wat. But nothing at all is fine?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, he has a big blanket with that printed on it"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao what! Down filled comforter 🥵
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what happened to the girl you were dating?!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,We both know he’ll still be an asshole especially when people remember I bought KTOS at the top. Can’t forget I’m ♿️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,FFS LMAO
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,🙄 I guess I see it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait a minute... 

this + bakes + blep cat + green thumb + guitar + cannabis connoisseur + really amazing furniture taste

###u/competitivebunny whats going on in Canada? Why the fuck is he single?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s Bradley cooper actually yeah. And the Doggos head is so damn big 🤣
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a standard American diet lol?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I try keto I feel so sick
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You do intermittent fasting too?? You me and u/Richtofin115 gonna start a IF gang
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey pal 🙂. Isn’t it hard to stay in ketosis tho?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Very good boi
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,2021*
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's definitely the weirder part of marvel.  I'd adds if you remember the main character is schizophrenic and you have no idea if anything at all is real.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That shouldn’t be too difficult. What are you programming it in?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,2000! 🎉
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,that was weird. when we hit 1k it was for everyone and same with daily 500.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I've refreshed like 10 times by now and it's still at 1.9k... Yall are celebrating prematurely confirmed
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Google images doesn’t show any appealing photos. Where’s the chocolate?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I probably have but it was such a forgettable experience 🤷🏻‍♀️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao yo you're not wrong tbh.  I learned from r/avb to save my spent bud, and repurpose it. I double boil it into coconut oil or butter.

80% I would say is regular baking. Once a or twice a month I make a large (2-3 dozen) batch of edibles."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry bb but snickerdoodles are a waste of a cookie. u/VacationLover1 be the tie breaker here, are snickerdoodles 👍or 👎?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It's ok u know a guy now. We'll figure out a shipment schedule lmao
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to know the secret now too. How tall/short is u/four1six_? Plus do we really know u/Richtofin115 is 6’5”? Seems sus to me.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😦
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm only like 126lbs tho so I'm just a small person that got stretched out real long
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Aw it's ok we stan our short princes
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, still confirmed I’m the shortest in unpinned and beyond just shortest girl"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh interesting.  I am not an expert on what makes a man attractive so idk what's going on here.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is the same way all my girl friends talk. “YOU ARE SO PRETTY” “NOOO YOU ARE IM UGLY!!” Come to think of it maybe the positivity is why you guys outlive us.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven’t seen a single Fanny face reveal!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes ma’am, I’m in to deep lmao"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought there was a bot that auto banned it so maybe unpinned is lawless
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a theory that it’s more likely spaceX will go public as a subdivision of TSLA and they consider it a complete vehicle and tech company, but I get argued with. Still seems more likely to me then a starlink via spac"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been at 23/24 for a few days, basically nav.  I treat it as a savings account, I don't care what price movements it has until a DA and even then I'm holding longer for the juicy warrants.  This is gonna be my only long term hold."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got out at somewhere between 27 and 30, I forget where, but wouldn't mind getting back in if it drops lower,"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit. Yep. Normally I’m the one that remembers
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a weird way to say it lol
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s possible. If you don’t hear from me the rest of the day assume it’s extra gluten
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fine! I’m sorry. Writing this on my hand in ballpoint pen so I won’t forget ✋🖊
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Usually just cross my arms and go to sleep.  Tuck pants onto socks to create a seal
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You swore that was **our** secret 🥺
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the second image.... with a mother's day advertisement.

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Carrie lesbians don't care as much about natural looks, we understand how it is 💁🏻‍♀️"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,She broke my heart 💔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,###WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME SALAD MAN!?!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dating game is pretty shit in Canada across the board honestly. That’s what you get in this cold, wasteland 😞"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL this is the validation I was looking for 🖤

Our hearts are icy up here 🥶"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have we seen his face yet?

What if he's actually a dog? Nobody knows you're a dog on the internet."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fat
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I just do cico and heavy cardio works like a charm
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That sucks I’m sorry. Not sure what to say but maybe pushing through it? Keto is life for me. Curbs my appetite 100%
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not worth it 🤫
Intermittent fasting is where it’s at though"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I love it. Been doing it for a while. I have coffee w half and half in the morning then nothing until dinner time. Sometimes not till 9ish
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hard how? I don’t worry about ketosis or none of that. Like if I was doing true keto I’d probably not be eating enough fats. I just know I want to stay away from carbs and it works for me
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I haven't done it yet since lack of api but I would do it in elixir, I do all my hobby stuff in that."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Your app hates you rn
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fs in the chat for bun 🌹

No chocolate it's a cinnamon sugar cookie. But no reason you couldn't add some choco to it!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re good just try them.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably. It’s like cinnamon toast crunch lost all its flavor sprinkles, and then not crunchy"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m jelly 😑
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing that should have the word snickers in it is a candy bar.. plain old chocolate chip cookies 🥰
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,😂 things get slow in the market you can start a bakery / edibles / and candy export business
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The worst kind of lie is a convincing lie. It's funny if I say I'm 7' 4"", because that's ridiculous. If I say I'm 6' 1"", who's to say... it's insidious."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm the flip side of richtofin115 height 🥶
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask me something only a tall person would know. I’ll pass with flying colors
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You should go next Halloween as lady skeletor
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE being little spoon so it’s cool being small🙃
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s got the multi-cultural look going for him so it should be the edge. I’m wondering if it’s too cold in Canada maybe? Idk something is wrong. u/competitivebunny confirmed dating on west coast Canada is also fuk.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. We just know everyone is more critical of their own image than others. 

Except for “Becky” girls. They say it to fish for compliments and are convinced they are model hot."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t mean I slept all day though. There’s this thing called an alarm I know most geriatric homes don’t have those as the nurse will come wake you up
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to start breaking all the rules then 😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the bot was ahead of its time? It knew what we'd do in future and tried to prevent it from happening?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spacex won't ever be public in our lifetime imo.  space exploration can't have a profit motive, it's a research venture."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just can’t imagine Elon going through Spacman, would give up the attention and control with a heavily institutionally owned spac. 

Plus the valuation wouldn’t make sense."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 2,646 shares and about 20+ calls from June to Jan 2023.. if Papa Bill doesn’t bless me I swear"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I did. If he doesn’t announce by EOM it could drop more but I’m not sure
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You got Celiacs?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Tattoo it or you'll forget 😒
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You absolute madman
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, are you a mummy?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,👀 forgive me senpai
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL ok yes it's that without the image printed on it 😂. Mine is purple with a candy skull on it 😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, fair enough."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nooooooooo damnit!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry bb
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,:L
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know. I mean If anything this just makes it worse for me. Before people thought I was some old lady mom and probably excused some of my retardation, but now they know I’m not as old so it’s not excusable"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro Love 🥺🥲
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone needs to fix dating. This is nuts.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No we did but u/four1six_ wimped out and deleted.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,But everything has saturated and unsaturated fats?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to start again. Bunbun is getting a bit...fluffy
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe. I think it’s the keto flu? I’m not sure my blood pressure is naturally low and that flu shit takes me right out. I can only do keto in moderation.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, I need to get back on that"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Same deal! I tried keto and paleo way back but I drop too much weight that way. Fasting over the last 5 years has worked perfectly. I’ll eat my first meal around 6-7
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh ok. Yeah because in a true keto diet any carbs that you eat kill ketosis so you’re no longer burning fat and then you have to wait to be in ketosis again.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm not sure I’ve heard of that. Gotta look into it. For all my personal hobby stuff I use Python cause there’s lots of libraries for anything you need. I think the APIs I used to use were AlphaVantage and IEXTrading API. Those gave you free 1 min price feeds for any tickers
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah you n rich are just living in an alternate reality
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"No chocolate = no bun


My managing partner sent me these fancy cookies recently and you know what’s left? Oatmeal raisin and all the non-chocolate ones"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah seems like something you’d wanna forget eating
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"😍You’re moving up again in mod bracket

In your face u/Richtofin115"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,True. I’m shaving a foot off until it’s proven
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that’s average then.

And FannyPackPhantom still shortest continues to be confirmed"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,You could Google for the answers 🤨
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,No cuz that's what kids bullied me with :(
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Dating everywhere is fuk 😭😭💔
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm waiting on this new picture Carrie... don't tease me like this you know how I feel
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Or when the EKG goes flat 👴🚨
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking shots fired!
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean the bot really shit the bed on not telling us what would happen if that were the case lol any tech or ark comment should’ve gotten flagged haha
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that's more than me.  I only have 30k in it
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,For your sake I hope it’s something great 🙏🏻
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was referencing the other part, people get flagged for that"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not quite, or at least not severe. If I’m at a restaurant and some flour is in the food I’m fine, but if I were to have a big piece of bread I wouldn’t be fine."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you but also, fuk you for not being here all weekend"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm walking the fine line of having taste and being straight
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wait, was he the dude with the campfire(?) picture? With the hoodie(?) and the two other guys with blacked out faces? Or was that somebody else's?"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,#🤭
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was being facetious. Being non-US I would say overprocessed, fast food, high transfats, large portion sizes to be some of the biggest culprits in US diet."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to get in shape during Covid, I got got very fit. Now I’m working to get jacked. You got this bun 💪"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That sucks sorry. It’s hard to get help with this stuff physicians are so weak in knowledge about nutrition.
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow good for you. I dropped 30 with IF, stalled and dropped the last 20 doing both. Together they’re such a powerful tool. That was years ago and I’m still at my goal weight. What should we name our gang? What about something w skinny in the name lol"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Over a certain amount yeah. I rarely eat carbs. Haven’t had a burger or pizza since super bowl 2020. When I do though I feel like crap the next day and gain like 6lbs of water weight if I went crazy. I used to do cheat meals all the time but found it works better for me to not cheat at all

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,All I do is drink lol. Hard liquors have like 1 carb per ounce. White claws have 2 carbs per can. I usually stick to though. Even light beers cans work. Stuff like craft beers and wine are hard to do on keto. Especially how I drink. Most people count their carbs and make space for stuff they feel like having. I don’t count though. I do the laziest keto ever but it works so 🤷‍♂️
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,How about now

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh... You want to investigate and report back? I’m curious on the success rate. Maybe this is the hack for a new dating app to finally work 😎
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think I am...although..maybe.

Hm, today seems like a great day for an existential crisis!"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,That was about as not a serious response I could give bro 😂😂😂

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"He could wait a bit for GME to start rising again, I'll honestly eat one of my socks(after washing and seasoning it, ofcourse, I am not a monster) if GME doesnt reach 300$ before the end of June.

Yes, I made sure to word that in my favor, because someone on here is going to hold me onto this statement."

(I put my order in just after the close of market.) It spiked up to $310 the next morning, my order didn’t go through, and I bought them all at the higher price, anyway. Ever since, I’ve been on a strict diet of Crayola products and bananas. Someone tried to tell me I can do something called “sail them”, but I’m not sure what that means. Please come back for me.

How on planet earth could you claim that's not a saturated market where you have to go head to head against behemoths like steam, epic, origin etc. Their bread and butter is the used physical media market which is Jon existent online.

I just don't understand what they can offer now that they are abandoning retail which was their only advantage but is also why they've led money for years since retail is dying."

Went up way to fast but there is at least a reason for bullish momentum! I'd be careful betting this will stay low, although I'm hoping for a bit more of a dip, before a runup. Also some of this sell off is due to the Archeos friday shenanigans.

Im bullish and want to buy at 35 if possible. Not financial advice. Stupid Ape thinks people will pay money to watch diners, drivins and dives, because he finds people who make tendies. ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull)![img](emote|wsb_emojis|tendies)"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea i doubled my original 800 so im chillin. Withdrew 900 the friday before and 700 the monday before that. Just put 100 bucks back in and am gonna try to do it all over.

Edit: last time i had 6 trades in a row that were around an average of 70% gain. This time imma go for 100% trades and just got to get my timing right. 8 trades will put me back in the clouds lol. Odds arent for me but im willing to lose 100 bucks to try to make a shit ton as well as have a bunch of fun on the way."

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's have an update
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a serpentza video on this, essentially the problem is people are buying up apartments as investments, never visiting/maintaining them etc etc. problem is the Chinese government will bail out these “investors” and since they have to return the property to the government anyway the government can just demolish buildings to raise prices."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there is no govt developed towns. However, if you look at total supply it is actually significant. We do have empty houses, the market is just opaque so we don't have the data available. Think about what you just said too, the land isn't developed, we have the second largest land mass in the world, why the fuck are houses this expensive? We have no population growth, no wage growth, and prices went up over 100% in 5 years on 1% drop in mortgage rates. This time is not the same, this time is fucking fomo and people are going to get burned."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,So?
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"The value of real estate is based on population and income. When China get's their inevitable population drop for many reasons (as planned by the Chinese government through the history of the one child policy), the real estate value will drop with it. No one to rent to. No one to pay upkeep. cheaper to demo."
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are going to put up the population because the one child policy had been lifted, thus, they’ll have plenty of inhabitants who’ll get to rent a flat"
03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does ""up sequentially "" mean?"

03/28/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did some research today, hope it's of use to any fellow apes looking at profiting from the Suez Canal closure.

**Tide tables:**  They have until Wednesday 31st to float the Ever Given with neap tides  of 2.1m. After this date high tides drop dramatically until after the  25th of April.

**Distribution of Nordic Tankers (NAT) from GPS:**  Nordic currently have no tankers en route for the canal. Also no  vessels stuck in jams. As far as I can see none have been re-routed  around the Cape of Good Hope as yet.

**Location of crane ships:**  If the vessel cannot be floated off the sand it will need to be  partially unloaded to reduce its displacement. There are only a few  crane ships worldwide capable of operating in shallow water and lifting  containers from the 40m height of the deck stacks. Remarkably a suitable  ship, the Saipem 3000, is currently located in the Red Sea en route to  Turkey via Suez. There are also 3 similar vessels currently docked in  the Persian Gulf."
