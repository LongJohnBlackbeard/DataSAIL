2021-05-22 19:17:33,wallstreetbets,So this basically means that Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
2021-05-22 19:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I like your thought process but how are these plant shutdowns going to change their business model? [news release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/olin-announces-further-chlor-alkali-capacity-reduction-301292851.html)"
2021-05-22 19:58:51,wallstreetbets,"They also make Winchester ammo, another industry in the middle of  a major shortage"
2021-05-22 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,What is your price target for $OLN?
2021-05-22 19:19:56,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-22 19:51:50,wallstreetbets,"This is good, they are cutting the less environmentally friendly processing that does not sell for much because its caustic and impure so it costs a lot to make (especially now with epa regs) and doesn't sell for much (why would you even make that? New ceo exactly why they're ending it) this is a strong play especially longer term this is a massive net positive that why the ceo used the term ""accretive"" it means gradual growth, so gradual growth away from impure products + massive demand for more pure products= blast off (over a year no instant moons sorry)"
2021-05-22 19:29:02,wallstreetbets,It’s exactly why they shut this down. Diaphragm grade chlorine producing facility. Not a focal point
2021-05-22 19:59:29,wallstreetbets,Yup that too
2021-05-22 19:58:02,wallstreetbets,$90-$100. Their current market cap is under 6 billion and they did 2 billion just in quarter 1 2021
2021-05-22 19:57:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly what my husband said!  He wants instant blast off to the moon so I’m buying this with my own $$ and leaving him in orbit, ha!"
2021-05-22 19:41:53,wallstreetbets,Looks like all the main analysts are saying buy too.... thanks for sharing!
2021-05-22 19:16:46,wallstreetbets,Gratz.. these are gonna print on Monday!
2021-05-22 19:48:50,wallstreetbets,Let’s go!
2021-05-22 19:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Show me your January 2023s!!!!

Lmao. 

I'm looking at it. Might pull the trigger."
2021-05-22 19:40:52,wallstreetbets,Calls on $SPCE and puts on $COIN
2021-05-22 19:11:09,wallstreetbets,"True autist, lead the way. Keep us updated ;)"
2021-05-22 19:21:22,wallstreetbets,WSB seems to be deleting SPCE posts
2021-05-22 19:03:32,wallstreetbets,"Good luck.  I'm sitting on a few hundred.  Everything I have is down besides GME.   Lol!  CCIV, SPCE, BB, eh... a bunch of other nonsense."
2021-05-22 19:32:59,wallstreetbets,Blastoff
2021-05-22 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 3 days
2021-05-22 19:26:52,wallstreetbets,"I rode a little ~400% gain way back when it went public thru our good old friends SPACs, and sold around $42 when it peaked first... I think my average cost was just around $10 isa a share even though I bought a nice chunk around $7.25 when it first fell. A fun little 6 month ride or so.

Idk if I'd jump back in again. I wish I could access blue origin or SpaceX. FOMO is real."
2021-05-22 19:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I will show them in October, when I sell my Oct $30 Calls :P"
2021-05-22 19:16:34,wallstreetbets,I'll try to post an update every month. Let's see how it goes :)
2021-05-22 19:24:59,wallstreetbets,Why is that? This is just a YOLO like any other one
2021-05-22 19:34:25,wallstreetbets,SPCE  is not a SPAC
2021-05-22 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I have lost some money on SPACs warrants that I ended up selling and buying more SPCE until now, that it's all I have.

I think the pesimistic general opinion created a great entry point last week.

Good luck to you too 🚀🚀"
2021-05-22 19:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, last 12 months have been crazy with those two peaks. I bought the first time around october but didn't sell but I could improve my avg a bit.

I think I would add them to the portfolio if they were public companies depending on their valuation, of course.

The good thing with SPCE is that their delays made the stock crash and that created a good opportunity in my opinion. Also knowing that it reached $60 just on expectations... now that we had this successful flight and some others to come, like Richard Branson's flight... 🚀🚀

Whatever happens, I will hold."
2021-05-22 19:55:35,wallstreetbets,Nice.
2021-05-22 19:30:29,wallstreetbets,You gonna be the next SpaceKitty!

2021-05-22 18:57:39,wallstreetbets,Was there a catalyst?
2021-05-22 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,What is this company other than a cool ticker
2021-05-22 19:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Entire gain was in one week :)

I did post a DD a week back about  this and got shitted mercilessly . It’s all cool as it’s a brand new account and I’m just learning .

Still not late to load up or cover - earnings in 7 trading days . It’s going to be a (step) mother of all beats

C3.AI is an AI platform - mainly for the Oil and gas industry . Due to Covid , lot of billing was deferred last Q which should be recognized this quarter

They have zero debt so inflation is not a pain point . Rotation into growth stocks would definitely help though. 

Target 90-100 for a short term trade ."
2021-05-22 19:00:44,wallstreetbets,Not too bad that sausage💪
2021-05-22 19:48:54,wallstreetbets,She's been good to me as well. My account looks like that just exponentially smaller lol
2021-05-22 19:12:46,wallstreetbets,"Sell the calls and buy puts, you will get rich. C3. Ai is a Bullshit stock and a promotion stock like Nikola"
2021-05-22 19:26:29,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that I”m not a perma bull  - I have shorted this stock when it was 120+ but now long for a short term trade .Play both sides and make money  !
2021-05-22 19:18:52,wallstreetbets,"Literally the first thing I wanted to spit out, congrats and fuck you!"
2021-05-22 19:23:04,wallstreetbets,This is why you buy leaps calls on tech stuff and only buy shares on boomer stuff 😉
2021-05-22 19:19:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the moral support 🦍
2021-05-22 19:00:48,wallstreetbets,growth stocks went up after taking an ass pounding.
2021-05-22 19:14:05,wallstreetbets,How did you manage this performance? The stock has been falling since February. At what stock price did you buy the option?
2021-05-22 19:21:05,wallstreetbets,I remember you told me that a week back in my DD post . Wow I’m so happy I don’t listen to you .
2021-05-22 19:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Sell them, short the stock and use all the money to buy puts… go big or go homeless 😉"
2021-05-22 19:28:50,wallstreetbets,That seems to be the winning formula in 2021

2021-05-22 18:49:58,wallstreetbets,If you're a shareholder and a SMART investor.  you should want the share price to stay underpriced and underperforming for the next 6 months or so. It would be short sighted to want them to appreciate too much before the buyback is complete

2021-05-22 19:44:01,wallstreetbets,What is killing the stock is the low volume only few people want to buy. +90% of shares owned by CEO.
2021-05-22 19:35:32,wallstreetbets,Seriously.  Then people over at the UWMC sub is acting like Mat was gonna use buybacks to bid up the price for a gamma squeeze.
2021-05-22 18:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter what I want. But I hope if it does get to squeezing they hault share repurchases until the price is reasonable (anything under $10 imo). They have already started at least they said they were going to start last week and you could definitely see some weird volume spikes after they said they would begin.

&#x200B;

When they mentioned the program they said they want to take advantage of the low share price right now, I hope they meant that and put their money where their mouth was at $6."
2021-05-22 18:57:45,wallstreetbets,So why would you want it to go up short term.  That only means they leave more shares in the float.  Unless you're impatient and need to paper hands sell. Companies don't usually buy back all at once
2021-05-22 19:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Like i said it doesnt matter what I want. I see great news and a volume spike i get excited so i position myself accordingly:

Have my shares to hold and collect dividends, have my calls to sell during a squeeze event - thats how I played RKT into their special div."
2021-05-22 19:01:37,wallstreetbets,buy more make my bag holding ass some money
2021-05-22 19:13:38,wallstreetbets,Nice entrance on it.  Less then 1/2 my base cost average.  Congratulations and F you.

2021-05-22 18:47:01,wallstreetbets,I feel entry is a bit premature as my chart doesn’t show a established upward trend yet. Will track over the next week.
2021-05-22 18:32:26,wallstreetbets,Good luck trying to match what Microsoft has already done with Gamepass. Microsoft basically dominates the subscription gaming space with the amount and relevance of titles they offer. Microsoft has been aquiring big game studios lately with the intention of making their content exclusive to Gamepass and the Microsoft/ Xbox environment. Netflix is about 3-4 years behind here if not more.
2021-05-22 18:19:42,wallstreetbets,Sounds like cramers dream
2021-05-22 19:23:19,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see Netflix muscle in on live sporting events of all kinds.

Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities.
I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.


It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.

I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!

That would’ve been a good scalp play for daytrading. Ta is just a tool. And pairs with option flow data and spotgamma levels you should be good. You dumb as f bro

He made more TA post than you can think of. Know the context and then comment.

He says 20-day and 60-day now you came here saying 13, 20, 50 and 200. Which one exactly? On a monthly chart? weekly? daily?

Timeframe?"
2021-05-22 16:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Really? Read what you just wrote! When SPY is dropping it's dropping doesn't matter what is your set up there. So if someone  cracked that unique set up what is holding him to be the richest man on earth? Is that unique set up works everyday or just few days? On all tickers? or just one ticker?

If there is no rule and everyone says that you have to build a unique system but can't really tell how to build that system because it's so personalized that it's just saying ""do whatever you want and see what work for you"" 

If you have to change the set up every times but yet can't make money consistently then you are just gambling. If you buy SPY calls one dollar above the trading price, everyday at a certain time of the trading hour, for just 30 days, keeping 10% profit as exit point, your probability of winning is about 50%. I literally did that experiment."

(Which is okay since trading itself is pretty much gambling) we are all just making directional bets based on certain information. We all use different information differently to make more educated bets to up our chances. Everyone has different trading styles, so you need to make a strat that fits you.

I just wanna say, don't make it sound like you're better than all traders using TA just because you say you had a good WEEK while not showing P&L or anything. I'm 99% sure there are traders out there that use TA that did and do a lot better than you lol"
2021-05-22 19:09:47,wallstreetbets,"Depends if I’m only looking to scalp or catch momentum. Also if I’m doing shares or options plays a big role. 

Usually use 1,5 minutes to time exits. 15,30 1 and 4 hr for MAs as support/resistance. 1D to set up stuff like fib lines etc. 

Haven’t wrote down but shares are a winning track record overall. Options are about even all time. Futures are - return for me.

You're bashing all of TA based on this one indicator while pointing out only cases where it ""didn't work"". 


You're  bragging about your strat saying that it ""won"" 89% of the time but you don't elaborate or give any proof. (The pnl posted just shows your top winners and not of this 89% win rate you claim this last week. Also what's the win rate over a longer time period? Like over a year?) 


If you have a working strat and it's working great for you then congrats. Why do you feel the need to bash TA just because you're not using it? If you truly believe that TA doesn't work and the point of this post is to discourage other people from using it cuz it's bs, then why not elaborate on your own strat and explain how it's better than TA strats? If you were at least trying to sell a course or something, I'd get that this post has an actual purpose other than to incite some kind of argument for argument's sake."

2021-05-22 15:35:12,wallstreetbets,"In a short time frame, exponential growth is roughly linear. Over a longer time period, exponential growth dwarfs the information at the beginning of the graph because it is tiny in absolute terms. The timeframe when a log scale is necessary and linear scales are inappropriate depends on the average growth rate, but roughly speaking, a log scale should be used for multi-year charts, maybe 5yr+"
2021-05-22 17:28:06,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a $1 stock and it goes to $2 it is a (2/1) - 1 or 100% return. When it goes up another dollar it's only a (3/2) - 1 or 50% return. On a linear scale the stock prices are equidistant away but on a log scale the second move up from 2 to 3 would be relative to the %return. 

If you are a moron that thinks that the $10 stock you bought which went up a dollar did as well as the $20 stock which also went up a dollar use a log scale. If you have a single wrinkle on your brain then use whichever you prefer. There are so many stocks out that staring at a chart is not an optimal strategy. Most of your analysis should be in a quantitative tool whether it's excel or tableau or python. Sorting by return as a number over some time period or sorting by an annualized return number is easier than looking at a chart with over 5000 tickers."

compounding..."
2021-05-22 15:24:11,wallstreetbets,"I am also an ape so I understand logs like this:

10 usd grows by 10% you got 11 usd --> you gain 1 usd

11 usd grows by 10% you got 12.1 usd --> you gain 1.1 usd

12.1 usd grows by 10% you got 13.31 usd --> you gain 1.21 usd

So the more you have the bigger absolute gain you get from that same 10% return, basically the famous compound interest, the chart goes exponential

&#x200B;

when you log the chart, you remove the compounding and you are looking essentially at that 10%, otherwise the chart looks like 90% happened, no it's just compounding, so when you log you see the market is growing at the rate it has always been.

2021-05-22 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"You know, there's an easy solution for this. Wealth tax cash holdings and fund services and infrastructure through a centralized government to decrease liquidity in the money supply.  The banks got the money for free essentially through QE. The tech companies got it for free through tax loopholes and gaps in international finance treaties.

Time to put the money to use. Its not like the US doesn't have multiple bridges and highways dating back to the 50s or even earlier that effectively need to be rebuilt from scratch after decades of subpar maintenance. Its not like the US hasn't effectively taxed its middle class into being poor by forcing them to subsist on privatized healthcare that rewards an HMO's shareholders.

Forcing the money to recirculate is how you bring wages back to par after 40 years of steady decline in spite of massive gains in productivity owing to Internet-based automation."
2021-05-22 17:51:21,wallstreetbets,"You’ve not got much inflation in the US, it’s not the end of the world, far from it. If you hit even 5% inflation I’ll be surprised. If rates go much above 3%, interest rates can be raised and that will take out some of the rampant leveraged speculation going on bringing things closer to a normal range.

And hyperinflation is when you hit 50% per month…you aren’t even close. So so so far away from Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela that it is a joke you are going there as a comparison."

2021-05-22 15:03:59,wallstreetbets,Nice post. I think maybe the writer shouldve taken some classes in economics. Inflation is necessary tool to stimulate spending en therefore investments. Since we have replaced the gold to back the money for production there is no maximum amount of money that can be created as long as production and consumption rise along with it. At some point maximum production is reached and only prices will rise thus an economic crisis and rising of the interest rates. This will make production capacity be destroyed as de-investments or bankruptcy so the cycle can start over. I know of two other systems in the world one is in north korea and the other in cuba. Would you like either one of the two or do you have a new solution that no other economic have thought of before?

2021-05-22 18:05:19,wallstreetbets,"The dollar is indirectly backed by oil, via the petrodollar. Hyperinflation probably won’t happen since every country in the world needs to hold reserves of USD in order to purchase oil, and foreign countries are more than willing to buy up USD in order to increase the value of their own currency/fund future purchases of oil. This also explains why USD does not really suffer from monetary inflation. If the oil trade ever subsided, and was no longer the world’s reserve currency, then we’d be in a world of hurt, since the dollar will no longer be backed by an asset. I think we’ll see moderate inflation that will last a few years."

2021-05-22 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,"The reason why your explanation of inflation doesn’t hold is because inflation is not always a monetary phenomenon.  Friedman was wrong.  Hence the United States: who can print money indefinitely because it ostensibly launders the excess capital of the ENTIRE WORLD (trade deficits). The other reason is that money has not always expressed the same object in various economies. (hence why nominal wages have gone up and purchasing power down). Lastly, the dollar is not money.  It is world reserve currency.  It does not behave like money and hasn’t since it has gone off the gold standard—whose price has risen exponentially.  

There is no inflation coming.  There is zero lower bound coming.  

Money died in 1933.  FDR and the fascist state killed it in order to fuse capital and labor together again (“Keynesianism”). What we have today is worthless scrip.  And that’s the point: valueless tokens expressing valueless labor."

Economics 101 - The law of supply and demand is ever-present. If you make the same mistakes as many governments have done throughout history and you stretch your money supply to the extent where demand can't keep up then you are in a vicious cycle of hyperinflation. 

What we have today is a reactionary monetary policy. When the money supply was tied to the gold standard, it was proactive. The safeguards were in place to keep the money supply well within control."

It's a global market now, everyone trades with everyone. Protectionism does no one any good. How the US economy recovers is designed financial planning from within, not by taxing necessities US industry requires to stay alive. Does no one remember when Trump excessively taxed Aluminum and Steel? It took Coca Cola and Pepsi (2 things Trump drinks more than water) to say they need it or they'll have to throttle production and layoff jobs. Trump then ditched the tariff. I have always looked at taxes as a last gasp effort of governments who have run out of ideas on how to make money for fed governments.

2021-05-22 16:51:06,wallstreetbets,Yup the moon is within $60-$100. There are a lot of index funds that hold Virgin that will have to rebalance eventually too which will bump it up. Also I bet the clown show at ARK will jump on board again at the highs..
2021-05-22 16:00:47,wallstreetbets,Great!!! But how does the company make money?

2021-05-22 17:48:15,wallstreetbets,"how much profits can they make tho? considering how much they’re losing money flying those rockets up there and back, even if they only offer those services to rich people, do you think they’ll be able to make a profit? what about the climate damage they’re doing by flying those rockets, we know how much propaganda there is for “renewal” energy nowadays"
2021-05-22 18:38:46,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy puts on this piece of shit company again.

Wait for the exuberance to take it past 40+ and then buy puts around 25.  

Then profit.

2021-05-22 15:42:57,wallstreetbets,Super!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
2021-05-22 16:09:29,wallstreetbets,They didn’t hit 100km. Technically not space… I’m great at parties.

2021-05-22 16:25:45,wallstreetbets,To the Moon
2021-05-22 17:45:55,wallstreetbets,"IT WILL!!!!!!!!!!! 

This was one of the first short squeeze successes of last year on WSB. I know there are A LOT of new people but a bit sad to see so many seem to have forgotten.

$SPCE has been my best play during all last and this year, I've flipped it twice from low 20s to $43 and $56 making over 120k.


Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities.
I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.


It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.

I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!


Now that WSB is onboard we can take down another hedge fund, let's GO!"

2021-05-22 19:25:30,wallstreetbets,Huh. If they rebalance after it goes up that means they have to sell the stock?

2021-05-22 19:49:27,wallstreetbets,So you think are going to sell low just to buy high?
2021-05-22 19:28:42,wallstreetbets,"1% of 328 mil is still 3,280,000. If even 1% of those people fly at $250k a ticket that 38000 * 250000 = $9,500,000,000

And that's not including potential customers from other countries & additional sources of revenue the company could pivot into. 

I dont think long term unviability is a problem. By the time they run out of customers, there will be new rich people that also want to go to space."

I actively use draftkings, betonline,  and bovada. What state are you betting in? Their odds are different on a per state basis and as they begin to leave the expansion period in said state, I’d imagine their vig would adjust to match the norm. (Other bookies)

When DKNG opened at first (in my area), their lines were insane, now a year later they’re on par with offshore bookies. They wont need to offer as many promotional stints or insanely great odds as growth begins to stagnant and revenue is steady.

but that’s just my opinion"

2021-05-22 13:13:56,wallstreetbets,yeah i just love dick kings man.
2021-05-22 15:59:00,wallstreetbets,Ok. But he was talking about dfs (see; contests)

2021-05-22 16:02:38,wallstreetbets,"There’s several contests within their sportsbook; betting pools, free promo contests for free $$ bets on o/u. So he’s most likely referring to the sportsbook contests. Plus it’s DFS off season."

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SPCE Virgin Galactic Test Flight 5/22/2021 is currently successfully proceeding as planned! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 FINAL EDIT:  VMS Eve has landed safely. Thanks to our pilots Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci for flying the mothership today and their vital role in helping VSS Unity complete today’s spaceflight!

Twitter link for direct updates from Virgin Galactic team -> [https://twitter.com/virgingalactic](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic);

\- Take off! VMS Eve and VSS Unity have taken to the skies above Spaceport America, New Mexico.

\- VMS Eve is taking VSS Unity to a release altitude of 44,000ft. The climb to release will take approximately 60 minutes.

\- VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now at 30,000 ft, nearly half-way to release altitude.

\- Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.

\- VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

\- VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\- VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\- VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\- The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

A successful test flight + landing!

EDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

EDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).

EDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.

Congrats to fellow bagholders, this was a fun one to watch!  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"

It's an idea that was great for a budget build way of getting a guy into space once, but an idea that should have been killed as soon as Spacex started landing rockets and Blue Origin started developing New Shepard. The rocket glider is not scalable to orbital missions. There is no abort feature like Spacex and Blue have, and it is dependant on a sketchy feather mechanism that has already killed someone."

2021-05-22 17:46:37,wallstreetbets,"YES!!!!!!!!!!!

This was one of the first short squeeze successes of last year on WSB. I know there are A LOT of new people but a bit sad to see so many seem to have forgotten.

$SPCE has been my best play during all last and this year, I've flipped it twice from low 20s to $43 and $56 making over 120k.
Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities. I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.

It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.
I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!

Now that WSB is onboard we can take down another hedge fund, let's GO!"

This is below the 100-kilometer altitude of the Karman Line, which is commonly used as a standard, although not official, boundary of space. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the world air sports federation that maintains records for both aviation and spaceflight, said in November that it planned to reconsider the altitude of the Karman Line, suggesting it might be moved down to 80 kilometers.

Also betting against TLT is very dangerous and buying short term weekly options can make you lose significant amounts of money so please don’t do so expecting to make quick money.

I wonder why schools teach you that hyper is a 50% when I promise: at 49% you feel veeery hyperinflated. Even at 5% monthly you can see prices double at a minimun period of every year and half. Someone tell me if this is not to worry about.

According to the international bussiness standards, hiperinflation is defined by three requisites.  3% monthly makes you reach the cummulative 100% in three years. that is one of the requisites to be in a hyperinflated economy. 

Your country have an advantage: most of your printed money go around the world exporting inflation to other countries. You can verify it.

I am more concerned about your government, is creating a trillion deficit a year and this is before the 2021. You dont have a liquidity problem, your economy have a problem of solvency. Im not sure if this is the correct word, but I think is still understandable."

Fed has said they are OK with letting it run above their 2% target to bring the average up.

Gas & food prices are exploding and the only thing holding rates low is the Fed. Pressure will continue until Yellen is forced to start raising rates to slow the Inflation and then things will get ugly quick.
2021-05-22 14:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Rates are extremely low. They are going up, but remaining extremely low.

You can have inflation with rates at 3% (what is expected next year) without any problem. In 1980 rates where **15%** and inflation was still 10%. In 1970 rates where **10%**, and inflation 5%.

So don't imagine rates around 3% will do something more than rates at 15%."
2021-05-22 13:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that somehow gets lost in the headlines. If inflation is 0% the year before, then 4% the next, it’s an average of 2%. Which is precisely what JPow describes.

Funny enough, it’s the same headline writers that were trying to make people people afraid on deflation just a few months ago.

Moreover, wages haven’t been keeping up, which means that the relatively modest inflation we’ve seen in commodities is actually higher than you’d think. I made a post about it here a couple days ago.

2021-05-22 18:13:09,wallstreetbets,"100% spot on. I was trying to focus just on the ""official"" inflation numbers. We've actually had insane inflation since 2008 in what I think of as the ""big three"" - housing, health care, and education.

Bread hasn't gone up that much...""yay!"" but a huge number of Americans have found themselves completely priced out of the housing market, which is doubly exacerbated by the fact that so many of them have insane amounts of student loan debt holding them back. God forbid you get really sick or have a persistent or unusual illness...then it's just game over financially.

I guess my feeling is that everybody was scared shitless about hyperinflation after 2008 but it ""never came"" (except it did, just in disguise) but nothing bad happened either way...we had one of the biggest bull runs in history and continue to hit new ATHs regularly. We've been printing the whole time with only a couple half-hearted attempts at dialing things back.

Entirely possible the whole thing comes tumbling down tomorrow...or maybe we have another 10 years of insane ""growth"". Not sure betting against TLT is the optimal way to guard against that"

It was a surprise to me, but I'm sure it wasn't to you. Know Thyself, as they say."
2021-05-22 12:41:52,wallstreetbets,"Finally, can we fuck now!!!?? 😂"
2021-05-22 13:44:54,wallstreetbets,Lasting inflation vs temporary inflation then but you get my gist.
2021-05-22 13:32:54,wallstreetbets,"That's the point. Understand the words you say before you say them. They don't know what they mean. Obviously the markets get shook up. They're sensitive to anything that's not buy buy buy, and everything is perfect, etc. The US economy is boom and bust by design (capitalism). This is how it's always been."
2021-05-22 16:35:44,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you’re understanding what basically everyone in this thread is saying. If the US dollar became hyper inflated and effectively worthless, it would be the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. It would likely be worse. The US dollar is the single most important security in the world."
2021-05-22 14:29:03,wallstreetbets,"This is 💯 right. And you, like me, are the few that understand this. This makes buying growth stocks attractive"
2021-05-22 14:26:03,wallstreetbets,">It's not like we don't have enough stuff to sell

>We aren't producing enough to meet demand

I'm pretty sure that not producing enough *is* not having enough to sell."
2021-05-22 17:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Dude you’re so wrong. Many businesses are closed for good and won’t ever reopen. Unemployment checks are stopping in September in most all states that people have been getting from federal stimulus. 

Everything seems exciting now because summer is approaching and people are tired of being inside and don’t want to hear anymore bad news. But when fall and winter comes so will reality."
2021-05-22 14:29:01,wallstreetbets,"US has the most savings because the gouverment has been shoving it up your throat. And 6% unemployment is a wishful number, which even lying prick jerome cant sweep under the rug. Your trade deficit is balooning and gouverment jobs are the only things that are created in the US as of now. If this trend continues, stagflation is the new way to go."
2021-05-22 14:05:39,wallstreetbets,U-6 is probably a better measure for the time right now. And that sits at 10%.
2021-05-22 19:19:28,wallstreetbets,"It's not only wrong, it's obviously wrong. And based on misinformation."
2021-05-22 19:40:33,wallstreetbets,"The fact that, in addition to shit coins, you are also interested in penny stocks does not make me more confident in your financial literacy"
2021-05-22 13:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Lmao! Man, there's too much led in the water."
2021-05-22 12:39:34,wallstreetbets,I don't recall
2021-05-22 13:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Who knows. But look at the 10y bond yield climbing at 2% it’s going to rock the economy as there’s no confidence in the debt to be repaid.

You don’t need a economic degree to see the stock market at all time high while the bond yield is climbing. The fed is buying too much and it’s going to suck cause taxpayers is holding the bags."
2021-05-22 13:42:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean the facts is there if you can understand. Corporations posting record profit and stock gains selling bonds to the Feds?

Just recently banks been selling bonds to the Feds and they get repo for supper low rates 🤦‍♂️

Yeah it’s a house of toilet paper ready to get wiped."
2021-05-22 13:59:24,wallstreetbets,But if you want to know how much jobs the stimulus creates you can look at Obama stimulus out of the 2009 crash 🤷‍♂️. Try reading instead of getting spoon fed. His debt was massive easily doubling the debt
2021-05-22 13:36:24,wallstreetbets,Yea it does. Lot of people invest. I also don’t trust sleepy. Until he lays out the real plan who knows
2021-05-22 13:29:42,wallstreetbets,Republicans can't even spell crayon. Or revenue.
2021-05-22 12:47:29,wallstreetbets,Probably pass out on couch after too much whiskey. Who knows
2021-05-22 13:35:23,wallstreetbets,Come on. It’s funny though
2021-05-22 12:44:03,wallstreetbets,Ohhh rub dicks first. Beer time. Sorry. I’m a little testy. Power washing sucks. I’m beat
2021-05-22 13:49:33,wallstreetbets,"True. But the thing is inflation causes more inflation. Think about it. The buying power of the US will decrease. It's not really 1+1 like that. It's not that the fed says ok we gonna increase interest by 1% and that will stop it. Other countries decide they are buying less $, inflation increases again. Lots of factors i don't really understand effect that."
2021-05-22 16:50:56,wallstreetbets,"I understood and I rest my case. 

Great Depression wasn't hyper inflation, it was hyper deflation, so the complete opposite. This will be different, simply because now USD is not pegged to gold."
2021-05-22 14:29:42,wallstreetbets,"It will be temp. The reason is because imports have been low because the pandemic. Now that everyone is out, there ate shortages. But macro theory says that eventually supply will catch up with demand and will surpassed demand."
2021-05-22 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,But we are now producing. It will just take a little time to catch up.
2021-05-22 19:42:11,wallstreetbets,What reality? Shitty businesses closed. They weren't ever profitable.
2021-05-22 13:41:16,wallstreetbets,"""lead"" (sic)"
2021-05-22 16:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I agree that inflation is coming, but I still see a lot of value in an infrastructure plan."
2021-05-22 16:02:29,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people invest but put the majority of their money into tax-sheltered vehicles, I think their are called Roth IRAs?

Most people aren’t day traders, house flippers, or the like.

The increase in tax for capital gains from what it is now to what its proposed comes off the **profits**, it’s not a straight income tax."
2021-05-22 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,I feel ya man. Bartender here.... No air-conditioning... It's hot. Hope your shift goes quick brother.
2021-05-22 14:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. As long as supply bottle necks are resolved competition is gonna come back and prices will be pressed down. The strawberry example is actually a good one. Where I live they start selling every year around june. Some years it's up due to a cold start of the summer and some years its down. It doesn't benchmark itself on the previous year but on  supply, demand and production costs as most consumer goods do. When bottle necks are resolved, supply goes up driving prices down. Since the majority of the current inflation is due to these factors I expect it to be transitory. I also do not believe that other countries will stop buying USD. For all extents and purposes it is the global currency and such a change of paradigm doesn't just happen over night. Also lets keep in mind that inflation has been too low for many years, a temporary boost might be healthy."
2021-05-22 14:33:21,wallstreetbets,"I mean that's fair, I was mostly just pointing out that your wording left a little something to be desired haha."
2021-05-22 13:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Oops, third language, no spell check:)"
2021-05-22 14:27:35,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Just too many lightbulbs in the water.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
2021-05-22 17:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Inflation happens yearly (at 2% clip because of COLA). The disconnect is when fed inflation gauge verse real world cost of living (COL) is way off. Your cost of living is well above 2%, more like 25-40%.  Hyperinflation is dangerous because asset is bubbling when consumers starts to tighten up their budget."
2021-05-22 13:34:59,wallstreetbets,I’m good. Slamming beers while powerwashing my house. It’s like 90 out
2021-05-22 15:03:58,wallstreetbets,"What suply bottle necks exist in housing markets? Or used cars markets? Inflation means a dollar buys less. You can see it all around you, and me living half a world a way from you, see it too."
2021-05-22 15:00:47,wallstreetbets,But you're assuming inflation is due only because of supply bottle necks. What about a debt that rose few folds? Or a manic printing? Or so many more factors playing that neither of us understand. I am saying the fed is acting as if they know how it is going to play out for a false sense of stability. You assume you have the slightest clue?
2021-05-22 14:35:45,wallstreetbets,I understand. But think about that all macro theories were based on 3-4 % normal inflation rate. I don't understand when above 2% became evil
2021-05-22 15:23:58,wallstreetbets,"In housing markets it has been way more expensive to build during covid because of among other things imports of building material. This is because of a global container shortage. Not to mention covid shut downs halting production, workers having to stay home at the slightest symptom. At the same time you have more people working from home wanting to move to bigger houses. Stagnant supply and hightened demand =price goes up. In used cars it's both the containers for parts and the chip shortage. New cars are sitting on production lines waiting for parts and chips. When there's a limited supply they are gonna sell out at the dealerships so people start buying used cars instead. Add to that people who have gotten a worse economic situation because ofbthe pandemic who might normally get a new car now going for a used one instead. Price of used cars goes up. Supply, demand  and bottle necks."
2021-05-22 15:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Well seems like your bias is confirmed. I would recommend you to doubt it for a second, just for the sake of your financial security. There is a possibility you are wrong, whatcha gonna do bout it?"
2021-05-22 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Of course there is a chance I'm wrong. I don't have a crystal ball. But if I am and there is hyperinflation, we're all screwed and I guess I'll go all in on the Hongkong exchange."
2021-05-22 15:38:07,wallstreetbets,Hyperinflation is a big word. I believe double digits or close. I'm not a rage prophet. It's gonna be down strong and then it will be up again. You won't be screwed if you play it right.
2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Some call me a prostitute. I prefer to be called a whore.

But if the guy initially invested 300k in GME, we can assume he's not the average American and makes more money than most of us"

2021-05-22 12:10:52,wallstreetbets,It wasn't like that before GME lol. Only the dumbest of YOLOs were put on display. This is just stupid and sad that someone has a half million dollars and still has to beg for attention and approval online anonymously. That's next level sad.
2021-05-22 12:33:45,wallstreetbets,Did it hurt your pussy that I cold read someone online? Do you feel the need to go through comments and stick up for people who didn't ask you to? Very cool. You should wear tights and ask your mayor for a skeleton key because you're such a good and righteous person. Hero.
2021-05-22 12:57:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah right, what's the risk in overly concentrated positions with an entire portfolio in a single position? I CANT see how that would be wrong. It's not like there are countless traders and pieces of information that explicitly say why you shouldn't do this. But hey, what's the risk, coming from some inexperienced person who doesn't comprehend the silliness of his own question. Do you know who Bill Hwang is? 

The fact that you're asking such a dumb question, and it is dumb, shows you don't have any idea what you are talkng about. You're just some person who took personal offense to a comment not directed at you and chose to try and rationalize the illogical through a scope of zero experience. 

You are not helpful or good in any sense for acting that way. People like you with supportive opinions to bad habits are actually reductive to the progress of anyone trying to be successful at trading. 

Im not mean, you are just pointlessly oversensitive."

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

2021-05-22 10:21:45,wallstreetbets,"Turkish stock market is a terrible bear market since 2013 in dollar parity. The index came from $500 to like $150. It only seems like appreciating because of the bad monetary policies like keeping interest rates irresponsibly low for political gains and causing hyperinflation in the end, plus large trade deficits mostly due to energy dependence. In reality, the index can't catch up with inflation.

Fed is both better equipped and politically more independent than Turkish CB. Even if they weren't, people would flee to gold and less inflationary foreign currency and stock market would have troubles catching up with inflation. Solid companies that can increase their earnings percentages in an inflationary environment too.

Source: I am Turkish. I hold gold and some mid term plays like refineries in Turkish stocks. We have fucking extremely cheap stocks but shit won't change until there is a political change in my country. Some options and stocks betting on Erdoğan losing elections might be a WSB worthy play though. But in short, i think you don't understand the effects of high inflation on the stock market."

2021-05-22 11:19:35,wallstreetbets,With higher rates of inflation the prices of products rise faster than peoples wages so less products are sold and stock prices come under pressure.

2021-05-22 08:22:32,wallstreetbets,Especially with the high amount of debt that has variable interestrate. Those will default once interest rises. In macro economics i think production capacity is maxed out so if demand rises only prices can go up. Production capacity has to be destroyed so the cycle can start over. Putting more money in the economy doesnt solve the problem of maxed out production capacity only development can. You can see that during the industrial revolution. Interest has to go up soon if you see the rise of prices in raw materials. Consumer goods will be affected by this and prices will keep rising.

The US might punish them for breaking Iran embargo through gold smuggling too (Halkbank stock if you want to gamble on the US acting harsh or no).

So you should know some inner workings of the country to invest and that is hard for a foreigner.

My position: I bought TUPRS at $10.2, the monopoly refinery of the country because i predict rising demand in jet fuel, their largest profit margin product. They usually pay good dividends too but the refinery shut down last year, their access to cheap Iran oil got cut and they had large losses, and the price went down.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME Holders! $10,000,000 Is FUD To Keep You To Hold The Bag! Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for “stock manipulation”. If you don’t think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don’t do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don’t let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

2021-05-22 06:04:47,wallstreetbets,Turd app. Will lock your money. You could’ve gotten the price for cheaper on TD or any other real broker and saved yourself 2-4k in cost. Instead of paying .4 you could’ve paid .36-.37.
2021-05-22 10:59:35,wallstreetbets,"Technically it’s not a “loss” because the option is still active, but being down 98% does in fact feel just like a loss tbh."
2021-05-22 10:56:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah but  you still have 26k to put elsewhere. I made that mistake too many times. Don’t go down with the ship. Chances are slim that you’ll come out on top. You’re too far outside the money
2021-05-22 12:20:01,wallstreetbets,It shows the bid/ask for the contract that OP yolo’d over time. It also has other data points but don’t worry about that yet.
2021-05-22 17:37:44,wallstreetbets,No this is not a vertical call spread its just a single naked call
2021-05-22 12:20:17,wallstreetbets,Nobody TELLs him lol
2021-05-22 16:28:17,wallstreetbets,"yes, robinhood will fuck you over.

it's not worth it. Robinhood does worst fills and they pocket the difference, so you will instantly lose about 3-5% your account value every time you make a trade.

To put it into perspective. I placed a $5k bet on MSTR put, and fidelity did a price improvement of $170 dollars. If I used robinhood, they would have kept that $170 for themselves.

Even if you put a limit order, it doesn't matter. Say you want to buy a put for $3.50 and it will never fill at that price until price fluctuates down to $3.45. Then citadel buys it for $3.45 and then sells it to you for $3.50. Limit order doesn't mean anything when they can wait on filling your orders."
2021-05-22 12:52:19,wallstreetbets,"My experience trading options hasn’t been horrible, but I have noticed that the option values tend to be inaccurate sometimes in comparison to the options calculator I use separately."

2021-05-22 14:04:47,wallstreetbets,An options calculator cannot account for implied volatility changes in the market. It takes the current IV and calculates expected price as underlying price and time changes only.
2021-05-22 16:28:41,wallstreetbets,"its options are inaccurate because robinhood fucks you over.

2021-05-22 17:02:09,wallstreetbets,"try fidelity. The user interface kinda sucks, but they will always fill out orders at best prices. Even if you put a price too high, they will automatically search for a lower price and fill any orders at that lower price."

2021-05-22 04:31:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah it will the patents they are releasing for 5G are the only credible competition to huawei’s so which such a monopoly they have going for them I’m surprised it’s so undervalued. I think they suffer from their legacy phone manufacturing rep which is understandable.
2021-05-22 03:46:26,wallstreetbets,Nice! $10 calls for January 2023? That’s a 100% increase in price but fuck it man I don’t see why not other than like the 4 billion share float. Pretty diluted but I’m holding NOK leaps. Have been since late 2020 (before it was a meme).

2021-05-22 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Underrated company IMHO. After a decade of being relegated to little more than a meme about indestructible antique phones and bleeding cash they’ve amazingly somehow positioned themselves as about the only end-to-end 5G company out there (that Chinese company notwithstanding). 
In just the past couple of months they’ve made deals with largest telecom companies in Sweden, Philippines, London, and a bunch of future work with US tech sector as well. 
As soon as these moves start turning into actual earnings and not just news stories (we saw a taste last quarter and stock jumped 15% in a day) this will continue to gain traction. If the 2nd or 3rd quarter reports later this year are anything close to what we just saw, or better, then $6+ won’t be tough by this January and $10 by Jan 23 isn’t unrealistic at all."

That’s with the current 43% IV. If things get a little more volatile, say it gets jumpy in sympathy with GME’s next big shake-up, that can be closer to $50k."

2021-05-22 16:50:32,wallstreetbets,Explain plz.
2021-05-22 17:24:46,wallstreetbets,1 call contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price. A put is the option to sell 100 shares at that price. That's the basics of it.
2021-05-22 12:07:23,wallstreetbets,That is correct
2021-05-22 16:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Well, just that... when a WSB stock “explodes” (aka it gets extremely overvalued such as MVIS at 30, AMC at 15, etc) you short it and make profit. You have to put wide stop losses due to the volatility tho.
Basically instead of going long at the precise top like all the apes here, you go short like a sensible human being 🤣 It’s the exact opposite, nothing more nothing less."

2021-05-22 13:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Plans have been modified slightly n stuff but they're in a better position than ever. No debt, drilling, best executives in the industry, deep political enmeshment, and more. If interested I would check out r/TellurianLNG"
2021-05-22 13:09:05,wallstreetbets,"It did hit yes, but dropped back down and thus posts started to get deleted. Check out the graph. It was like 800M last week."
2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure I’m completely fucked. 
2021-05-22 02:26:43,wallstreetbets,You got time. Otherwise you got umm 20 years of write off. No biggie.
2021-05-22 02:38:27,wallstreetbets,Looks like it’s well within his personal risk tolerance
2021-05-22 02:07:44,wallstreetbets,Why do you hate money?
2021-05-22 05:07:30,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning it off & back on again 🤷‍♂️😕
2021-05-22 03:58:45,wallstreetbets,"After losing $66,910, I find humor in the fact that the $30 loss is what prompted you to post this"
2021-05-22 02:00:55,wallstreetbets,Diamond toilet paper
2021-05-22 01:59:40,wallstreetbets,"What in the actual heck did you do. 

You can’t be doing this kind of stuff

Tell me this isn’t your only account"
2021-05-22 02:00:41,wallstreetbets,Rich in upvotes soon tho…
2021-05-22 03:29:13,wallstreetbets,"I am not going to ask about hedging, stop losses, and what made you buy it in the first place, but why the heck didn’t you cut your losses? You could have taken an out in March at 50%, April at 40%. I know it’s a lot of money to just cut lose but look where it got you. Tough luck, mate, and sorry for you loss. Hope you are going to be alright. 

Just to make a note for other apes and their future endeavors:

The stock of the company, CEO of which can end it with one tweet, is sitting near the all time high, like 4% off, and declining. It also gained something like 1,500% in just over a year to get there. The company had never made a profit before. The (trading) volume has been disappearing for months and is, literally, the lowest it’s been in years. The guy goes ahead and buys calls with a strike ~6% out and break even price ~22% out. The guy sees a profit of ~15% in the next few days, but doesn’t take it. A week later the price starts to roll and volume actually picks up because people are selling. The guy holds hoping for a rebound. The due date is still ~6 months out, but the stock price keeps rolling for a month before it takes a breather. It does provide a couple of opportunities in the process to cut losses and get out of the trade, but the guy never takes it. About 2 months before expiry, the guy makes this post, down ~99%. The stock is down ~30% since the purchase and little hope for recovery.

Again, sorry for your loss, mate. I hope it runs in the time left and you recover some of the money."
2021-05-22 09:32:29,wallstreetbets,I hear that if you arch your back it goes in easier
2021-05-22 02:13:46,wallstreetbets,"Marrrrryyyyyy, we got a BLEEDER!!!!"

2021-05-22 02:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Hi completely fucked, I’m dad"
2021-05-22 02:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Stop loss, trailing stops have you heard of these terms before? There’s a finite belief that diamond hands will prevail but man, you are just a shredder of monies."
2021-05-22 06:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry for this man... It is real painful to cope with losses and it will take time to get over it. Loss aversion is asymmetric, and the pain coming from a heavy loss like this is way bigger than the joy you can get from any profit.   


My advice is to take a break from all this. You need to find a new distraction/hobby. If you do not fight it, you will find yourself reliving this trade over and over, eventually ending up in a depression.  


If you need to talk to someone, feel free to send me a message."
2021-05-22 07:56:05,wallstreetbets,This isn't even loss porn. This is the kind of porn that you shouldn't watch.

2021-05-22 02:00:07,wallstreetbets,More Like a Newbie with money . No sane even Remotely Intermediate Option Trader wouldnt open a Call Option Like that without Big Sell Covers . You should stop trading and learn before you invest a penny more
2021-05-22 02:03:52,wallstreetbets,This massive influx of GME nerds to this sub does have one perk I guess. I look forward to your realized loss.
2021-05-22 03:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not, you still have more than a month to turn around. I don’t think so.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)"

2021-05-22 07:47:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't know shit about options so I have 2 questions, 
How much did you actually put in at the beginning?
If the contract expires, you actually will owe 66k to RH?

And lastly, I really hope a miracle happens and you print that money"
2021-05-22 02:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Si, muy estupido!!"

2021-05-22 05:19:27,wallstreetbets,This is why I don't fuck with options
2021-05-22 03:23:57,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand your fiscal strategy. Are you in fact just retarded?

Godspeed retard let's hope Tesla does real well in the following month. Seriously though you need to look into safety features like trailing stop losses, and look at past performance to figure out a comfortable trailing stop % for you. The fact that you're down 98% seems brain damaged."
2021-05-22 05:43:23,wallstreetbets,Credit goes to idiot Elon Musk ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

2021-05-22 04:31:29,wallstreetbets,"You might actually not be. Tesla is way oversold at this point. You shouldn’t have done this. However, I really think there’s huge hope !!!!"
2021-05-22 03:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Can somebody explain this please? This is a call option, right? Doesn't that mean that if it expires worthless he just needs to pay the premium and doesn't need to purchase the stock? I'm new to this"

2021-05-22 02:20:48,wallstreetbets,There is still hope for this
2021-05-22 02:55:31,wallstreetbets,LMAO Tesla needs to go up 90% in a month for him to break even
2021-05-22 04:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Im still not sure how to read this type of investment.

You bought at 850 but nowhere do you get to see that.to me it looks like you bought 5 x 100 shares @135 which are now worth 1.97... the breakeven is an even larger mystery to me."
2021-05-22 02:21:27,wallstreetbets,hope you learned your lesson ...
2021-05-22 03:35:14,wallstreetbets,Ouch I took. A loss and decided to start over from scratch and waited until a bigger dip happens

2021-05-22 05:32:08,wallstreetbets,I really don’t understand why with that amount of money people throw it all into one call instead of buying shares and writing covered calls. Especially with the insane premiums during the past few months.
2021-05-22 05:34:57,wallstreetbets,"A timely reminder that there are a lot of new and impressionable investors here. Support one another, learn from OP,  peel a banana, throw feacies... wait, what?

2021-05-22 08:19:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah you’re pretty fucked. Maybe time to consider pulling out before you lose the rest of it though honesty at this point that’s pretty much nothing.
2021-05-22 08:21:16,wallstreetbets,How does somebody get so far into the red? Looking for an ELIM5 summary. Thanks
2021-05-22 08:22:56,wallstreetbets,What is the strike?
2021-05-22 08:25:44,wallstreetbets,Yes for still using Robinhood 😂
2021-05-22 08:25:54,wallstreetbets,"I don’t use Robin the hood and I’m somewhat smoothbrained, what did OP do here to lose 67k? I assume these are call options but it doesn’t show the price nor the amount of contracts..."
2021-05-22 08:26:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-22 08:29:47,wallstreetbets,You are on Robinhood so yes you are fucked.
2021-05-22 08:35:23,wallstreetbets,Join hands with me to convert 1k to 100k
2021-05-22 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,You’re not fucked. You’re just a poor now.
2021-05-22 08:37:00,wallstreetbets,nah dude I own more than that in student loans for 20 years
2021-05-22 08:37:45,wallstreetbets,I knew people would call these next few weeks
2021-05-22 08:37:49,wallstreetbets,Are you ok?
2021-05-22 08:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry for your lost.
I hope that you are going to recover and get rich"
2021-05-22 08:41:00,wallstreetbets,Add 1 gme to your portfolio and you'll be fine
2021-05-22 08:41:37,wallstreetbets,"Look on the bright side, you've only lost $30 today!"
2021-05-22 08:42:09,wallstreetbets,With a capital FUCKED
2021-05-22 08:42:10,wallstreetbets,Did you actually think TSLA would be worth more than 1035 on 7/16? Or just hoping to sell the options before that for a quick profit?
2021-05-22 08:43:14,wallstreetbets,This was a bad call 😏
2021-05-22 08:44:49,wallstreetbets,"Situations like this remind me of late game basketball when it's a 2/3 score game. Logically, if you looked at one team and said , ""ok team one have to do A and B then the other team has to fuck up S so that team one can some how pull off C and D"", you would write it off as a loss for team one. That said, you're in this deep so why not say fuck it and ride it all the way out? If you made this bet you can probably take the hit with some grace. Anyway, thanks for sharing this man, Its both educational and somewhat inspiring."
2021-05-22 08:45:06,wallstreetbets,Fuck a stop loss I guess
2021-05-22 08:47:04,wallstreetbets,Can i comment?
2021-05-22 08:48:35,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-05-22 08:50:35,wallstreetbets,"You bought calls on Tesla at those stratospheric levels !👏🏻 I read somewhere that buying into parabolic rallies can come back to bite you in the butt , hope you have some dry powder left bro"
2021-05-22 08:51:36,wallstreetbets,I didn't hear no Bell!
2021-05-22 08:52:30,wallstreetbets,Great love it big ball shit right here this is what we need
2021-05-22 08:53:04,wallstreetbets,BUY THE DIP
2021-05-22 08:53:14,wallstreetbets,Why did you hold? Literally 0 catalysts for Tesla
2021-05-22 08:54:24,wallstreetbets,"If a meme stonk squeezes before your expiry date, then there could be a chance 🤔 i'm personally planning to invest in Tesla afterwards. Otherwise indeed you're completely fucked 😶"
2021-05-22 08:55:55,wallstreetbets,I’m tired of newcomers on this sub thinking that we have risk tolerance. The fact that we don’t is what makes this sub great. Go back to r/investing. And good job op for being a retard. God bless you
2021-05-22 08:57:53,wallstreetbets,With prices that cheap I may need to join you for the ride with one call.
2021-05-22 09:03:20,wallstreetbets,Wsb autist mode.
2021-05-22 09:05:32,wallstreetbets,Truest a retard
2021-05-22 09:05:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah that might be a problem
2021-05-22 09:06:01,wallstreetbets,You should puting on GME
2021-05-22 09:06:50,wallstreetbets,Maybe if the AMC squeeze ends soon everyone can jump on Tesla lol
2021-05-22 09:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Every single time
I touch tesla I get burned"
2021-05-22 09:09:47,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-22 09:09:58,wallstreetbets,I'm surprised you're surprised.
2021-05-22 09:11:12,wallstreetbets,We've got a retatd alert.
2021-05-22 09:11:40,wallstreetbets,Perfect I was wondering how I was gonna blow my load
2021-05-22 09:12:57,wallstreetbets,I’m going to buy 5 of the same contacts we got this
2021-05-22 09:12:59,wallstreetbets,Your tax bill will thank you for the next two decades.
2021-05-22 09:13:49,wallstreetbets,Just “pretty sure”?
2021-05-22 09:14:51,wallstreetbets,You just have to wait longer
2021-05-22 09:15:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-05-22 09:17:42,wallstreetbets,Damn
2021-05-22 09:19:07,wallstreetbets,How did this happen? I don't get it. If he bought call options on Tesla - maximum he could have lost was his premium?
2021-05-22 09:19:45,wallstreetbets,You still have time to average down.
2021-05-22 09:21:11,wallstreetbets,You’re completely fcked because you’re in Robinhood
2021-05-22 09:21:54,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-05-22 09:22:27,wallstreetbets,WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!
2021-05-22 09:24:06,wallstreetbets,"At least you got 1 bar of service, better than 0 bars I guess."
2021-05-22 09:25:04,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have to exercise those option... let it expire and u only lose ur initial investment of $1,000 . Just let it expire man...."
2021-05-22 09:25:09,wallstreetbets,Pain
2021-05-22 09:28:37,wallstreetbets,"I must admire you for holding this long, you got real balls 👍"
2021-05-22 09:30:06,wallstreetbets,Diamond brains right here.
2021-05-22 09:30:51,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
2021-05-22 09:31:11,wallstreetbets,You have time my friend
2021-05-22 09:31:12,wallstreetbets,On the bright side you only lost $30 today
2021-05-22 09:42:20,wallstreetbets,First problem is get out of Robinhood.
2021-05-22 09:43:33,wallstreetbets,"Crazier swings have happened in a 2 month range to be fair. You're fucked, but maybe not completely"
2021-05-22 09:43:51,wallstreetbets,Only .20 more and ya woulda got a 69420. Royal flush if you ask me.
2021-05-22 09:45:04,wallstreetbets,Ummm... But the dip... Oh wait you bought the dippy...
2021-05-22 09:46:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-22 09:47:30,wallstreetbets,Bro you deserve this 100% if you think Tesla is going to be 1000$. You’re prob more retarded than Elon Musk
2021-05-22 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,your fucked because your getting robbed from the hood
2021-05-22 09:50:04,wallstreetbets,At least you got some sweet internet points.
2021-05-22 09:51:19,wallstreetbets,Hero. Take my regards. I couldn’t afford to even buy a single share. I salute you.
2021-05-22 09:51:42,wallstreetbets,I still have no idea how to read this
2021-05-22 09:51:49,wallstreetbets,You retard I love you. You wanna split a sixer of crayola’s
2021-05-22 09:51:50,wallstreetbets,It’s not a loss if you never sell
2021-05-22 09:52:39,wallstreetbets,Jesus. I’d probably jump off a bridge... lol. Jk
2021-05-22 09:52:42,wallstreetbets,Daaamn
2021-05-22 09:52:54,wallstreetbets,Yup. You’re fucked. AMC will bail you out though.
2021-05-22 09:53:31,wallstreetbets,That makes gives me nausea just looking at it
2021-05-22 09:53:57,wallstreetbets,"join the club, my friend! Congrats!!!"
2021-05-22 09:54:18,wallstreetbets,Better you than me!
2021-05-22 09:55:26,wallstreetbets,#lossporn
2021-05-22 09:57:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you are still using RobbingHood, you are pretty fucked"
2021-05-22 09:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Probably 
but I am going down in the same boat with you !
The entire market is fucked and who knows where we will be by summers end?"
2021-05-22 10:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Nice return, buy high and never sell!"
2021-05-22 10:04:05,wallstreetbets,I am thankful I got out when it was $700. Holding Tesla stocks were like the worst game of hot potato. You were always holding over the weekend and you never knew WTF Elon was going to tweet out and plunge the stock.
2021-05-22 10:04:48,wallstreetbets,You are only fucked if you are sell. Think long game
2021-05-22 10:05:31,wallstreetbets,Always sale on the way down 😭
2021-05-22 10:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Yea, pretty much 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️"
2021-05-22 10:05:49,wallstreetbets,God speed Sir.
2021-05-22 10:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Nah mate, u good"
2021-05-22 10:06:05,wallstreetbets,"60 bagger full of L's, nice."
2021-05-22 10:06:48,wallstreetbets,The question is do u pull last $1k and make 1 final play or does Captain go down with Ship??
2021-05-22 10:11:20,wallstreetbets,OP can always file for Bankruptcy. RIP
2021-05-22 10:14:05,wallstreetbets,I’m so confused by the “current price” of 1.97?
2021-05-22 10:15:49,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure you’re fucked too.
2021-05-22 10:16:40,wallstreetbets,Fun times eh.
2021-05-22 10:16:58,wallstreetbets,That's just two percents of your account right? Everybody do the 2% position sizing thingy so I heard
2021-05-22 10:17:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are"
2021-05-22 10:17:06,wallstreetbets,Make it back !!   YOLO AMC ! 🦍🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-22 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,Wow sorry for your loss bro..  avoid options it’s pure gambling and you rarely can win.  If you prefer to play them I would suggest buying the dip with them then sell the rip immediately because time decay is a mofo
2021-05-22 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,Jesus man when did you buy these?
2021-05-22 10:20:53,wallstreetbets,"How did you manage to get - 66K€ with a 900€ equity?

And I really mean it, what did you do?"
2021-05-22 10:21:08,wallstreetbets,That is just sad it hurt me to see this
2021-05-22 10:24:05,wallstreetbets,oh my comrades![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
2021-05-22 10:24:08,wallstreetbets,Just think that you made the person on the other end of this contract happy 😀
2021-05-22 10:24:29,wallstreetbets,Well that only means you better get to sucking
2021-05-22 10:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Good loss porn, must have been hard to hold"
2021-05-22 10:25:48,wallstreetbets,"If you delete the app it doesn’t count, or something"
2021-05-22 10:26:11,wallstreetbets,Cash out the remaining 1.45% and buy lottery tickets.
2021-05-22 10:28:23,wallstreetbets,Why? Wtf my guy... why would you do such a thing.
2021-05-22 10:28:58,wallstreetbets,What’s the strike price?
2021-05-22 10:29:54,wallstreetbets,Just wait til the new vehicle comes out i can’t remember the name
2021-05-22 10:31:55,wallstreetbets,Damn. And I thought my TSLA bags were heavy.
2021-05-22 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,Sell low buy high
2021-05-22 10:33:00,wallstreetbets,"1.. $30 loss so far is no biggy. Let it expire out of the money and zee what happens.. the entire option value will evaporate.

2. Sidebar discussions about taxes anz loss carry overs.. this is simple. Imagine you are going to a casino. You walk in and gamble $1000. If you leave with more than $1000 you pay ordinary income tax (short term gain). If leave with less than $1000, you can write off the amount you lost.. If you dont have anything to write it off against, you have 20 years to make a taxable gain to match the loss against."
2021-05-22 10:34:42,wallstreetbets,Ooopps!! 😬
2021-05-22 10:37:42,wallstreetbets,"The Muskrat giveth, and the Muskrat taketh away"
2021-05-22 10:38:52,wallstreetbets,Why do y’all make option trades without knowing about the risk of options ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-22 10:39:43,wallstreetbets,This is one of the worst I seen. Keep your chin up
2021-05-22 10:41:18,wallstreetbets,"You're not completely fucked,  your battery still has 50% charge."
2021-05-22 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,"Have you  tried turning the screen the other way?
Maybe turn it off and put in freezer for while?
Last thing can think of; put in a bag of rice overnight"
2021-05-22 10:42:44,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-22 10:43:19,wallstreetbets,Dookie hands!💩
2021-05-22 10:44:49,wallstreetbets,Should’ve been prepared to lose $67k when you placed the trade. Ouch though
2021-05-22 10:45:11,wallstreetbets,Proper fucked.
2021-05-22 10:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile, I'm being a pissy little bitch over losing 100 dollars on an spy option"
2021-05-22 10:47:39,wallstreetbets,This is hilarious
2021-05-22 10:48:08,wallstreetbets,"Stock market is for investment, not gambling"
2021-05-22 10:48:56,wallstreetbets,The streets are CALLing
2021-05-22 10:49:13,wallstreetbets,Ask Elon for refund or EV credits tbh ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
2021-05-22 10:49:45,wallstreetbets,Which app is this?
2021-05-22 10:50:11,wallstreetbets,Aaelon
2021-05-22 10:53:14,wallstreetbets,U let it go down 98% lol 😆 retard
2021-05-22 10:54:17,wallstreetbets,O h
2021-05-22 10:54:50,wallstreetbets,Big oof
2021-05-22 10:56:48,wallstreetbets,I will never bet on Elon Musk. He is a self centered grifter
2021-05-22 10:58:40,wallstreetbets,"Should have just bought a tesla, would have been a better bet because you wouldn’t have even received it yet"
2021-05-22 10:58:42,wallstreetbets,Help this smooth brain to understand how it is even possible to get into this much trouble
2021-05-22 11:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes I’m down bad and sad but seeing this make me happy, thank you op 🙏"
2021-05-22 11:04:24,wallstreetbets,Next time setup a stop loss sell order bro. Also stop using Robinhood cause that is what exactly happened.
2021-05-22 11:07:20,wallstreetbets,Should have sold when high but you can always keep trying.
2021-05-22 11:07:33,wallstreetbets,I didn't register that you were trading options and thought TSLA had fallen to $1.97 for a second!
2021-05-22 11:09:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are"
2021-05-22 11:09:04,wallstreetbets,"Oof, options on Tesla is risky man. We love to see it, you definitely one of us retards!"
2021-05-22 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,Why can't people with money like this just buy the shares and be a multi-millionaire in 10 years +? What a shame.
2021-05-22 11:10:46,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk should personally hug you for the love you proved for his company
2021-05-22 11:11:00,wallstreetbets,Honestly don’t know how people didn’t see Tesla as drastically overvalued.
2021-05-22 11:11:08,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what all that means but I think you are fucked lol
2021-05-22 11:11:43,wallstreetbets,"That why it's usually never a good idea to hold until expiration,  I'm sure you was up at one point greed just get the best out of us sometimes"
2021-05-22 11:11:54,wallstreetbets,Buying calls at the top lol this is the way smh
2021-05-22 11:12:50,wallstreetbets,This is the Tesla curse.
2021-05-22 11:15:20,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-05-22 11:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did you buy OUT OF THE MONEY calls? I can’t believe buy calls instead of selling puts, it is the same scenario but no risk. The stock can go up or down and you still make money"
2021-05-22 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,Leaps are Supreme according to the man
2021-05-22 11:19:05,wallstreetbets,Got damn
2021-05-22 11:20:19,wallstreetbets,Can someone school me? Is that -67k the price of the premium?
2021-05-22 11:20:22,wallstreetbets,now take that $985 and turn it into $67k
2021-05-22 11:21:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are."
2021-05-22 11:22:44,wallstreetbets,Don’t think you’ll be getting fucked anymore for awhile after this
2021-05-22 11:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Can somebody explain the $1.97 at the top? It looks like it’s saying that’s the share price, but the share price is actually like $580"
2021-05-22 11:23:58,wallstreetbets,Where is she ?
2021-05-22 11:25:25,wallstreetbets,Bruh. I would pack up all my shit and move to Nepal to become a Buddhist monk and give up all attachments to the physical world. (Aside from what's left in my bank account.)
2021-05-22 11:26:22,wallstreetbets,Sheesh 😒 is this a call
2021-05-22 11:26:27,wallstreetbets,"Options bad, shares good"
2021-05-22 11:26:52,wallstreetbets,Tbh idk why people do this to themselves when they can just buy & hold GME 💎🙌🏼💎
2021-05-22 11:28:16,wallstreetbets,On the bright side you made someone’s day 😁
2021-05-22 11:28:42,wallstreetbets,I didn’t even have to look at the ticker
2021-05-22 11:29:31,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain all these fields to a beginner? I don't know how to read what happened.
2021-05-22 11:31:13,wallstreetbets,Oooof
2021-05-22 11:31:22,wallstreetbets,Use the Martingale method to pull yourself out of the whole. Mathematically guaranteed
2021-05-22 11:31:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks for making me feel betrer
2021-05-22 11:31:43,wallstreetbets,Better*
2021-05-22 11:32:09,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-22 11:35:10,wallstreetbets,Should I tie the rope or you got it? By the state of your portfolio I'd say you'd need my help....
2021-05-22 11:37:04,wallstreetbets,How did you even get 70k being so fucking stupid?
2021-05-22 11:40:10,wallstreetbets,"No worries, I took the opposite approach of buying OTM puts on this.  Blew it all.  Pretty sure it can only go down or up.  Not just stay wallowing like the rest of the market for 2021 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
2021-05-22 11:42:26,wallstreetbets,Immagen if those were puts instead of calls.... the guy on the other side of this must be your wifes boyfriend.
2021-05-22 11:43:58,wallstreetbets,Even with how volatile Tesla is I doubt I'd ever get to that strike price. You need a goddamn miracle.
2021-05-22 11:44:05,wallstreetbets,Damn. I thought I was ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
2021-05-22 11:44:42,wallstreetbets,"All good, soon enough you'll be at a $69,420 loss"
2021-05-22 11:44:52,wallstreetbets,I sense a bad decision in your past.........clouded by greed you were.......
2021-05-22 11:45:03,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry bro, you still got two months"
2021-05-22 11:45:34,wallstreetbets,Goodnight.
2021-05-22 11:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you should have sold this quite some time ago.

Risk management is key"
2021-05-22 11:46:52,wallstreetbets,damn man why can’t I own 100 shares of TSLA and fleece some scrubs selling CCs at insane strikes
2021-05-22 11:47:06,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-05-22 11:47:11,wallstreetbets,Whats wrong with losing $30?
2021-05-22 11:47:13,wallstreetbets,Only if you sell!
2021-05-22 11:47:53,wallstreetbets,Almost 2 more months to lose that last $1k. You got this OP! Don’t give up now!
2021-05-22 11:48:16,wallstreetbets,Did you try to average down like a true retard yet?
2021-05-22 11:49:24,wallstreetbets,I'm down about the same 🤷‍♂️ still holding
2021-05-22 11:50:04,wallstreetbets,I'm positive u are

2021-05-22 11:52:36,wallstreetbets,Heard Tesla could drop to $300ish??...
2021-05-22 11:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, if taxes go up, The losses are worth more to you?"
2021-05-22 11:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Not completely, you still got that sweet 1.5%left"
2021-05-22 11:58:47,wallstreetbets,Which app is that?
2021-05-22 11:59:31,wallstreetbets,im confused. how did TSLA go to $1

2021-05-22 12:07:58,wallstreetbets,"You, my friend, like most people here, are gambling. Donating to charity would be more beneficial to society."
2021-05-22 12:08:52,wallstreetbets,Is this an option?
2021-05-22 12:11:07,wallstreetbets,Time to hit that restart trigger.
2021-05-22 12:12:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t sell
2021-05-22 12:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Is Tesla was owned by another guy, I would buy the stocks."

2021-05-22 12:17:27,wallstreetbets,Nah man you still have almost a grand to go.
2021-05-22 12:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Theta until December is higher than Delta, so if you buy something, then go December or further out

+ You can sell a call for every call you bought. Looks like you have 5 calls, so you can sell 5 calls - closer to expiration and at a higher strike price than what you’re currently holding

+ You can make it into a spread by buying the same strike price (averaging down) and then sell a call at a higher strike price. The price is $.28 cents (or $28 for 100 shares) for the option to SELL 920 CALL 7/16; BUY 900 CALL 7/16

+ You can sell the position (for a loss), then open up a spread further out in 2022. The spread for BUY 1000 CALL 1/21/22
and SELL 1005 CALL 1/21/22 was $.30 cents on Friday. You could get back some money as credit while you wait for this spread to ride out

I have no idea what I’m doing, btw"
2021-05-22 12:19:15,wallstreetbets,"don’t be shy, buy some more 🐍"

2021-05-22 12:21:48,wallstreetbets,That breakeven is ridiculous bro. You'll get at least 1/4 back though. Cut your losses on the next uptrend to $700
2021-05-22 12:22:50,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-05-22 12:24:05,wallstreetbets,"At this point, you could see it as paying approximately $15 for each upvote you have on this post"
2021-05-22 12:26:33,wallstreetbets,"What trading platform are you using to buy Tesla stock on the picture? I really like it in terms of its design and simplicity 😍..Really appreciate if you can share it to me, thanks 👍"
2021-05-22 12:27:17,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-22 12:27:29,wallstreetbets,Why do you idiots buy options? Trade stocks like a real sigma male
2021-05-22 12:28:10,wallstreetbets,This post just tells me it is possible to turn 985$ into 67k
2021-05-22 12:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla above 1k is way way off into the future, those leaps need years."
2021-05-22 12:33:09,wallstreetbets,Keep the faith
2021-05-22 12:36:00,wallstreetbets,"This is always so inspiring. From a young retard ape, I wish you guys the best of luck and I look forward to being a fellow retard in the future once I have money like this!"
2021-05-22 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,At least you use Robin Hood. You saved yourself like $3 in commissions!
2021-05-22 12:39:57,wallstreetbets,Umm excuse me sir but this is a Wendy’s?!?!
2021-05-22 12:43:17,wallstreetbets,"so what did you do?

buy 5 calls with a strike price of $1,035.85?

and its going to expire worthless, correct?"
2021-05-22 12:45:41,wallstreetbets,technically this is a victory for society if you consider it's taking money away from someone who shouldn't be trusted with money at all.
2021-05-22 12:46:56,wallstreetbets,That sucks but it's good to see some loss porn again
2021-05-22 12:47:56,wallstreetbets,Wtf!!! Dude what is wrong with u!!

2021-05-22 12:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Just sell some OTM weekly's until exp to get back a portion of your losses and hope it goes up. Fuck I don't know man, I am not a financial advisor."
2021-05-22 13:01:29,wallstreetbets,"You were so close to losing $69k, what a waste of a good joke"
2021-05-22 13:02:04,wallstreetbets,"What’s your strike price? Cause as I see it you still have lots of time, unless you have a call outside of $800 or put that is below $400. Then that might be a little harder."
2021-05-22 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,Wow.
2021-05-22 13:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah, 900 EOW. Right?"

2021-05-22 13:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Yup, you're boned."
2021-05-22 13:53:52,wallstreetbets,It's so incredibly stupid of Webull to not have an exercise option button. Smooth brain to the core. Email them to fucking execute it?!?!?! Just hope the price is still where you want it to be.
2021-05-22 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,and god damn it man you could have bought me a c8 corvette instead of being hammered in the anus with a Pringle's Can.

2021-05-22 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
2021-05-22 15:03:40,wallstreetbets,Ouch.
2021-05-22 15:07:10,wallstreetbets,Maybe Elon announces a flying Tesla before expiration. That’s probably what you would need to profit
2021-05-22 15:10:56,wallstreetbets,Ooof my stomach no longer hurts as much from my loss porn
2021-05-22 15:14:35,wallstreetbets,Looks pretty good to me

2021-05-22 15:27:32,wallstreetbets,I'm so confused. Does Tesla have to reach $1035 for op to recieve gains?
2021-05-22 15:30:47,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-05-22 15:32:43,wallstreetbets,Me and Michael Burry thank you for your contribution🤣

2021-05-22 15:59:47,wallstreetbets,"You're still on RH, so yeah you may be fucked."
2021-05-22 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,You really should start writing options instead of buying them. Let the expiration date work in your favor.
2021-05-22 16:02:40,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know what’s worse, your loss porn or continuing to use Robinhood"
2021-05-22 16:02:57,wallstreetbets,"Dang this tops mine. But imagine if tsla pops off. Cyber truck, new factory, burry buying puts, more chargers everyday. So bullish. You might be alright they were 2022s"

2021-05-22 17:06:42,wallstreetbets,At least you can claim capital loss on your taxes.
2021-05-22 17:10:03,wallstreetbets,Well done
2021-05-22 17:14:37,wallstreetbets,How did you let it go -98% bro 🤣 can see why you're on Wallstreet bets. I was fortunate enough to see this on my recommended

2021-05-22 17:36:58,wallstreetbets,yes. probably
2021-05-22 17:38:23,wallstreetbets,Pretty stupid all in
2021-05-22 17:41:33,wallstreetbets,Maybe you can join a hedgefund and get covered by the next bailout
2021-05-22 17:55:51,wallstreetbets,July is still far away
2021-05-22 18:02:08,wallstreetbets,You guys realize 💎🙌 was always a joke right? At least before the ape crowd came. You cut your losses and live to fight again.
2021-05-22 18:02:15,wallstreetbets,You should just buy more. Now it’ll really pay when you (don’t) hit
2021-05-22 18:06:59,wallstreetbets,Feeling better about my -50% portfolio 🥲
2021-05-22 18:07:22,wallstreetbets,"Hey man I know how you feel, I had a 2k account and now it’s only worth $600, sometimes life does this but it’ll be alright.

Lmao"
2021-05-22 18:08:27,wallstreetbets,On the bright side that’ll reduce your realized gains. That’s if you...ughh
2021-05-22 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,Quite simple how to solve this situation. Just double down with another 70k and sell the very first moment it ticks up. Can't go tits up.
2021-05-22 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,Does that mean you owe money or just make 0?
2021-05-22 18:24:20,wallstreetbets,Why not shares
2021-05-22 18:34:12,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-22 19:16:03,wallstreetbets,Nah you’re 98.55% fucked
2021-05-22 19:19:24,wallstreetbets,Hope you elect Mark to market.
2021-05-22 08:58:36,wallstreetbets,That's the Biden economy.  A roller-coaster to nowhere.  And at the finish line the Demonrat Socialists will be there to kick you in the ding ding and take the rest
2021-05-22 02:16:39,wallstreetbets,Did he borrow money? I don’t get it
2021-05-22 10:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Bruh dont sell, tesla can only go up and come on we all know that tesla ain't going no where so wait and dont worry. Tesla is starting to sell cars in Russia so stocks will rise from that let alone them being the leader in electric cars, also every western country is going green"
2021-05-22 04:27:16,wallstreetbets,Sell what you have and buy gme....not financial advice cause I'm a retard
2021-05-22 04:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Obviously, this post means TSLA is going to be at $1500 in June"
2021-05-22 04:41:26,wallstreetbets,You are so fucked. Hope you got more money.
2021-05-22 09:01:16,wallstreetbets,I’ll buy some share hoping that will help you sir. We need to push Tesla for this mans!
2021-05-22 09:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Tesla be at 25,00 a share by 6/17"
2021-05-22 10:15:11,wallstreetbets,KEEP HOLDING TESLA WILL RUN BACK UP CATHIES ALL IN LETS GOOOO
2021-05-22 10:43:59,wallstreetbets,Wow you can still be lucky. TSLA is volatile and unpredictable. Maybe stop looking at the position everyday. Pray 🙏 and I am gonna remember you in my prayer too.
2021-05-22 03:04:10,wallstreetbets,Have you considered inversing yourself?
2021-05-22 03:14:13,wallstreetbets,Imagine if you inversed yourself

2021-05-22 04:34:36,wallstreetbets,Well done 😂
2021-05-22 05:34:36,wallstreetbets,I sold it to you then
2021-05-22 05:44:08,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your assessment, completely fucked is an accurate description of your financial situation. Drink some water it’ll help with the nausea"
2021-05-22 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,"You bought these calls at 850 during the top because everyone was making easy money and saying stonks only go up. 

Lol 

The best part is if someone had told you not to do it, you probably wouldn't have listened. Remember this loss the next time you want to play trading. Next time, pay the cost of educating yourself instead of paying mr market for an expensive lesson in losses. 

You people crack me up."
2021-05-22 14:13:09,wallstreetbets,Only fucked if you sell!
2021-05-22 14:49:56,wallstreetbets,What made you think it was going to rocket to that when it already did last year
2021-05-22 08:40:07,wallstreetbets,"""20 years"", so far..."
2021-05-22 08:06:40,wallstreetbets,Wait you get to write off loss?
2021-05-22 08:51:49,wallstreetbets,How do you write these loses off? I hired an accountant last year to just that and he completely ignored write offs. Any accountant recommendations is also appreciated.
2021-05-22 07:26:57,wallstreetbets,It's the Trump way
2021-05-22 10:08:56,wallstreetbets,20 years of write offs? What is max per year in US?
2021-05-22 10:15:53,wallstreetbets,Agreed a lot can happen from here to July. At this point hold and see.
2021-05-22 10:28:43,wallstreetbets,"I had 33 years of write offs after 2000, but was fortunately able to write everything off by 2017 after the sale of a business."
2021-05-22 11:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Only 7 for bankruptcy, he should try harder. 20 years vs 7 hmmmm"

2021-05-22 07:16:20,wallstreetbets,He definitely had his IV priced in
2021-05-22 10:15:13,wallstreetbets,Why do money hate you?
2021-05-22 03:19:58,wallstreetbets,He’s got it the other way around.

2021-05-22 09:07:40,wallstreetbets,"I wanted it to say 66,942.00 and I'm so disappointed"
2021-05-22 09:11:37,wallstreetbets,This cracked me tf up. Haha Thank you marijuana man.
2021-05-22 09:42:14,wallstreetbets,That’s when he knew he “might” be screwed
2021-05-22 10:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Hey, 30 bucks is almost an eighth of weed."

2021-05-22 09:58:23,wallstreetbets,Ouch.
2021-05-22 02:02:00,wallstreetbets,I bought this back in February when Tesla was sitting around 850$. Thought it was easy money. I was up about 10k the following week but it’s been downhill ever since. 😩
2021-05-22 02:47:49,wallstreetbets,"This is wall street BETS, his race horse lost YOLO!"
2021-05-22 07:52:41,wallstreetbets,"You can't be doing this kind of stuff 😂😂

2021-05-22 03:24:28,wallstreetbets,Unlikely. Not before the apes wake up and even then...
2021-05-22 02:34:17,wallstreetbets,He’s going to rich af.
2021-05-22 06:41:14,wallstreetbets,That was brutal but a lesson to be learned
2021-05-22 11:12:50,wallstreetbets,Many people gamble their bets until they lose. That's why didn't sell at 15% gain. This has little to do with investing money.
2021-05-22 11:31:12,wallstreetbets,It’s really hard to take the loss when it’s down 30 - 40%
2021-05-22 13:26:12,wallstreetbets,"The beautiful thing about taking a small loss, is it saves you from a big loss. Ape to Ape 🦍"
2021-05-22 09:29:55,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to bother, but how did you figure this out by looking at the image?"
2021-05-22 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,You only loose if you sell. Unless...

2021-05-22 11:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Options are the right to buy stock at a certain price by a certain date. OP bought 5 options, each option has 100 contracts to buy at a certain price. So 5x100 = 500 contracts that give you the right to buy the stock at a specific price by a certain date, in this case OP has 500 contracts to buy the stock for $900 by 7/16 (hence in the photo his breakeven price, he needed the stock to hit $1035 so he can buy the stock for $900 and still profit off it after paying $135 per contract which gave him the right to buy at a certain price ($900) by a certain date (7/16)). Each contract in this trade was worth $135 so 5x100=500 then 500x$135 = $67500 (that is what OP originally put in).

He will not owe robinhood. He will owe himself an explanation as to why he is so fucking retarded."
2021-05-22 13:23:00,wallstreetbets,It's almost impossible to lose money buying options.  That's why on the really rare occasion someone loses big buying options it is posted as porn.
2021-05-22 16:33:55,wallstreetbets,"For options you multiply by 100 for price per contract. Current value is $1.97 which is equal to $197 per contract; you can just move the decimal point two places to the right; current equity is $985 for the 5 contracts. Was bought at $135.85 which is equal to $13,585 per contract. Spent $67,925 for the 5 contracts. Not looking too good but it’s 2021, the impossible is probable."
2021-05-22 16:48:36,wallstreetbets,you can still buy a MacBook Air M1™ for 15 more dollars or 561.45 pounds of bananas

2021-05-22 03:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Bought 5 call options with a strike price of $900 for average price of $135.85. A call option represents 100 shares so he paid $13,585 for each of the five options. So $67,925. The options are currently worth $1.97 and will most likely expire worthless, though in Tesla world you never know."

2021-05-22 09:25:00,wallstreetbets,"besides what u/mikeskeezer31 wrote, and that the ""breakeven"" shows the price where TSLA share price would have to in order for OP to get their money back from this investment. If TSLA rose to above the breakeven of $1035.85/share before the options expire 7/16, OP would be ""in the money"" and could make a profit by selling the options."

2021-05-22 08:57:52,wallstreetbets,"A newbie Ape here but this is how i think of numbers, i may be completely wrong so feel free to ignore me or correct me or ban me whatever. 

150 × $197=$29,550
$29,550 + $67,925 = $97,475
$97,475 ÷ 155 = $628.9
$628.9 ÷ $100 = $6.289
$6.289 maybe achieved if price hit $625/$650/$675 i don't know but maybe better possibility, if NOT your screwed anyway. 
Good luck"

2021-05-22 08:28:49,wallstreetbets,3k year... or offset future gains
2021-05-22 09:06:39,wallstreetbets,It's not a loss. Its reverse income!
2021-05-22 09:39:50,wallstreetbets,Would also note that the losses generally cannot be tied to a wash sale for a write off.
2021-05-22 09:45:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it also depends on what tax bracket you’re in or how you get paid to see if 3k in write offs is even worth it to you.
2021-05-22 09:53:35,wallstreetbets,How do people not know they can write off losses???? What is wrong with this society??? Lol
2021-05-22 10:07:43,wallstreetbets,Yes & tell Uncle Sam to cut u a fat tendie check
2021-05-22 11:17:55,wallstreetbets,"You can write off 3000 in losses if you are ""investor tax status"" which is where most retail traders are. In order to qualify for more maximum writeoffs and perks you must be registered with the IRS as ""Trader tax status"". Meaning you can write off any expense that pertains to your trading business. But be careful once you get approved for trader tax status through the irs.. there's no going back to investor status."
2021-05-22 09:17:40,wallstreetbets,"You can only write off realized losses. So if you didn't sell, you can't write it off."

2021-05-22 09:05:01,wallstreetbets,"You may not have losses then. 


My understanding is it’s 3K + any gains. 


So if your losses are $10000 in your “lifetime” and you made $5000 this year, you’d have $2000 losses carry over ($5000 +$3000h."
2021-05-22 13:18:52,wallstreetbets,Something to note. You're not actually saving 3K you're saving the taxes on 3K every year
2021-05-22 13:54:19,wallstreetbets,You can easily get on turbot@x & talk to a pro they will walk u thru the whole thing. Thats what i did. I lost 11k last year.

That is just too risky no matter how many people are doing that here on WSB. 

At this point there is no choice but to March forward until the end it might not be complete over for you because there are still 56 days until expiration. 

A lot can happen until then. 

But damn. And I’m sure your not the only one"

I cant imagine myself holding those calls after TSLA dipped below 800s->700s"
2021-05-22 04:42:16,wallstreetbets,You could’ve bought yourself a Tesla with that money 🙈

2021-05-22 05:23:27,wallstreetbets,This hurts my soul.
2021-05-22 05:10:50,wallstreetbets,I'm sure it's all part of the strategy. You bought a LEAPS sort of so you must have a gameplan.
2021-05-22 09:11:24,wallstreetbets,Going forward dollar-cost average monthly into ETFs VOO and QQQ. Then at least you know you are doing something sensible!  It will make you feel better in general.
2021-05-22 02:59:47,wallstreetbets,TSLA was already way way overpriced. It grew almost 10 times within a year or so. Everyone was against it when it was less than $200 before the recent split. Then it was hyped by Cathy and others. You made a terribly dumb mistake.
2021-05-22 09:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, those options man...gotta lock in profit and roll it into the stock if you still think there is upside. I’ve learned to take the 15-20% profit then roll it into buying the stock if I thought it was going up more. Took me 40% of my account to learn that lesson."
2021-05-22 08:35:56,wallstreetbets,Stop loss - is your friend.  Not enemy. Protect you losses.
2021-05-22 09:09:47,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is overvalued, everyone is about to lose thousands."
2021-05-22 10:11:22,wallstreetbets,20% loss and that’s it. Once you hit 20% you cut that shit loose. Better than a 96% loss.
2021-05-22 15:50:50,wallstreetbets,Send TSLA a strongly worded email.
2021-05-22 05:41:47,wallstreetbets,Pls buy gme you'll be saved. As long as you have diamond hands tho

2021-05-22 02:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks what do those other numbers mean?  Does the stock need to get $1035 for break even? What is equity and amount?

Edit: Downvotes to -4?  Sometimes yall disappoint me."
2021-05-22 09:48:41,wallstreetbets,I am also new to this but why would anyone buy so many call options when stock is all time high? Looks like he didn't even change it to debit spreads - that way he would have pocketed some premium and have lowered his breakeven too. Am I missing something there?
2021-05-22 05:58:49,wallstreetbets,thank you so much! so Tesla has to go over 1k for him just to break even? that is funny
2021-05-22 05:00:45,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are you talking about?

The OP doesn’t have to pay shit because he already did for the calls he bought. He paid $67,925 for the 5 calls expiring on July 16, 2021. The strike is $900 and he breaks even at $1.035.85 per share. He paid $13,585 for each of the 5 calls he bought.

Part of the issue is that people who have no clue what they are talking about need to shut the fuck up. Seriously."
2021-05-22 03:37:13,wallstreetbets,How much will he owe?
2021-05-22 13:27:38,wallstreetbets,If he says it 4.5 more times he will increase the number of times he's said it by 90%.
2021-05-22 03:40:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah I copy-pasted it so I could react to everyone who said he might recover
2021-05-22 15:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so 5 x100 shares (options on shares)   but whats with the 1.97 dollars?   Im not sure how to read that. X100 its not lining up with share value. Which is around 500.   This is probably the main part where it throws me off.


The entire thing to.me feels like it could be displayed far clearer like regular stocks are shown."
2021-05-22 10:41:49,wallstreetbets,Nah i never bet against a company.
2021-05-22 10:20:26,wallstreetbets,Listen to this guy. Seriously. Turn back now
2021-05-22 11:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So since OP has the right, but not the obligation to exercise those contracts, OP can just let the contracts expire and just lose the amount paid for the premium, right? Assuming, of course, that TSLA keeps going down."
2021-05-22 11:45:50,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
2021-05-22 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,Yikes. So would $1035.85 be the strike price?
2021-05-22 19:14:57,wallstreetbets,In that case you can double double down with another 140k to fix everything :)
2021-05-22 02:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I know, but what’s the expiration date have to do with it? That’s why I asked because it seems like if he had until then to pay it back or what?"
2021-05-22 11:31:27,wallstreetbets,A positive comment is better than the negative comments that could lead this poor guy to contemplate self harms. Be positive

2021-05-22 10:01:27,wallstreetbets,Is that true for options that expire worthless?
2021-05-22 09:47:33,wallstreetbets,I think the misconception is that more than $3000 can be written off. If that were true it could be worth the accountant fee. But it's not.

He would be better off taking the $985 into a volatile YOLO play with better odds. No reason to hold it hoping for a miracle. This is like someone buying 5 of the same calls right now.

2021-05-22 08:53:53,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC went to the moon months ago.

2021-05-22 11:19:25,wallstreetbets,"It's fine if you make rules beforehand. I only buy options with profits. If I have no profits I will continue to average down into shares. If your capital stays large its just a matter of time. Once you achieve 10% profit, YOLO 5% into options. Cut losses and let the winners ride. If it goes up 50% a day and you have 3 contracts, sell 1 to lock profits, and then the 2 can really start adding to your profits without the mental attachment."
2021-05-22 03:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes, over $1k to break even. Equity is what he could sell it for at the time."
2021-05-22 12:41:20,wallstreetbets,If you complain about downvotes in an Edit you will get more downvotes.
2021-05-22 10:12:38,wallstreetbets,"No idea.  I have a seven-figure portfolio and the thought of buying over $60,000 worth of calls is just inconceivable to me. It’s either someone who’s already filthy rich or someone with a serious gambling problem."
2021-05-22 03:43:13,wallstreetbets,70k lost
2021-05-22 05:40:06,wallstreetbets,He might recover
2021-05-22 17:33:30,wallstreetbets,"They were worth 135.85 x 100 = 13,585. Every time you buy on options contract you have to multiply the cost by 100 because each contract is good for 100 shares. They are now worth 1.97 x 100 or 197. So he basically lost 66,940 on his contracts because of the time that has gone by and the price dropping."
2021-05-22 11:31:57,wallstreetbets,i don’t know why he would want to let it expire though since each contract will be worth 0.01 soon
2021-05-22 11:27:00,wallstreetbets,OP better hope that the stock price goes higher above the strike price by 7/16 or it’ll expire worthless. i don’t know the strike price based on this but i’m guessing it’s something very high like $800 or $900 lol
2021-05-22 17:56:26,wallstreetbets,"No, that’s the price you’d need the stock to be at to start making a profit if you sold the shares obtained by exercising. The strike price is not visible in the screenshot."
2021-05-22 17:40:05,wallstreetbets,$900 is the strike price but the premium paid was $135.85. For calls the breakeven = strike price + premium.
2021-05-22 03:05:42,wallstreetbets,"It’s a call option my guy. If you don’t know what’s that, go do some research"

2021-05-22 09:56:51,wallstreetbets,"It is more than $3,000 ...the thing is it's only 3K *per year*.. if you lose more than that then you have to spread it across multiple years on the future tax returns."
2021-05-22 11:30:26,wallstreetbets,"You net out gains/losses first. If you still have a loss you can write off 3k towards income. If there is a loss balance, you carry that forward."
2021-05-22 09:38:30,wallstreetbets,No you can deduct 3k in excess of your capital gains.
2021-05-22 09:34:47,wallstreetbets,IRS allows and additional 3 k in losses regardless or classification annually. You would get to deduct 8K (5K in gains plus the additional 3K) and carry the additional 2k to the next year.
2021-05-22 09:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps you are right about that.

2021-05-22 03:45:51,wallstreetbets,"At 75k he probably wouldn't have to become a dumpster whore, at least"
2021-05-22 08:26:48,wallstreetbets,"Depending on where you live and how much it costs (takes obviously), 75k a year is enough to tighten the belt and recover the loss within 3-4 years, rather than a decade."

2021-05-22 08:12:43,wallstreetbets,Move to Ukraine bro. No extradition there with United States. Before you move do all kinds of criminal activities. Bunch of YOLOS as well. Make sure to at least have $10k in your bank that will last you a few years on the hookers.

2021-05-22 06:39:05,wallstreetbets,"You would need 2k in the webull for it to be margin anyways I believe, so keep it a cash account. If you trade options on webull there is a small fee but your cash is ready the next day T+1 and stocks are T+2 on cash accounts. So it will be different from what you're used to on RH. Best thing about webull, you buy an options contract for the day, scalp it, sell it and the next day do it again. No PDT, just GFV, which means you can only do 1 trade a day with the cash you use.

Example: you have $100. You spend $50 on option, sell for $100, total is $150 but the $100 you made is T+1 so you can't trade with that money again. You still have $50 cash available to trade for that day.

Hope that helps"
2021-05-22 06:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Keep your RH for options and short term trading, 0 fees but shitty fills, and its margin. Webull has the best TA on mobile apps. Use that to make short plays for RH. Make your webull your long plays account and keep it a cash account instead of margin. It will take 5 days for deposits to clear but then you dont have to worry about PDT rule, just good faith violation/ free riding violations. 

I also recommend the webull paper trading weekly competition. Allows you to short sell and a great way to practice your stock day trading. I think 10 trade limits a day per stock on the competition. After every week you get real money towards a gift card after you save up over $2 in rewards.

Or use RH for long plays and webull for cash option t+1 plays, either way you can use both in tandem.

Hope this helps !"

2021-05-22 11:39:55,wallstreetbets,yes the max that OP can lose is the amount paid for the premium in this case around $67k. OP should have set a stop loss so he didn’t lose that much or hope that the stock price goes up so he doesn’t loss the entire 67k by 7/16

2021-05-22 13:01:56,wallstreetbets,I do to.
2021-05-22 11:17:16,wallstreetbets,That's litteraly exactly how amortizing capital losses over $3000 works. You're obviously not financially literate enough to be playing in anything other than index funds if you don't understand this simple concept.
2021-05-22 10:00:15,wallstreetbets,THIS is correct.
2021-05-22 11:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Not a licensed CPA but did pass my exams so maybe I need a different profession but my understanding would be this. 

Example: Lets say you had 66K in capital losses trading Tesla options in 2019. In 2020 you do better and have capital gain income of 10K. In 2020 you would be allowed to offset 10K of capital gains by carry forwarding your losses but the IRS also allows you to deduct up to 3k (1,500 if single which if you're losing 70K a year maybe you are, or soon will be) of the loss carryforward and use it to offset agains ordinary income as well. In the example you would use 13K of the CF in 2020 and have another 53K CF going into 2021."

2021-05-22 11:51:38,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thanks
2021-05-22 14:44:39,wallstreetbets,CPA here. You’re flat out wrong.. if he’s got a 10k net loss in year one he has 7k to carry over. If he has 10k of net gains in year two then he uses the carryover loss of 7k to reduce that to 3k. Don’t give advice when you don’t know what you’re talking about.
2021-05-22 14:33:44,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. That’s kinda what I had previously assumed but had never bothered to look into it... have mostly traded stocks up to this point and mostly held long enough and on decent enough companies that realizing a net loss for the year hasn’t been a problem yet. Fingers crossed that that continues and I just won’t have to worry about this 😄
2021-05-22 11:52:15,wallstreetbets,"What about If you invest in a company you own, run it into the ground by buying shit for yourself, then claim the losses while liquidating the assets you bought as business?

And 

Redditors are morons with big opinions for 1200, Alex"
2021-05-22 12:24:25,wallstreetbets,"There is a way you could get on top purposely losing money, but I think wash sales prevent this for now.

Say in 2020, I had $1.5m in three places - Google, Apple, Tesla, $500k each.

In 2021, Google is worth $600k, Apple is worth $600k and Tesla is worth $400k. I know that it's time to sell Google, and Tesla would probably go up in the future and this is just a temporary slump. If I sold Google and held Tesla and Apple, I pay taxes on $100k of realized gains.

However, if I sold Google and Tesla, and rebought Tesla immediately (or something like Tesla with the same temporary slump rationale), I effectively made $0 this year and pay no taxes because my $100k loss offsets $100k gains.

I can move the $600k from Google into another promising stock. Basically, I now have $600k to play around + $1m in securities = $1.6m, up $100k from last year, yet paid 0 taxes (maybe some trading fees).

Rinse and repeat for 5 years with different securities, and now I have a position worth $2m in the best stocks possible right now (not Google, Tesla and Apple) and I paid a grand total of $0 in taxes for these capital gains.

It is scalable, which means I could have a position of, say $5m, by the time I die, and I can pass that onto my kids who receive a basis step-up. Which means if they sold it, it acts as if they bought all of that at $5m, not my original $1.5m.

It's a brilliant way to build up your position, avoid a fuck ton of taxes, AND leave your kids a nice inheritance."
2021-05-22 14:25:12,wallstreetbets,"I imagine you could do something like realize your losses on the last day of the year, then buy back in on the first trading day of the new year. Like if you have a proper diversified portfolio, realize all your losses, pay no tax on your income, then buy all those shares back the next day. If you are rich enough, you probably have enough losses in their somewhere to write off most of your paycheck income.




But really I have no idea. This is wsb, I'm not a tax lawyer, I just know that the IRS has a lot of bizarre convoluted rules to close loopholes rich people found."
2021-05-22 12:12:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  But it works when you have enough disposable income to make attempts at moonshots.  I mean, what in the actual fuck?  are people so fucking stupid that they dont get the benefit of that for a person that is independently wealthy?"

The couple paid federal income tax at a rate of 23.5% in 2016, 33.9% in 2017 and 33.4% in 2018.""

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market Timing vs Pricing Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!"

2021-05-22 00:26:19,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this r/investing?
2021-05-22 02:22:53,wallstreetbets,Got a bit lost did you? Back 2 blocks and make a left. Good luck.
2021-05-22 02:37:17,wallstreetbets,Downvote because you’re using your brain. How many smart people become rich? Zero.

2021-05-22 01:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino.

While I 100% appreciate Graham/Warren and value investing, this is 100% not the sub for it my dude. Take this to r/stocks, r/investing or r/valueinvesting (that last one might laugh you out of the room because The Intelligent Investor is baby's first read for them)(

WSB is for blowing up your account (or becoming a millionaire) in a single trade and bragging about it afterwards. Graham is way too tame for a place like this."
2021-05-22 01:07:32,wallstreetbets,"This right here is why PTON is up 15% in 2 weeks. Half the trouble is just identifying clear opportunities. Oh! A stationary bike company is losing 30-40% of it's value to a product issue that amounts to less than 5% of their revenue? That along with the bottom for COVID stocks was an opportunity, still is one tbh"
2021-05-22 11:24:42,wallstreetbets,Wait so that popular movie theatre stock that lost $550 million last quarter and $5 billion last year isn't 50% more valuable than it was in 2019???

2021-05-22 01:51:07,wallstreetbets,"i mean this is all true, but check out the returns for value investing compared to momentum chasers

it's not even comparable

most of the time i am grabbing bites of the market here and there as sentiment waxes and wanes. then occasionally i see the market got something totally fucking wrong and i push all my chips in and walk away from the table. last time i did this, i retired at 40. next time i'll buy a villa somewhere fancy."
2021-05-22 04:54:05,wallstreetbets,Do you have a meme for this?
2021-05-22 04:36:13,wallstreetbets,Tldr: this is casino no one knows
2021-05-22 05:50:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks for reading for me. No text to talky for paper word pile. What does this seance say about just liking a stonk?
2021-05-22 07:18:14,wallstreetbets,"But because most of us don't have the capital to ""price"" the market and have the returns we are aiming for, we use options as leverage, in which time is crucial. Usually buying 10k of what ever share would be nice, but not possible for most."
2021-05-22 07:26:35,wallstreetbets,"*"" They just accept that the market can be irrational""*

The market has been as irrational lately as becky bridezilla."
2021-05-22 11:12:44,wallstreetbets,I have that book and i am re-reading it a second time. Big fan of Mr. Graham and his empirical approach to investing.

2021-05-22 00:48:13,wallstreetbets,"I am 100% price investor a majority of the time, which is why this whole “squeeze” scenario caught me off guard. However, if we peel back the onion on AMC, we actually see that it is undervalued and in the long term, squeeze aside, there is money to be made. 

Of course the naysayers, non-movie goers, have a different opinion on the future of the industry, but they have forgotten the ace in the hole: innovation!"
2021-05-22 04:16:06,wallstreetbets,Timing the market beats time in the market.

2021-05-22 01:04:51,wallstreetbets,NO U!
2021-05-22 07:20:15,wallstreetbets,What stock did they have wrong
2021-05-22 00:44:33,wallstreetbets,So do you work at wendys and searching for your tendies?
2021-05-22 00:22:53,wallstreetbets,Point is to go buy more AMC :)
2021-05-22 07:21:36,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🦍
2021-05-22 02:24:26,wallstreetbets,"You are definitely, 100% NOT a price investor if you like AMC and GME dude, those stocks are absolute shit, and especially AMC has a true value of around 5 dollars, less now with the horrible debt position they are after the pandemic. AMC is literally on the verge of bankruptcy and there is not a clear path they can take. Stop with the bullshit lol."
2021-05-22 04:22:12,wallstreetbets,"I made 100X on Google from my purchase of shares in 2012. 
That’s an excellent return.

However I joined WSB and made 10X return on fucking Dollar General options in a few weeks.
(Have lost it all on SPY options but you get my point).

You time the market with options and the returns are massive."
2021-05-22 00:48:53,wallstreetbets,No handy's.  I'm not looking for a fiver.  I'm looking for a meal and $40
2021-05-22 02:38:13,wallstreetbets,AMC undervalued
2021-05-22 11:23:46,wallstreetbets,"The law of diminishing returns state that the larger you get the less return you can make on your money. That especially applies to day traders. Theres a point where you make peak return on your money and adding more funds yield less of a return. For example warren buffet has said he could make a better return for share holders if he were half the size he is today. 

Any way what im saying is that at some point you will have to sideline some of your gains and park them in some boomer stock"

Thankfully I don’t have that problem!"

2021-05-22 00:26:50,wallstreetbets,"Man, theta gang that shit brah! Sell covered calls and lower that cost basis some mo."
2021-05-22 00:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Please tell me you’re at least selling calls against that crap? 

I mean, for example, you can sell $11 or $12 calls for 6/18 for $13 or $9 a pop. You have 56 calls, so that amounts to $500-700 a month. Decent pocket money while you wait for the underlying to recover."
2021-05-22 00:47:59,wallstreetbets,I am envious of your position. You are going to be a billionaire.
2021-05-22 00:26:48,wallstreetbets,😬 That's gotta hurt.
2021-05-22 00:39:30,wallstreetbets,4K shares here at 12.35...can’t get the heart to buy more and average down
2021-05-22 00:53:15,wallstreetbets,Sold 20 cc’s at $10 which expired today. Should have just let it expire worthless instead of buying to close at 50% (effectively less than 50% after fees).
2021-05-22 00:30:17,wallstreetbets,Be patient. It’ll pay off
2021-05-22 02:15:18,wallstreetbets,"People still buying that stock, damn....."
2021-05-22 00:55:40,wallstreetbets,That’s a definite win congrats. Now you can drop the RobbedyouNood account and get a real one so your tendies don’t get eaten up when it squeezes.

You’ve only lost 26% so far. This is not loss porn.

You have $48k remaining. Is there anyone in this subreddit that wouldn’t shit in a plastic bag for one year just to trade with a $48k bankroll?"

2021-05-22 10:15:57,wallstreetbets,"Y’all memeing but a close friend of mine got a job as a Robinhood support person (just trying to make minimum wage) and the massive amount of hate that came from the GME fiasco was insane. Death threats, insults, and pleas to allow traders to see/trade GME (as though she has any say) were unending. It’s a circlejerk on here about Apes standing together and taking down Melvin (fucking bravo, those assholes deserve it) but you don’t make change by insulting or degrading the person who makes less than you. That’s not taking down the giants. That’s just making people in equal or worse positions than you hate their lives. And to those who say “then don’t work for a shitty company”: 1) No one knew they were shitty before the GME removal. 2) It’s a minimum wage job in *customer service job in a* ***pandemic***. It’s not like it’s her dream job. She’s just trying to make ends meet. 

Bring on the downvotes, but you know I’m right."

In reality, all I had done was cancel an unprocessed transfer of funds into RH after they spontaneously restricted buying in late Jan. I'm sure they did not want to lose yet another customer and ignored literally 100s of emails I sent them.  Was finally able to transfer out, have never looked back.  Fuck RH."

2021-05-22 11:52:36,wallstreetbets,"Unpopular opinion - I actually had a really good experience with their customer service. 

However, I will say that I think it is absolutely ridiculous the best way to get a hold of them is by tweeting at them. That needs to change... 

But, I did. They DM'd back, we opened an email chain, they DM'd again saying I'm good to go and support will solve my issue through email. Emailed my issue through a secure portal which was my social security number was incorrect with them. Two emails and within 30 minutes everything was solved. 

I did not like the process to initiate contact. But it was a very smooth and easy process once the ball was rolling."

2021-05-22 03:08:05,wallstreetbets,Finally transfered out to Fidelity. No more benefit of the doubt. There is no doubt about the collusion that is going on between the Sheriff of Nottingham and Shitadel. Not financial advice.

2021-05-22 11:00:40,wallstreetbets,"
This is a stupid question, but are there any active class action lawsuits against RH? I lost several hundred dollars last week between their glitchy UI and costumer service. They withdrew  1.2k from my checking account when they were supposed to take it from my RH balance. I bought shares before realizing what they had done and then they sold some of my positions without speaking to me in order to refund my checking account. I’ve read similar stories online. 

Another time, they sold all of my position on one stock when I requested less than half of the shares to be sold. Their costumer service was very stern in this instance, basically saying I had no evidence. Now I screen record every transaction with them. 

I want out of RH but I don’t want to leave while I’m down. I’ve been down since they openly conspired with Melvin and Citadel to shut down squeeze. 

There are other complaints I’ve seen that seem to imply RH is operating beyond the boundaries of certain laws. 
 
I see posts about suing Citadel over the GME squeeze. It seems to me that RH is much more vulnerable than Citadel. As for me, I would just like to annihilate RH from my financial reality and the rest of the planet. Personally, I don’t like to be involved with lawsuits but I would certainly sign on to a class-action if it would A.) potentially bankrupt RH, B.) get me some of my money back w/o having to look at their stupid UI anymore."

2021-05-22 03:37:20,wallstreetbets,I'm going to be honest any platform works in the financial sector. You're not going to get a positive customer service ever. I've worked customer service and multiple industries I'm going to tell you they're going to give you the circle jerk as much as I can until you decide to quit. So when dealing with customer service that is when you need the diamond hands. Don't give up keep pushing when you do that is when you get the answers. Sorry I don't have stock choices or advice because guess what I invest in stocks that I like personally companies that have values and things I like and other things that I invested in a long time ago are now doing good bad and the other. All I can say is do you love you and when you lose because the way you invested that's you it's no one else remember that but only invest what you can lose in cash Don't take margin ever. Never do it. I saw the one post about a kid taking his life because of what he chose to do. Don't do it Don't risk more than when you're willing to lose. At the end of the day your life matters more than a dollar. Money does not make you. And that's coming from someone who is addicted to money I love it it's a great thing. I am a gambleholic and I love money and itself. Stock market is not new to me been doing it since I don't know 20 something years ago. But I've learned to read what is going on in society and the specialists and stock markets and celebrities on a 1% scale because they drive things in certain ways but it's usually an up then a drastic down. This is very long if you actually have time to read it I give you a high five. But seriously if you're investing money be smart I think twice and be careful and get out before it drops.
2021-05-22 01:51:07,wallstreetbets,$75 fee for all PARTIAL or FULL transfers out of Robinhood ! Charged to your receiving brokerage and then is debt on your account. Also all shares from RH transfer as Margin unless you call your new broker!

2021-05-22 03:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will waive the $75 depending on the account size transferred.

The margin thing is not a RH or a Fidelity (or any other brokers) issue.  It has to do with how margin accounts are generally handled and makes the transfer clear fastest.  (RH supposedly maintains ALL accounts as margin behind the scenes to facilitate their fractional trading.)

With Fidelity, an any account originating as a cash-based account should automatically revert after the settlement period (T+2)."

2021-05-22 10:03:24,wallstreetbets,"I have accounts with Fidelity and TDA - both have actual phone support and, in my experience, exemplary customer service."
2021-05-22 10:01:47,wallstreetbets,"As I mentioned, my issue occurred shortly after they restricted the purchase of certain stocks, in my case GME, late January. There were restrictions still in place on purchases going into Feb, and I had long exceeded the number of total shares you were allowed to have.  The whole debacle is what prompted me to cancel the transfer of additional funds into RH since I wasn't going to be able to use them to purchase more GME.  If they've since added customer support via phone, good for them, but that certainly wasn't an option to me back then or I would have jumped at the opportunity to resolve it much faster than it took, I had all my funds and shares locked up in RH with nary a repsonse, meanwhile was afraid to transfer out with the level of volatility we've seen with GME, and probably couldn't transfer out anyway with my whole account locked up.  I called every number I could find for RH on Google, including one that was apparently a cell belonging to a poor woman who had to field all these random RH customer calls.  I spam emailed them literally hundreds of times in chunks and over the course of weeks just to try and get them to respond. I take full responsibility for not researching the quality of a broker before doing business with them, that's on me.  But I never expected what happened would have occurred, and I certainly did not expect that a company would not offer any phone support for issues like mine.  I believe at the time the only support they had was for problems with options.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Don't believe me? That tells me that even if you've been a long time customer of RH's, you must never have encountered the type of problem I had or you'd know it was completely true.  Lol - gotta love the internet."

2021-05-22 01:21:02,wallstreetbets,Screenshots of the buy side posted elsewhere - was a mix of 5 cents (90 contracts) and then 10 little more expensive. That’s where the 7.5 cent average comes from :)

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tilray & Europe $TLRY

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [“New”](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray – a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland’s  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland’s offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **“making changes to optimize operational efficiencies.”** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‘new’ Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-f2m-tilray#/

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray’s medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Tilray is poised for significant growth*"
2021-05-21 23:50:05,wallstreetbets,It’s so odd that the largest group of liberal countries all on one continent still haven’t legalized it for recreational use. Side note: at least your life isn’t ruined if caught with it there.

2021-05-21 23:37:32,wallstreetbets,I like what I’ve been seeing from Aphria and Tilray this year. Had Aphria shares before the merger and just bought a couple Jan 2023 $15 calls.

2021-05-22 00:11:17,wallstreetbets,"The Germany and Netherlands medical marijuana market size is expected to reach USD 2.9 billion by 2027., expanding at a CAGR of 13.0% over the forecast

Germany is not a huge market to be banking on for long term position with Tilray. I’d have an exit price ready 

IMO this company is not worth space in a portfolio when there are trading platforms that offer OTC US MSO such Curaleaf, Greenthumb Industries, Cresco Labs, Trulieve, Columbia Care, Jushi, Verano, Vireo, Valens Company, Marimed,  

Curaleaf is on pace to see over 1.3 Billion this year in revenue and that is not including New Jersey who May lift legalization sometime this year 

California, Colorado, Washington Each generate 2 Billion a year in revenue in California half of that goes back for taxes. It’s a cut throat business in the west"
2021-05-22 06:42:42,wallstreetbets,No mention that Columbia care has had an overseas contract for years or that curaleaf just made an acquisition to enter Europe?? Tilray is toast... the us MSOs are the way to go... maybe the only pure play ETF MSOS if you can’t buy OTC? tilray is clearly not the best investment in the space....
2021-05-22 09:49:05,wallstreetbets,"That same liberalism is an issue to legalization in the form of a sort of ""nanny state"", which, to be fair, could*** be actually an attempt to look out for citizens health as misguided as I think it is. For example, I went to Iceland, Norway and Sweden on a trip. Liquor stores were only open like 5 hours a day and straight up closed on certain days across the entire countries with little difference between the 3. Even something as simple as melatonin was impossible to get because apparently you need a prescription in those countries. It's a weird form of liberalism, I'm pretty left myself but holy shit, let people do what they want a little bit more and just have supports in place for people who need/want help."

2021-05-22 04:40:58,wallstreetbets,"Even if the greens become the largest party they´ll find it hard to form a government without the support of cdu wont they?
And i can´t imagine them supporting legalization this century let alone in the next 4-5 years."
2021-05-22 17:35:07,wallstreetbets,Mh.. the question is if a canabis legalization will affect $TLRY in a positive way. I could also imagine that investors sell as less people will try to go the painfull bureaucracy way via medicine and get canabis from a headshop directly. just a thought
2021-05-22 08:51:49,wallstreetbets,Hard to tell at this point. We will see the results in October I guess.

And finally watch this one on the status of negotiations. Deals are coming. 

https://youtu.be/rHPkqhVtyI4

Remember Tellurian traded at $8 pre-COVID and they are in an even better place now in terms of securing deals. Never bet against Charif Souki."
2021-05-21 23:20:27,wallstreetbets,All these new Yolo posts are really starting to make me regret buying October calls.  WSBs is like the kiss of death
2021-05-21 23:30:39,wallstreetbets,Hopefully Souki can get a few deals soon. Driftwood needs to get built ASAP. Time is ticking with all this New energy climate BS.

2021-05-22 00:14:42,wallstreetbets,"TELL will be a good long play IMO.

2021-05-21 23:20:16,wallstreetbets,I would sell and look to the next “opportunity”

2021-05-22 09:28:12,wallstreetbets,"If you get the jaw surgery first you might get the added benefit of allowing more air to get to your brain so you won't act as retarded with your finances, hopefully"
2021-05-21 23:47:30,wallstreetbets,"So many people have come across this sub, decided that they can just do any ole (literally retarded) play, and then come up big, or something. I think there is a lot of drug abuse and then they hop on here and ruin the rest of themselves. I hope you are forced to learn a lesson, OP, frankly."
2021-05-21 23:03:41,wallstreetbets,hope it was a nice life

2021-05-21 23:33:56,wallstreetbets,"Liquid natural gas company, the chairman is Charif Souki. He was the highest paid CEO in the US in 2013 as CEO of Cheniere Energy.

The company struggled after shelving one of their main pipelines due to Covid but their newest project, Driftwood, is scheduled to begin construction this summer.

Commercial deals for phase 1 exports are being signed within the next few weeks, stock is expected to return to pre-covid $7 a share (or higher) from its current $2.60 a share."
2021-05-21 23:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Start with googling Charif Souki. He pioneered and created the US LNG export market when he built Cheniere. That company is now at $80 a share. Souki was pushed out of Cheniere by Carl Icahn because Souki wanted to keep expanding and reinvesting money into the business, whereas Carl Icahn wanted a dividend paying company. So Souki started his own company where he’d be in full control. Tellurian is on the verge of signing deals which will allow them to start construction on their LNG facility and associated pipelines. Tellurian will one day be bigger than Cheniere. Souki is out for blood.

2021-05-22 06:10:05,wallstreetbets,Good for u! I was in a similar boat. Had a lot of calls that printed on that huge pop. I cashed out and waited for it to come down. Went all in on shares $300k at $2.46. Endured the dip to $1.62 and wasnt even worried. Up 120k in the past 30 days. I have faith in souki and the tellurian team. Best risk reward out there. I dont know if u will get another chance in the low 2s.  I think next dip will be to the 2.30 range... but deals could get announced any day now- then good luck buying under $7
2021-05-22 13:02:51,wallstreetbets,"This shit will be $45 by the time Driftwood is completed. Don't do this to yourself, get the fuck back in here."

2021-05-22 16:07:23,wallstreetbets,"Ill get back in , in low 2's Heavy. There are 33.5M short and not currently making any profit. Driftwood hasnt started yet to my knowlege. TELL hasnt even finished securing the deal (unless im missing something) Full production wont even start until 2026.
Im not bashing it, Im putting out the facts, My original purchse was for the long. I set stop losses on all my longs once I get in profit and I stoped out in JAN @ 3.05 from .87. I do agree about the potential on TELL but this is not a 1 or 2 year play this is 5+ for full potential.
Look at the insider trades, that will give you some  Perspective. 1 buy and 21 sells in the last 3 months.
Just my opinion and facts.
My advice to an inexperienced trader is always to set stop losses.
By the way this is how I make a living. I am an investor. I used to work for money now money works for me."

2021-05-22 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,"When they're supposed to announce partner deals in the next few weeks, why would you want to sit that out? Betchel is supposed to begin construction in Q12022.

The announcements should at least bring it back to the pre-Driftwood speculative price that was pre-COVID. 

Being that this will have some initial big moves and climb over 5+ years means I'll probably keep investing. Who needs VTI when in 5 years you can have 2,000%+.

Also, the sells you have seen have been very small and only come as the execs have acquired more stock. Makes sense if they need a little something to live off of if that's their compensation. Someone on the board recently also added another 100,000shares. Insider ownership is at 32% and institutional ownership is buying more and more. That's right, money that works for you is buyingggg it uppppp, sluts. It's being added to ETFs too. 

As for Total there's myriad of speculation and it is even hopeful in some scenarios they drop out. 

Not worried. Thanks for the blessing 🚀"
2021-05-22 10:43:48,wallstreetbets,💯
2021-05-22 18:24:29,wallstreetbets,"To answer your question why I want to sit that out:
I dont but Im greedy and I like it better closer to $2.
Ive also 3x the capital I pulled out in jan so it gives me more buying power when I close out the positions I put the capital into.
 Insider trades last 3 months:
Buys  1  100,000
Sells  21 7,926,908
Those are not small.
You didnt touch on the shorting either. 
Like I said Im an investor and these are facts not hope, wishing or my opinion.
Opinion section:
This will get cheaper IMO, when that happens I will start a position. Im looking forward to the run I just don't believe it's going to happen anytime soon.
You will make good money on the long.
Im going continue to RIP SOME FACES OFF where Im at, then Ill be over to join the party."

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVidia is a good buy right now In September, NVidia released the RTX 3000 series. They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain."

2021-05-22 04:34:32,wallstreetbets,Typically goes up. More retail traders can afford the shares after a split.
2021-05-21 23:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Its a common occurrence that stocks increase prior to the split, as once they do split there is an increase in interest due to lower price."
2021-05-21 23:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Same here, tho it makes me feel bad for those who lose money joining late.

I started to realize that every time I see some dd on this sub, I'm too late and I already missed the gains, so I just buy puts and wait for the early gainers to dumps their bags."
2021-05-22 11:43:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao yes SAME! Seems when shi is so called about to moon we throw a put and we Rocket (;
2021-05-21 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Well all I was trying to say is NVDA may look enticing but their main competitor deserves a hard look at before taking a position
2021-05-21 23:28:37,wallstreetbets,Apple was up 30% in a month after announcing split (along with a good earnings)
2021-05-21 22:54:14,wallstreetbets,"That's true, I hated that damn split. I now hate Apple hahaha"
2021-05-21 23:05:17,wallstreetbets,What is with that
2021-05-21 23:07:29,wallstreetbets,I figured the OP was implying the use of a time machine
2021-05-22 01:07:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm a pessimist for two reasons: cause I'm either always right, or pleasantly surprised."
2021-05-22 00:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Yup it's either that or most.of.the time they bag has holding and trying to influence the market, which is totally doable with 10million people on the sub"
2021-05-22 11:53:19,wallstreetbets,Just add th3 stocks everyone talks about to you watchlist and keep an eye on them. You don't have to makena move on everything people say whether you believe them or not. It's usually better to have more options to choose from while looking for good opportunities to trade
2021-05-22 02:13:08,wallstreetbets,"I agree, AMD killed it this quarter, yet they’re 25% below ATH. NVDA is almost at the top, so I’d argue AMD is the better buy if you had to pick one. I have positions in both."
2021-05-22 13:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I think they are both good companies.  There isnt even a third alternative in their competing market which continues to grow, and nvidia has its AI division while AMD has its (awesome) processor division"
2021-05-21 23:56:21,wallstreetbets,That trial they have going on is going to hurt them. Cramer was defending Apples 30% cut today. Me: do 15% and settle out of court. Boom!
2021-05-21 23:08:16,wallstreetbets,Apple is just REALLY good at taking your money and getting you to buy things that depreciate like Italian cars.
2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Portfolio 100% GME. Been selling all my other stocks since February and lowering my average. Always played it safe, been too fearful but this is the first time I feel at ease. Done my DD, invested all my money. Relaxing to enjoy the ride 💎🙌🏻 "
2021-05-21 22:59:11,wallstreetbets,Me too. 100% portfolio in GME since January and haven't sold anything.
2021-05-21 22:54:25,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been told not to put all eggs in one basket, and I won’t ,but I’m holding onto my 50 shares and will add to them on the dips...(Have to admit- GME really hasn’t dipped lately.). 

Hopefully it will continue upwards!  Woo-Hoo"
2021-05-21 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,That’s awesome man! Best of luck to you and to everyone that’s invested in GME. I’m no where near you. I have a little over 40K in and enjoying the ride.
2021-05-22 08:19:00,wallstreetbets,Rotating $50k cryp..to into GME in March saved me $25k on one side of the trade and gained about $35k on the other. Net $60k off that action.
2021-05-22 07:07:13,wallstreetbets,I've got a full 7 shares. Not much compared to you lot but that was a significant amount of money to me at this time in my life. Have had my business closed because of covid for 14 months now and beginning to lose all hope. Banking on GME coming to something soon
2021-05-22 05:36:04,wallstreetbets,"I always seem to miss out on things, not this time tho, hell fucking no!! Love the movement and being part of it, altho i only have 10 shares 😂"
2021-05-22 09:47:57,wallstreetbets,"So funny how should always scream bag holders, but literally most people I see have average prices between 70 and 150, because they gave us so much time to stock up on a discount!"
2021-05-21 23:56:07,wallstreetbets,Same 100% GME.
2021-05-21 22:38:21,wallstreetbets,You glorious bastard...I’ll cheers you from across the pond. To Valhalla!! 🍻

2021-05-21 23:17:32,wallstreetbets,Supprised to see GME posts allowed on WSB today. Mods asleep?
2021-05-21 22:24:58,wallstreetbets,That’s awesome man.  I’m really happy for you.
2021-05-22 03:56:40,wallstreetbets,My account looks exactly the same... minus a few 00's though! 💎👐

2021-05-21 23:48:43,wallstreetbets,I hope/ can’t wait to tell people I got a car because of GameStop
2021-05-22 01:18:43,wallstreetbets,Funny...I been selling all my other stocks and upping my average. I'm something of a retard myself
2021-05-21 23:11:45,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations! This is the waY! 

Looking forward to meeting you on Pluto good sir! 

To Valhalla! ❤️"
2021-05-22 08:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Wait, is the short squeeze still going on? Do they just keep doubling down?"
2021-05-22 08:50:29,wallstreetbets,If I could set up a standing order to automatically buy gme shares every month with my wages I would. Sadly the best I can do is immediately transfer funds to my broker account and smash buy every single fucking month it’s become a ritual
2021-05-21 22:58:58,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, he has acquired exactly one metric fuckton of GME. Well done, Silverback"
2021-05-22 03:39:38,wallstreetbets,Yes for real bruv once in a lifetime chance to hold a single share in 6-7 digit
2021-05-22 03:58:29,wallstreetbets,100% in GME + 2% in BATTERY = 1000% True Ape 😅

2021-05-22 00:26:10,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the average! My only regret was not going full ham in the beginning instead I slowly averaged up. 1056 @ 94 hell I even bought at 257 🤣
2021-05-22 00:32:52,wallstreetbets,I would have at least saved enough to buy a phone charger.

2021-05-22 03:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Depebding on your options and where you live.. Concider buying somewhere else than etoro.. They dont allow voting, you dont actually own the shares. They own them and you get some kind of receipt. Thats why you cant transfer out. I started on etoro too. Be careful, fellow ape. Check degiro or revolut maybe."
2021-05-22 03:58:54,wallstreetbets,An Etoro user..good to we got 💎👐 there too

2021-05-22 08:40:46,wallstreetbets,I'm with ya pal.  All stock shifted to GME.  Might be at the end of my buying spree now.  We'll see what happens next week 😂
2021-05-22 08:43:32,wallstreetbets,Good man 👊🏼
2021-05-22 08:49:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way sir. We are with you
2021-05-22 08:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I’m all on as well. As well as a lot of us apes. 

Soon may the tendieman come"
2021-05-22 09:03:53,wallstreetbets,Why all GME.. just tell me one reason
2021-05-22 11:22:25,wallstreetbets,"I'm INSANELY envious of those who own more than 1,000 shares. Godspeed fellow Ape, see you on the moon!"
2021-05-22 11:23:12,wallstreetbets,When the lenders who gave the hedges funds there share to short they cant borrow them forever.. So basically when the lenders ask for them back the shares will return to the market and the price will skyrocket...when you take a short position you want to borrow the stock at the highest price possible in order to get the best return when it hits bottom.. That means the hedge funds borrowed the stocks highest price.. Also some how they shorted more shares then even exist.. This happened by person A who borrowed them allowed person B to borrow them from him.. How the SEC let thia happen idk but D-day for GME is going to be crazy just try to make sure you own a few shares.. If you still dont get it idk fo back to school then
2021-05-22 12:12:43,wallstreetbets,i swear to god trying to keep my average low has fucked me over more times than my uncle
2021-05-22 13:04:30,wallstreetbets,I sadly can’t afford that much however I still hold my one gme share to the moon we will go

2021-05-22 16:10:23,wallstreetbets,"Sold TSLA from an average 435 at about 800$

Turned around and bought more GameStop at 250$ a share that week. My average is 230$

I have faith and refuse to give up any of my 29 shares."
2021-05-22 19:28:51,wallstreetbets,The biggest clue that the squeeze isn’t over is that GME is trading at 175$ SIX MONTHS after the initial squeeze. If that’s not enough to convince you there’s some shady shit going on then I don’t know what is.
2021-05-22 00:33:46,wallstreetbets,This will end really well.
2021-05-21 23:59:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-05-22 03:47:24,wallstreetbets,">playing it safe 

>sold everything and all in on GME


You are the opposite of safe. You are in the highest risk category. You're floating maximum risk betting that a meme stock will do something amazing, which isn't guaranteed."

2021-05-22 09:32:49,wallstreetbets,Maybe it’s just me but I feel like the “ride” of GME is over. It’s been fairly stable over the last month or so and likely won’t have any more huge jumps like it did early on.  I am a full retard on this so I could be wrong.
2021-05-22 09:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, I’m sure all of these confident and mouthy echo chamber redditors will help you take on the repo men one by one...stand strong 🥸"

2021-05-22 10:06:34,wallstreetbets,Can't blame you.  Gme seems to be the only thing up no matter what right now
2021-05-22 10:19:31,wallstreetbets,I thought gme was over am I missing something?
2021-05-22 10:20:25,wallstreetbets,Can somebody explain to me why still buying GME?
2021-05-22 10:29:54,wallstreetbets,Your low battery is making me anxious bruh.

2021-05-22 00:49:23,wallstreetbets,my 2 shares
2021-05-22 03:36:46,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-22 03:15:32,wallstreetbets,You're not going to want to hear this but I'm going to tell you anyway. Reddit conspiracy theories are not DD.
2021-05-22 01:26:53,wallstreetbets,"If I'm wrong I'm happy to be wrong, but I just don't see the argument for GME anymore. It very much seems like a ship that already sailed. 

Sure, I think it can stay strong if the company does well and turns things around, but I'm just not seeing any evidence of another squeeze.

If anyone has links to resources that disprove me I'm happy to reconsider."
2021-05-22 00:54:42,wallstreetbets,"I am happy for you! But as I have been lurking here at wsb for 4 months... I remember that every single post that mentioned GME was taken down. No comments of gme was allowed... what happened? Did the mods realize that the squeeze is certain now? 
Just curious"
2021-05-21 23:35:07,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that!  LOL!
2021-05-22 02:16:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-22 00:29:30,wallstreetbets,"If you did DD and decided you want to be 100% long GME, just DM your wife's phone number now"
2021-05-22 04:22:37,wallstreetbets,But why? What do you Think Will happen?
2021-05-21 22:45:03,wallstreetbets,"It's not awesome to revert the diversity so much. Bad, bad move. If you're already up you should at least do some profit taking as a hedge since you don't have any other hedge.

And people won't like the comment because they'll say but for the squeeze... But lots of them are upside down so of course they will say to keep buying and not diversify. That will help drive the price up for them more than you if they're upside down and you're not.

I hope the squeeze happens, I really do. But people need to be smart about it, not greedy and much less gambling."
2021-05-22 05:48:26,wallstreetbets,I think this is over and it will never rocket 🚀 i hold all my shares bit i lost hope
2021-05-22 07:01:31,wallstreetbets,So how long before this squeeze happens?

2021-05-21 23:09:29,wallstreetbets,Some of you are truly brain washed.
2021-05-22 03:25:35,wallstreetbets,Funny how all these GME bros have accounts with less than 100 karma and less than 6 months old. Most I'm sure are sock-puppet bot accounts or complete noobs. Who puts 100% in one thing? And I thought Bitcorn maximalists were crazy.
2021-05-21 22:53:09,wallstreetbets,Im new here so dont rip my head off but why wouldn’t you do 50/50 Gme/Amc?
2021-05-22 04:07:04,wallstreetbets,I'd be seriously curious what DD youve done to arrive to this conclusion lmao

2021-05-22 00:11:28,wallstreetbets,At least it's shares and not options. Short interest isn't high enough for a real squeeze so the best you can hope for is another retail circle jerk driving up the price up long enough for you to jump out with profit when no one is looking.

2021-05-22 00:15:14,wallstreetbets,It's been reverse dipping.
2021-05-21 22:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Don’t blame you. I always diversified and held ETFs but currently the stock market prices are so inflated GME is the only stock I feel comfortable owning. Not financial advise, just my opinion. Always used to preach about diversity, would have never thought to have a portfolio with only one stock."
2021-05-22 06:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Don't put your eggs all in one basket? What kind of shit logic is that? I'm not using 8 baskets to clean out the hen house, that's just being retarded with extra steps."

2021-05-22 19:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, the market dictates the price, and if we value it at 175, then that's just the starting point for the squeeze. We know the SHF's hand, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride."

2021-05-22 19:30:45,wallstreetbets,Lol what? It’s trading at 175$ SIX MONTHS after the initial squeeze. What more proof do you need that this shit is primed to moon?
2021-05-22 02:06:10,wallstreetbets,And what is his price target?

2021-05-22 08:49:10,wallstreetbets,Shorts must cover. GME heavily shorted.
2021-05-21 23:48:27,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
2021-05-21 23:40:23,wallstreetbets,lol its a house of cards. Watch what happens when we take a 20% correction. Somehow an overhyped brick and mortar is gonna be safe? lol.
2021-05-22 12:16:30,wallstreetbets,Mathematically impossible that the shorts covered.

2021-05-22 05:16:24,wallstreetbets,It's also funny how most of the negative comments against GME are less than a day old.  With comment karma that reflects the one and only comment they have made on this GME play

2021-05-21 23:02:16,wallstreetbets,"I just personally do not know much about AMC. Ultimately I now only own GME because I’ve done a lot of research about it and see it as a long term investment with the potential of a short term squeeze. I just do not see the long term in AMC, especially with COVID. I trust Ryan Cohen and his vision for GME. The gaming and online industry has a lot of potential in the future and GME could become a main player. In my opinion, this makes GME a stock with value. Not financial advise."
2021-05-21 22:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is the worlds largest casino."
2021-05-22 00:19:51,wallstreetbets,"AMC is inferior to GME in both squeeze potential and as a recovering business. GME has always been more shorted and will squeeze harder. GME also has the potential to remodel and become the Amazon of gaming. While I want AMC to survive, it does not have much of an option to expand or remodel from brick and mortar. AMC is poor man's GME.

I've got like 97.5% GME and 2.5% AMC as a back up."

2021-05-22 16:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Risk of it returning to where it was? Like $10-$15? That's seriously not happening.

We own the float, probably many times over. The DTCC is passing new rules to cover their asses. Citadel is doing everything in their power to control the ascent but how long before they become insolvent? Shorters are losing ten of millions as the price slowly creeps upward and then, bam, it's going to skyrocket as they scramble to cover their positions all at once. The short squeeze will last for several days, if not longer.

Ryan Cohen becoming the chairman is another matter. He's tenacious, he's sexy, and he's here to take charge."
2021-05-22 08:23:11,wallstreetbets,Absolutely real. I'm probably as risk adverse as it gets and have bailed on stocks in the past from being unable to stomach losses. This is the first time in my life I've ever been so informed and calm about an investment and have been in since mid Jan through the up and downs. We own all the stock that is available more than once over at least and can hold forever. Cohen going to turn this into an Amazon long term
2021-05-22 14:56:00,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino! Let it fukn ride!!
2021-05-22 09:33:59,wallstreetbets,"To put it bluntly. Nothing anyone says here will give you that confirmation bias to put it all into GME.

You should go and read DDs and judge for yourself. That and time to understand it."
2021-05-22 08:52:04,wallstreetbets,Read some dd. Then you will understand why.
2021-05-22 18:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Ok my numbers are bad but here’s what I remember: 13F’s of institutional and insider share positions for GME were recently released. The number of shares NOT owned by these people was about a measly 136k. DFV himself has 200k, meaning that 64k of his shares are synthetic naked shorts, and every single other share out on the market is a naked short. Now when these bastards get margin called or force liquidated, they have to cover their naked shorts WHICH WE OWN. So if you HAVE to buy something that I own, I’m in control of the price. That’s the logic behind this, and why it will be the mother of all short squeezes. As always, do your own DD, not financial advice, but I’m buying and holding every paycheck"
2021-05-22 13:21:18,wallstreetbets,"To quickly summarise the DD for you, because there’s so many and it becomes a mess of conspiracy theories in the later ones;

All shorts must cover - the maths behind the numbers says there’s 0% chance they covered in Jan, the Melvin ceo admitted it didn’t squeeze in jan, the % of the total float available to trade(non-institution or insider) is quite low(I think around 20m?), and the most conservative estimates of retail ownership have it around 50m, with higher estimates going closer to 200-300mill. It can sound ridiculous, that’s because everything about the situation is. But the maths doesn’t lie, and the shorts must cover

As to returning where it was - Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy is the new chair of the board and has replaced almost the entire board with staff from ex-Amazon and Chewy with incredible resume’s in e-commerce and transformation, the business cleared its short term debts several years early and is sat on reserves of 500mill, most recently they’ve just re-opened sales to the EU, as part of their e-commerce transition. Bankruptcy doesn’t look to be an option"
2021-05-22 08:08:45,wallstreetbets,We looked.
2021-05-22 14:35:01,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is Wendy's"

2021-05-22 17:09:25,wallstreetbets,This guy doesn’t fuck👆🏾
2021-05-22 09:24:31,wallstreetbets,Because they’re retarded
2021-05-22 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,I am in there with you. If it were a stock going to cover the world then hang. But it’s not. Just a fade to my notion. Not saying the company wasn’t good in its prime but that is now gone. All I can say with 100% Portfio be on your toes. Coz that’s were you be when the chair is gone.

2021-05-22 08:04:23,wallstreetbets,This. I’ve been quite a logical and diversified investor until GME. Sold everything to buy more bc like you said the prices are inflated and we’re due for a recession anyway. Congrats OP
2021-05-22 00:06:01,wallstreetbets,Came to the same conclusion. Gave a lot of thought to where to park my savings. GME was the most obvious option.
2021-05-22 02:28:03,wallstreetbets,Stock market are inflated and you buy... the literal most inflated stock in the market aka GME? WTF is wrong with you dude 🤣
2021-05-22 06:48:10,wallstreetbets,"I currently hold AMC, I want to get into GME as well but I need someone to kick my ass in the right direction"
2021-05-22 01:19:19,wallstreetbets,What are you looking at for a price target 🎯?  So many memes that not sure what people are really thinking 🤔.
2021-05-21 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,"How can GME be the only stock you feel comfortable owning when there are so many companies within many sectors to choose from? Even if there is a pullback, recoveries are historically brisk if you hold."
2021-05-22 00:24:17,wallstreetbets,No offense but you don’t think GME is inflated? Lol
2021-05-22 10:59:55,wallstreetbets,"One of the things that recently I’ve been thinking about is the timing of the marketwatch/business insider articles regarding RC and how he was only (at the time) holding two stocks (AAPL, WFC) and even said if Apple went down enough he’d go all in. 

This is also around the time he announced his GME investment"
2021-05-22 07:13:27,wallstreetbets,"How on earth do you think there’s no better stock to own then GME? I get wanting to have a position, but to literally see no other viable option to own is pure insanity dude."
2021-05-22 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,You think the rest of the market is over inflated but *not* GME?
2021-05-22 08:05:17,wallstreetbets,I’ve never thought about it logically like that. Who the eff has a bunch of baskets they bring when going to collect eggs. You bring one basket and put all your eggs in it.

2021-05-22 11:26:29,wallstreetbets,Sell weeklies deep out the money every Thursday.
2021-05-22 09:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Moon, obviously!"

but you guys go ahead.. put your cash wherever you like.. please don’t put your house into it though. You’re gonna lose it.. the community doesn’t have your back anymore and the hedges aren’t there anymore.. it’s just not possible.."
2021-05-22 13:51:26,wallstreetbets,Anecdotal evidence. Look at the gme freaks. Check their profile. You are the sucker they are targeting.
2021-05-21 23:03:24,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. I appreciate the solid response
2021-05-21 23:22:34,wallstreetbets,"this is the way, an educated response from an Ape. 

Proud of you retard"
2021-05-22 06:37:16,wallstreetbets,"Being the poor mans GME, it has a hell of alot more 🦍investing in it and a lot more hype. It’s heavily shorted with likely 3x or more float short sold. Both are almost guaranteed to squeeze, a lot of people are going to make a lot money. I’m in both so I’m happy 🚀🌙💎🙌"
2021-05-21 22:38:29,wallstreetbets,For now
2021-05-22 04:15:16,wallstreetbets,True

2021-05-22 04:25:47,wallstreetbets,Well always bet on black lol
2021-05-22 13:44:35,wallstreetbets,What should I get for a 10 pc tender
2021-05-22 12:04:38,wallstreetbets,Because there is no discussion of anything else on this sub anymore. If you talk about anything but GME you are downvoted to fuck and your post is hidden.
2021-05-22 16:16:06,wallstreetbets,Me culpa
2021-05-22 19:58:20,wallstreetbets,Anything in particular?
2021-05-22 10:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Look around dude. None of us can advise what to do with your money, be we're all here for a reason. There's countless amounts of solid DD on this and the only arguments I ever see against are either scare tactics or just straight up false info. It's not too late to get on the 🚀"
2021-05-22 06:37:22,wallstreetbets,I’m not recommending anything as I’m not a financial advisor.

2021-05-22 09:29:55,wallstreetbets,Even though I don't believe in it I wish you the best thanks for the answer
2021-05-22 14:50:09,wallstreetbets,"We're just a clan of retarded apes, what the f_=^< we know?"
2021-05-22 09:43:43,wallstreetbets,"You know conformation bias is a bad thing, right?  It literally means you twist new information to fit with your prior beliefs, or filter out information that doesn’t support what you believe."
2021-05-22 09:55:38,wallstreetbets,What is DD?
2021-05-22 14:53:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the kind explaination
2021-05-22 17:57:38,wallstreetbets,so a company like amazon (who now doesn’t even stand by 2 day deliveries and so many issues with imposter products) is worth what it is. but a company who is in the middle of a change to e-commerce and during that change can offer same day - 2 day delivery depending on location on all products not just companies who pay to be there.  who has been expanding their warehousing.  is not even a fraction of the market cap.  my god i really love that the people who say GME is going to fade or has already covered can’t even back up with facts.  You may choose to be ignorant to the facts but please for the love of god learn something before you go and spout nonsense.
2021-05-21 23:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I hope your investments are going well, wish you all the best for the future too!"
2021-05-22 19:23:08,wallstreetbets,Name checks out
2021-05-22 10:33:28,wallstreetbets,"Stocks prices have been going up too quick. The one stock that is up 3,800% is definitely the safest bet moving forward, limited downside for sure."
2021-05-22 04:19:44,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to decide to *gamble* your savings then sure, it's *an* option. Mystified how this could be construed as the ""most"" ""obvious"" option for ""parking"" ""savings."""
2021-05-22 08:25:35,wallstreetbets,GME has negative beta 10x more than what's considered normal range for any stock. Perfect for an overinflated market.
2021-05-22 07:20:02,wallstreetbets,seriously. The mental gymnastics required to get to that level of thinking are Olympian.
2021-05-22 12:00:45,wallstreetbets,I've yet to meet someone who's read the DD and doesn't like the stock. You should try it sometime.
2021-05-22 04:10:02,wallstreetbets,"I walked away with 20% gains at 181. Call me a paper hand if you want but 20% gain over a few weeks is fine with me. Even if it goes up to 200+ again I’m still happy with a win. Everyone’s rolling the dice and rebuying when it just as well could drop back down below 150 again. Could go to the moon at 400+ but it’s pretty unlikely. 

Then again this is WSB so I know everyone here is gonna say moon or bust haha."
2021-05-21 23:39:34,wallstreetbets,The amount of DD available on GME is not comparable to any other stock. The momentum does not only help GME as a stock but the business as well. The market is very uncertain which is my I sold my other shares. I only own GME because it does not only have long term value which means if the market goes down it will most likely go back up after the market recovers but also has the potential to short squeeze and after reading a lot of DD it could go the opposite way in a market correction/ up instead of down and I think that is very promising.
2021-05-22 00:27:03,wallstreetbets,Cray how how such unoffensive conservative financial opinions like this get downvoted to hell in this sub hhahahah

2021-05-22 17:02:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks! 😁 Is there anything in particular we vote for/against? Or is it not about the issues but about counting shares? Any link to help get me up to speed?
2021-05-22 19:39:12,wallstreetbets,Have you read any of the DD?
2021-05-22 16:35:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I really don’t see it.
2021-05-22 11:31:36,wallstreetbets,As an etoro user that's true in huge volatile moments the platform just crashes but usually let's you use offline tool to set your stop losses take profit and close positions. Never used it but I'm talking about what I see :)
2021-05-22 12:04:27,wallstreetbets,EToro also isn't letting shareholders vote. Don't use etoro.
2021-05-22 08:49:31,wallstreetbets,Damn that sucks. Well it’s still an honor to hold with you 🚀
2021-05-22 14:55:47,wallstreetbets,Which broker? You sound Dutch.
2021-05-22 11:40:11,wallstreetbets,"So you have no evidence, got it"
2021-05-22 09:15:26,wallstreetbets,"I know, my arms are getting tired from holding 🥲"
2021-05-22 13:10:50,wallstreetbets,How about 4?

2021-05-21 22:44:04,wallstreetbets,"If so, why not you go short GME then. Try and short it to prove your point instead of being salty"
2021-05-22 15:19:27,wallstreetbets,Well that's dumb. I haven't seen that happen.
2021-05-22 09:32:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes but GME is different. We aren't talking about a minor increase like 10% extra shares.

It would not surprise me in the slightest if the float is vastly, and I mean VASTLY, higher than what is out there. You can't trim that. And if they do it will be painfully obvious.

GME is the worst kept secret right now."
2021-05-22 17:48:47,wallstreetbets,Then why don’t u?
2021-05-22 15:42:11,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm not. You have no idea what you're talking about and the things you're saying are laughably stupid."

2021-05-22 06:33:46,wallstreetbets,"I bought GME at 340 and I feel like I will never see the green again. It's like I'm seing you guys having fun all the way down there. Still, never sold anything."
2021-05-22 12:29:59,wallstreetbets,You mean that’s not a logical decision? I must be retarded. But really tho it’s a safer bet given that the entities shorting it are long on a lot of the S&P500
2021-05-22 11:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Considering they’ve been using naked shorts and got caught, it really is lol"
2021-05-22 16:18:44,wallstreetbets,Well if one stock went up that fast that probably means the whole market is over inflated. But the same principle definitely *does not* apply to GME which is up 1000% on the year.

2021-05-22 15:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Nailed it. This is gambling. No DD done. All the money ever made on this stock was made months ago it's all a steep decline from here. It's just taking a lot longer to happen because of all the diamond hands. All the due diligence actually shows to put a very long short position & ride the wave down slowly with multiple exits. However even that is too risky as this event has never happened before & one can never be sure when an ape will sell. Either way - it's not going up & probably not going down.

A better play would be for everyone to move to a better stock, but there is no leader. Those guys already cashed out on these apes & moved on. So these apes are all bagholding for each other. What started out an amazing idea had generated into loss porn."
2021-05-22 07:27:16,wallstreetbets,Right 😳
2021-05-22 10:21:48,wallstreetbets,It's extra money I have no use to spend right now. Should I leave it in cash and earn no return while the Fed inflates it all away? Or do I risk it with a chance for a big reward? I'm just adding up the maths and following the conclusions where they go.
2021-05-22 14:38:06,wallstreetbets,Must be all that negative beta
2021-05-22 17:42:33,wallstreetbets,It's not. These people are delusional.
2021-05-22 16:19:28,wallstreetbets,I'm sure that will hold up over time.

The “street” has never seen shareholders they could not shake out before this.  The street did not count on “not selling” and individuals actually buying more.  Personally, I believe that the longs own far more than 50% of the issued AND the synthetic float.  I no longer stare at the candles all day and have set up price alerts for the eruption."

2021-05-22 11:29:59,wallstreetbets,There will be a massive market correction within a month. Take a look at the reverse repo rates. Everything is hyper inflated or artificially suppressed. The CPI should have gapped up 3 months ago.

At the moment I just feel a lot of the healthcare stocks are overpriced or up for a correction and therefore do not feel comfortable opening positions in them.

You get 1 karma for every $ you lose. 20% in a few weeks is a great return and anyone with any sense knows that. Thinking about it surely they should be happy you sold so they can buy up more GME. That argument might be a bit too logical though.

 Probably down voting because they yoloed into the hype at the peak and are stuck with unrealised losses that they know theyre very unlikely to claw back."
2021-05-22 10:10:22,wallstreetbets,That’s why no one will remember your name

2021-05-22 12:11:40,wallstreetbets,Yup- You have to have an exit point set.
2021-05-22 05:24:45,wallstreetbets,Yuuup I bought that dip around 150 and dumped when it hit 181. My own gamble for sure. Some just can’t walk away from the casino when they’re up!
2021-05-22 10:12:11,wallstreetbets,"I’m okay with that. Never wanted to be rich and famous, just rich."
2021-05-22 15:06:06,wallstreetbets,We haven’t had a correction. We’re printing money to buy collateral to artificially lower interest rates. Short positions are being funded with rehypothicated bonds. We have negative interest rates because collateral is more valuable than the dollar. You see inflation in the stock market and in component goods before you see it in the retail markets.
2021-05-22 00:19:25,wallstreetbets,I hear ya. But there has never been an opportunity like this with the amount of exposure for any stock in the history of history. I tend to agree with you wholeheartedly until this GME anomaly happened. This is the exception to where for one time and one time only it might be wise to put all your eggs in this one basket.
2021-05-22 10:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Ermm, but WSB has always been a casino. You are calling a retard retard, if you hope to find someone here who aren’t a retard, then you are the retard. WSB is a casino, always has been and I am amazed you still find yourselves amazed? Go to /r/investing if you want “safe investment”

Also, in WSB, we embrace loss and gain porn, we never wish anyone goes bankrupt especially when they are having a 70% profit.

Oh ya the DD flair filter is there in WSB, perhaps make use of it?"

But damnit I know that if I were to sell in the back of my mind I'd be thinking I'm gonna miss one of the biggest opportunities of my life. (Besides the things that actually mean shit (family, friends wives etc.)) So no I'm not 100% sure but damnit my heart says yes, yes and yes.

2021-05-21 20:04:42,wallstreetbets,"True, but OTM is where lambos are funded as 10K stretches a lot further so you own many more options.

OTM is also the place where savings can be destroyed.

With 10K I could buy roughly 50 calls for Sept @6, or I could buy 660  $20 calls.  If it rockets up to $25, the $6 calls would be worth $50 x19x100 =95,000, but the $20 calls would be worth $330,000.

Granted, I don't think that far out of the money is realistic for UWMC by September, but it's a higher torque bet, with a lambo payoff.  But, I could be wrong and have left lambo money on the table.  It takes cojones to make a bet that far OTM, and I applaud that, sorry to OP that it didn't work out.

# W-Shape Note:

* We needed to close above 418 for the w-shape to be confirmed. This didn't happen :(
* Maybe next week?

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

2021-05-21 22:39:08,wallstreetbets,These posts are the best things I've seen on this sub in months. If I didn't see your Friday post I would have yolod into calls the second the price cleared the gap and started to test resistance. Instead I decided to wait and see if it would break resistance before making any moves. Saved me an entire day of anxiety watching my 0dte calls bleed out while saying 'Pls SPY fly again'

2021-05-21 21:08:35,wallstreetbets,"u/JakTravis_u_SOB

Made good money this week with my two $407 SPY calls. I was nervous SPY was going to fall straight back down today. Glad SPY stayed strong and my calls were in the money after market closed today. I'm not sure where the market is going to be headed next week. Since there is still fear of inflation, I think we might have a small bearish market next week. If that is the case, I might buy some puts. Thank you SPY for making my two calls in the money this week"
2021-05-21 21:42:16,wallstreetbets,"Im thinking higher high’s, hoping we get a run into the holiday weekend!"
2021-05-21 22:45:58,wallstreetbets,I do know this dude is much better at TA then me but seems like from a psychological standpoint the bulls pushed this baby up 3 times without breaking above that resistance of 418. Bulls went up to 417.45 then a little dip then up again to 417.55 then there was the big rundown to 405.33. Then back up to 418.20 which we saw today. Has to be exhausting to try Try try and not win. I’m on the side of seeing 400. Then a big time upward trend.
2021-05-21 23:40:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting these. It helps me understand what risk I am taking. Like going 415 vs 418 calls and not doing something dumb like a 420 call or something else otm.

2021-05-21 20:34:27,wallstreetbets,"The market is the economy🚀
Whose ready for some $SPCE tendies tomorrow?"
2021-05-21 23:08:00,wallstreetbets,">IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!

Is this your DD? We have already seen $420+ on the 1st week of this month and $405- during the 2nd week. Next week has 5 trading days and considering todays closing price of $515, it's a 1.02% uptrend to cross $420 or 2.41% downtrend. A fluctuation of 1-2.5% in 5 trading days is very normal for SPY and you do not need to eat crayon to say that.

You say W shape? There is no W shape in that chart. If you forcefully try to make a flat line between 14th, 17th and 18th to a point, it doesn't become a point!

>Current support at 60 SMMA   
>  
>Current resistance at 20 SMMA

This is idiotic at best. Do you even understand what a moving average filter is? The resulting value is moving along time. How can a moving point be either support or resistance? 

You say if the SP is above X price it's bullish and if it's below Y price it's bearish. There are bull call support and bear put support bla bla bla. Did you looks at the OI and volume of SPY contracts for the last month? It has always been on the bearish side yet SPY move upward. 

Give it up TA does not work. Do not get confused and make other's confused trying to be smarter. Instead of saying SPY can vary 2.5% in next 5 trading days clearly say what will be the price on Monday at open, at midday and at close. If you can't say that that admit TA doesn't work."

The 200 day ma is 306 which is full bear thesis, but I don’t see that happening without some serious panic selling"

2021-05-21 23:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Here’s some reading material ape. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp#why-use-a-moving-average

A moving average can also act as support or resistance. In an uptrend, a 50-day, 100-day or 200-day moving average may act as a support level, as shown in the figure below. This is because the average acts like a floor (support), so the price bounces up off of it. In a downtrend, a moving average may act as resistance; like a ceiling, the price hits the level and then starts to drop again.”"

2021-05-21 20:22:43,wallstreetbets,Like the past two weeks but w higher low and higher high. But if it opens green idk if it'll have the juice to make a new ath.
2021-05-21 20:28:35,wallstreetbets,Bruh are you me? I nearly doubled my money on my calls this morning but got greedy by $20/contract and ended up taking a rather substantial loss instead because I'm apparently retarded and only diamond hand instead of taking profits...
2021-05-21 20:22:20,wallstreetbets,As soon as it hit 418 I loaded up on puts. When it gets to 407-409 I'll load up on calls for next Friday. But if it opens green I'm just going to sit next week out.
2021-05-21 22:53:15,wallstreetbets,I'll definitely be keeping an eye on it but imo this current range is the scariest to play. I think I'm going to chill on SPY until it either establishes a higher support for a few days or retests the current support and play the run back up from that. That's what I did this week and it worked pretty well for me. Cheers

Open your tool and then open 1 year SPY chart then plot 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MA and tell me what you see. Let me tell you what you will see-

200-day MA is never being touched in last 9 months

100-day MA was touched twice and it dipped below that line once out of two times which means 50% probability.

50-day MA was touched 7 times and dipped below that line 3 times which means 42.8% times it did not bounced.

Now open the AMZN and do all over again. What you see? It almost never works. Instead of sharing that investopedia link if you could try to understand what a moving average is you would know why SP is above that line in a uptrend or below that line in a downtrend. It's not due to how stock market works, neither it's some TA magic. It's the definition of moving average itself.

Look at other tickers as well you will see that claim fails miserably most times. Sometimes it might align with your claim but that's not due to some TA magic rather the nature of random number. You know coin flip!

&#x200B;

And when there are a lots of **may, can, or** involved describing something that's not something anyone should follow ever."
2021-05-21 23:56:23,wallstreetbets,Everybody thought the same thing! When it hit 418 i was contemplating if i should close my calls but i got greedy.  thought it would hit 420 but it never came back and took a huge L.

2021-05-22 06:38:40,wallstreetbets,"QQQ has been looking much stronger than SPY recently, except for yesterday, where the Aapl dumping held back both SPY and QQQ. I think your puts might pay off.

I honestly believe it's Aapl holding both back and seriously can't figure out why? Inflation? Aapl don't give a fuck they will raise prices. Chip shortages? Aapl don't give a fuck, they delivered during rona production cuts and they will continue, to deliver during chip shortages.

Apple will literally ram their dong down their suppliers throat if they don't deliver. 

TLDR tech is overvalued, except MSFT and Aapl."
2021-05-22 10:25:44,wallstreetbets,Time in the market. You're better off playing the market than cashing out in fear. This is proven time and time again. People have been calling for a crash since January and we've hit ATH multiple times since. Just be nimble.

2021-05-22 00:04:37,wallstreetbets,"You got me! OMG!

I did not use TA magic to write that post. I used data from SEC filling to speculate the movement. You did not even read that post because if you did you would see that I also wrote in the TlDr-

>I am not going to touch PLTR **unless** insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently.

I wrote that post on May 8 and CEO sold share on May, May 6, May 4, April 21, April 20, April 19, April 08, April 07, April 06 and continuing...... each time over 600K to 1.3M shares. After I wrote that post he sold only 499 shares on 13th!

On May 8, PLTR was between $18.18-$19.30 and todays closing price was $20.75.

My whole writing was based on heavy selling by CEO which apparently looks like stopped or slowed down significantly.

What do you think now? Master?"

2021-05-22 07:32:27,wallstreetbets,"I feel sorry for you. 

All this post provides is data to help people day trade spy. And play 0dte. Welcome to the casino friend. 

Yes, you can use the 15m or even 5m SMMAS as support and resistance to help you DAY-TRADE. My read posts uses spotgamma. Which is call and put data and delta hedging - vanna and charm, etc. LEGIT DATA. Notice how the abs gamma strike was 415 yesterday and was used as a magnet??

If you look at this post as conditional statements - if then statements. I’m essentially saying that if resistance breaks then look for these price targets - that’s all I’m saying. It’s not magic. 

Do me one favor and look up Charles Dow and the Dow theory. WallStreet uses TA friend.

Do me a favor and pull up spy on the 1day timeframe and you will find heavy support at 20 SMMA. Even tested the 60 SMMA. We are at a critical moment in the market since we are off ATH and with reopening and recovery on the horizon with inflation fears. If you don’t like my work then f-off. It’s people like you that fuck it up for everyone else. Go back to jerking it to form4s."

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GOLD open interest June 18 $Gold Barrick Gold Corp, looking like a snack...

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

2021-05-22 00:38:21,wallstreetbets,"The smaller cap miners should rise in price more than the large caps if gold or silver rise because since their costs are smaller, the same rise in revenue from higher priced product will cause an greater overall increase in revenue than the large miners will get. I would choose a smallcap gem for this prediction instead of a large cap."
2021-05-21 20:37:26,wallstreetbets,I’ve been all in on the inflation play for a while now. I wouldn’t recommend Barrick as they are one of the most notoriously hedged gold companies out there. Also the higher options volume is almost certainly because the fed meeting which is a couple days before that. I would recommend KGC or BTG
2021-05-21 22:11:04,wallstreetbets,"I love Barrick Gold...   I bought in at 21ish for 400 shares,  may buy another 600 to round it out.

31 is the high for the year.  It's bubbling just below 25.   If it breaks to the high, that's a decent upside considering that gold is 10ish% below it's ATH.

and if gold blasts past the ATH,  barricks shares should see multiples as it's AISC per oz is very low for the industry."
2021-05-21 20:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I have a small position at $22 average, I agree that gold is finally making progress after months of pullback.  Will take time though, gold is kind of a slow moving commodity ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"

2021-05-21 22:53:59,wallstreetbets,So did they.
2021-05-22 00:08:27,wallstreetbets,Really confused as to why this was downvoted tbh
2021-05-22 11:07:19,wallstreetbets,I’m glad someone brought this up. I do see the potential on gme going to like 1000 or 2000 like Tesla did. But mf are saying 10million like let’s be honest bro there isn’t enough money in the system to cover every single share at 10million. It’s culty as fuck but I still think gme has a lot upside
2021-05-21 22:17:07,wallstreetbets,"We're not going back to reasonableland. That's how. Plus, the cost to cover would be pushed onto the other hedge funds and then onto DTC insurance. Read up on the DD. It won't make sense, but maybe you can find some understanding there cause I'm and idiot"
2021-05-21 23:25:28,wallstreetbets,Not everyone will be able to sell at the top. The goal of course is to see how high it will go first before selling. Many people claim they will never sell some shares. Should be a ride down where everyone can have their tendies and eat some too.
2021-05-22 02:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Read the DD, some of it makes sense"
2021-05-21 23:34:48,wallstreetbets,You seem a little out of date on the company’s current status.
2021-05-21 20:41:35,wallstreetbets,No don't. a transfer takes 1 business day and if you dont transfer your stock will be sold at low as values by robinhood. If you sell them now you help the hedgefunds. The launch is gonna take longer than 1 day anyway
2021-05-21 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,Too late

2021-05-21 22:20:28,wallstreetbets,"I started investing late November 2020. First trade ever was PLTR at the top. Second trade was GME shares @ $16 and 2 $0.50C expy 1/22. When I think back to how much of an absolute waste of capital those calls were it still gets me mad. I could have (and would have) had 20 Calls expy 2022 instead of 2 if I had any idea how the Greeks worked back then. 

It kills me cause I was posting my position on damn near every comment in nov/Dec and not even 1 person bothered to tell me that spending large amounts of capital on deep ITM calls is actually the worst way to set up that position if you were expecting a squeeze."

Indeed GameStop’s current mean weight in their portfolio is less than 1.4%, and thus although GME spectacular rise was captured in their performance, investors might look elsewhere to catch some of the momentum in GameStop"

2021-05-22 12:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Good luck!  I feel like there might be a wall of resistance around $400 that could be tough to break through, so ITM options weren't a bitch move, they were the smart play if you're bullish.

I feel like even with good earnings, there will be a rotation out by institutions as they cycle money into reopening plays.  May take a few days post earnings to find its legs."
2021-05-21 21:13:27,wallstreetbets,3 dots in bottom right corner > settings > light/dark theme
2021-05-21 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,I believe there would be some cooling down to 374 if the market slows next week but I don’t mind because if we go into earnings at 376 and blow it off the roof it will easily go to 390 on earnings day then creep above $400 in the days following that next week. I plan to sell half at $405 on tuesday or so and then the rest Thursday regardless of the price hopefully $412+
2021-05-21 23:27:34,wallstreetbets,It is 93% of my account and less than 2 weeks away based on earnings and only calls not even a spread so it is a yolo I could lose 93% of my account in less than a month that surely is a yolo brotha just a smarter one than OTM FDs
2021-05-21 23:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Feeling about the same, I’d hope we don’t see to low of 70s but I think it’ll hover in the 78s again where it was around last week when things lit red. Hoping that the April reports on there earnings are a sample of how the quarter went and it booms, kind of same plan, will see how earnings play out and see how I feel going into the weekend if I let it ride into the next few days of the week or not."
2021-05-22 12:25:57,wallstreetbets,"You blocked out how much of your portfolio but now that you said how much, it is indeed a yolo"
2021-05-22 14:29:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah exactly and Costco isn’t really known the the stock gapping up at earnings in premarket it’s going to have to be a killer earnings so the stock can slowly rise throughout the next 3 trading days as institutions increase their position size and then price targets 2-4 days after and it has the weekend for news to bake in since the report is Thursday after close
2021-05-22 14:30:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wasn’t gonna post it but I don’t know how else to describe it’s a yolo other than my 6% Costco shares and 1% NRZ shares

So, after reading my TA, what we saying? All in or no? Look, just give it to me straight no chaser. Is this a bad idea, because I've already done it. Now I'm wondering, do I double down or triple down? It gained like 1000% in 3 years since 2017. Now we've had a 60% correction...c'mon surely this has gotta be the play of the fucking century. My uncertainty really stems from the fact that...im a retard, the stock is still going down, so does everyone else know something I dont?

Before anyone asks, no, I know nothing about what Alteryx does, dont ask me about a balance sheet, I only learned what that was 2 days ago, and Im not fucking looking so dont tell me any of that. Quite simply, the blue line is down and I want a lambo. Does this sound good?

So I look at the yearly chart and think man it runs up every earnings. So I get the bright idea I’ll buy calls then puts on the may earnings. Bought 47 contracts from 85 strike all the way up to 120 strike. Did the math and thought no brainer this goes back to where it was that’s 100k. Put 14k lost 11k, I tried to post loss porn but mods kept taking it down I have screenshots.

      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

2021-05-22 11:49:28,wallstreetbets,I have seen that movie. It’s got a good plot.
2021-05-22 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Completely false. Correction, YOU don't have a fucking clue, but you can help yourself by dropping macd. Those who are rich from trading and make 100k-millions a year beg to differ.. Real trader is hardly anyone on this sub. People here are just gamblers. People who make a living or are rich from trading rarely use things like RSI and MACD, for good reason. MACD is a shitty lagging indicator that all noobs flock to and lose money trying to use.

&#x200B;

Good technical analysis is done with candlesticks, volume, price action, EMAs, and resistance/support lines. Knowing how to use that and training your brain to patterns will yield you the most successful results.

&#x200B;

Trading is like poker, calculated gambling where you need to know when to fold, and get in at the perfect time. If you waste time with MACD, you simply lower your odds.  That's all I have time to explain to you.

&#x200B;

Look up some material if you really want to know. endless reading material out there. Anna Couling's ""Volume Price Analysis"". A long time professional trader that never mentions shitty things like RSI, MACD"

2021-05-22 08:45:09,wallstreetbets,"If you search for patterns and draw lines in a way that makes the chart look good to you, it gives you confidence and helps you sleep better at night while your wife fucks her boyfriend.

Seriously, there are established patterns that stocks make (bull flag, bear flag, cup and handle etc) that can help. It can also be helpful to try to figure out the lower and higher resistance levels. This can help you figure out good buy in points or points where you should sell to mitigate loss (if you're a paper handed bitch of course). You can also look at volume, market cap, inflow and outflow of orders, look at the level 2 books to see bid and ask orders, and there's the various technical indicators like MACD, VWAP, RSI, etc which can help a bit too, but all any of this does is give you a more educated guess about how a stock will perform. If there was some formula that could accurately predict a stock's performance, we'd all be rich af. A time machine would also be very useful.

Me personally though, I just wake up before the market opens, do a line of coke off my own dick, take a slug of whiskey from the bottle I keep under my pillow, then buy large amounts of whatever this sub is recommending. Then I just sit watching the stocks move, eating crayons, and as I plunge deep into the red, I just remind myself that I have diamond hands and it's not a loss if you don't sell. This is not financial advice and results may vary."
2021-05-22 14:49:40,wallstreetbets,"a ""real"" indicator is your brain function which most people on this sub lack.

&#x200B;

Volume+ Price action relations. Knowing your candlesticks. Being able to spot resistance/support levels, trendlines, drawing them. Patterns that you learn by practice and losing over and over until you study your mistakes and learn from them...

Read ""Volume price analysis"" by Anna couling, that's a good start."

Someone who's been dumping shares every time the price goes up finally ran out of shares. Guess that means the price can run a little higher?"

2021-05-22 08:33:39,wallstreetbets,Uhh price climb was after the offering was sold because company had no more debt which was the only reason to be short. Price stayed sideways the whole time they sold and didn't go down at all.

I am a swing trader, switching between SQQQ and TQQQ, **well aware of the facts behind TQQQ**. Recently, I bought TQQQ (for 6 figures) at $80 and sold it around $108.

Now, we are in peak stock cycle, better to own SQQQ than TQQQ as I expect TQQQ to go down to $45-$50 range within 45 days."

2021-05-22 12:15:48,wallstreetbets,I dont really care what happens in 45 days. I'm betting on the future of American business. The last year has given me gains of 150 percent. The future will be better
2021-05-22 12:49:33,wallstreetbets,"The 150% will become 25% in 45 days. You won't believe this, That is why I said Fate !  

I did extensive research on TQQQ & SQQQ and finally came to that conclusion very few companies beat TQQQ in the long run. 

For example, only one company beat the TQQQ last 10 years, it is not AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, but TSLA beat it. It is very rare for companies beat TQQQ during bullish run. Last Mar 23, 2020 was lowest for Market, but still very few companies beat TQQQ (as given below) [https://imgur.com/xqssSfD](https://imgur.com/xqssSfD)

However, there is a major drop is coming within 45 days which may result 50% drop in TQQQ. Wise will remove Sell cash and wait for sidelines until you see TQQQ in blood bath!

Any way, I understand you will not change until you see the reality. **At that time, do not hate TQQQ,** it is your destiny decides now! 

Good Luck."

Just made a calculaton: FAANG is 6328 Bln. If TQQQ appreciates at 53% and you hold 35 years to beat FAANG, you need minimum $217303 by now.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say."

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. 

I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

In the morning I went to meet up with the same group of friends for breakfast.  When I walked in they were calling me Dick Ripper.  Made no sense to me. 

My friend explained:

""Last night you tackled [Friend] into a grill and the side tray hit his dick and cut it halfway off.  He had to go get 7 stitches to put his weiner back on.  You just left and we had to call an ambulance.  He's still in the hospital.""

2021-05-21 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here’s what I mean: I’d bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill—there are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can’t even really explain how—they just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn’t help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don’t like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

Nobody used Hinge or Coffee Meets Bagel. 

They all suck, honestly. It’s a weird popularity contest where people interact in a totally unrealistic way.  
Like this whole culture of needing to have a super witty and sexual innuendo filled opening line... simply saying “hello” to a woman means you are an uninteresting piece of shit. 

Also, every single person on there lies about their physical traits, their career, lifestyle , etc. 

I played the whole online dating game after my first marriage, and it did work out - I met my current wife on Tinder - but I wouldn’t recommend the experience   .

I have way better luck finding women and flirting/setting up dates in person.  Guess I’m just a ranting old millennial now."

2021-05-22 19:50:11,wallstreetbets,"

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky ****/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering ****/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own ****blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Guys, DON'T SHAVE YOUR BUTT-HAIR!"

2021-05-22 09:02:08,wallstreetbets,"Basic rule is: just be a good person. It’s often that easy. 

We often don’t listen to people speak; instead, we are thinking about what we are going to say while they are speaking. Don’t do this. Actually listen and pay attention; people can tell. Ask for more details when appropriate, as it often shows that you’re invested in whatever they are talking about. 

Don’t overshare. If you start talking about a topic and find your date isn’t interested, talk about something else. Do they show interest? Keep going. Let their reactions and emotions guide you. 

Give them time to speak, and focus on any mutual interests you have.

I know this all sounds very obvious, but most people don’t follow it. Also remember that dating is a numbers game. If you don’t get along, just move on. 

Also, while physical appearance is important, it’s not as important as you’d think. A good chunk of spouses didn’t find their partner physically attractive until a few dates in because attraction will grow with emotional attachment.  So don’t feel too self conscious while, at the same time, don’t dismiss someone you may share interests with just because you don’t find them attractive at first."

Do some DD and find them on the web and social media.  Discussions are a lot easier when you know what interests them.  

If the date goes stale and no connection or communication just whip it out."

2021-05-21 23:27:03,wallstreetbets,Sell the news event.  I think the price will go down regardless. There was demand for the stock (and your contracts) because of the test flight. the test flight itself is irrelevant. the price will dip even with a sucessful flight. I hope it goes well for you or at least the price stays flat so you can exit with profit.
2021-05-22 16:32:07,wallstreetbets,Tell this to PLTR

2021-05-22 14:09:27,wallstreetbets,Eh im not so sure. Space is hard. The expectation always leans towards failure or at the very least weather delay or cancellation of the flight. A successful flight is very big news. If theres significant media coverage of the successful tests this thing could pop hard. Space tourism is the kind of thing the average person gets a real boner for.
2021-05-22 14:12:31,wallstreetbets,If people were going to sell the news their exit should have been by eod friday BEFORE the risk of a catastophic failure. This things gonna pop.

2021-05-21 20:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say. It definitely dips on earnings quite often. However I believe it will blow out expectations, still may dip, but that just improves the fundamentals. I think a week after earnings its higher, even if there is an initial dip. My belief is earnings and forecast will better than expected, and this will result in a long term rise. Short term who knows, but obv with weekly call options im betting on earnings and split to be a catalyst"

1) They lowball homeowners and charge fee for Buying your house (5%)

2) When agreed on price,  they send an inspector and after BS findings,  they deduct another 50K from the price

3)  Couple of years ago,  They literally Buy homes at market value and do repairs/updates.    Then I come in after they have sat in market for months and I lowball their ass.  No problems on getting my offers accepted since they play on volume and they are a ""tech company losing money like amazon when it started"".

4) They are a tech company looking to disrupt real estate market.,..Bitch Uber still cant make profits and thats taking a client from point A to Point B.   The complexities of Buying and selling a home is a bit more involved, time consuming and frustrating."

That’s why every time Bitcoin go down she come out with crazy comments saying Bitcoin will go to 600k something we all hope but understand that is not going to happen in the near future.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite While SNDL’s market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill."

Canopy is of better quality, but I did this research when I bought last year. 
The issue is the US grows on a much smaller scale so we get much better quality and higher THC. East coast ever smaller grows, so even better quality especially with micro-grows.

GME got me started trading, but I haven’t ever bought a share. I’ve yet to see a single “fundamental” or technical indication that it’s worth its current price, much less more. 

But maybe I’m looking in the wrong place? So I ask again, what fundamentals?"

2021-05-22 17:55:33,wallstreetbets,"Dude how about you consider this. Gme was gonna moon back in January (and I mean like shoot to the dark side of the moon and back) but Market Makers shut it down. Quite frankly the stock market isn’t built for the type of gain we would’ve seen had they not shut it down so I see why they did it (as unfair and stupid as it was). After that the retarded apes running the hedge funds shorted the shorts on GME (a term called naked shorting since you’re autistic as hell). And now we wait for 1 of three possibilities: 
1. Naked shorts get margin called
2. On 6/8 GME turns over awesome earnings and then the following day (6/9 since you’re retarded) at the board meeting the board announces a share recall to boost their treasury. 
3. Apes keep buying and holding until some other catalyst comes along. 

All it takes is for something to happen that causes all of the short and naked short positions to be unwound. You wanna talk to me about fundamentals I’d recommend two things:

1. Become a licensed financial advisor (pass your SIE, Series 7, and Series 66 since you prob don’t know what that means either). 
2. After that, tell me how fundamentally AND/OR historically, we have ever seen anything quite like this. You can’t place a time stamp on when the squeeze will happen! All you can do is hold and if you want, buy more. Don’t be retarded bro be an autistic ape.

edit: since he is so autistic that he prob thinks I’m a $300 bag holder: 7 shares average cost $120 (one share was bought at $300 because I’m honest). Come at me braaaaaa"

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)"

The way I see it is there is no way that the price of SPCE will stay the same from today going into Monday. 

One of three options are going to play out.

1. Successful test flight
2. Test flight delayed, again 
3. Unsuccessful test flight

Regardless of the situation, the needle is going to move a LOT. How are you playing this rocket ride? 

I have a few 17p and 16p expiring Monday and a few HUGELY OTM calls expiring next Friday. I’m more expecting a total failure, but on the off chance it’s a huge success those calls are going to print.

What are y’all’s positions?

And to all the people saying you wouldn’t touch SPCE with a 40 foot pole, why? The stock is going to move one way or another and if you’re really that against it, buy puts and put your Twitter fingers to work.

2021-05-21 20:03:33,wallstreetbets,I remember I jumped in... second worst trade. First is nnox
2021-05-21 20:50:18,wallstreetbets,"I think you’re misreading a letter there. AMD is not a movie theater. Also it’s consistently been above 70 for the past 6 months, almost hit 100 in December of 2020."
2021-05-21 23:27:13,wallstreetbets,I said after the shortages end. That won't be this generation.
2021-05-21 20:01:54,wallstreetbets,Just excuse. Finally I once patiently wait it till lower 70 to buy. It also down after Er. Always
2021-05-21 23:34:04,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how long the shortages last, but if they really do recover sometime next year, I do not think AMD will have a new GPU generation until the year after. AMD has been skipping every other generation, more or less. They will likely have a single card, or a rebranding; not a new generation.

And that's all to assume if they did release a new stack it'd be competitive. They haven't really been competitive on the GPU scene for a couple of generations. It likely wouldn't change suddenly now.

Thankfully, NVidia is seemingly shoving their had as far up their own ass as they can manage, so maybe the goal is that NVidia fails harder than AMD."
2021-05-21 23:35:48,wallstreetbets,"RDNA1 was released in July 2019 and RDNA2 in November 2020, RDNA3 should be sometime 2022"
2021-05-21 23:56:20,wallstreetbets,"RDNA was half a product stack.

RDNA 2 was the other half.

I'm not joking, by the way.

RDNA 1's highest priced card was $449, coincidentally, the lowest priced RDNA 2 card. The highest tier RDNA 1 card was *700XT, the lowest tier RDNA 2 card was that same sku. The fact is that RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 were not full launches, and were more similar to an extremely elongated launch.

I'm sure AMD ***could*** do it. But it's not something I'd bet on."
2021-05-21 20:00:32,wallstreetbets,Isn’t because the premium is too low? Look at those 20cents weekly...
2021-05-21 23:58:47,wallstreetbets,"But with a 50% increase in perf/watt, I'm betting it will be a full release next gen, also note that RDNA2 does go down to 6600XT now, though it's very delayed"
2021-05-21 20:35:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s much higher if you go further out but you need to write em on green days and buy em back on red days
2021-05-21 22:07:48,wallstreetbets,"At the same time a $20 premium on a weekly is a .1 delta while the Dec $100 is a .23. if you sell a weekly .23 delta it's $50-$60. Monthlies are usually what I target, but I'm also looking for more strategies from people who sell. I know I'm at more risk selling shorter term, but the payoff seems crazy slow for long dated options to me"
2021-05-22 00:05:50,wallstreetbets,"It really doesn't much matter if their perf/watt is good if they don't actually have relevant products. You can have the absolute most amazing breakthrough in the world, but if you can't actually bring it to market in a full product stack, you may as well not have it at all.

To give an example of how this sort of thing can effect companies, look at how difficult it is to sell luxury variants of products."
2021-05-21 22:05:08,wallstreetbets,Is that how that works?
2021-05-21 22:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Are we talking amd? $20 premium, then you need to sell 100 contracts... that’s 10k shares. I don’t have that many shares"
2021-05-22 00:06:41,wallstreetbets,You're changing the subject a lot here
2021-05-21 22:26:42,wallstreetbets,"The 79.5 (.27 delta) for 5/28 is selling at around $65 in premium right now and the $80 (.24 delta) for around $50 premium.  I'm usually less concerned about the strike and more about the likelihood of it being called away. The $100 strike has an almost 0% chance of being called away next week. So you're going to get super low premiums, but if you sell an equivalent risk of assignment weekly as you do for 7 months out you will make more money on average.

Edit : I'm asking because i don't know which is better, selling long dated options on green days and buying back on red. Or selling low probability weeklies and hope to not be assigned."
2021-05-22 00:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to explain how and why AMD has failed to compete with NVidia, and why it doesn't seem like that's going to change. Failures to release full product stacks and seemingly skipping generations are the key factors."
2021-05-21 22:36:35,wallstreetbets,"I usually do weeklie on other stocks. If it hits I just roll to the next week. If it being called away before weekend, you still get higher premium. I’m not doing well buying back on red days. I usually also do a otm put. So if it goes up, I will close otm put earlier. Like 1cents or 0.1 ones. So I can free up more margin for other opportunities. If it goes down my cc will gain. And I can also roll otm put to the next week in case I had the wrong estimates

I still not quite get you. I understand the delta and probability. But I still don’t think AMD is a good candidate for cc. Premium is too low, but this is to individual’s risk reward. So may be only I won’t do it."
2021-05-21 22:47:36,wallstreetbets,"Premiums aren't high on them because they don't explode up or down on average at least lately.  The $100 strike in Dec isnt much premium and theta ticks off relatively slow on OTM options months out. But I could be missing something. 

I'm only thinking this because AMD has been fairly stable for a while and plays into more more traditional probability than large swings giving you premiums.  If you close the December in 2 months for $100 profit, it's likely you could sell multiple weeklies for more then $100."
2021-05-21 23:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Just my personal experience... especially this year. if it’s a red day, it is not easy to determine when to buy back cc... if it keeps declining which happened so many times  this year. You tend to make less with buy back. And premium will be lower with lower strike if you want to re-sell a cc"

Weird about margin though, I’ve only had an account with them 6 months and they’ve been great about putting margin upgrade requests (3 so far) and now my account is at level 7 of max 12 margin (~1.3M AUM at time of application for upgrade). For awhile I was trading high volumes of contracts and they reduced my contract fee to .35c, waived all of my fees for any transfer or corporate actions/splits. And customer service, trade desk and margin department have been great at solving all the problems I’ve run into. If it goes South when the merge happens I guess I’ll be moving my main account to Fidelity."

Outages would be something everyone experiences, unless they're localized, which is highly unlikely for a company like Schwab. I've personally never experienced any sort of outage, error, or notable slowness and have been using them for a long time.  Seems you may be exaggerating this some.  Same with the margin approval.  They're definitely strict compared to some joke app broker like Robinhood, but their approval process is perfectly in line with other serious brokers."

2021-05-21 20:24:54,wallstreetbets,"I dunno what to tell you.  I proudly opened my first Schwab account while working minimum wage almost 20 yrs ago, first job outta college.  

IBKR was a short and easy quiz with no call required, instant approval.  Fidelity, the lady literally said ""you're approved"" when I called for expediting 5 minutes after sending in app (almost no phone wait unlike Schwab which one time was 1.5 hours) and asked ZERO questions, she just wanted to see my app went through and agreed to expedite.  It could be my networth and maybe others aren't as lucky but then it begs the question why Schwab doesn't see that I've been responsible with and slowly growing wealth as well.  Please don't treat me like a college kid.  I'm almost 40 and have been investing for 19 years.

I get ""system currently unavailable"" or other issues constantly with Schwab.  I've been with them so long I truly wish it wasn't so.

2021-05-21 20:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Just reading through the patent for the inertial drive there are some cringeworthy statements. 

It’s highly suspect. For the example they give of spinning a coulomb charge on a metal disk 1M in diameter. The capacitance of such a disk is on the order of micro farads which means the voltages need to be in the megavolts to get anywhere near a coulomb of charge on it. That’s some serious van de Graf generation going on, let alone arc insulation. 

They need to pick up orders of magnitude voltage enhancement to get anywhere near where any of these effects could possibly happen. 

As for competing tech. The worlds most intense laser fields are only now just attempting to reach >10^18 J/cm^2 in intensity and only on femtosecond timescales. 

If there’s anything that can reach these power levels it’s got to involve manipulation of inner shell atomic fields. Unlikely and hard to do in a macroscopic fashion without fields cancelling out between individual atoms. 

Otherwise there needs to be some magic trick that is not listed in the patent. Some kind of coherence previously undiscovered that enables high EM field generation at least locally within materials. 

All very dubious.

Commando, Terminator, Die Hard, Predator.  These were four R tapes at my house that I cared aboutwhen I was a kid, and I'd seen them each 15-20 times by the time I was 14.  Parents sent me to bed for the full metal jacket rental when I was 10, though...  I still managed to see the sniper scene from around the corner at the end of the hallway."

2021-05-21 20:03:31,wallstreetbets,"The movie was very, very clearly a satire. It was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Total Recall) ffs lol. 

The book on the other hand, is a serious science fiction book. And that was the intent of the author. It was not meant as satire at all, and wasn't received as such. Have you read it recently? There is zero indication of satire, the whole thing is played 100% straight without even a wink. If you haven't read it, it is very different from the movie.

Now in a modern context, through the lens of a fan of the movie... nah even then you can't really find satire in the book."
2021-05-22 03:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Robocop is a satire , not ST , The movie is like the book , not a satire of the book , the book being a satire itself or not is secondary in my comment. Accept it."
2021-05-22 10:46:23,wallstreetbets,"Wait you are saying that starship troopers, directed by the father of film satire, featuring things like a cutaway from the story to literal propaganda reel showing kids doing their part by stomping on bugs, is not satire?

2021-05-21 22:21:20,wallstreetbets,It's the last quarter of the year. If you look at the most profitable periods January is one of them which is when major rebalancing occurs. So October is when everyone either divests or prepares to divest for the year and thus start the tax loss harvesting (and overseas accounting) process and January is when they re-up.
2021-05-21 20:00:12,wallstreetbets,So no need to go Vegas in Oct? Sounds like good plan
2021-05-21 20:17:19,wallstreetbets,It's probably because October is earnings reporting for the summer months when nobody wants to be at work

I, too, wish I was handed the greatest economy in the world where I could afford a house, cars, boats, vacation, a wife that doesn't work, kids, and save for retirement with a pension coming as well all on a high school education.  And if I wanted to go to college I could work as a cashier at Pizza Hut during the summer and make enough to pay my full tuition. And had to do nothing as a generation to have these opportunities,  the generations before you sacrificed and built the great country that you inherited.

Oh, and then change all the rules of society so that the generations that follow after me don't have the same opportunities that I did and struggle just to pay for a college textbook, a single textbook that costs and entire paycheck, and unable to get housing because the generation that rigged the game owns all the land."

2021-05-22 10:24:38,wallstreetbets,"This is the lies they tell you choobs in college. Did you ever think that maybe it's a supply and demand issue and that the lie of a college degree is pushed by the same people? They push the idea that if you don't go to college you will be poor but it's actually the opposite. You are taught extremely left wing failed policies and to blame your failures on other's instead of teaching you how to succeed. Unless you are going to college in the STEM field you are wasting your money. They told this lie to my generation in the late 90's too. I decided that college was a waste of money for me personally and went out to make my own way. Years later I have more money than most of my peers that went with out the debt. If you actually learn how to manage your money and invest you can save tens of thousands of dollars or more by reading free books in a library.

The reason we have a lower standard of living is due to the Federal Reserve inflating the currency. Back when the boomers were growing up at least their money was tied to gold. Now everyone lives paycheck to paycheck and lives on debt. My grandparents generation actually had a thing called savings and didn't buy something unless they could pay cash. But now our currency inflates and everyone lives off credit cards. 

Look, if you actually want to improve your financial life, read books on investing, money management, and the history of Central banks. Or your could blame other generations your you own personal failure. I know what worked for me 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-22 07:01:22,wallstreetbets,Paper silver doesnt 'track' the price of silver it sets the price of silver.
2021-05-22 04:41:47,wallstreetbets,Silver is the best conductor there is.  Copper isn't quite as good.  Similar use cases but silver is a better option for top performing electronics.   There are other uses as well.  Solar panels depend on silver.  Many medical uses.   And I suspect it will become money again when fiat currencies inevitably collapse in on themselves.  That day seems to be coming sooner than later.   The banks balance sheets are way off.  They are sitting on huge reserves.   We are already seeing prices rise in everything at levels approaching something hyperinflationary and it's all barely begun IMO.   Maybe they can keep the plates spinning indefinitely but I doubt it.

But yeah, his drug of choice was coke and crack, but when he fell off the wagon again it was meth.  


I went and saw him the other day, we played some music together. He taught me that too! People have told me he is one of the best musicians around the area. I think he is trying lately, his lungs are really bad. Not many good years left, so I am trying to go see him more, and just jam out."

Ford stock is held up by a false belief.   If you've never paid over 50K for a car, you don't understand that demographic."
2021-05-22 08:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Federal government especially is going to be pushing big for EVs.  They are also examining different models for installing and maintaining charging stations for their fleets.  

A big selling point is how to level load on the electric grids utilizing the vehicles batteries.  Store the energy in the batteries when demand is low and then provide energy to grid when demand is high.  With a fleet of 10 to 50 EVs, this newer concept of distributed battery storage to level load is plausible."
2021-05-21 22:43:55,wallstreetbets,"Where do you see the price going? 
I’m looking into this new truck you are talking about."
2021-05-21 22:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Car companies are moving from a push system to a pull system.  Cars are no longer being overproduced forcing them to be sold at discounts to make way for the new year model.  Instead vehicles are being made per order.  This also avoids storage waste of a dealership having 100+ vehicles on hand.  It is simple continuous process improvement standards of eliminating waste.

I personally wonder if this 'automotive chip shortage' crisis is false and simply because car companies are changing up their business models."
2021-05-22 19:04:36,wallstreetbets,You don't think traditional car manufacturers can sell EVs?
2021-05-22 10:04:40,wallstreetbets,"Interesting logic, whatever it takes to affirm your biases.  🤡"

2021-05-22 07:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Everybody had the same concerns about Teslas battery constraint and they figured it out.  Ford will follow suit and the road block will be overcame.  EVs are the way.  PR stunt, yes.  POTUS driving the vehicle - another great PR stunt."
2021-05-22 07:32:43,wallstreetbets,"The only place it can go......To the Moon!!

At least $20.  That'll be about a 50% gain from current level.

The relative strength is at 90, it gained 6% in higher volume Thursday and Friday, it retook and went above its 50-day moving average last week.  It's close to its recent yearly high and seems to have momentum.  Fridays increase in higher volume seems to be institutional buying. We'll see what happens next week.  The momentum may continue or it may pull back."
2021-05-22 19:15:09,wallstreetbets,".......

Again. I don't think they will sell as many cars as they are now. I think it will be less. 

EV OEMS are frankly out in front of traditional car manufacturers. They are ahead in just about every way. And there's a metric ton of them hitting the market. There's 50+ EV OEMs."
2021-05-22 10:20:57,wallstreetbets,"You have a better take?   How about something simple?  

Legacy can't scale BEV production and have never been able to.  Not ever.  30K per quarter is decent starter production.   Tesla scales to 10K per month in less than a quarter, then 75K per quarter within a year.

How can you consider some low volume boutique BEV from legacy when they have zero ability to scale.  Have no record of ever being able to produce in volume.  

Manufacturing at profit is an equation.  It's math.  That's logic.  

So give me the pro case.   Why should anyone invest in a Ford BEV future?"
2021-05-22 08:45:19,wallstreetbets,"Alright, but I can't make the scaling assumption after seen their battery pack construction--it's too intricate and parts assembly intensive.  I have a background in manufacturing and watched them go out of business due to overestimating the production hump.

Tesla scales to 10K units per month on a brand new line within 30 days.  Not one legacy car company has got to 10K per month in BEVs.  Ever.

Let that sink in.  Not EVER.

Scaling is how the factories are paid back.   Tesla is very cash efficient.  Factory is built and paid for in 2 years.   Debt is miniscule.   Ford cancelled their dividend and carries a lot of debt and is losing money.

The context of this is DD on Ford by someone with saying it's a great buy.   Not whether Joe Biden is impressed with a test drive.   That's not DD.

edit: BTW, the max capacity of a Tesla line is 25K per month, just in case you thought 10K was a lot."
2021-05-22 12:37:59,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the information about the different companies battery manufacturing capabilities.  I admit I've bought into the hype and appreciate your logic keeping me level.

What are your thoughts about Rivian's capabilities of manufacturing batteries?  Will Ford rely on their 15% stake in Rivian for batteries?"
2021-05-22 10:41:21,wallstreetbets,Perhaps you're the cult....
2021-05-22 00:54:04,wallstreetbets,Their vehicles are already at enough volume to have good volume pricing.  Some of the only further improvements you can get are if you're 1.) a stable / reasonable OEM to partner with (think Toyota) 2.) try to be a bully with your volume (GM was notorious for this. leads to acrimony and games.) 3.) pay your damn bills.  Tesla isn't.

 I do have to give them credit though, I think their ICE F150s are fantastic and best in class. their engines and MPGs have come a long way. But that’s just it, that’s what they have been focused on… the transition is happening too quickly for them.

America’s truck for the next 3years will be a gas F150… but after 3 years, I don’t think it will be. I’m not saying it’ll be Tesla… I’m saying they’re the top dog to beat and going forward they’re going to have way to many headwinds defending that position - which is why the stock is so low.

now you have to justify running a company at a loss.... since it is ran as a division of a other company you can use that money hole of a division to use for software development... but any only video based company is fucked because again this model doesn't work if it is just a video company....


how do they justify the millions or billions in losses well they use it to run data collection and software tends. 


now as they are a profit seeking company but they are offering a free unlimited service their costs to operate. the cost to operate is ever increasing at a faster and faster rate..... it costs more to run every year than the year before because billions of hours of video are uploaded every year.

2021-05-21 20:05:59,wallstreetbets,"$139 premium with a $210 strike? This takes the cake. You went high risk, no reward. You basically put $13K on Memphis to win the NBA finals at 2:1 odds."
2021-05-21 20:13:25,wallstreetbets,why the fuck would you ever buy options for GME right now?  the fuck were you thinking?

The hate seriously comes from regret. You have to justify it somehow."

Then when you're done learning about options just do whatever you want.

Don't start buying 2.50 or 5.00 or 10.00 calls a month out and get your ass bucketed."
2021-05-22 10:04:09,wallstreetbets,Have ya checked citadels position on tell. That's when ya know you are fucked
2021-05-22 19:42:16,wallstreetbets,Citadel is one institution. What about all the other institutions that have been buying? I guess we’ll see how the market reacts when they start announcing deals. Stay tuned.

2021-05-21 21:30:08,wallstreetbets,Yes that is one way. People seem to forgot it take an immense amount of energy to turn water to steam to power a turbine. Usually using natural gas as a fuel source. Which is why I was asking the fella I was replying to how he thinks this works.

2021-05-21 22:14:05,wallstreetbets,"ViacomCBS breadth of content is tops.  Much of the most popular content on Netflix and Amazon is licensed from ViacomCBS.  They will be at a huge loss when that content goes exclusive to Paramount+ or to a rival competitor.  Building out brands like Paw Patrol, Star Trek, NCIS, Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Dexter, Frasier, etc takes more than money.  

Top Gun 2 is coming soon as well, that alone will probably double their sub count when it comes to Paramount+.  One of the biggest theatrical releases in decades."
2021-05-22 18:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Yo. So u like stock rover? I've been looking at screeners. I use td and ml , plus basic programs to chart. Have you had a good history with it? I'm always on the lookout."

2021-05-22 12:44:00,wallstreetbets,"\^ This. Price of shares can't really be determined by fundamentals, because there aren't really any. Most of it is speculation and betting. If you went by P/E ratio (which you can't because it's not a profitable company yet), the shares are overvalued by around 11x. Buying shares in it is betting that they'll be ready to launch people, and be profitable enough to keep up an average of 100%+ annual revenue increases for the next decade. Maybe they can, maybe they can't. Who knows?"

For example, indices or shares of holding companies. These options guarantee a stable base and the responsibility for your funds of a group of quality analysts based on the experience of agencies such as S&P. As far as holding companies are concerned, stable options can also be selected with the right analysis. For example, Crawford United and Elah holdings have performed well in 2020, more applied data based on my investment experience. I also expect a demand recovery in Europe and am personally betting on Gesco AG and MBH Corp.

2021-05-22 12:16:00,wallstreetbets,You mean you’re the one who thinks the money that isn’t yours means you have money? And you seem to be pretty obsessed with me which would indicate that you got owned little buddy. Sorry you’re stuck being a poor. Keep following me around like a puppy. That’s a good boy.

2021-05-22 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,just because we like the stock doesn’t mean w have to like this retard and his garbage technical analysis
2021-05-22 18:56:38,wallstreetbets,Who hurt you man
2021-05-22 18:58:27,wallstreetbets,luckily not you and your 16 edits trying to wiggle your way out of being completely wrong

2021-05-22 01:43:22,wallstreetbets,FOR FUCK SAKES
2021-05-22 04:35:08,wallstreetbets,I have Netflix out of habit. Content is beyond underwhelming. Time to finally put the nail in the coffin. And Bank of America... I see you.  I will not bank with any institution that has a role in short attacks like this.
2021-05-22 01:59:11,wallstreetbets,You literally forgot to talk about the other fucking CEO

Fuck your right, this is why I'm not a journalist. Thanks for the read and critique."
2021-05-21 21:36:20,wallstreetbets,Mmmm shitadel sponsored content.
2021-05-22 02:47:29,wallstreetbets,"If they were to actually execute this plan, they still do not provide what gamestop provides. The physical game market is alive and well. Netflix would surely be able to provide a cloud streaming service for games, but it wouldn't come anywhere near the library of games that gamestop provides. Sure they may have Netflix exclusive games, but will they have Nintendo IP's? Sony? Nope. Will they provide a service to provide retro games to the market? (HUGE MARKET) Nope. Will their service be as reliable or match the performance and resellability that physical games provide? Absolutely not. Their competitor would be google stadia if anyone. You can stretch this theory as far as you'd like, but if you don't know the market (which I have built a business on myself) then you won't realize you're comparing apples to oranges."
2021-05-21 22:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.. Although everyone is starting to post the news...

But you can still compare them."
2021-05-22 02:44:57,wallstreetbets,Still gonna fail. I give them 0.01% chance of success.
2021-05-22 02:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Sure can. Doesn't mean apple industry is gonna short the orange industry. They both have their place.

If Orangeflix shorts Applestop into bankruptcy, Applezon, Appleout, or Appledock will facilitate the market faster than it takes for people to forget about apples and eat oranges from Orangeflix.

Lay off the crayons, you're losing it charlie"
2021-05-22 02:53:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, but it's interesting that they are going that direction. Especially while the hedge funds are still shorting it into the ground."
2021-05-21 23:45:33,wallstreetbets,damn people selling calls on COIN making a killing. some wall street trader just took 30k from you
2021-05-22 11:56:09,wallstreetbets,My emotion and the chart  were right
2021-05-22 12:15:43,wallstreetbets,i’m pretty small time 🤷🏽‍♂️ started with a couple bucks like literally 10$ and have been trying to play and learn as much as possible. I’ve had days where my portfolio is sitting at 140 from the 10 i started with. Multiply 😌 just a regular boy trying to become an ape 🦍
2021-05-22 02:33:01,wallstreetbets,It’d only be better if you bought OTM options.
2021-05-22 01:34:48,wallstreetbets,😏💎

2021-05-22 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,SPY is fine as long as the MM’s want to extract funds from retail. Most investment is done through ETF’s with SPY obviously being one of the largest (or its variants). It’s easy to manipulate to keep positive with a few dips so that people can feel they’re catching a dip and it’s not rigged. All the while individual stocks are completely divorced from logic and trade at the whims of hedge funds.
2021-05-22 14:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Great summary. Now can we use this as evidence that the government and economists are just as incapable of predicting or writing good policy as the homeless crackhead and only appear right occasionally, purely through luck and random happenstance completely outside of any of their models and the more complexity they add the less accurate it will be (they read nice and give the warm fuzzies though)."
2021-05-22 12:37:55,wallstreetbets,How did you afford this fellow Ape? Teach me the ways!
2021-05-21 20:14:30,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. I neglected mine. I have some slippage, but it’s ok under gradual acceleration. It also shifts rough sometimes. I was going to change the fluid but a mechanic said that it could cause greater issues. I think I should have just changed it (not flush). I read on a Honda forum, a guy changed fluid three times at something like every 1k miles and seemed to stop his slipping. I take it you use Honda brand fluid?"
2021-05-22 08:38:53,wallstreetbets,Im guessing those calls were not the way....
2021-05-22 15:07:45,wallstreetbets,Don’t try to hold my bag. I can hold my bag myself. Thank you very much. 😂
2021-05-21 23:39:36,wallstreetbets,Awesome week . My calls have tripled !!! Should touch 70 next week . Earnings in 7 trading days .
2021-05-22 19:37:28,wallstreetbets,You doing good now with your $65 calls ? Don’t sell them next week is going to be awesome
2021-05-21 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,How is your short doing? I bought a few puts and they are under water
2021-05-21 22:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Those calls are worth around $4.30 each right now , so he's lost only like an extra $160 or so since his post."
2021-05-22 11:00:26,wallstreetbets,Can we GME this stock 🤔
2021-05-22 11:38:33,wallstreetbets,This def aged like milk
2021-05-22 11:41:22,wallstreetbets,"Not too concerned, I have long puts. They'll be just fine.. May even add more lol"
2021-05-22 11:40:11,wallstreetbets,My calls def made some money..
2021-05-22 11:46:57,wallstreetbets,I may play that swing trade but guessing the top is risky with this stock being so new
2021-05-22 11:06:46,wallstreetbets,Hold the line ?  This isn’t Braveheart!  Cutting losses at 30%-50% is pretty good advice.  I did it week and half ago - painful yet good exercise in discipline.

2021-05-22 01:03:17,wallstreetbets,Everything you do just do the opposite. BAM.
2021-05-22 05:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Aye, we failed to gain the momentum to get up to the crucial $9 level and the delta ramp tilted downwards as options were unhedged."
2021-05-22 18:34:31,wallstreetbets,you want to tell me why the line goes back down?
2021-05-22 03:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Literally just sold all my Delta and United stock to buy this.  I thought I would check WSB to see if it was hyped or not.  BTW CCL only scrapped 3 25yo ships and sold 15 other aging (small and expensive) ships.  They still own 86 boats.  Also as bad as their company is doing, the entire rest of the industry is sinking the same amount.  The have a competitive edge in that smaller cruiselines have completely sunk knocking out many smaller competitors.  The ships are ready to sail as soon as CDC gives go ahead. Airlines are good and I made +50% off them, but going forward I see another 30-50% jump from cruises happening very soon.  Disclaimer: I just made all this up."
