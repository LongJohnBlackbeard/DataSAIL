2021-05-22 19:17:33,wallstreetbets,So this basically means that Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself.
2021-05-22 19:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I like your thought process but how are these plant shutdowns going to change their business model? [news release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/olin-announces-further-chlor-alkali-capacity-reduction-301292851.html)"

2021-05-22 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,What is your price target for $OLN?
2021-05-22 19:19:56,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-22 19:51:50,wallstreetbets,"This is good, they are cutting the less environmentally friendly processing that does not sell for much because its caustic and impure so it costs a lot to make (especially now with epa regs) and doesn't sell for much (why would you even make that? New ceo exactly why they're ending it) this is a strong play especially longer term this is a massive net positive that why the ceo used the term ""accretive"" it means gradual growth, so gradual growth away from impure products + massive demand for more pure products= blast off (over a year no instant moons sorry)"
2021-05-22 19:29:02,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs exactly why they shut this down. Diaphragm grade chlorine producing facility. Not a focal point
2021-05-22 19:59:29,wallstreetbets,Yup that too
2021-05-22 19:58:02,wallstreetbets,$90-$100. Their current market cap is under 6 billion and they did 2 billion just in quarter 1 2021
2021-05-22 19:57:52,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs exactly what my husband said!  He wants instant blast off to the moon so I‚Äôm buying this with my own $$ and leaving him in orbit, ha!"

2021-05-22 19:21:22,wallstreetbets,WSB seems to be deleting SPCE posts
2021-05-22 19:03:32,wallstreetbets,"Good luck.  I'm sitting on a few hundred.  Everything I have is down besides GME.   Lol!  CCIV, SPCE, BB, eh... a bunch of other nonsense."
2021-05-22 19:32:59,wallstreetbets,Blastoff
2021-05-22 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 3 days
2021-05-22 19:26:52,wallstreetbets,"I rode a little ~400% gain way back when it went public thru our good old friends SPACs, and sold around $42 when it peaked first... I think my average cost was just around $10 isa a share even though I bought a nice chunk around $7.25 when it first fell. A fun little 6 month ride or so.

Idk if I'd jump back in again. I wish I could access blue origin or SpaceX. FOMO is real."
2021-05-22 19:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I will show them in October, when I sell my Oct $30 Calls :P"
2021-05-22 19:16:34,wallstreetbets,I'll try to post an update every month. Let's see how it goes :)
2021-05-22 19:24:59,wallstreetbets,Why is that? This is just a YOLO like any other one
2021-05-22 19:34:25,wallstreetbets,SPCE  is not a SPAC
2021-05-22 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I have lost some money on SPACs warrants that I ended up selling and buying more SPCE until now, that it's all I have.

I think the pesimistic general opinion created a great entry point last week.

Good luck to you too üöÄüöÄ"
2021-05-22 19:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, last 12 months have been crazy with those two peaks. I bought the first time around october but didn't sell but I could improve my avg a bit.

I think I would add them to the portfolio if they were public companies depending on their valuation, of course.

The good thing with SPCE is that their delays made the stock crash and that created a good opportunity in my opinion. Also knowing that it reached $60 just on expectations... now that we had this successful flight and some others to come, like Richard Branson's flight... üöÄüöÄ

Whatever happens, I will hold."
2021-05-22 19:55:35,wallstreetbets,Nice.
2021-05-22 19:30:29,wallstreetbets,You gonna be the next SpaceKitty!

2021-05-22 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,What is this company other than a cool ticker
2021-05-22 19:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Entire gain was in one week :)

Still not late to load up or cover - earnings in 7 trading days . It‚Äôs going to be a (step) mother of all beats

C3.AI is an AI platform - mainly for the Oil and gas industry . Due to Covid , lot of billing was deferred last Q which should be recognized this quarter

They have zero debt so inflation is not a pain point . Rotation into growth stocks would definitely help though. 

Target 90-100 for a short term trade ."

2021-05-22 19:26:29,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that I‚Äùm not a perma bull  - I have shorted this stock when it was 120+ but now long for a short term trade .Play both sides and make money  !
2021-05-22 19:18:52,wallstreetbets,"Literally the first thing I wanted to spit out, congrats and fuck you!"

2021-05-22 19:00:48,wallstreetbets,growth stocks went up after taking an ass pounding.
2021-05-22 19:14:05,wallstreetbets,How did you manage this performance? The stock has been falling since February. At what stock price did you buy the option?
2021-05-22 19:21:05,wallstreetbets,I remember you told me that a week back in my DD post . Wow I‚Äôm so happy I don‚Äôt listen to you .

2021-05-22 18:49:58,wallstreetbets,If you're a shareholder and a SMART investor.  you should want the share price to stay underpriced and underperforming for the next 6 months or so. It would be short sighted to want them to appreciate too much before the buyback is complete

2021-05-22 19:44:01,wallstreetbets,What is killing the stock is the low volume only few people want to buy. +90% of shares owned by CEO.
2021-05-22 19:35:32,wallstreetbets,Seriously.  Then people over at the UWMC sub is acting like Mat was gonna use buybacks to bid up the price for a gamma squeeze.
2021-05-22 18:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter what I want. But I hope if it does get to squeezing they hault share repurchases until the price is reasonable (anything under $10 imo). They have already started at least they said they were going to start last week and you could definitely see some weird volume spikes after they said they would begin.

&#x200B;

When they mentioned the program they said they want to take advantage of the low share price right now, I hope they meant that and put their money where their mouth was at $6."
2021-05-22 18:57:45,wallstreetbets,So why would you want it to go up short term.  That only means they leave more shares in the float.  Unless you're impatient and need to paper hands sell. Companies don't usually buy back all at once
2021-05-22 19:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Like i said it doesnt matter what I want. I see great news and a volume spike i get excited so i position myself accordingly:

Have my shares to hold and collect dividends, have my calls to sell during a squeeze event - thats how I played RKT into their special div."
2021-05-22 19:01:37,wallstreetbets,buy more make my bag holding ass some money
2021-05-22 19:13:38,wallstreetbets,Nice entrance on it.  Less then 1/2 my base cost average.  Congratulations and F you.

2021-05-22 18:47:01,wallstreetbets,I feel entry is a bit premature as my chart doesn‚Äôt show a established upward trend yet. Will track over the next week.
2021-05-22 18:32:26,wallstreetbets,Good luck trying to match what Microsoft has already done with Gamepass. Microsoft basically dominates the subscription gaming space with the amount and relevance of titles they offer. Microsoft has been aquiring big game studios lately with the intention of making their content exclusive to Gamepass and the Microsoft/ Xbox environment. Netflix is about 3-4 years behind here if not more.
2021-05-22 18:19:42,wallstreetbets,Sounds like cramers dream
2021-05-22 19:23:19,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see Netflix muscle in on live sporting events of all kinds.

Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities.
I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.


It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.

I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!

He made more TA post than you can think of. Know the context and then comment.

He says 20-day and 60-day now you came here saying 13, 20, 50 and 200. Which one exactly? On a monthly chart? weekly? daily?

Timeframe?"
2021-05-22 16:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Really? Read what you just wrote! When SPY is dropping it's dropping doesn't matter what is your set up there. So if someone  cracked that unique set up what is holding him to be the richest man on earth? Is that unique set up works everyday or just few days? On all tickers? or just one ticker?

If there is no rule and everyone says that you have to build a unique system but can't really tell how to build that system because it's so personalized that it's just saying ""do whatever you want and see what work for you"" 

If you have to change the set up every times but yet can't make money consistently then you are just gambling. If you buy SPY calls one dollar above the trading price, everyday at a certain time of the trading hour, for just 30 days, keeping 10% profit as exit point, your probability of winning is about 50%.

(Which is okay since trading itself is pretty much gambling) we are all just making directional bets based on certain information. We all use different information differently to make more educated bets to up our chances. Everyone has different trading styles, so you need to make a strat that fits you.

I just wanna say, don't make it sound like you're better than all traders using TA just because you say you had a good WEEK while not showing P&L or anything. I'm 99% sure there are traders out there that use TA that did and do a lot better than you lol"

You're bashing all of TA based on this one indicator while pointing out only cases where it ""didn't work"". 


You're  bragging about your strat saying that it ""won"" 89% of the time but you don't elaborate or give any proof. (The pnl posted just shows your top winners and not of this 89% win rate you claim this last week. Also what's the win rate over a longer time period? Like over a year?) 


If you have a working strat and it's working great for you then congrats. Why do you feel the need to bash TA just because you're not using it? If you truly believe that TA doesn't work and the point of this post is to discourage other people from using it cuz it's bs, then why not elaborate on your own strat and explain how it's better than TA strats? If you were at least trying to sell a course or something, I'd get that this post has an actual purpose other than to incite some kind of argument for argument's sake."

2021-05-22 15:35:12,wallstreetbets,"In a short time frame, exponential growth is roughly linear. Over a longer time period, exponential growth dwarfs the information at the beginning of the graph because it is tiny in absolute terms. The timeframe when a log scale is necessary and linear scales are inappropriate depends on the average growth rate, but roughly speaking, a log scale should be used for multi-year charts, maybe 5yr+"
2021-05-22 17:28:06,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a $1 stock and it goes to $2 it is a (2/1) - 1 or 100% return. When it goes up another dollar it's only a (3/2) - 1 or 50% return. On a linear scale the stock prices are equidistant away but on a log scale the second move up from 2 to 3 would be relative to the %return. 

If you are a moron that thinks that the $10 stock you bought which went up a dollar did as well as the $20 stock which also went up a dollar use a log scale. If you have a single wrinkle on your brain then use whichever you prefer. There are so many stocks out that staring at a chart is not an optimal strategy. Most of your analysis should be in a quantitative tool whether it's excel or tableau or python. Sorting by return as a number over some time period or sorting by an annualized return number is easier than looking at a chart with over 5000 tickers."

2021-05-22 15:24:11,wallstreetbets,"I am also an ape so I understand logs like this:

10 usd grows by 10% you got 11 usd --> you gain 1 usd

11 usd grows by 10% you got 12.1 usd --> you gain 1.1 usd

12.1 usd grows by 10% you got 13.31 usd --> you gain 1.21 usd

So the more you have the bigger absolute gain you get from that same 10% return, basically the famous compound interest, the chart goes exponential

&#x200B;

when you log the chart, you remove the compounding and you are looking essentially at that 10%, otherwise the chart looks like 90% happened, no it's just compounding, so when you log you see the market is growing at the rate it has always been.

2021-05-22 18:22:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah I understand that money supply alone wont be a cause of inflation but if economic growth doesn't match the money supply being created then ofcourse there will be some levels of inflation as we are now seeing. The economy has been on its knees but yet money supply has jumped up 6 years worth in 1 year.  Only thing I see coming are rates to go up.

2021-05-22 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"You know, there's an easy solution for this. Wealth tax cash holdings and fund services and infrastructure through a centralized government to decrease liquidity in the money supply.  The banks got the money for free essentially through QE. The tech companies got it for free through tax loopholes and gaps in international finance treaties.

Time to put the money to use. Its not like the US doesn't have multiple bridges and highways dating back to the 50s or even earlier that effectively need to be rebuilt from scratch after decades of subpar maintenance. Its not like the US hasn't effectively taxed its middle class into being poor by forcing them to subsist on privatized healthcare that rewards an HMO's shareholders.

Forcing the money to recirculate is how you bring wages back to par after 40 years of steady decline in spite of massive gains in productivity owing to Internet-based automation."

If rates go much above 3%, interest rates can be raised and that will take out some of the rampant leveraged speculation going on bringing things closer to a normal range.

And hyperinflation is when you hit 50% per month‚Ä¶you aren‚Äôt even close. So so so far away from Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela that it is a joke you are going there as a comparison."

2021-05-22 15:03:59,wallstreetbets,Nice post. I think maybe the writer shouldve taken some classes in economics. Inflation is necessary tool to stimulate spending en therefore investments. Since we have replaced the gold to back the money for production there is no maximum amount of money that can be created as long as production and consumption rise along with it. At some point maximum production is reached and only prices will rise thus an economic crisis and rising of the interest rates. This will make production capacity be destroyed as de-investments or bankruptcy so the cycle can start over. I know of two other systems in the world one is in north korea and the other in cuba. Would you like either one of the two or do you have a new solution that no other economic have thought of before?

2021-05-22 18:05:19,wallstreetbets,"The dollar is indirectly backed by oil, via the petrodollar. Hyperinflation probably won‚Äôt happen since every country in the world needs to hold reserves of USD in order to purchase oil, and foreign countries are more than willing to buy up USD in order to increase the value of their own currency/fund future purchases of oil. This also explains why USD does not really suffer from monetary inflation. If the oil trade ever subsided, and was no longer the world‚Äôs reserve currency, then we‚Äôd be in a world of hurt, since the dollar will no longer be backed by an asset.

2021-05-22 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,"The reason why your explanation of inflation doesn‚Äôt hold is because inflation is not always a monetary phenomenon.  Friedman was wrong.  Hence the United States: who can print money indefinitely because it ostensibly launders the excess capital of the ENTIRE WORLD (trade deficits). The other reason is that money has not always expressed the same object in various economies. (hence why nominal wages have gone up and purchasing power down). Lastly, the dollar is not money.  It is world reserve currency.  It does not behave like money and hasn‚Äôt since it has gone off the gold standard‚Äîwhose price has risen exponentially.  

There is no inflation coming.  There is zero lower bound coming.  

Money died in 1933.  FDR and the fascist state killed it in order to fuse capital and labor together again (‚ÄúKeynesianism‚Äù). What we have today is worthless scrip.  And that‚Äôs the point: valueless tokens expressing valueless labor."

Economics 101 - The law of supply and demand is ever-present. If you make the same mistakes as many governments have done throughout history and you stretch your money supply to the extent where demand can't keep up then you are in a vicious cycle of hyperinflation. 

What we have today is a reactionary monetary policy. When the money supply was tied to the gold standard, it was proactive. The safeguards were in place to keep the money supply well within control."

This was one of the first short squeeze successes of last year on WSB. I know there are A LOT of new people but a bit sad to see so many seem to have forgotten.

$SPCE has been my best play during all last and this year, I've flipped it twice from low 20s to $43 and $56 making over 120k.


Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities.
I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.


It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.

I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!


Now that WSB is onboard we can take down another hedge fund, let's GO!"

I actively use draftkings, betonline,  and bovada. What state are you betting in? Their odds are different on a per state basis and as they begin to leave the expansion period in said state, I‚Äôd imagine their vig would adjust to match the norm. (Other bookies)

When DKNG opened at first (in my area), their lines were insane, now a year later they‚Äôre on par with offshore bookies. They wont need to offer as many promotional stints or insanely great odds as growth begins to stagnant and revenue is steady.

but that‚Äôs just my opinion"

\- Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.

\- VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity‚Äôs rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into ‚Äúfeathered‚Äù re-entry position.

\- VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\- VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\- VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\- The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

A successful test flight + landing!

EDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.  **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

EDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).

EDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.

Congrats to fellow bagholders, this was a fun one to watch!  **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**"

This was one of the first short squeeze successes of last year on WSB. I know there are A LOT of new people but a bit sad to see so many seem to have forgotten.

$SPCE has been my best play during all last and this year, I've flipped it twice from low 20s to $43 and $56 making over 120k.
Because of the nature of the news cycles with flights and shorts it has provided so many swing opportunities. I also believe they will hold a strong position in an emerging industry that will eventually be led by SpaceX and Blue Origin.

It's also gotten upgrade and reiterations of price targets double and triple where it is. Shorts have just once again beaten it down.
I'm about to watch it go to $60+ again and I hope you all are on board!!

Now that WSB is onboard we can take down another hedge fund, let's GO!"

The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), the world air sports federation that maintains records for both aviation and spaceflight, said in November that it planned to reconsider the altitude of the Karman Line, suggesting it might be moved down to 80 kilometers.

I wonder why schools teach you that hyper is a 50% when I promise: at 49% you feel veeery hyperinflated. Even at 5% monthly you can see prices double at a minimun period of every year and half. Someone tell me if this is not to worry about.

According to the international bussiness standards, hiperinflation is defined by three requisites.  3% monthly makes you reach the cummulative 100% in three years. that is one of the requisites to be in a hyperinflated economy. 

Your country have an advantage: most of your printed money go around the world exporting inflation to other countries. You can verify it.

I am more concerned about your government, is creating a trillion deficit a year and this is before the 2021. You dont have a liquidity problem, your economy have a problem of solvency. Im not sure if this is the correct word, but I think is still understandable."

You can have inflation with rates at 3% (what is expected next year) without any problem. In 1980 rates where **15%** and inflation was still 10%. In 1970 rates where **10%**, and inflation 5%.

Bread hasn't gone up that much...""yay!"" but a huge number of Americans have found themselves completely priced out of the housing market, which is doubly exacerbated by the fact that so many of them have insane amounts of student loan debt holding them back. God forbid you get really sick or have a persistent or unusual illness...then it's just game over financially.

I guess my feeling is that everybody was scared shitless about hyperinflation after 2008 but it ""never came"" (except it did, just in disguise) but nothing bad happened either way...we had one of the biggest bull runs in history and continue to hit new ATHs regularly. We've been printing the whole time with only a couple half-hearted attempts at dialing things back.

2021-05-22 13:42:34,wallstreetbets,But no inflation is permanent..inflation is always adjusted. It's not as if someone says tomorrow we gonna have this or that inflation. I am also having some thoughts about the supply chains. Is it possible for manufectores hold supplies waiting for inflation to rise so they can sell it for more? Assuming the fed could control something so global as the price of the dollar is a bit naive in my opinion.
2021-05-22 13:20:55,wallstreetbets,"It is fluid but very uncertain. Also i don't know how controllable it is even if the fed want to paint it green like that. I believe it will shake the market. Also i think most people shouting hyperinflation don't mean 50%, just high and dangerous."
2021-05-22 15:40:19,wallstreetbets,"Stock would take a hit compared to inflation, but not that much and they'd still go up. Cash or bonds would be much worse.

Stock is not a completely bad play. Especially if you avoid the bigger crash potential that are growth stock. Value stock are fine."
2021-05-22 13:45:45,wallstreetbets,"People are working and have money to spend. We have the most savings ever.

The wealth gap is expanding. But wages are rising. People can afford the shit they are buying. People are traveling, computers are in demand, and builders are building and so things related to those things are getting more expensive.

The shortages and the everything bubble are temporary and caused by us shutting shit down almost completely for months.

So it will take months for us to catch back up. It's not like we don't have enough stuff to sell, we just aren't producing enough to meet the demand.

Inflation will rise for a year and then normalize. Hyper inflation is not happening, it's not even close."
2021-05-22 13:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Low levels of unemployment correlates with higher inflation.

Tito5000 maybe think 6% is a high level on unemployment.

He's wrong because it's not a cause even if it helps, it's more than anything a consequence:

* Inflation has not started. When it starts, as prices and salaries rise, people will all be forced to go to work.
* 6% is a low level of unemployment, if you live in USA you may think it's high, but in most countries it's considered very low."
2021-05-22 18:36:47,wallstreetbets,"Might be, but its not.ü§î"

I then had to explain to them, slowly, that that was made up and not real and a joke."
2021-05-22 12:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Okay, in all seriousness, what year did you suffer a head injury?"
2021-05-22 13:21:50,wallstreetbets,"How much money will the stimulus package put into the hands of Americans? How much long term revenue will the infrastructure bill create for the US?

You‚Äôve vastly oversimplified his tax plan."
2021-05-22 13:23:07,wallstreetbets,"So the US isn‚Äôt collecting any money, via any route, at all?

News flash, capitals gains taxes don‚Äôt apply to the average person living in the US. Yeah, selling a house or property, but it largely has no effect on the average US citizen."

2021-05-22 13:44:54,wallstreetbets,Lasting inflation vs temporary inflation then but you get my gist.
2021-05-22 13:32:54,wallstreetbets,"That's the point. Understand the words you say before you say them. They don't know what they mean. Obviously the markets get shook up. They're sensitive to anything that's not buy buy buy, and everything is perfect, etc. The US economy is boom and bust by design (capitalism). This is how it's always been."
2021-05-22 16:35:44,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre understanding what basically everyone in this thread is saying. If the US dollar became hyper inflated and effectively worthless, it would be the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. It would likely be worse. The US dollar is the single most important security in the world."
2021-05-22 14:29:03,wallstreetbets,"This is üíØ right. And you, like me, are the few that understand this. This makes buying growth stocks attractive"
2021-05-22 14:26:03,wallstreetbets,">It's not like we don't have enough stuff to sell

>We aren't producing enough to meet demand

I'm pretty sure that not producing enough *is* not having enough to sell."
2021-05-22 17:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Dude you‚Äôre so wrong. Many businesses are closed for good and won‚Äôt ever reopen. Unemployment checks are stopping in September in most all states that people have been getting from federal stimulus. 

Everything seems exciting now because summer is approaching and people are tired of being inside and don‚Äôt want to hear anymore bad news. But when fall and winter comes so will reality."
2021-05-22 14:29:01,wallstreetbets,"US has the most savings because the gouverment has been shoving it up your throat. And 6% unemployment is a wishful number, which even lying prick jerome cant sweep under the rug. Your trade deficit is balooning and gouverment jobs are the only things that are created in the US as of now. If this trend continues, stagflation is the new way to go."
2021-05-22 14:05:39,wallstreetbets,U-6 is probably a better measure for the time right now. And that sits at 10%.
2021-05-22 19:19:28,wallstreetbets,"It's not only wrong, it's obviously wrong. And based on misinformation."
2021-05-22 19:40:33,wallstreetbets,"The fact that, in addition to shit coins, you are also interested in penny stocks does not make me more confident in your financial literacy"
2021-05-22 13:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Lmao! Man, there's too much led in the water."
2021-05-22 12:39:34,wallstreetbets,I don't recall
2021-05-22 13:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Who knows. But look at the 10y bond yield climbing at 2% it‚Äôs going to rock the economy as there‚Äôs no confidence in the debt to be repaid.

You don‚Äôt need a economic degree to see the stock market at all time high while the bond yield is climbing. The fed is buying too much and it‚Äôs going to suck cause taxpayers is holding the bags."
2021-05-22 13:42:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean the facts is there if you can understand. Corporations posting record profit and stock gains selling bonds to the Feds?

Just recently banks been selling bonds to the Feds and they get repo for supper low rates ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yeah it‚Äôs a house of toilet paper ready to get wiped."
2021-05-22 13:59:24,wallstreetbets,But if you want to know how much jobs the stimulus creates you can look at Obama stimulus out of the 2009 crash ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Try reading instead of getting spoon fed. His debt was massive easily doubling the debt

2021-05-22 12:44:03,wallstreetbets,Ohhh rub dicks first. Beer time. Sorry. I‚Äôm a little testy. Power washing sucks. I‚Äôm beat
2021-05-22 13:49:33,wallstreetbets,"True. But the thing is inflation causes more inflation. Think about it. The buying power of the US will decrease. It's not really 1+1 like that. It's not that the fed says ok we gonna increase interest by 1% and that will stop it. Other countries decide they are buying less $, inflation increases again. Lots of factors i don't really understand effect that."
2021-05-22 16:50:56,wallstreetbets,"I understood and I rest my case. 

Great Depression wasn't hyper inflation, it was hyper deflation, so the complete opposite. This will be different, simply because now USD is not pegged to gold."
2021-05-22 14:29:42,wallstreetbets,"It will be temp. The reason is because imports have been low because the pandemic. Now that everyone is out, there ate shortages. But macro theory says that eventually supply will catch up with demand and will surpassed demand."
2021-05-22 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,But we are now producing. It will just take a little time to catch up.
2021-05-22 19:42:11,wallstreetbets,What reality? Shitty businesses closed. They weren't ever profitable.
2021-05-22 13:41:16,wallstreetbets,"""lead"" (sic)"
2021-05-22 16:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I agree that inflation is coming, but I still see a lot of value in an infrastructure plan."
2021-05-22 16:02:29,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people invest but put the majority of their money into tax-sheltered vehicles, I think their are called Roth IRAs?

Most people aren‚Äôt day traders, house flippers, or the like.

The increase in tax for capital gains from what it is now to what its proposed comes off the **profits**, it‚Äôs not a straight income tax."
2021-05-22 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,I feel ya man. Bartender here.... No air-conditioning... It's hot. Hope your shift goes quick brother.
2021-05-22 14:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. As long as supply bottle necks are resolved competition is gonna come back and prices will be pressed down. The strawberry example is actually a good one. Where I live they start selling every year around june. Some years it's up due to a cold start of the summer and some years its down. It doesn't benchmark itself on the previous year but on  supply, demand and production costs as most consumer goods do. When bottle necks are resolved, supply goes up driving prices down. Since the majority of the current inflation is due to these factors I expect it to be transitory. I also do not believe that other countries will stop buying USD. For all extents and purposes it is the global currency and such a change of paradigm doesn't just happen over night. Also lets keep in mind that inflation has been too low for many years, a temporary boost might be healthy."
2021-05-22 14:33:21,wallstreetbets,"I mean that's fair, I was mostly just pointing out that your wording left a little something to be desired haha."
2021-05-22 13:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Oops, third language, no spell check:)"

2021-05-22 17:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Inflation happens yearly (at 2% clip because of COLA). The disconnect is when fed inflation gauge verse real world cost of living (COL) is way off. Your cost of living is well above 2%, more like 25-40%.  Hyperinflation is dangerous because asset is bubbling when consumers starts to tighten up their budget."
2021-05-22 13:34:59,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm good. Slamming beers while powerwashing my house. It‚Äôs like 90 out
2021-05-22 15:03:58,wallstreetbets,"What suply bottle necks exist in housing markets? Or used cars markets? Inflation means a dollar buys less. You can see it all around you, and me living half a world a way from you, see it too."
2021-05-22 15:00:47,wallstreetbets,But you're assuming inflation is due only because of supply bottle necks. What about a debt that rose few folds? Or a manic printing? Or so many more factors playing that neither of us understand. I am saying the fed is acting as if they know how it is going to play out for a false sense of stability. You assume you have the slightest clue?
2021-05-22 14:35:45,wallstreetbets,I understand. But think about that all macro theories were based on 3-4 % normal inflation rate. I don't understand when above 2% became evil
2021-05-22 15:23:58,wallstreetbets,"In housing markets it has been way more expensive to build during covid because of among other things imports of building material. This is because of a global container shortage. Not to mention covid shut downs halting production, workers having to stay home at the slightest symptom. At the same time you have more people working from home wanting to move to bigger houses. Stagnant supply and hightened demand =price goes up. In used cars it's both the containers for parts and the chip shortage. New cars are sitting on production lines waiting for parts and chips. When there's a limited supply they are gonna sell out at the dealerships so people start buying used cars instead. Add to that people who have gotten a worse economic situation because ofbthe pandemic who might normally get a new car now going for a used one instead. Price of used cars goes up. Supply, demand  and bottle necks."
2021-05-22 15:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Well seems like your bias is confirmed. I would recommend you to doubt it for a second, just for the sake of your financial security. There is a possibility you are wrong, whatcha gonna do bout it?"
2021-05-22 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Of course there is a chance I'm wrong. I don't have a crystal ball. But if I am and there is hyperinflation, we're all screwed and I guess I'll go all in on the Hongkong exchange."
2021-05-22 15:38:07,wallstreetbets,Hyperinflation is a big word. I believe double digits or close. I'm not a rage prophet. It's gonna be down strong and then it will be up again. You won't be screwed if you play it right.

Yall are in a bubble. I made money on gamesetop myself, but its still a meme stock thats basically a huge coordinated pump. Not a basher, I totally support what you guys are doing. Thats just not the type of trader I am. Mad respect for your conviction. But I'd rather not miss out on other plays cause my money is tied up in a meme."

2021-05-22 12:57:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah right, what's the risk in overly concentrated positions with an entire portfolio in a single position? I CANT see how that would be wrong. It's not like there are countless traders and pieces of information that explicitly say why you shouldn't do this. But hey, what's the risk, coming from some inexperienced person who doesn't comprehend the silliness of his own question. Do you know who Bill Hwang is? 

The fact that you're asking such a dumb question, and it is dumb, shows you don't have any idea what you are talkng about. You're just some person who took personal offense to a comment not directed at you and chose to try and rationalize the illogical through a scope of zero experience. 

You are not helpful or good in any sense for acting that way. People like you with supportive opinions to bad habits are actually reductive to the progress of anyone trying to be successful at trading.

But heres the thing. Inflation doesnt just fall from the skies. The value of a currency declines because the currency amount in float, in assets and overall rises + the velocity of this money escalates in parallel (so that 1 currency unit is spend multiple times more often).

When these things happen, we get Inflation and maybe some time later rising interest rates (which usually dont even keep up with the devaluing of currency!). BUT additionally, asset and goods prices grow even more.

2021-05-22 10:21:45,wallstreetbets,"Turkish stock market is a terrible bear market since 2013 in dollar parity. The index came from $500 to like $150. It only seems like appreciating because of the bad monetary policies like keeping interest rates irresponsibly low for political gains and causing hyperinflation in the end, plus large trade deficits mostly due to energy dependence. In reality, the index can't catch up with inflation.

Fed is both better equipped and politically more independent than Turkish CB. Even if they weren't, people would flee to gold and less inflationary foreign currency and stock market would have troubles catching up with inflation. Solid companies that can increase their earnings percentages in an inflationary environment too.

Source: I am Turkish. I hold gold and some mid term plays like refineries in Turkish stocks. We have fucking extremely cheap stocks but shit won't change until there is a political change in my country. Some options and stocks betting on Erdoƒüan losing elections might be a WSB worthy play though. But in short, i think you don't understand the effects of high inflation on the stock market."

2021-05-22 08:22:32,wallstreetbets,Especially with the high amount of debt that has variable interestrate. Those will default once interest rises. In macro economics i think production capacity is maxed out so if demand rises only prices can go up. Production capacity has to be destroyed so the cycle can start over. Putting more money in the economy doesnt solve the problem of maxed out production capacity only development can. You can see that during the industrial revolution. Interest has to go up soon if you see the rise of prices in raw materials. Consumer goods will be affected by this and prices will keep rising.

The US might punish them for breaking Iran embargo through gold smuggling too (Halkbank stock if you want to gamble on the US acting harsh or no).

So you should know some inner workings of the country to invest and that is hard for a foreigner.

My position: I bought TUPRS at $10.2, the monopoly refinery of the country because i predict rising demand in jet fuel, their largest profit margin product. They usually pay good dividends too but the refinery shut down last year, their access to cheap Iran oil got cut and they had large losses, and the price went down.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME Holders! $10,000,000 Is FUD To Keep You To Hold The Bag! Hello,

I have been buying GME since May 2020. I currently have a 200k bet that GME goes up. I want the squeeze as much as anyone.

However, I feel like it is my duty to explain what is going on. The $10,000,000 share price is not going to happen. Whales want you to think it is possible so they can sell at $500 and there will be enough depth in the market to exit.

How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? Right as midterms are heating up? No, the government will halt trading for days, or weeks, until a deal is brokered with GME directors. Ryan C may not want to issue more stock, but it will be the only way to avoid jail time for ‚Äústock manipulation‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt think the gov will send innocent ppl to jail, then you have not been paying attention.

The point of this post is not to make anyone sad or angry, it is to offer good trading advice. I see people breaking up with their loved ones, underperforming at work, or alienating others over this saga. Don‚Äôt do this. life is long and you do not want to trash what you have built bc you think one share of GME is a winning lotto ticket. 

Everyone has their own exit strategy. Don‚Äôt let anyone talk you out of making money. if you think this is FUD, then you really have fallen for the whales and you will be left holding our bags.

I wish the best to everyone here. Good luck: Buy, Hold, Vote and plan an exit strategy!

Anyways, the short interest in GME hasn't been anywhere near high enough to cause an ISS since it threatened in January.

Dude is absolutely right that the infinite price target memes are there to sucker people into buying and holding at inflated prices.

2021-05-22 16:28:17,wallstreetbets,"yes, robinhood will fuck you over.

it's not worth it. Robinhood does worst fills and they pocket the difference, so you will instantly lose about 3-5% your account value every time you make a trade.

To put it into perspective. I placed a $5k bet on MSTR put, and fidelity did a price improvement of $170 dollars. If I used robinhood, they would have kept that $170 for themselves.

Even if you put a limit order, it doesn't matter. Say you want to buy a put for $3.50 and it will never fill at that price until price fluctuates down to $3.45. Then citadel buys it for $3.45 and then sells it to you for $3.50. Limit order doesn't mean anything when they can wait on filling your orders."

2021-05-22 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Underrated company IMHO. After a decade of being relegated to little more than a meme about indestructible antique phones and bleeding cash they‚Äôve amazingly somehow positioned themselves as about the only end-to-end 5G company out there (that Chinese company notwithstanding). 
In just the past couple of months they‚Äôve made deals with largest telecom companies in Sweden, Philippines, London, and a bunch of future work with US tech sector as well. 
As soon as these moves start turning into actual earnings and not just news stories (we saw a taste last quarter and stock jumped 15% in a day) this will continue to gain traction. If the 2nd or 3rd quarter reports later this year are anything close to what we just saw, or better, then $6+ won‚Äôt be tough by this January and $10 by Jan 23 isn‚Äôt unrealistic at all."

2021-05-22 04:04:52,wallstreetbets,They've done a a ton already.. if they ever consolidate shares that'd fix alot of the issues with price movements
2021-05-22 09:49:34,wallstreetbets,">late 2020

2021-05-22 08:12:39,wallstreetbets,Those balls... I must say.
2021-05-22 09:15:30,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and assume if this person putting up 65k+ on meme stock options with a break even point that‚Äôs insane, didn‚Äôt risk their last two pennies to do this. Either way good luck pal"
2021-05-22 08:39:12,wallstreetbets,I'm in the same contract for 50x. I def don't think soon. 5G contracts for their patents aren't going to show returns till end of year. But it can't go tits up
2021-05-22 12:13:28,wallstreetbets,Its a call he didnt buy at 10
2021-05-22 16:11:02,wallstreetbets,Love how the guy is still confident lmfao
2021-05-22 12:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Its for 2023 tho, could happen"
2021-05-22 12:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Ummm I actually do that, you definitely don‚Äôt need to be a hedge fund lol. Have shorted all of them at close to their peak (MVIS at 20, EBON, MNMD, AMC, etc) and made a shit ton of money. You don‚Äôt need millions or anything."
2021-05-22 11:35:13,wallstreetbets,What is a contract? I'm still kinda new to this. Is a contract the same as an option?

2021-05-22 14:59:29,wallstreetbets,Ohh alright alright
2021-05-22 09:00:08,wallstreetbets,literally going tits up
2021-05-22 16:50:32,wallstreetbets,Explain plz.
2021-05-22 17:24:46,wallstreetbets,1 call contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price. A put is the option to sell 100 shares at that price. That's the basics of it.
2021-05-22 12:07:23,wallstreetbets,That is correct
2021-05-22 16:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Well, just that... when a WSB stock ‚Äúexplodes‚Äù (aka it gets extremely overvalued such as MVIS at 30, AMC at 15, etc) you short it and make profit. You have to put wide stop losses due to the volatility tho.
Basically instead of going long at the precise top like all the apes here, you go short like a sensible human being ü§£ It‚Äôs the exact opposite, nothing more nothing less."

2021-05-22 02:00:41,wallstreetbets,Rich in upvotes soon tho‚Ä¶
2021-05-22 03:29:13,wallstreetbets,"I am not going to ask about hedging, stop losses, and what made you buy it in the first place, but why the heck didn‚Äôt you cut your losses? You could have taken an out in March at 50%, April at 40%. I know it‚Äôs a lot of money to just cut lose but look where it got you. Tough luck, mate, and sorry for you loss. Hope you are going to be alright. 

Just to make a note for other apes and their future endeavors:

The stock of the company, CEO of which can end it with one tweet, is sitting near the all time high, like 4% off, and declining. It also gained something like 1,500% in just over a year to get there. The company had never made a profit before. The (trading) volume has been disappearing for months and is, literally, the lowest it‚Äôs been in years. The guy goes ahead and buys calls with a strike ~6% out and break even price ~22% out. The guy sees a profit of ~15% in the next few days, but doesn‚Äôt take it. A week later the price starts to roll and volume actually picks up because people are selling. The guy holds hoping for a rebound. The due date is still ~6 months out, but the stock price keeps rolling for a month before it takes a breather. It does provide a couple of opportunities in the process to cut losses and get out of the trade, but the guy never takes it. About 2 months before expiry, the guy makes this post, down ~99%. The stock is down ~30% since the purchase and little hope for recovery.

Again, sorry for your loss, mate. I hope it runs in the time left and you recover some of the money."

2021-05-22 06:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry for this man... It is real painful to cope with losses and it will take time to get over it. Loss aversion is asymmetric, and the pain coming from a heavy loss like this is way bigger than the joy you can get from any profit.   


My advice is to take a break from all this. You need to find a new distraction/hobby. If you do not fight it, you will find yourself reliving this trade over and over, eventually ending up in a depression.  


If you need to talk to someone, feel free to send me a message."

2021-05-22 05:10:44,wallstreetbets,This is hilarious..good for you
2021-05-22 05:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully IV rockets and you can benefit some from the increase in premiums. There's still time to expiration, with these markets who knows what'll happen."
2021-05-22 05:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Put it this way, this would be a normal 6 month swing in property prices."
2021-05-22 05:19:19,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 50 Days
2021-05-22 05:21:17,wallstreetbets,Sell and walk away with your $985 or you will lose everything
2021-05-22 05:23:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes indeed."
2021-05-22 05:32:08,wallstreetbets,I really don‚Äôt understand why with that amount of money people throw it all into one call instead of buying shares and writing covered calls. Especially with the insane premiums during the past few months.
2021-05-22 05:34:57,wallstreetbets,"A timely reminder that there are a lot of new and impressionable investors here. Support one another, learn from OP,  peel a banana, throw feacies... wait, what?  

Good luck OP, feel for you right now."

2021-05-22 08:00:06,wallstreetbets,Daaamn
2021-05-22 08:00:47,wallstreetbets,300 is more achievable
2021-05-22 08:04:16,wallstreetbets,I lost sooo much money on tesla! I love the company but the shorts were perfectly timed to take my money. Finally i just stopped trying. And yolod to AMC because generally I am retarded.
2021-05-22 08:05:05,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-22 08:13:05,wallstreetbets,Can someone translate total damage? What r we looking at here?
2021-05-22 08:19:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah you‚Äôre pretty fucked. Maybe time to consider pulling out before you lose the rest of it though honesty at this point that‚Äôs pretty much nothing.
2021-05-22 08:21:16,wallstreetbets,How does somebody get so far into the red? Looking for an ELIM5 summary. Thanks
2021-05-22 08:22:56,wallstreetbets,What is the strike?
2021-05-22 08:25:44,wallstreetbets,Yes for still using Robinhood üòÇ
2021-05-22 08:25:54,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt use Robin the hood and I‚Äôm somewhat smoothbrained, what did OP do here to lose 67k? I assume these are call options but it doesn‚Äôt show the price nor the amount of contracts..."
2021-05-22 08:26:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-22 08:29:47,wallstreetbets,You are on Robinhood so yes you are fucked.
2021-05-22 08:35:23,wallstreetbets,Join hands with me to convert 1k to 100k
2021-05-22 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre not fucked. You‚Äôre just a poor now.

2021-05-22 08:37:45,wallstreetbets,I knew people would call these next few weeks
2021-05-22 08:37:49,wallstreetbets,Are you ok?
2021-05-22 08:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry for your lost.
I hope that you are going to recover and get rich"
2021-05-22 08:41:00,wallstreetbets,Add 1 gme to your portfolio and you'll be fine
2021-05-22 08:41:37,wallstreetbets,"Look on the bright side, you've only lost $30 today!"
2021-05-22 08:42:09,wallstreetbets,With a capital FUCKED
2021-05-22 08:42:10,wallstreetbets,Did you actually think TSLA would be worth more than 1035 on 7/16? Or just hoping to sell the options before that for a quick profit?
2021-05-22 08:43:14,wallstreetbets,This was a bad call üòè
2021-05-22 08:44:49,wallstreetbets,"Situations like this remind me of late game basketball when it's a 2/3 score game. Logically, if you looked at one team and said , ""ok team one have to do A and B then the other team has to fuck up S so that team one can some how pull off C and D"", you would write it off as a loss for team one. That said, you're in this deep so why not say fuck it and ride it all the way out? If you made this bet you can probably take the hit with some grace. Anyway, thanks for sharing this man, Its both educational and somewhat inspiring."
2021-05-22 08:45:06,wallstreetbets,Fuck a stop loss I guess
2021-05-22 08:47:04,wallstreetbets,Can i comment?
2021-05-22 08:48:35,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-05-22 08:50:35,wallstreetbets,"You bought calls on Tesla at those stratospheric levels !üëèüèª I read somewhere that buying into parabolic rallies can come back to bite you in the butt , hope you have some dry powder left bro"

2021-05-22 08:54:24,wallstreetbets,"If a meme stonk squeezes before your expiry date, then there could be a chance ü§î i'm personally planning to invest in Tesla afterwards. Otherwise indeed you're completely fucked üò∂"
2021-05-22 08:55:55,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm tired of newcomers on this sub thinking that we have risk tolerance. The fact that we don‚Äôt is what makes this sub great. Go back to r/investing. And good job op for being a retard. God bless you
2021-05-22 08:57:53,wallstreetbets,With prices that cheap I may need to join you for the ride with one call.

2021-05-22 09:19:07,wallstreetbets,How did this happen? I don't get it. If he bought call options on Tesla - maximum he could have lost was his premium?
2021-05-22 09:19:45,wallstreetbets,You still have time to average down.
2021-05-22 09:21:11,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre completely fcked because you‚Äôre in Robinhood

2021-05-22 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,your fucked because your getting robbed from the hood
2021-05-22 09:50:04,wallstreetbets,At least you got some sweet internet points.

2021-05-22 10:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Nice return, buy high and never sell!"
2021-05-22 10:04:05,wallstreetbets,I am thankful I got out when it was $700. Holding Tesla stocks were like the worst game of hot potato. You were always holding over the weekend and you never knew WTF Elon was going to tweet out and plunge the stock.
2021-05-22 10:04:48,wallstreetbets,You are only fucked if you are sell. Think long game

2021-05-22 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,Wow sorry for your loss bro..  avoid options it‚Äôs pure gambling and you rarely can win.  If you prefer to play them I would suggest buying the dip with them then sell the rip immediately because time decay is a mofo
2021-05-22 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,Jesus man when did you buy these?
2021-05-22 10:20:53,wallstreetbets,"How did you manage to get - 66K‚Ç¨ with a 900‚Ç¨ equity?

2021-05-22 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,Sell low buy high
2021-05-22 10:33:00,wallstreetbets,"1.. $30 loss so far is no biggy. Let it expire out of the money and zee what happens.. the entire option value will evaporate.

2. Sidebar discussions about taxes anz loss carry overs.. this is simple. Imagine you are going to a casino. You walk in and gamble $1000. If you leave with more than $1000 you pay ordinary income tax (short term gain). If leave with less than $1000, you can write off the amount you lost.. If you dont have anything to write it off against, you have 20 years to make a taxable gain to match the loss against."

2021-05-22 10:56:48,wallstreetbets,I will never bet on Elon Musk. He is a self centered grifter
2021-05-22 10:58:40,wallstreetbets,"Should have just bought a tesla, would have been a better bet because you wouldn‚Äôt have even received it yet"
2021-05-22 10:58:42,wallstreetbets,Help this smooth brain to understand how it is even possible to get into this much trouble
2021-05-22 11:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes I‚Äôm down bad and sad but seeing this make me happy, thank you op üôè"
2021-05-22 11:04:24,wallstreetbets,Next time setup a stop loss sell order bro. Also stop using Robinhood cause that is what exactly happened.
2021-05-22 11:07:20,wallstreetbets,Should have sold when high but you can always keep trying.
2021-05-22 11:07:33,wallstreetbets,I didn't register that you were trading options and thought TSLA had fallen to $1.97 for a second!
2021-05-22 11:09:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are"
2021-05-22 11:09:04,wallstreetbets,"Oof, options on Tesla is risky man. We love to see it, you definitely one of us retards!"
2021-05-22 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,Why can't people with money like this just buy the shares and be a multi-millionaire in 10 years +? What a shame.
2021-05-22 11:10:46,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk should personally hug you for the love you proved for his company
2021-05-22 11:11:00,wallstreetbets,Honestly don‚Äôt know how people didn‚Äôt see Tesla as drastically overvalued.
2021-05-22 11:11:08,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what all that means but I think you are fucked lol
2021-05-22 11:11:43,wallstreetbets,"That why it's usually never a good idea to hold until expiration,  I'm sure you was up at one point greed just get the best out of us sometimes"
2021-05-22 11:11:54,wallstreetbets,Buying calls at the top lol this is the way smh
2021-05-22 11:12:50,wallstreetbets,This is the Tesla curse.
2021-05-22 11:15:20,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-05-22 11:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did you buy OUT OF THE MONEY calls? I can‚Äôt believe buy calls instead of selling puts, it is the same scenario but no risk. The stock can go up or down and you still make money"
2021-05-22 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,Leaps are Supreme according to the man
2021-05-22 11:19:05,wallstreetbets,Got damn

2021-05-22 11:21:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are."
2021-05-22 11:22:44,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting fucked anymore for awhile after this
2021-05-22 11:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Can somebody explain the $1.97 at the top? It looks like it‚Äôs saying that‚Äôs the share price, but the share price is actually like $580"
2021-05-22 11:23:58,wallstreetbets,Where is she ?
2021-05-22 11:25:25,wallstreetbets,Bruh. I would pack up all my shit and move to Nepal to become a Buddhist monk and give up all attachments to the physical world. (Aside from what's left in my bank account.)
2021-05-22 11:26:22,wallstreetbets,Sheesh üòí is this a call
2021-05-22 11:26:27,wallstreetbets,"Options bad, shares good"

2021-05-22 11:29:31,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain all these fields to a beginner? I don't know how to read what happened.
2021-05-22 11:31:13,wallstreetbets,Oooof
2021-05-22 11:31:22,wallstreetbets,Use the Martingale method to pull yourself out of the whole. Mathematically guaranteed

2021-05-22 11:37:04,wallstreetbets,How did you even get 70k being so fucking stupid?
2021-05-22 11:40:10,wallstreetbets,"No worries, I took the opposite approach of buying OTM puts on this.  Blew it all.  Pretty sure it can only go down or up.  Not just stay wallowing like the rest of the market for 2021 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
2021-05-22 11:42:26,wallstreetbets,Immagen if those were puts instead of calls.... the guy on the other side of this must be your wifes boyfriend.
2021-05-22 11:43:58,wallstreetbets,Even with how volatile Tesla is I doubt I'd ever get to that strike price. You need a goddamn miracle.
2021-05-22 11:44:05,wallstreetbets,Damn. I thought I was ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
2021-05-22 11:44:42,wallstreetbets,"All good, soon enough you'll be at a $69,420 loss"
2021-05-22 11:44:52,wallstreetbets,I sense a bad decision in your past.........clouded by greed you were.......

2021-05-22 11:45:34,wallstreetbets,Goodnight.
2021-05-22 11:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you should have sold this quite some time ago.

Risk management is key"
2021-05-22 11:46:52,wallstreetbets,damn man why can‚Äôt I own 100 shares of TSLA and fleece some scrubs selling CCs at insane strikes

2021-05-22 11:52:36,wallstreetbets,Heard Tesla could drop to $300ish??...
2021-05-22 11:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, if taxes go up, The losses are worth more to you?"
2021-05-22 11:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Not completely, you still got that sweet 1.5%left"

2021-05-22 12:07:58,wallstreetbets,"You, my friend, like most people here, are gambling. Donating to charity would be more beneficial to society."
2021-05-22 12:08:52,wallstreetbets,Is this an option?
2021-05-22 12:11:07,wallstreetbets,Time to hit that restart trigger.
2021-05-22 12:12:58,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt sell
2021-05-22 12:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Is Tesla was owned by another guy, I would buy the stocks."

2021-05-22 12:17:27,wallstreetbets,Nah man you still have almost a grand to go.
2021-05-22 12:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Theta until December is higher than Delta, so if you buy something, then go December or further out

+ You can sell a call for every call you bought. Looks like you have 5 calls, so you can sell 5 calls - closer to expiration and at a higher strike price than what you‚Äôre currently holding

+ You can make it into a spread by buying the same strike price (averaging down) and then sell a call at a higher strike price. The price is $.28 cents (or $28 for 100 shares) for the option to SELL 920 CALL 7/16; BUY 900 CALL 7/16

+ You can sell the position (for a loss), then open up a spread further out in 2022. The spread for BUY 1000 CALL 1/21/22
and SELL 1005 CALL 1/21/22 was $.30 cents on Friday. You could get back some money as credit while you wait for this spread to ride out

I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, btw"
2021-05-22 12:19:15,wallstreetbets,"don‚Äôt be shy, buy some more üêç"

2021-05-22 12:19:43,wallstreetbets,Dam! üßê
2021-05-22 12:21:48,wallstreetbets,That breakeven is ridiculous bro. You'll get at least 1/4 back though. Cut your losses on the next uptrend to $700
2021-05-22 12:22:50,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-05-22 12:24:05,wallstreetbets,"At this point, you could see it as paying approximately $15 for each upvote you have on this post"
2021-05-22 12:26:33,wallstreetbets,"What trading platform are you using to buy Tesla stock on the picture? I really like it in terms of its design and simplicity üòç..Really appreciate if you can share it to me, thanks üëç"

2021-05-22 12:28:10,wallstreetbets,This post just tells me it is possible to turn 985$ into 67k
2021-05-22 12:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Tesla above 1k is way way off into the future, those leaps need years."
2021-05-22 12:33:09,wallstreetbets,Keep the faith
2021-05-22 12:36:00,wallstreetbets,"This is always so inspiring. From a young retard ape, I wish you guys the best of luck and I look forward to being a fellow retard in the future once I have money like this!"
2021-05-22 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,At least you use Robin Hood. You saved yourself like $3 in commissions!
2021-05-22 12:39:57,wallstreetbets,Umm excuse me sir but this is a Wendy‚Äôs?!?!
2021-05-22 12:43:17,wallstreetbets,"so what did you do?

buy 5 calls with a strike price of $1,035.85?

and its going to expire worthless, correct?"
2021-05-22 12:45:41,wallstreetbets,technically this is a victory for society if you consider it's taking money away from someone who shouldn't be trusted with money at all.
2021-05-22 12:46:56,wallstreetbets,That sucks but it's good to see some loss porn again
2021-05-22 12:47:56,wallstreetbets,Wtf!!! Dude what is wrong with u!!

2021-05-22 12:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Just sell some OTM weekly's until exp to get back a portion of your losses and hope it goes up. Fuck I don't know man, I am not a financial advisor."
2021-05-22 13:01:29,wallstreetbets,"You were so close to losing $69k, what a waste of a good joke"
2021-05-22 13:02:04,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs your strike price? Cause as I see it you still have lots of time, unless you have a call outside of $800 or put that is below $400. Then that might be a little harder."
2021-05-22 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,Wow.
2021-05-22 13:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Nah, 900 EOW. Right?"

2021-05-22 13:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Yup, you're boned."
2021-05-22 13:53:52,wallstreetbets,It's so incredibly stupid of Webull to not have an exercise option button. Smooth brain to the core. Email them to fucking execute it?!?!?! Just hope the price is still where you want it to be.
2021-05-22 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,and god damn it man you could have bought me a c8 corvette instead of being hammered in the anus with a Pringle's Can.

2021-05-22 15:07:10,wallstreetbets,Maybe Elon announces a flying Tesla before expiration. That‚Äôs probably what you would need to profit

2021-05-22 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,You really should start writing options instead of buying them. Let the expiration date work in your favor.

2021-05-22 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,Quite simple how to solve this situation. Just double down with another 70k and sell the very first moment it ticks up. Can't go tits up.
2021-05-22 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,Does that mean you owe money or just make 0?

2021-05-22 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,"You bought these calls at 850 during the top because everyone was making easy money and saying stonks only go up. 

Lol 

The best part is if someone had told you not to do it, you probably wouldn't have listened. Remember this loss the next time you want to play trading. Next time, pay the cost of educating yourself instead of paying mr market for an expensive lesson in losses. 

You people crack me up."

2021-05-22 08:51:49,wallstreetbets,How do you write these loses off? I hired an accountant last year to just that and he completely ignored write offs. Any accountant recommendations is also appreciated.
2021-05-22 07:26:57,wallstreetbets,It's the Trump way
2021-05-22 10:08:56,wallstreetbets,20 years of write offs? What is max per year in US?
2021-05-22 10:15:53,wallstreetbets,Agreed a lot can happen from here to July. At this point hold and see.

2021-05-22 11:12:50,wallstreetbets,Many people gamble their bets until they lose. That's why didn't sell at 15% gain. This has little to do with investing money.

So 5x100 = 500 contracts that give you the right to buy the stock at a specific price by a certain date, in this case OP has 500 contracts to buy the stock for $900 by 7/16 (hence in the photo his breakeven price, he needed the stock to hit $1035 so he can buy the stock for $900 and still profit off it after paying $135 per contract which gave him the right to buy at a certain price ($900) by a certain date (7/16)). Each contract in this trade was worth $135 so 5x100=500 then 500x$135 = $67500 (that is what OP originally put in).

He will not owe robinhood. He will owe himself an explanation as to why he is so fucking retarded."
2021-05-22 13:23:00,wallstreetbets,It's almost impossible to lose money buying options.  That's why on the really rare occasion someone loses big buying options it is posted as porn.

2021-05-22 10:11:22,wallstreetbets,20% loss and that‚Äôs it. Once you hit 20% you cut that shit loose. Better than a 96% loss.
2021-05-22 15:50:50,wallstreetbets,Send TSLA a strongly worded email.
2021-05-22 05:41:47,wallstreetbets,Pls buy gme you'll be saved. As long as you have diamond hands tho
2021-05-22 08:38:58,wallstreetbets,buy low sell high.
2021-05-22 08:53:43,wallstreetbets,Tesla is the toughest option play in the market.You have a whole lot of time left.Average down big time then buy some mid June puts to mitigate your losses.

2021-05-22 03:39:00,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, he‚Äôs bleed so much of the premium he paid to theta decay it would have to double so fast that the implied volatility also increases dramatically to make up for it.

2021-05-22 02:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks what do those other numbers mean?  Does the stock need to get $1035 for break even? What is equity and amount?

Edit: Downvotes to -4?  Sometimes yall disappoint me."
2021-05-22 09:48:41,wallstreetbets,I am also new to this but why would anyone buy so many call options when stock is all time high? Looks like he didn't even change it to debit spreads - that way he would have pocketed some premium and have lowered his breakeven too. Am I missing something there?
2021-05-22 05:58:49,wallstreetbets,thank you so much! so Tesla has to go over 1k for him just to break even? that is funny
2021-05-22 05:00:45,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are you talking about?

The OP doesn‚Äôt have to pay shit because he already did for the calls he bought. He paid $67,925 for the 5 calls expiring on July 16, 2021. The strike is $900 and he breaks even at $1.035.85 per share. He paid $13,585 for each of the 5 calls he bought.

Part of the issue is that people who have no clue what they are talking about need to shut the fuck up. Seriously."
2021-05-22 03:37:13,wallstreetbets,How much will he owe?
2021-05-22 13:27:38,wallstreetbets,If he says it 4.5 more times he will increase the number of times he's said it by 90%.
2021-05-22 03:40:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah I copy-pasted it so I could react to everyone who said he might recover
2021-05-22 15:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so 5 x100 shares (options on shares)   but whats with the 1.97 dollars?   Im not sure how to read that. X100 its not lining up with share value. Which is around 500.   This is probably the main part where it throws me off.


The entire thing to.me feels like it could be displayed far clearer like regular stocks are shown."
2021-05-22 10:41:49,wallstreetbets,Nah i never bet against a company.
2021-05-22 10:20:26,wallstreetbets,Listen to this guy. Seriously. Turn back now
2021-05-22 11:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So since OP has the right, but not the obligation to exercise those contracts, OP can just let the contracts expire and just lose the amount paid for the premium, right? Assuming, of course, that TSLA keeps going down."
2021-05-22 11:45:50,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
2021-05-22 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,Yikes. So would $1035.85 be the strike price?
2021-05-22 19:14:57,wallstreetbets,In that case you can double double down with another 140k to fix everything :)
2021-05-22 02:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I know, but what‚Äôs the expiration date have to do with it? That‚Äôs why I asked because it seems like if he had until then to pay it back or what?"
2021-05-22 11:31:27,wallstreetbets,A positive comment is better than the negative comments that could lead this poor guy to contemplate self harms. Be positive
2021-05-22 12:51:41,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-22 12:47:08,wallstreetbets,Hasn't this guy posted Tesla crazy bets before?? I smell a sadist lol

2021-05-22 09:47:33,wallstreetbets,I think the misconception is that more than $3000 can be written off. If that were true it could be worth the accountant fee. But it's not.

If your capital stays large its just a matter of time. Once you achieve 10% profit, YOLO 5% into options. Cut losses and let the winners ride. If it goes up 50% a day and you have 3 contracts, sell 1 to lock profits, and then the 2 can really start adding to your profits without the mental attachment."

2021-05-22 05:40:06,wallstreetbets,He might recover
2021-05-22 17:33:30,wallstreetbets,"They were worth 135.85 x 100 = 13,585. Every time you buy on options contract you have to multiply the cost by 100 because each contract is good for 100 shares. They are now worth 1.97 x 100 or 197. So he basically lost 66,940 on his contracts because of the time that has gone by and the price dropping."
2021-05-22 11:31:57,wallstreetbets,i don‚Äôt know why he would want to let it expire though since each contract will be worth 0.01 soon
2021-05-22 11:27:00,wallstreetbets,OP better hope that the stock price goes higher above the strike price by 7/16 or it‚Äôll expire worthless. i don‚Äôt know the strike price based on this but i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs something very high like $800 or $900 lol
2021-05-22 17:56:26,wallstreetbets,"No, that‚Äôs the price you‚Äôd need the stock to be at to start making a profit if you sold the shares obtained by exercising. The strike price is not visible in the screenshot."
2021-05-22 17:40:05,wallstreetbets,$900 is the strike price but the premium paid was $135.85. For calls the breakeven = strike price + premium.

2021-05-22 09:34:47,wallstreetbets,IRS allows and additional 3 k in losses regardless or classification annually. You would get to deduct 8K (5K in gains plus the additional 3K) and carry the additional 2k to the next year.

2021-05-22 06:39:05,wallstreetbets,"You would need 2k in the webull for it to be margin anyways I believe, so keep it a cash account. If you trade options on webull there is a small fee but your cash is ready the next day T+1 and stocks are T+2 on cash accounts. So it will be different from what you're used to on RH. Best thing about webull, you buy an options contract for the day, scalp it, sell it and the next day do it again. No PDT, just GFV, which means you can only do 1 trade a day with the cash you use.

Example: you have $100. You spend $50 on option, sell for $100, total is $150 but the $100 you made is T+1 so you can't trade with that money again. You still have $50 cash available to trade for that day.

Hope that helps"
2021-05-22 06:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Keep your RH for options and short term trading, 0 fees but shitty fills, and its margin. Webull has the best TA on mobile apps. Use that to make short plays for RH. Make your webull your long plays account and keep it a cash account instead of margin. It will take 5 days for deposits to clear but then you dont have to worry about PDT rule, just good faith violation/ free riding violations. 

I also recommend the webull paper trading weekly competition. Allows you to short sell and a great way to practice your stock day trading. I think 10 trade limits a day per stock on the competition. After every week you get real money towards a gift card after you save up over $2 in rewards.

Or use RH for long plays and webull for cash option t+1 plays, either way you can use both in tandem.

Hope this helps !"

2021-05-22 13:01:56,wallstreetbets,I do to.
2021-05-22 11:17:16,wallstreetbets,That's litteraly exactly how amortizing capital losses over $3000 works. You're obviously not financially literate enough to be playing in anything other than index funds if you don't understand this simple concept.
2021-05-22 10:00:15,wallstreetbets,THIS is correct.
2021-05-22 11:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Not a licensed CPA but did pass my exams so maybe I need a different profession but my understanding would be this. 

Example: Lets say you had 66K in capital losses trading Tesla options in 2019. In 2020 you do better and have capital gain income of 10K. In 2020 you would be allowed to offset 10K of capital gains by carry forwarding your losses but the IRS also allows you to deduct up to 3k (1,500 if single which if you're losing 70K a year maybe you are, or soon will be) of the loss carryforward and use it to offset agains ordinary income as well. In the example you would use 13K of the CF in 2020 and have another 53K CF going into 2021."

2021-05-22 14:44:39,wallstreetbets,CPA here. You‚Äôre flat out wrong.. if he‚Äôs got a 10k net loss in year one he has 7k to carry over. If he has 10k of net gains in year two then he uses the carryover loss of 7k to reduce that to 3k. Don‚Äôt give advice when you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
2021-05-22 14:33:44,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. That‚Äôs kinda what I had previously assumed but had never bothered to look into it... have mostly traded stocks up to this point and mostly held long enough and on decent enough companies that realizing a net loss for the year hasn‚Äôt been a problem yet.

And 

Redditors are morons with big opinions for 1200, Alex"
2021-05-22 12:24:25,wallstreetbets,"There is a way you could get on top purposely losing money, but I think wash sales prevent this for now.

Say in 2020, I had $1.5m in three places - Google, Apple, Tesla, $500k each.

In 2021, Google is worth $600k, Apple is worth $600k and Tesla is worth $400k. I know that it's time to sell Google, and Tesla would probably go up in the future and this is just a temporary slump. If I sold Google and held Tesla and Apple, I pay taxes on $100k of realized gains.

However, if I sold Google and Tesla, and rebought Tesla immediately (or something like Tesla with the same temporary slump rationale), I effectively made $0 this year and pay no taxes because my $100k loss offsets $100k gains.

I can move the $600k from Google into another promising stock. Basically, I now have $600k to play around + $1m in securities = $1.6m, up $100k from last year, yet paid 0 taxes (maybe some trading fees).

Rinse and repeat for 5 years with different securities, and now I have a position worth $2m in the best stocks possible right now (not Google, Tesla and Apple) and I paid a grand total of $0 in taxes for these capital gains.

It is scalable, which means I could have a position of, say $5m, by the time I die, and I can pass that onto my kids who receive a basis step-up. Which means if they sold it, it acts as if they bought all of that at $5m, not my original $1.5m.

It's a brilliant way to build up your position, avoid a fuck ton of taxes, AND leave your kids a nice inheritance."
2021-05-22 14:25:12,wallstreetbets,"I imagine you could do something like realize your losses on the last day of the year, then buy back in on the first trading day of the new year. Like if you have a proper diversified portfolio, realize all your losses, pay no tax on your income, then buy all those shares back the next day. If you are rich enough, you probably have enough losses in their somewhere to write off most of your paycheck income.




But really I have no idea. This is wsb, I'm not a tax lawyer, I just know that the IRS has a lot of bizarre convoluted rules to close loopholes rich people found."
2021-05-22 12:12:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  But it works when you have enough disposable income to make attempts at moonshots.  I mean, what in the actual fuck?  are people so fucking stupid that they dont get the benefit of that for a person that is independently wealthy?"

Do you have any advice for brokerages? I have been paper trading with thinkorswim for like 8 months.. then finally went to make an account with them to get real time data and start doing some small trades and they want $25000 to fund the account plus $10 per trade.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market Timing vs Pricing Hello apes! Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between ""market timing"" and ""pricing,"" and it was a bit of a holy shit moment.

Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up, and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they're actually worth, without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term.

They're both two sides of the same coin obviously - in both cases you're basically betting on a stock because you think it's going to go up, but the difference between the two is crucial.

When you're timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock. You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it's going to go up. If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30% after they buy it, they think, ""holy shit I made a mistake,"" potentially sell, and all sorts of bad things happen. Graham equates market timing to speculation, with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators (i.e. not good).

When someone is pricing, they don't worry too much about *why* the market is pricing a stock where it is. They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes, and for whatever reason this is one of those times. They also don't care about short term market fluctuations - they don't buy a stock because they think it's going to go up in any specific time frame, just because they think it's undervalued now, and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value. If a stock goes down 30% after they buy it they don't panic, and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more. As long as you've got time to wait, Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach.

The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock, *you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market's is wrong, even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses.* Having this conviction is not a question of your brain's computing power, but your temperament/emotional control, almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  

When reading the above, I think we all like to think we're pricers, not market timers. In practice, though, human nature being what it is, we're probably a lot closer to market timers than we'd like to admit. Pricing sounds easy on paper, but it's one of those things that's a lot harder to do in practice. A lot of people who have the brainpower to price a stock don't have the conviction/temperament to stick by their call in the face of market swings. The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can't or don't do it.

In any event, I have no actual point to this post, I just thought it was a really good insight. Go read his book!"

It‚Äôs a circlejerk on here about Apes standing together and taking down Melvin (fucking bravo, those assholes deserve it) but you don‚Äôt make change by insulting or degrading the person who makes less than you. That‚Äôs not taking down the giants. That‚Äôs just making people in equal or worse positions than you hate their lives. And to those who say ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt work for a shitty company‚Äù: 1) No one knew they were shitty before the GME removal. 2) It‚Äôs a minimum wage job in *customer service job in a* ***pandemic***.

In reality, all I had done was cancel an unprocessed transfer of funds into RH after they spontaneously restricted buying in late Jan. I'm sure they did not want to lose yet another customer and ignored literally 100s of emails I sent them.  Was finally able to transfer out, have never looked back.  Fuck RH."

However, I will say that I think it is absolutely ridiculous the best way to get a hold of them is by tweeting at them. That needs to change... 

But, I did. They DM'd back, we opened an email chain, they DM'd again saying I'm good to go and support will solve my issue through email. Emailed my issue through a secure portal which was my social security number was incorrect with them. Two emails and within 30 minutes everything was solved. 

I did not like the process to initiate contact. But it was a very smooth and easy process once the ball was rolling."

2021-05-22 11:00:40,wallstreetbets,"
This is a stupid question, but are there any active class action lawsuits against RH? I lost several hundred dollars last week between their glitchy UI and costumer service. They withdrew  1.2k from my checking account when they were supposed to take it from my RH balance. I bought shares before realizing what they had done and then they sold some of my positions without speaking to me in order to refund my checking account. I‚Äôve read similar stories online. 

Another time, they sold all of my position on one stock when I requested less than half of the shares to be sold. Their costumer service was very stern in this instance, basically saying I had no evidence. Now I screen record every transaction with them. 

I want out of RH but I don‚Äôt want to leave while I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôve been down since they openly conspired with Melvin and Citadel to shut down squeeze. 

There are other complaints I‚Äôve seen that seem to imply RH is operating beyond the boundaries of certain laws. 
 
I see posts about suing Citadel over the GME squeeze. It seems to me that RH is much more vulnerable than Citadel. As for me, I would just like to annihilate RH from my financial reality and the rest of the planet. Personally, I don‚Äôt like to be involved with lawsuits but I would certainly sign on to a class-action if it would A.) potentially bankrupt RH, B.) get me some of my money back w/o having to look at their stupid UI anymore."

2021-05-22 03:37:20,wallstreetbets,I'm going to be honest any platform works in the financial sector. You're not going to get a positive customer service ever. I've worked customer service and multiple industries I'm going to tell you they're going to give you the circle jerk as much as I can until you decide to quit. So when dealing with customer service that is when you need the diamond hands. Don't give up keep pushing when you do that is when you get the answers. Sorry I don't have stock choices or advice because guess what I invest in stocks that I like personally companies that have values and things I like and other things that I invested in a long time ago are now doing good bad and the other. All I can say is do you love you and when you lose because the way you invested that's you it's no one else remember that but only invest what you can lose in cash Don't take margin ever. Never do it. I saw the one post about a kid taking his life because of what he chose to do. Don't do it Don't risk more than when you're willing to lose. At the end of the day your life matters more than a dollar. Money does not make you. And that's coming from someone who is addicted to money I love it it's a great thing. I am a gambleholic and I love money and itself. Stock market is not new to me been doing it since I don't know 20 something years ago. But I've learned to read what is going on in society and the specialists and stock markets and celebrities on a 1% scale because they drive things in certain ways but it's usually an up then a drastic down. This is very long if you actually have time to read it I give you a high five. But seriously if you're investing money be smart I think twice and be careful and get out before it drops.

2021-05-22 03:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will waive the $75 depending on the account size transferred.

The margin thing is not a RH or a Fidelity (or any other brokers) issue.  It has to do with how margin accounts are generally handled and makes the transfer clear fastest.  (RH supposedly maintains ALL accounts as margin behind the scenes to facilitate their fractional trading.)

With Fidelity, an any account originating as a cash-based account should automatically revert after the settlement period (T+2)."

2021-05-22 10:01:47,wallstreetbets,"As I mentioned, my issue occurred shortly after they restricted the purchase of certain stocks, in my case GME, late January. There were restrictions still in place on purchases going into Feb, and I had long exceeded the number of total shares you were allowed to have.  The whole debacle is what prompted me to cancel the transfer of additional funds into RH since I wasn't going to be able to use them to purchase more GME.  If they've since added customer support via phone, good for them, but that certainly wasn't an option to me back then or I would have jumped at the opportunity to resolve it much faster than it took, I had all my funds and shares locked up in RH with nary a repsonse, meanwhile was afraid to transfer out with the level of volatility we've seen with GME, and probably couldn't transfer out anyway with my whole account locked up.  I called every number I could find for RH on Google, including one that was apparently a cell belonging to a poor woman who had to field all these random RH customer calls.  I spam emailed them literally hundreds of times in chunks and over the course of weeks just to try and get them to respond. I take full responsibility for not researching the quality of a broker before doing business with them, that's on me.  But I never expected what happened would have occurred, and I certainly did not expect that a company would not offer any phone support for issues like mine.  I believe at the time the only support they had was for problems with options.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Don't believe me? That tells me that even if you've been a long time customer of RH's, you must never have encountered the type of problem I had or you'd know it was completely true.  Lol - gotta love the internet."

Reputation doesn't mean only good. But imo most people that remember B&B and want a reboot probably want it to be similar to the original. (Trump has a reputation, for instance. Not necessarily a good one, but it's a reputation)

Ya know, because of the reputation the show has for being funny.

What was the point you wanted to make?"

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Tilray is slowly trying to take over Europe. 

As we know, on May 3rd, 2021, Tilray & Aphria Announce Closing of Transaction That Creates the [‚ÄúNew‚Äù](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005294/en/Tilray-Aphria-Announce-Closing-of-Transaction-That-Creates-the-%E2%80%9CNew%E2%80%9D-Tilray-%E2%80%93-a-Global-Cannabis-Leader) Tilray ‚Äì a Global Cannabis Leader

Rewind a bit..

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of ~~Aphria~~ Tilray, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face in creating desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; **we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe**. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through **CC Pharma**, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray‚Äôs operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**Who is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is based in Densborn, Germany and is one of the leading national distributors of pharmaceutical products to pharmacists in Germany, with over 13,000 pharmacies in its sales network that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

On Jan. 26th 2021, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group:

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

In Feburary, [Materia Deutschland](https://www.materia.global/press/materia-announces-strategic-portfolio-expansion/) entered into a commercial supply agreement with CC Pharma to distribute its high quality, Aphria-branded flower products across Materia Deutschland‚Äôs  pharmacy network throughout Germany. Under the terms of this agreement, CC Pharma will import and batch release the products, with Materia Deutschland taking responsibility for pharmacy sales and fulfillment.

>The addition of Aphria flower and dronabinol will bolster Materia Deutschland‚Äôs offering to customers and accelerate its growth potential in the German market. Materia has already commenced sales of dronabinol, while sales of Aphria-branded products to pharmacies will begin in the coming weeks.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

More recently, on May 13th 2021, Tilray annouced the closing of the Enniskillen medical cannabis facility:

>Tilray said as it merges operations with Leamington-based Aphira Inc., the company is **‚Äúmaking changes to optimize operational efficiencies.‚Äù** The company said it will concentrate local cultivation in Leamington, and local manufacturing in its nearby facility in [London](https://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2021/05/13/tilray-closing-enniskillen-medical-cannabis-facility/)

It is clear that the ‚Äònew‚Äô Tilray is prepping for aggressive European expansion. The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Tilray will be first is line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised for significant growth via European operations.

Recent interview with Irwin & Merton discussing the synergies between Aphria/Tilray:

Stay safe & GLTA!

Edit: Additionally, in early February, Tilray announced it has established an agreement with **Grow Pharma** to import and distribute Tilray‚Äôs medical cannabis products into the [United Kingdom](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209005404/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Announces-Agreement-with-Grow-Pharma-to-Import-and-Distribute-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-the-United-Kingdom). This agreement allows Tilray to provide authorized UK patients in need with a locally maintained supply of medical cannabis solutions.

>This partnership with Grow Pharma provides patients in need access to a sustained supply of GMP-certified, high-quality medical cannabis and is an important step in improving access in the UK. Tilray will continue to advocate for reasonable patient access to medical cannabis in Europe and countries around the world

*I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Tilray is poised for significant growth*"
2021-05-21 23:50:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs so odd that the largest group of liberal countries all on one continent still haven‚Äôt legalized it for recreational use. Side note: at least your life isn‚Äôt ruined if caught with it there.

Germany is not a huge market to be banking on for long term position with Tilray. I‚Äôd have an exit price ready 

IMO this company is not worth space in a portfolio when there are trading platforms that offer OTC US MSO such Curaleaf, Greenthumb Industries, Cresco Labs, Trulieve, Columbia Care, Jushi, Verano, Vireo, Valens Company, Marimed,  

Curaleaf is on pace to see over 1.3 Billion this year in revenue and that is not including New Jersey who May lift legalization sometime this year 

California, Colorado, Washington Each generate 2 Billion a year in revenue in California half of that goes back for taxes. It‚Äôs a cut throat business in the west"
2021-05-22 06:42:42,wallstreetbets,No mention that Columbia care has had an overseas contract for years or that curaleaf just made an acquisition to enter Europe?? Tilray is toast... the us MSOs are the way to go... maybe the only pure play ETF MSOS if you can‚Äôt buy OTC? tilray is clearly not the best investment in the space....
2021-05-22 09:49:05,wallstreetbets,"That same liberalism is an issue to legalization in the form of a sort of ""nanny state"", which, to be fair, could*** be actually an attempt to look out for citizens health as misguided as I think it is. For example, I went to Iceland, Norway and Sweden on a trip. Liquor stores were only open like 5 hours a day and straight up closed on certain days across the entire countries with little difference between the 3. Even something as simple as melatonin was impossible to get because apparently you need a prescription in those countries. It's a weird form of liberalism, I'm pretty left myself but holy shit, let people do what they want a little bit more and just have supports in place for people who need/want help."

The company struggled after shelving one of their main pipelines due to Covid but their newest project, Driftwood, is scheduled to begin construction this summer.

Commercial deals for phase 1 exports are being signed within the next few weeks, stock is expected to return to pre-covid $7 a share (or higher) from its current $2.60 a share."
2021-05-21 23:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Start with googling Charif Souki. He pioneered and created the US LNG export market when he built Cheniere. That company is now at $80 a share. Souki was pushed out of Cheniere by Carl Icahn because Souki wanted to keep expanding and reinvesting money into the business, whereas Carl Icahn wanted a dividend paying company. So Souki started his own company where he‚Äôd be in full control. Tellurian is on the verge of signing deals which will allow them to start construction on their LNG facility and associated pipelines. Tellurian will one day be bigger than Cheniere.

Im not bashing it, Im putting out the facts, My original purchse was for the long. I set stop losses on all my longs once I get in profit and I stoped out in JAN @ 3.05 from .87. I do agree about the potential on TELL but this is not a 1 or 2 year play this is 5+ for full potential.
Look at the insider trades, that will give you some  Perspective. 1 buy and 21 sells in the last 3 months.
Just my opinion and facts.
My advice to an inexperienced trader is always to set stop losses.
By the way this is how I make a living. I am an investor. I used to work for money now money works for me."

2021-05-22 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,"When they're supposed to announce partner deals in the next few weeks, why would you want to sit that out? Betchel is supposed to begin construction in Q12022.

The announcements should at least bring it back to the pre-Driftwood speculative price that was pre-COVID. 

Being that this will have some initial big moves and climb over 5+ years means I'll probably keep investing. Who needs VTI when in 5 years you can have 2,000%+.

Also, the sells you have seen have been very small and only come as the execs have acquired more stock. Makes sense if they need a little something to live off of if that's their compensation. Someone on the board recently also added another 100,000shares. Insider ownership is at 32% and institutional ownership is buying more and more. That's right, money that works for you is buyingggg it uppppp, sluts. It's being added to ETFs too. 

As for Total there's myriad of speculation and it is even hopeful in some scenarios they drop out. 

Not worried. Thanks for the blessing üöÄ"

2021-05-22 18:24:29,wallstreetbets,"To answer your question why I want to sit that out:
I dont but Im greedy and I like it better closer to $2.
Ive also 3x the capital I pulled out in jan so it gives me more buying power when I close out the positions I put the capital into.
 Insider trades last 3 months:
Buys  1  100,000
Sells  21 7,926,908
Those are not small.
You didnt touch on the shorting either. 
Like I said Im an investor and these are facts not hope, wishing or my opinion.
Opinion section:
This will get cheaper IMO, when that happens I will start a position. Im looking forward to the run I just don't believe it's going to happen anytime soon.
You will make good money on the long.
Im going continue to RIP SOME FACES OFF where Im at, then Ill be over to join the party."

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVidia is a good buy right now In September, NVidia released the RTX 3000 series. They are the first cards in a long time to have almost double the performance/price of its predecessor. Demand has been extreme, they sell out immediately when they're available and cost 3-4x retail in used markets. Even though their cards are the strongest ray tracing cards in the market, their stock price hasn't moved since they released.

In the short term, there is a worldwide silicon shortage. NVidia needs to at least fulfill enough demand to meet earnings expectations. Since AMD, which is outperformed in ray tracing, killed earnings this quarter, NVidia will too.

In the long term, it will be open season for huge revenues from RTX 3000 sales as long as a superior line of GPUs doesn't release before the silicon shortage is dealt with.

If NVDA fulfills this huge GPU demand in the future, then their current price is a bargain."
2021-05-21 22:45:05,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt fuckin believe anything I see in this shit anymore
2021-05-21 22:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Amd is selling out all their cards as well. The gap between nvidia and amd performance wise has been getting smaller with the last 2 generations. 

Amd has also been gaining market share with their CPUs.

Nvidia may be a good buy, but so should AMD, ps5 and XSX aren‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon."

2021-05-22 10:45:22,wallstreetbets,I was just reading they proposed a 4-1 stock split also
2021-05-22 12:16:30,wallstreetbets,NVDA will be a great buy during the post-earnings dip. Get in just before the split and just after profit taking.

2021-05-22 03:12:04,wallstreetbets,"Obviously dip, smooth brain"
2021-05-22 04:34:32,wallstreetbets,Typically goes up. More retail traders can afford the shares after a split.
2021-05-21 23:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Its a common occurrence that stocks increase prior to the split, as once they do split there is an increase in interest due to lower price."
2021-05-21 23:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Same here, tho it makes me feel bad for those who lose money joining late.

I started to realize that every time I see some dd on this sub, I'm too late and I already missed the gains, so I just buy puts and wait for the early gainers to dumps their bags."
2021-05-22 11:43:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao yes SAME! Seems when shi is so called about to moon we throw a put and we Rocket (;
2021-05-21 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Well all I was trying to say is NVDA may look enticing but their main competitor deserves a hard look at before taking a position
2021-05-21 23:28:37,wallstreetbets,Apple was up 30% in a month after announcing split (along with a good earnings)
2021-05-21 22:54:14,wallstreetbets,"That's true, I hated that damn split. I now hate Apple hahaha"
2021-05-21 23:05:17,wallstreetbets,What is with that

2021-05-22 00:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Yup it's either that or most.of.the time they bag has holding and trying to influence the market, which is totally doable with 10million people on the sub"
2021-05-22 11:53:19,wallstreetbets,Just add th3 stocks everyone talks about to you watchlist and keep an eye on them. You don't have to makena move on everything people say whether you believe them or not. It's usually better to have more options to choose from while looking for good opportunities to trade
2021-05-22 02:13:08,wallstreetbets,"I agree, AMD killed it this quarter, yet they‚Äôre 25% below ATH. NVDA is almost at the top, so I‚Äôd argue AMD is the better buy if you had to pick one. I have positions in both."
2021-05-22 13:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I think they are both good companies.  There isnt even a third alternative in their competing market which continues to grow, and nvidia has its AI division while AMD has its (awesome) processor division"
2021-05-21 23:56:21,wallstreetbets,That trial they have going on is going to hurt them. Cramer was defending Apples 30% cut today. Me: do 15% and settle out of court. Boom!
2021-05-21 23:08:16,wallstreetbets,Apple is just REALLY good at taking your money and getting you to buy things that depreciate like Italian cars.

2021-05-22 11:23:12,wallstreetbets,When the lenders who gave the hedges funds there share to short they cant borrow them forever.. So basically when the lenders ask for them back the shares will return to the market and the price will skyrocket...when you take a short position you want to borrow the stock at the highest price possible in order to get the best return when it hits bottom.. That means the hedge funds borrowed the stocks highest price.. Also some how they shorted more shares then even exist.. This happened by person A who borrowed them allowed person B to borrow them from him.. How the SEC let thia happen idk but D-day for GME is going to be crazy just try to make sure you own a few shares.. If you still dont get it idk fo back to school then
2021-05-22 12:12:43,wallstreetbets,i swear to god trying to keep my average low has fucked me over more times than my uncle

2021-05-22 19:28:51,wallstreetbets,The biggest clue that the squeeze isn‚Äôt over is that GME is trading at 175$ SIX MONTHS after the initial squeeze. If that‚Äôs not enough to convince you there‚Äôs some shady shit going on then I don‚Äôt know what is.

You are the opposite of safe. You are in the highest risk category. You're floating maximum risk betting that a meme stock will do something amazing, which isn't guaranteed."

Sure, I think it can stay strong if the company does well and turns things around, but I'm just not seeing any evidence of another squeeze.

If anyone has links to resources that disprove me I'm happy to reconsider."

2021-05-21 22:45:03,wallstreetbets,"It's not awesome to revert the diversity so much. Bad, bad move. If you're already up you should at least do some profit taking as a hedge since you don't have any other hedge.

And people won't like the comment because they'll say but for the squeeze... But lots of them are upside down so of course they will say to keep buying and not diversify. That will help drive the price up for them more than you if they're upside down and you're not.

I hope the squeeze happens, I really do. But people need to be smart about it, not greedy and much less gambling."

2021-05-22 00:11:28,wallstreetbets,At least it's shares and not options. Short interest isn't high enough for a real squeeze so the best you can hope for is another retail circle jerk driving up the price up long enough for you to jump out with profit when no one is looking.
2021-05-22 01:39:16,wallstreetbets,"I learned a long time ago getting more than one complicates things. Was once in a 3 way, was going all right until I got poked in the butt..."

2021-05-21 23:28:07,wallstreetbets,You can diversify by buying GME call options
2021-05-21 23:41:37,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs stuff like this that makes me thankful my father owns buildings and his money is tied up there instead of stocks.  Without a doubt one day he would totally do something crazy like this.

Ultimately I now only own GME because I‚Äôve done a lot of research about it and see it as a long term investment with the potential of a short term squeeze. I just do not see the long term in AMC, especially with COVID. I trust Ryan Cohen and his vision for GME. The gaming and online industry has a lot of potential in the future and GME could become a main player. In my opinion, this makes GME a stock with value. Not financial advise."

2021-05-22 00:19:51,wallstreetbets,"AMC is inferior to GME in both squeeze potential and as a recovering business. GME has always been more shorted and will squeeze harder. GME also has the potential to remodel and become the Amazon of gaming. While I want AMC to survive, it does not have much of an option to expand or remodel from brick and mortar.

2021-05-22 16:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Risk of it returning to where it was? Like $10-$15? That's seriously not happening.

We own the float, probably many times over. The DTCC is passing new rules to cover their asses. Citadel is doing everything in their power to control the ascent but how long before they become insolvent? Shorters are losing ten of millions as the price slowly creeps upward and then, bam, it's going to skyrocket as they scramble to cover their positions all at once. The short squeeze will last for several days, if not longer.

Ryan Cohen becoming the chairman is another matter. He's tenacious, he's sexy, and he's here to take charge."
2021-05-22 08:23:11,wallstreetbets,Absolutely real. I'm probably as risk adverse as it gets and have bailed on stocks in the past from being unable to stomach losses. This is the first time in my life I've ever been so informed and calm about an investment and have been in since mid Jan through the up and downs. We own all the stock that is available more than once over at least and can hold forever. Cohen going to turn this into an Amazon long term

2021-05-22 09:33:59,wallstreetbets,"To put it bluntly. Nothing anyone says here will give you that confirmation bias to put it all into GME.

You should go and read DDs and judge for yourself. That and time to understand it."
2021-05-22 08:52:04,wallstreetbets,Read some dd. Then you will understand why.
2021-05-22 18:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Ok my numbers are bad but here‚Äôs what I remember: 13F‚Äôs of institutional and insider share positions for GME were recently released. The number of shares NOT owned by these people was about a measly 136k. DFV himself has 200k, meaning that 64k of his shares are synthetic naked shorts, and every single other share out on the market is a naked short. Now when these bastards get margin called or force liquidated, they have to cover their naked shorts WHICH WE OWN. So if you HAVE to buy something that I own, I‚Äôm in control of the price. That‚Äôs the logic behind this, and why it will be the mother of all short squeezes. As always, do your own DD, not financial advice, but I‚Äôm buying and holding every paycheck"
2021-05-22 13:21:18,wallstreetbets,"To quickly summarise the DD for you, because there‚Äôs so many and it becomes a mess of conspiracy theories in the later ones;

All shorts must cover - the maths behind the numbers says there‚Äôs 0% chance they covered in Jan, the Melvin ceo admitted it didn‚Äôt squeeze in jan, the % of the total float available to trade(non-institution or insider) is quite low(I think around 20m?), and the most conservative estimates of retail ownership have it around 50m, with higher estimates going closer to 200-300mill. It can sound ridiculous, that‚Äôs because everything about the situation is. But the maths doesn‚Äôt lie, and the shorts must cover

As to returning where it was - Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy is the new chair of the board and has replaced almost the entire board with staff from ex-Amazon and Chewy with incredible resume‚Äôs in e-commerce and transformation, the business cleared its short term debts several years early and is sat on reserves of 500mill, most recently they‚Äôve just re-opened sales to the EU, as part of their e-commerce transition. Bankruptcy doesn‚Äôt look to be an option"
2021-05-22 08:08:45,wallstreetbets,We looked.

2021-05-22 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,I am in there with you. If it were a stock going to cover the world then hang. But it‚Äôs not. Just a fade to my notion.

2021-05-22 08:04:23,wallstreetbets,This. I‚Äôve been quite a logical and diversified investor until GME. Sold everything to buy more bc like you said the prices are inflated and we‚Äôre due for a recession anyway. Congrats OP
2021-05-22 00:06:01,wallstreetbets,Came to the same conclusion. Gave a lot of thought to where to park my savings. GME was the most obvious option.

2021-05-21 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,"How can GME be the only stock you feel comfortable owning when there are so many companies within many sectors to choose from? Even if there is a pullback, recoveries are historically brisk if you hold."
2021-05-22 00:24:17,wallstreetbets,No offense but you don‚Äôt think GME is inflated? Lol
2021-05-22 10:59:55,wallstreetbets,"One of the things that recently I‚Äôve been thinking about is the timing of the marketwatch/business insider articles regarding RC and how he was only (at the time) holding two stocks (AAPL, WFC) and even said if Apple went down enough he‚Äôd go all in. 

This is also around the time he announced his GME investment"
2021-05-22 07:13:27,wallstreetbets,"How on earth do you think there‚Äôs no better stock to own then GME? I get wanting to have a position, but to literally see no other viable option to own is pure insanity dude."
2021-05-22 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,You think the rest of the market is over inflated but *not* GME?
2021-05-22 08:05:17,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve never thought about it logically like that. Who the eff has a bunch of baskets they bring when going to collect eggs. You bring one basket and put all your eggs in it.

2021-05-22 09:55:38,wallstreetbets,What is DD?
2021-05-22 14:53:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the kind explaination
2021-05-22 17:57:38,wallstreetbets,so a company like amazon (who now doesn‚Äôt even stand by 2 day deliveries and so many issues with imposter products) is worth what it is. but a company who is in the middle of a change to e-commerce and during that change can offer same day - 2 day delivery depending on location on all products not just companies who pay to be there.  who has been expanding their warehousing.  is not even a fraction of the market cap.  my god i really love that the people who say GME is going to fade or has already covered can‚Äôt even back up with facts.  You may choose to be ignorant to the facts but please for the love of god learn something before you go and spout nonsense.
2021-05-21 23:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I hope your investments are going well, wish you all the best for the future too!"

2021-05-22 12:00:45,wallstreetbets,I've yet to meet someone who's read the DD and doesn't like the stock. You should try it sometime.
2021-05-22 04:10:02,wallstreetbets,"I walked away with 20% gains at 181. Call me a paper hand if you want but 20% gain over a few weeks is fine with me. Even if it goes up to 200+ again I‚Äôm still happy with a win. Everyone‚Äôs rolling the dice and rebuying when it just as well could drop back down below 150 again. Could go to the moon at 400+ but it‚Äôs pretty unlikely. 

Then again this is WSB so I know everyone here is gonna say moon or bust haha."
2021-05-21 23:39:34,wallstreetbets,The amount of DD available on GME is not comparable to any other stock. The momentum does not only help GME as a stock but the business as well. The market is very uncertain which is my I sold my other shares. I only own GME because it does not only have long term value which means if the market goes down it will most likely go back up after the market recovers but also has the potential to short squeeze and after reading a lot of DD it could go the opposite way in a market correction/ up instead of down and I think that is very promising.
2021-05-22 00:27:03,wallstreetbets,Cray how how such unoffensive conservative financial opinions like this get downvoted to hell in this sub hhahahah

2021-05-22 15:19:27,wallstreetbets,Well that's dumb. I haven't seen that happen.
2021-05-22 09:32:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes but GME is different. We aren't talking about a minor increase like 10% extra shares.

It would not surprise me in the slightest if the float is vastly, and I mean VASTLY, higher than what is out there. You can't trim that. And if they do it will be painfully obvious.

GME is the worst kept secret right now."
2021-05-22 17:48:47,wallstreetbets,Then why don‚Äôt u?
2021-05-22 15:42:11,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm not. You have no idea what you're talking about and the things you're saying are laughably stupid."

2021-05-22 12:29:59,wallstreetbets,You mean that‚Äôs not a logical decision? I must be retarded. But really tho it‚Äôs a safer bet given that the entities shorting it are long on a lot of the S&P500

2021-05-22 16:18:44,wallstreetbets,Well if one stock went up that fast that probably means the whole market is over inflated. But the same principle definitely *does not* apply to GME which is up 1000% on the year.

It's just taking a lot longer to happen because of all the diamond hands. All the due diligence actually shows to put a very long short position & ride the wave down slowly with multiple exits. However even that is too risky as this event has never happened before & one can never be sure when an ape will sell. Either way - it's not going up & probably not going down.

A better play would be for everyone to move to a better stock, but there is no leader. Those guys already cashed out on these apes & moved on. So these apes are all bagholding for each other. What started out an amazing idea had generated into loss porn."

You get 1 karma for every $ you lose. 20% in a few weeks is a great return and anyone with any sense knows that. Thinking about it surely they should be happy you sold so they can buy up more GME. That argument might be a bit too logical though.

 Probably down voting because they yoloed into the hype at the peak and are stuck with unrealised losses that they know theyre very unlikely to claw back."

2021-05-22 15:06:06,wallstreetbets,We haven‚Äôt had a correction. We‚Äôre printing money to buy collateral to artificially lower interest rates. Short positions are being funded with rehypothicated bonds. We have negative interest rates because collateral is more valuable than the dollar. You see inflation in the stock market and in component goods before you see it in the retail markets.
2021-05-22 00:19:25,wallstreetbets,I hear ya. But there has never been an opportunity like this with the amount of exposure for any stock in the history of history. I tend to agree with you wholeheartedly until this GME anomaly happened. This is the exception to where for one time and one time only it might be wise to put all your eggs in this one basket.

2021-05-21 20:04:42,wallstreetbets,"True, but OTM is where lambos are funded as 10K stretches a lot further so you own many more options.

OTM is also the place where savings can be destroyed.

With 10K I could buy roughly 50 calls for Sept @6, or I could buy 660  $20 calls.  If it rockets up to $25, the $6 calls would be worth $50 x19x100 =95,000, but the $20 calls would be worth $330,000.

Granted, I don't think that far out of the money is realistic for UWMC by September, but it's a higher torque bet, with a lambo payoff.  But, I could be wrong and have left lambo money on the table.  It takes cojones to make a bet that far OTM, and I applaud that, sorry to OP that it didn't work out.

# BULLS v BEARS - Who's in control?

* Essentially been consolidating since 5/11 (even longer if you zoom out - about 4/6 ish range)
* Short term - we've made higher low but not a higher high. We've made a lower high.
* This highlights uncertainty IMO. (iNfLaTiOn AnYoNe?)
* **410 break is still the line in the sand IMO.**
* **415 and above and market favors bulls IMO.**
* **410 and below and marker favors bears IMO.**

# 1D Timeframe

* We've hit heavy resistance at the gap fill - two full days with resistance @ gap fill.
* **IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!**

Made good money this week with my two $407 SPY calls. I was nervous SPY was going to fall straight back down today. Glad SPY stayed strong and my calls were in the money after market closed today. I'm not sure where the market is going to be headed next week. Since there is still fear of inflation, I think we might have a small bearish market next week. If that is the case, I might buy some puts. Thank you SPY for making my two calls in the money this week"

2021-05-21 22:45:58,wallstreetbets,I do know this dude is much better at TA then me but seems like from a psychological standpoint the bulls pushed this baby up 3 times without breaking above that resistance of 418. Bulls went up to 417.45 then a little dip then up again to 417.55 then there was the big rundown to 405.33. Then back up to 418.20 which we saw today. Has to be exhausting to try Try try and not win. I‚Äôm on the side of seeing 400. Then a big time upward trend.

2021-05-21 23:08:00,wallstreetbets,">IMO. We see 420+ or 405- next week. A higher-high or a lower-low! But let's see!

Is this your DD? We have already seen $420+ on the 1st week of this month and $405- during the 2nd week. Next week has 5 trading days and considering todays closing price of $515, it's a 1.02% uptrend to cross $420 or 2.41% downtrend. A fluctuation of 1-2.5% in 5 trading days is very normal for SPY and you do not need to eat crayon to say that.

You say W shape? There is no W shape in that chart. If you forcefully try to make a flat line between 14th, 17th and 18th to a point, it doesn't become a point!

>Current support at 60 SMMA   
>  
>Current resistance at 20 SMMA

This is idiotic at best. Do you even understand what a moving average filter is? The resulting value is moving along time. How can a moving point be either support or resistance? 

You say if the SP is above X price it's bullish and if it's below Y price it's bearish. There are bull call support and bear put support bla bla bla. Did you looks at the OI and volume of SPY contracts for the last month? It has always been on the bearish side yet SPY move upward. 

Give it up TA does not work. Do not get confused and make other's confused trying to be smarter. Instead of saying SPY can vary 2.5% in next 5 trading days clearly say what will be the price on Monday at open, at midday and at close. If you can't say that that admit TA doesn't work."

A moving average can also act as support or resistance. In an uptrend, a 50-day, 100-day or 200-day moving average may act as a support level, as shown in the figure below. This is because the average acts like a floor (support), so the price bounces up off of it. In a downtrend, a moving average may act as resistance; like a ceiling, the price hits the level and then starts to drop again.‚Äù"

2021-05-21 22:53:15,wallstreetbets,I'll definitely be keeping an eye on it but imo this current range is the scariest to play.

2021-05-21 23:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Read what you just copied from the investopedia website again.

**Can** act as support **or** resistance

a **50-day**, **100-day**, **200-day**, MA act as a support. Tell me which one to use when? Nobody can tell you.

Open your tool and then open 1 year SPY chart then plot 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MA and tell me what you see. Let me tell you what you will see-

200-day MA is never being touched in last 9 months

100-day MA was touched twice and it dipped below that line once out of two times which means 50% probability.

50-day MA was touched 7 times and dipped below that line 3 times which means 42.8% times it did not bounced.

Now open the AMZN and do all over again. What you see? It almost never works. Instead of sharing that investopedia link if you could try to understand what a moving average is you would know why SP is above that line in a uptrend or below that line in a downtrend. It's not due to how stock market works, neither it's some TA magic. It's the definition of moving average itself.

Look at other tickers as well you will see that claim fails miserably most times. Sometimes it might align with your claim but that's not due to some TA magic rather the nature of random number. You know coin flip!

Large open interest & volume on the June 18 expiration date, any reason why there's x10 times the normal open interest on the options expiring June 18? over 15M shares to cover options in the money as of today

GOLD is a good value company, with over 12B in revenue in 2020 & market cap is only 3.5x last year's revenue. Over 2B/yr in earnings the last 2 years & 5B in cash. Most of the business is in Gold mining 20% is in copper. Commodity prices keep climbing higher, so it's a good hedge for inflation.

For full disclosure I own several calls at the $20, $22, $23  expiring in June-Sept as well as shares of GOLD for the long to medium term. I'm no financial advisor and I'm likely wrong.

The stock has been seeing some resistance at $25 lately, but if the price of gold per ounce ($1881 currently) crosses the $1890... June is going to be a very good month for Barrick Gold. It's a quality company in my opinion & the market is at a tipping point, so it's a good safety net (maybe...)

$29 by end of summer? Would love to hear your thoughts

2021-05-21 22:11:04,wallstreetbets,"I love Barrick Gold...   I bought in at 21ish for 400 shares,  may buy another 600 to round it out.

31 is the high for the year.  It's bubbling just below 25.   If it breaks to the high, that's a decent upside considering that gold is 10ish% below it's ATH.

and if gold blasts past the ATH,  barricks shares should see multiples as it's AISC per oz is very low for the industry."
2021-05-21 20:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I have a small position at $22 average, I agree that gold is finally making progress after months of pullback.  Will take time though, gold is kind of a slow moving commodity ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"
2021-05-21 21:00:05,wallstreetbets,Gold is breaking out of a huge setup. I made a post about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ng99i7/gc_gldiaugold_ta_breaking_a_10_year_old_pattern/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
2021-05-22 01:57:17,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in and imo 30 USD in June will be very realistic if gold passes 1950 again (and it will!)
2021-05-22 02:24:00,wallstreetbets,I'd be more interested in July calls after the Basel 3 implementation.
2021-05-21 21:48:11,wallstreetbets,Just buy GLD etf for less risk.
2021-05-22 03:48:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with the general thesis, but it's worth calling out that 3.5x revenue for GOLD is very rich already... You don't do revenue multipliers unless there's a reason like projected income and growth many years out"
2021-05-21 22:04:43,wallstreetbets,Miners tend to go up 2-3% for every 1% movement in gold
2021-05-22 00:59:37,wallstreetbets,"That's true, but the risk & volatility are higher... it's not a prediction, more like strange options volume that I can't explain for such large cap company"
2021-05-21 20:57:49,wallstreetbets,"I have been in Barrick for years, haven't seen that much options volume difference in the past... something feels different"
2021-05-21 20:51:36,wallstreetbets,"I agree, it's very slow moving"
2021-05-22 10:35:12,wallstreetbets,">Barrick Gold

Gold certainly looking positive and quality gold mine stocks should follow the upward trend."

2021-05-21 23:25:28,wallstreetbets,Not everyone will be able to sell at the top. The goal of course is to see how high it will go first before selling. Many people claim they will never sell some shares. Should be a ride down where everyone can have their tendies and eat some too.

2021-05-21 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,I believe there would be some cooling down to 374 if the market slows next week but I don‚Äôt mind because if we go into earnings at 376 and blow it off the roof it will easily go to 390 on earnings day then creep above $400 in the days following that next week. I plan to sell half at $405 on tuesday or so and then the rest Thursday regardless of the price hopefully $412+
2021-05-21 23:27:34,wallstreetbets,It is 93% of my account and less than 2 weeks away based on earnings and only calls not even a spread so it is a yolo I could lose 93% of my account in less than a month that surely is a yolo brotha just a smarter one than OTM FDs

So, after reading my TA, what we saying? All in or no? Look, just give it to me straight no chaser. Is this a bad idea, because I've already done it. Now I'm wondering, do I double down or triple down? It gained like 1000% in 3 years since 2017. Now we've had a 60% correction...c'mon surely this has gotta be the play of the fucking century. My uncertainty really stems from the fact that...im a retard, the stock is still going down, so does everyone else know something I dont?

Before anyone asks, no, I know nothing about what Alteryx does, dont ask me about a balance sheet, I only learned what that was 2 days ago, and Im not fucking looking so dont tell me any of that. Quite simply, the blue line is down and I want a lambo. Does this sound good?

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Easy 10% Upside on LendingTree ($TREE)? After Northland Securities upgraded LendingTree‚Äôs price target to $225 (approx. 9.5% upside), I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT. 

# Company Overview

   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then

# Industry Overview and Outlook

* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt
* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs
   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending
* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales
   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017
* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006

# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace

LendingTree‚Äôs competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.

* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates
* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world
* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest
   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively
   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409

# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth

* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Refer to chart ‚ÄòSegment Revenue‚Äô
   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage
   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020
* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products 
   * QuoteWizard ‚Äì one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market
      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category
      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition 
   * ValuePenguin ‚Äì personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards
      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability ‚Äì allowing them further scale in the insurance space
* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020
   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment 

# Major Risks 

**Consumer Demand Risk ‚Äì** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree‚Äôs mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position

**Interest Rate Risk ‚Äì** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates

# Final Thoughts

The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts‚Äô recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I‚Äôve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.

2021-05-22 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Completely false. Correction, YOU don't have a fucking clue, but you can help yourself by dropping macd. Those who are rich from trading and make 100k-millions a year beg to differ.. Real trader is hardly anyone on this sub. People here are just gamblers. People who make a living or are rich from trading rarely use things like RSI and MACD, for good reason. MACD is a shitty lagging indicator that all noobs flock to and lose money trying to use.

&#x200B;

Good technical analysis is done with candlesticks, volume, price action, EMAs, and resistance/support lines. Knowing how to use that and training your brain to patterns will yield you the most successful results.

&#x200B;

Trading is like poker, calculated gambling where you need to know when to fold, and get in at the perfect time. If you waste time with MACD, you simply lower your odds.  That's all I have time to explain to you.

&#x200B;

Look up some material if you really want to know. endless reading material out there. Anna Couling's ""Volume Price Analysis"". A long time professional trader that never mentions shitty things like RSI, MACD"

2021-05-22 08:45:09,wallstreetbets,"If you search for patterns and draw lines in a way that makes the chart look good to you, it gives you confidence and helps you sleep better at night while your wife fucks her boyfriend.

Seriously, there are established patterns that stocks make (bull flag, bear flag, cup and handle etc) that can help. It can also be helpful to try to figure out the lower and higher resistance levels. This can help you figure out good buy in points or points where you should sell to mitigate loss (if you're a paper handed bitch of course). You can also look at volume, market cap, inflow and outflow of orders, look at the level 2 books to see bid and ask orders, and there's the various technical indicators like MACD, VWAP, RSI, etc which can help a bit too, but all any of this does is give you a more educated guess about how a stock will perform. If there was some formula that could accurately predict a stock's performance, we'd all be rich af. A time machine would also be very useful.

Me personally though, I just wake up before the market opens, do a line of coke off my own dick, take a slug of whiskey from the bottle I keep under my pillow, then buy large amounts of whatever this sub is recommending. Then I just sit watching the stocks move, eating crayons, and as I plunge deep into the red, I just remind myself that I have diamond hands and it's not a loss if you don't sell. This is not financial advice and results may vary."
2021-05-22 14:49:40,wallstreetbets,"a ""real"" indicator is your brain function which most people on this sub lack.

&#x200B;

Volume+ Price action relations. Knowing your candlesticks. Being able to spot resistance/support levels, trendlines, drawing them. Patterns that you learn by practice and losing over and over until you study your mistakes and learn from them...

Read ""Volume price analysis"" by Anna couling, that's a good start."

2021-05-22 08:33:39,wallstreetbets,Uhh price climb was after the offering was sold because company had no more debt which was the only reason to be short. Price stayed sideways the whole time they sold and didn't go down at all.

I am a swing trader, switching between SQQQ and TQQQ, **well aware of the facts behind TQQQ**. Recently, I bought TQQQ (for 6 figures) at $80 and sold it around $108.

Now, we are in peak stock cycle, better to own SQQQ than TQQQ as I expect TQQQ to go down to $45-$50 range within 45 days."

2021-05-22 12:49:33,wallstreetbets,"The 150% will become 25% in 45 days. You won't believe this, That is why I said Fate !  

I did extensive research on TQQQ & SQQQ and finally came to that conclusion very few companies beat TQQQ in the long run. 

For example, only one company beat the TQQQ last 10 years, it is not AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, but TSLA beat it. It is very rare for companies beat TQQQ during bullish run. Last Mar 23, 2020 was lowest for Market, but still very few companies beat TQQQ (as given below) [https://imgur.com/xqssSfD](https://imgur.com/xqssSfD)

However, there is a major drop is coming within 45 days which may result 50% drop in TQQQ. Wise will remove Sell cash and wait for sidelines until you see TQQQ in blood bath!

Any way, I understand you will not change until you see the reality. **At that time, do not hate TQQQ,** it is your destiny decides now!

Just made a calculaton: FAANG is 6328 Bln. If TQQQ appreciates at 53% and you hold 35 years to beat FAANG, you need minimum $217303 by now.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say."

I thought NFLX was going down to $490 range and stay down but NFLX was resting the $500 range all day today. Didn't want to risk losing out on my puts if NFLX shoots straight up again. If the bears have not left next week, I might buy more puts again"

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. 

I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

In the morning I went to meet up with the same group of friends for breakfast.  When I walked in they were calling me Dick Ripper.  Made no sense to me. 

My friend explained:

""Last night you tackled [Friend] into a grill and the side tray hit his dick and cut it halfway off.  He had to go get 7 stitches to put his weiner back on.  You just left and we had to call an ambulance.  He's still in the hospital.""

2021-05-21 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here‚Äôs what I mean: I‚Äôd bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill‚Äîthere are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can‚Äôt even really explain how‚Äîthey just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn‚Äôt help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don‚Äôt like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

2021-05-22 19:50:11,wallstreetbets,"

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky ****/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering ****/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own ****blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Guys, DON'T SHAVE YOUR BUTT-HAIR!"

2021-05-22 09:02:08,wallstreetbets,"Basic rule is: just be a good person. It‚Äôs often that easy. 

We often don‚Äôt listen to people speak; instead, we are thinking about what we are going to say while they are speaking. Don‚Äôt do this. Actually listen and pay attention; people can tell. Ask for more details when appropriate, as it often shows that you‚Äôre invested in whatever they are talking about. 

Don‚Äôt overshare. If you start talking about a topic and find your date isn‚Äôt interested, talk about something else. Do they show interest? Keep going. Let their reactions and emotions guide you. 

Give them time to speak, and focus on any mutual interests you have.

I know this all sounds very obvious, but most people don‚Äôt follow it. Also remember that dating is a numbers game. If you don‚Äôt get along, just move on. 

Also, while physical appearance is important, it‚Äôs not as important as you‚Äôd think. A good chunk of spouses didn‚Äôt find their partner physically attractive until a few dates in because attraction will grow with emotional attachment.  So don‚Äôt feel too self conscious while, at the same time, don‚Äôt dismiss someone you may share interests with just because you don‚Äôt find them attractive at first."

Do some DD and find them on the web and social media.  Discussions are a lot easier when you know what interests them.  

If the date goes stale and no connection or communication just whip it out."

There was demand for the stock (and your contracts) because of the test flight. the test flight itself is irrelevant. the price will dip even with a sucessful flight. I hope it goes well for you or at least the price stays flat so you can exit with profit.

2021-05-22 14:09:27,wallstreetbets,Eh im not so sure. Space is hard. The expectation always leans towards failure or at the very least weather delay or cancellation of the flight. A successful flight is very big news. If theres significant media coverage of the successful tests this thing could pop hard. Space tourism is the kind of thing the average person gets a real boner for.

3)  Couple of years ago,  They literally Buy homes at market value and do repairs/updates.    Then I come in after they have sat in market for months and I lowball their ass.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SNDL vs TLRY, comment your favorite While SNDL‚Äôs market cap is only about a fifth of TLRY, it has more cash than Tilray on its balance sheet. In its earnings release, SNDL said that as of May 7, it had $752 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.


Now, there are two narratives if you are interested in buying SNDL stock. First is the bullish one that points to the ample cash on its balance sheet. SNDL is becoming like the Berkshire Hathaway of the marijuana industry. The company is investing and lending to several smaller marijuana companies. Also, it could expand into the U.S. adult-use market.


As for TLRY, it looks like a good marijuana company to buy from a business perspective. The company is a marijuana powerhouse with international operations and both medical and adult-use businesses. Also, count on the post-merger synergies and economies of scale to work for the new TLRY.



To sum it up, from a purely business perspective, you will bet on TLRY. However, if you are looking at betting on an investment vehicle that can capitalize on the troubles of some of the smaller marijuana companies, SNDL will fit the bill."

Canopy is of better quality, but I did this research when I bought last year. 
The issue is the US grows on a much smaller scale so we get much better quality and higher THC. East coast ever smaller grows, so even better quality especially with micro-grows.

Quite frankly the stock market isn‚Äôt built for the type of gain we would‚Äôve seen had they not shut it down so I see why they did it (as unfair and stupid as it was). After that the retarded apes running the hedge funds shorted the shorts on GME (a term called naked shorting since you‚Äôre autistic as hell). And now we wait for 1 of three possibilities: 
1. Naked shorts get margin called
2. On 6/8 GME turns over awesome earnings and then the following day (6/9 since you‚Äôre retarded) at the board meeting the board announces a share recall to boost their treasury. 
3. Apes keep buying and holding until some other catalyst comes along. 

All it takes is for something to happen that causes all of the short and naked short positions to be unwound. You wanna talk to me about fundamentals I‚Äôd recommend two things:

1. Become a licensed financial advisor (pass your SIE, Series 7, and Series 66 since you prob don‚Äôt know what that means either). 
2. After that, tell me how fundamentally AND/OR historically, we have ever seen anything quite like this. You can‚Äôt place a time stamp on when the squeeze will happen! All you can do is hold and if you want, buy more. Don‚Äôt be retarded bro be an autistic ape.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"LEV: Lion Electric is the underdog So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. 

Edit: nice close at 19$

You probably havent heard about [The Lion Electric Company](https://thelionelectric.com/). Its because its only been 2 weeks since they are officially listed on both [NYSE](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy5d2/nyselev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [TSX](https://www.reddit.com/user/air2dee2/comments/nhy67g/tsxlev/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Before that, you could only buy the SPAC's stock Northern Genesis Acquisition. This is when I first bought most of my shares.

Basic infos about the stock:
- currently worth 19 U$D (+30% this week and its the highest ever with ticker LEV)
- Market Cap 3,5 billion USD


What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses.
And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. 


What makes me think LEV is a buy



1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good.



2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 



3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 



4. Lion has clients
Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock.
But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 



5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right?



So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment.


Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!"

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA **Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)"

3. Unsuccessful test flight

2021-05-22 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD 100$ by end of year We have all read about the fundamentals why AMD has great growth coming it's way, and here is some TA on charts that backs up the price.

Good support on the \~74$ line, looks to be holding, my personal stop loss is at 70$ if that breaks it's open to free fall.

On the 1H candles, break out over 50ma, resistance at 200ma, rsi peaking at 70, propably will come down to get support from 50ma again before breaking over the 200ma.

Nasdaq index looks to have made bottoms at 13000 and is on long trend again, or at least will go sideways for the summer period, between 13k and 14k.

NOT a investing advice, personally im long with 2040 shares target 100$ average price 77$

A lot can happen in 6 months, I actively follow the movements and if something happens am ready to sell early and buyback when TA looks good again.

2021-05-21 23:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Most of what you say I agree with; but I do not think, at any level, that AMD will considerably chip away at NVidia's market share. Not this generation at least."

2021-05-21 20:03:33,wallstreetbets,I remember I jumped in... second worst trade. First is nnox
2021-05-21 20:50:18,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre misreading a letter there. AMD is not a movie theater. Also it‚Äôs consistently been above 70 for the past 6 months, almost hit 100 in December of 2020."
2021-05-21 23:27:13,wallstreetbets,I said after the shortages end. That won't be this generation.
2021-05-21 20:01:54,wallstreetbets,Just excuse. Finally I once patiently wait it till lower 70 to buy. It also down after Er. Always
2021-05-21 23:34:04,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how long the shortages last, but if they really do recover sometime next year, I do not think AMD will have a new GPU generation until the year after. AMD has been skipping every other generation, more or less. They will likely have a single card, or a rebranding; not a new generation.

And that's all to assume if they did release a new stack it'd be competitive. They haven't really been competitive on the GPU scene for a couple of generations. It likely wouldn't change suddenly now.

Thankfully, NVidia is seemingly shoving their had as far up their own ass as they can manage, so maybe the goal is that NVidia fails harder than AMD."
2021-05-21 23:35:48,wallstreetbets,"RDNA1 was released in July 2019 and RDNA2 in November 2020, RDNA3 should be sometime 2022"
2021-05-21 23:56:20,wallstreetbets,"RDNA was half a product stack.

RDNA 2 was the other half.

I'm not joking, by the way.

RDNA 1's highest priced card was $449, coincidentally, the lowest priced RDNA 2 card. The highest tier RDNA 1 card was *700XT, the lowest tier RDNA 2 card was that same sku. The fact is that RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 were not full launches, and were more similar to an extremely elongated launch.

I'm sure AMD ***could*** do it. But it's not something I'd bet on."
2021-05-21 20:00:32,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt because the premium is too low? Look at those 20cents weekly...
2021-05-21 23:58:47,wallstreetbets,"But with a 50% increase in perf/watt, I'm betting it will be a full release next gen, also note that RDNA2 does go down to 6600XT now, though it's very delayed"
2021-05-21 20:35:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah it‚Äôs much higher if you go further out but you need to write em on green days and buy em back on red days
2021-05-21 22:07:48,wallstreetbets,"At the same time a $20 premium on a weekly is a .1 delta while the Dec $100 is a .23. if you sell a weekly .23 delta it's $50-$60. Monthlies are usually what I target, but I'm also looking for more strategies from people who sell. I know I'm at more risk selling shorter term, but the payoff seems crazy slow for long dated options to me"
2021-05-22 00:05:50,wallstreetbets,"It really doesn't much matter if their perf/watt is good if they don't actually have relevant products. You can have the absolute most amazing breakthrough in the world, but if you can't actually bring it to market in a full product stack, you may as well not have it at all.

To give an example of how this sort of thing can effect companies, look at how difficult it is to sell luxury variants of products."
2021-05-21 22:05:08,wallstreetbets,Is that how that works?
2021-05-21 22:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Are we talking amd? $20 premium, then you need to sell 100 contracts... that‚Äôs 10k shares. I don‚Äôt have that many shares"
2021-05-22 00:06:41,wallstreetbets,You're changing the subject a lot here
2021-05-21 22:26:42,wallstreetbets,"The 79.5 (.27 delta) for 5/28 is selling at around $65 in premium right now and the $80 (.24 delta) for around $50 premium.  I'm usually less concerned about the strike and more about the likelihood of it being called away. The $100 strike has an almost 0% chance of being called away next week. So you're going to get super low premiums, but if you sell an equivalent risk of assignment weekly as you do for 7 months out you will make more money on average.

Edit : I'm asking because i don't know which is better, selling long dated options on green days and buying back on red. Or selling low probability weeklies and hope to not be assigned."
2021-05-22 00:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to explain how and why AMD has failed to compete with NVidia, and why it doesn't seem like that's going to change. Failures to release full product stacks and seemingly skipping generations are the key factors."
2021-05-21 22:36:35,wallstreetbets,"I usually do weeklie on other stocks. If it hits I just roll to the next week. If it being called away before weekend, you still get higher premium. I‚Äôm not doing well buying back on red days. I usually also do a otm put. So if it goes up, I will close otm put earlier. Like 1cents or 0.1 ones. So I can free up more margin for other opportunities. If it goes down my cc will gain. And I can also roll otm put to the next week in case I had the wrong estimates

I still not quite get you. I understand the delta and probability. But I still don‚Äôt think AMD is a good candidate for cc. Premium is too low, but this is to individual‚Äôs risk reward. So may be only I won‚Äôt do it."
2021-05-21 22:47:36,wallstreetbets,"Premiums aren't high on them because they don't explode up or down on average at least lately.  The $100 strike in Dec isnt much premium and theta ticks off relatively slow on OTM options months out. But I could be missing something. 

I'm only thinking this because AMD has been fairly stable for a while and plays into more more traditional probability than large swings giving you premiums.  If you close the December in 2 months for $100 profit, it's likely you could sell multiple weeklies for more then $100."
2021-05-21 23:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Just my personal experience... especially this year. if it‚Äôs a red day, it is not easy to determine when to buy back cc... if it keeps declining which happened so many times  this year. You tend to make less with buy back. And premium will be lower with lower strike if you want to re-sell a cc"

2021-05-21 21:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I just opened a CS account."
2021-05-21 23:13:07,wallstreetbets,"use Interactive Broker. 1.5% margin rate. option approval, future approval,... everything are done online and takes around 1-2 days to finish. fill are even better than NBBO sometimes."
2021-05-22 03:56:21,wallstreetbets,"U HAD ME AT ""PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit."" lMFAO@!!!!!"
2021-05-22 05:10:17,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt offer IPOs anymore either due to a contract dispute. Fidelity does.
2021-05-22 13:41:16,wallstreetbets,"Hmm I really hope TDA doesn‚Äôt go that way when the merge or forced switch happens. I love the ToS app/desktop. Weird about margin though, I‚Äôve only had an account with them 6 months and they‚Äôve been great about putting margin upgrade requests (3 so far) and now my account is at level 7 of max 12 margin (~1.3M AUM at time of application for upgrade). For awhile I was trading high volumes of contracts and they reduced my contract fee to .35c, waived all of my fees for any transfer or corporate actions/splits. And customer service, trade desk and margin department have been great at solving all the problems I‚Äôve run into. If it goes South when the merge happens I guess I‚Äôll be moving my main account to Fidelity."
2021-05-21 20:40:34,wallstreetbets,Best for execution speed is lightspeed
2021-05-21 20:57:47,wallstreetbets,"I've had Schwab for years without issues, but hey go with wherever float your boat as long as it makes you  money."
2021-05-21 22:13:19,wallstreetbets,"I am holding many bags of weed ...stocks that is . I would be happier holding just bags of weed 
instead. But it‚Äôs not Fidelity‚Äôs fault .... it‚Äôs Jeff Sessions fault with his stupid comments about 
‚Äú good people not smoking marijuana ‚Äú"
2021-05-22 10:29:48,wallstreetbets,"I like Schwab and StreetSmart. I like how intuitive StreetSmart is. For regular stock trading it's like they got it right 20 years ago and I wouldn't want them to change a thing. One thing I don't like is Schwab's nanny day trade limit.

Last summer I was thinking of switching to IBKR and applied to open an account. It took like a month and by then I mostly lost interest. Everything about IBKR is a pain and is non-intuitive. I use them now for small LTBH where I can just forget about the stocks."
2021-05-22 04:00:57,wallstreetbets,"FIDELITY PROS + CONS 

PROS the coaching from Fidelity active trader pro strategy team is really helpful. CONS- for day trading, lack of VWAP and hotkeys really makes it  tougher. I'm going to try day trading on IBKR. Anyone switched and happier there?"
2021-05-22 03:24:40,wallstreetbets,"There is.  It‚Äôs called processors blowing it and putting money into the wrong accounts.  Shit happens all the time.  If you make interest off of it while the money is in there, they‚Äôll let you keep it. To have all the transactions line up and the account balance be wrong (if that‚Äôs the complete story) is, in fact, a rare programming error."
2021-05-22 11:30:45,wallstreetbets,i had a stop loss on AMC back in the day at 15 and it executed at 10.20. now i only use them for pennies.
2021-05-22 04:06:44,wallstreetbets,I've Never heard of Robinhood... Is that the![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes_rainbow) broker where men in tights place PFOF for rich gay bears?
2021-05-21 20:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Never go there. Closing an account is a nightmare, I tried closing mine 15 times and they still have it open. I've even submitted complaints to the attorney general, FINRA, etc anyone who would listen , and MorganFuckFace is still like ""lol? IDC, I'm keeping your account open"". Who knows what would happen if I get identity thefted through that account. Fuck them so hard. They need to die off."
2021-05-21 20:56:41,wallstreetbets,I thought the whole point of the TDA acquisition was to port Think or Swim to Schwab because StreetSmart is clunky af.  But I guess not.
2021-05-21 20:57:43,wallstreetbets,They are known for their amazing customer service.  Can you elaborate on your experience?
2021-05-22 02:15:33,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt get any error.:
2021-05-22 11:35:34,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that's nuts. Did you speak to them about it?"
2021-05-22 11:35:11,wallstreetbets,No - they are heavily regulated and that sucks you had to deal with all of that. The paperwork can be a bitch.
2021-05-22 04:08:02,wallstreetbets,"Was it just some reporting inaccuracy while money was shifting around, or did they actually have to deposit the money back?"
2021-05-21 23:27:19,wallstreetbets,"I think the derivatives guys at every brokerage act like that. I just spoke to a rep at a Chicago firm yesterday that was all attitudue. ""Take a look at your net liq, what's it say?"" I just hung up."
2021-05-21 20:10:59,wallstreetbets,"Not to doubt your experience, but I kinda do to be honest.  Outages would be something everyone experiences, unless they're localized, which is highly unlikely for a company like Schwab. I've personally never experienced any sort of outage, error, or notable slowness and have been using them for a long time.  Seems you may be exaggerating this some.  Same with the margin approval.  They're definitely strict compared to some joke app broker like Robinhood, but their approval process is perfectly in line with other serious brokers."
2021-05-21 22:28:01,wallstreetbets,Schwab has lowers fees
2021-05-22 16:38:38,wallstreetbets,"Well, look at their hiring practices.  They have a good concentration of employment in my neck of the woods.  Every person with a 4 year degree in some worthless bullshit knows they can, in the worst, case go to Schwab.  Underwater basket weaving?  Gender studies?  Liberal arts?  Schwab doesn't care if you know anything about stocks or even basic math competency.  You could apply with a high school diploma but have a series 7 license and they will tell you to fuck right off."
2021-05-21 21:57:04,wallstreetbets,It might be but it‚Äôs not available yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2021-05-22 12:40:53,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I went to a down detector site and saw that 100s of people were having the same problem, so I figured I would wait a day."
2021-05-21 20:24:54,wallstreetbets,"I dunno what to tell you.  I proudly opened my first Schwab account while working minimum wage almost 20 yrs ago, first job outta college.  

IBKR was a short and easy quiz with no call required, instant approval.  Fidelity, the lady literally said ""you're approved"" when I called for expediting 5 minutes after sending in app (almost no phone wait unlike Schwab which one time was 1.5 hours) and asked ZERO questions, she just wanted to see my app went through and agreed to expedite.  It could be my networth and maybe others aren't as lucky but then it begs the question why Schwab doesn't see that I've been responsible with and slowly growing wealth as well.  Please don't treat me like a college kid.  I'm almost 40 and have been investing for 19 years.

I get ""system currently unavailable"" or other issues constantly with Schwab.  I've been with them so long I truly wish it wasn't so.

If it works for you, great wish you the best of luck."
2021-05-21 21:07:18,wallstreetbets,"I use Schwab and I know that they did have an outage back during the height of the GME fiasco.  They came back before 10AM though.  I haven't really actively traded since then so can't tell you if there were more instances. 

Agree with the approvals.  I have been approved for 100% margin and L2 options and both were easy, although not instant."
2021-05-21 20:27:38,wallstreetbets,They got tired of having to send out the letters about reevaluating your risk thresholds when people lose a ton of money.
2021-05-21 22:47:53,wallstreetbets,You will just end up talking to less seasoned reps when you call in.

2021-05-21 20:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Just reading through the patent for the inertial drive there are some cringeworthy statements. 

It‚Äôs highly suspect. For the example they give of spinning a coulomb charge on a metal disk 1M in diameter. The capacitance of such a disk is on the order of micro farads which means the voltages need to be in the megavolts to get anywhere near a coulomb of charge on it. That‚Äôs some serious van de Graf generation going on, let alone arc insulation. 

They need to pick up orders of magnitude voltage enhancement to get anywhere near where any of these effects could possibly happen. 

As for competing tech. The worlds most intense laser fields are only now just attempting to reach >10^18 J/cm^2 in intensity and only on femtosecond timescales. 

If there‚Äôs anything that can reach these power levels it‚Äôs got to involve manipulation of inner shell atomic fields. Unlikely and hard to do in a macroscopic fashion without fields cancelling out between individual atoms. 

Otherwise there needs to be some magic trick that is not listed in the patent. Some kind of coherence previously undiscovered that enables high EM field generation at least locally within materials. 

All very dubious.

2021-05-21 20:03:31,wallstreetbets,"The movie was very, very clearly a satire. It was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Total Recall) ffs lol. 

The book on the other hand, is a serious science fiction book. And that was the intent of the author. It was not meant as satire at all, and wasn't received as such. Have you read it recently? There is zero indication of satire, the whole thing is played 100% straight without even a wink. If you haven't read it, it is very different from the movie.

Now in a modern context, through the lens of a fan of the movie... nah even then you can't really find satire in the book."
2021-05-22 03:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Robocop is a satire , not ST , The movie is like the book , not a satire of the book , the book being a satire itself or not is secondary in my comment. Accept it."

2021-05-21 22:21:20,wallstreetbets,It's the last quarter of the year. If you look at the most profitable periods January is one of them which is when major rebalancing occurs. So October is when everyone either divests or prepares to divest for the year and thus start the tax loss harvesting (and overseas accounting) process and January is when they re-up.
2021-05-21 20:00:12,wallstreetbets,So no need to go Vegas in Oct? Sounds like good plan

I, too, wish I was handed the greatest economy in the world where I could afford a house, cars, boats, vacation, a wife that doesn't work, kids, and save for retirement with a pension coming as well all on a high school education.  And if I wanted to go to college I could work as a cashier at Pizza Hut during the summer and make enough to pay my full tuition. And had to do nothing as a generation to have these opportunities,  the generations before you sacrificed and built the great country that you inherited.

Oh, and then change all the rules of society so that the generations that follow after me don't have the same opportunities that I did and struggle just to pay for a college textbook, a single textbook that costs and entire paycheck, and unable to get housing because the generation that rigged the game owns all the land."

2021-05-22 10:24:38,wallstreetbets,"This is the lies they tell you choobs in college. Did you ever think that maybe it's a supply and demand issue and that the lie of a college degree is pushed by the same people? They push the idea that if you don't go to college you will be poor but it's actually the opposite. You are taught extremely left wing failed policies and to blame your failures on other's instead of teaching you how to succeed. Unless you are going to college in the STEM field you are wasting your money. They told this lie to my generation in the late 90's too. I decided that college was a waste of money for me personally and went out to make my own way. Years later I have more money than most of my peers that went with out the debt. If you actually learn how to manage your money and invest you can save tens of thousands of dollars or more by reading free books in a library.

The reason we have a lower standard of living is due to the Federal Reserve inflating the currency. Back when the boomers were growing up at least their money was tied to gold. Now everyone lives paycheck to paycheck and lives on debt. My grandparents generation actually had a thing called savings and didn't buy something unless they could pay cash. But now our currency inflates and everyone lives off credit cards. 

Look, if you actually want to improve your financial life, read books on investing, money management, and the history of Central banks. Or your could blame other generations your you own personal failure. I know what worked for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-05-22 07:01:22,wallstreetbets,Paper silver doesnt 'track' the price of silver it sets the price of silver.
2021-05-22 04:41:47,wallstreetbets,Silver is the best conductor there is.  Copper isn't quite as good.  Similar use cases but silver is a better option for top performing electronics.   There are other uses as well.  Solar panels depend on silver.  Many medical uses.   And I suspect it will become money again when fiat currencies inevitably collapse in on themselves.  That day seems to be coming sooner than later.   The banks balance sheets are way off.  They are sitting on huge reserves.   We are already seeing prices rise in everything at levels approaching something hyperinflationary and it's all barely begun IMO.   Maybe they can keep the plates spinning indefinitely but I doubt it.

But yeah, his drug of choice was coke and crack, but when he fell off the wagon again it was meth.  


I went and saw him the other day, we played some music together. He taught me that too! People have told me he is one of the best musicians around the area. I think he is trying lately, his lungs are really bad. Not many good years left, so I am trying to go see him more, and just jam out."

This is not to say anything negative about Ford; just want to add that this is the case in almost every car dealership now (Mazda in town seems to have some in stock, but that's really the exception; Toyota also bought a bigger cushion with chips apparently).

2021-05-21 22:32:55,wallstreetbets,"I bought 560 stocks of F today.  I'll buy more.  

I remember first seeing a Tesla andI felt that way yesterday seeing the Lightening.  I'm digging the Lightening. 

Ford can use this Lightening platform to do the Electric Expedition.  They'll do the same for the other models they carry."
2021-05-22 10:32:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying there's not a high likelihood they sell more EV 150s than they sold Gas F 150s in the long run. Maybe the margins will be better.

But I have that same criticism for every traditional auto OEM. I think all their stocks are topped out forever because pure EV manufacturers are going to reduce their total market share, and car sales growth into the future isn't that spectacular."
2021-05-22 06:25:56,wallstreetbets,"This isn't about preference, I'm not evangelizing.

Ford does not and will not have the capacity to scale BEVs.    Like the Hummer, these are PR stunts that will go nowhere.   They cannot ramp the Mustang because they are constrained and this takes 2x that amount of batteries.   

Ford stock is held up by a false belief.   If you've never paid over 50K for a car, you don't understand that demographic."
2021-05-22 08:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Federal government especially is going to be pushing big for EVs.  They are also examining different models for installing and maintaining charging stations for their fleets.  

A big selling point is how to level load on the electric grids utilizing the vehicles batteries.  Store the energy in the batteries when demand is low and then provide energy to grid when demand is high.  With a fleet of 10 to 50 EVs, this newer concept of distributed battery storage to level load is plausible."

2021-05-21 22:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Car companies are moving from a push system to a pull system.  Cars are no longer being overproduced forcing them to be sold at discounts to make way for the new year model.  Instead vehicles are being made per order.  This also avoids storage waste of a dealership having 100+ vehicles on hand.  It is simple continuous process improvement standards of eliminating waste.

I personally wonder if this 'automotive chip shortage' crisis is false and simply because car companies are changing up their business models."

At least $20.  That'll be about a 50% gain from current level.

The relative strength is at 90, it gained 6% in higher volume Thursday and Friday, it retook and went above its 50-day moving average last week.  It's close to its recent yearly high and seems to have momentum.  Fridays increase in higher volume seems to be institutional buying. We'll see what happens next week.  The momentum may continue or it may pull back."
2021-05-22 19:15:09,wallstreetbets,".......

Again. I don't think they will sell as many cars as they are now. I think it will be less. 

EV OEMS are frankly out in front of traditional car manufacturers. They are ahead in just about every way. And there's a metric ton of them hitting the market. There's 50+ EV OEMs."
2021-05-22 10:20:57,wallstreetbets,"You have a better take?   How about something simple?  

Legacy can't scale BEV production and have never been able to.  Not ever.  30K per quarter is decent starter production.   Tesla scales to 10K per month in less than a quarter, then 75K per quarter within a year.

How can you consider some low volume boutique BEV from legacy when they have zero ability to scale.  Have no record of ever being able to produce in volume.  

Manufacturing at profit is an equation.  It's math.  That's logic.  

So give me the pro case.   Why should anyone invest in a Ford BEV future?"
2021-05-22 08:45:19,wallstreetbets,"Alright, but I can't make the scaling assumption after seen their battery pack construction--it's too intricate and parts assembly intensive.  I have a background in manufacturing and watched them go out of business due to overestimating the production hump.

Tesla scales to 10K units per month on a brand new line within 30 days.  Not one legacy car company has got to 10K per month in BEVs.  Ever.

Let that sink in.  Not EVER.

Scaling is how the factories are paid back.   Tesla is very cash efficient.  Factory is built and paid for in 2 years.   Debt is miniscule.   Ford cancelled their dividend and carries a lot of debt and is losing money.

The context of this is DD on Ford by someone with saying it's a great buy.   Not whether Joe Biden is impressed with a test drive.   That's not DD.

edit: BTW, the max capacity of a Tesla line is 25K per month, just in case you thought 10K was a lot."

2021-05-22 00:54:04,wallstreetbets,Their vehicles are already at enough volume to have good volume pricing.  Some of the only further improvements you can get are if you're 1.) a stable / reasonable OEM to partner with (think Toyota) 2.) try to be a bully with your volume (GM was notorious for this. leads to acrimony and games.) 3.) pay your damn bills.

2021-05-21 21:26:32,wallstreetbets,If they can find a way to boost how many businesses pay them to post their ads it will be good for revenue. Right now they don't seem like they can is all I'm saying. I think they need to find a way to bump revenue for anyone in the partner program and put the crappier ads on no name videos lol
2021-05-22 00:28:55,wallstreetbets,"They are giving less and less bat for every ad now, earlier they used to give 0.01 BAT for every ad but now only 0.005, why is that? I wonder maybe because the value of BAT is increasing slowly that's why."

I don‚Äôt know what I just said.   So don‚Äôt AXE me."
2021-05-21 22:17:29,wallstreetbets,Watch all small youtuber not give a damn about demonetization until they get into the partner program. The small channels are gonna be exciting
2021-05-22 00:21:13,wallstreetbets,well that‚Äôs all the more reason to IPO! What better hallmark of american business philosophy is there than ‚Äúmonetize something that is literally no work on your part‚Äù? ü§£ü§£

2021-05-21 20:53:20,wallstreetbets,"the company youtube isn't profitable... it costs more money to run it than it generates in revenue.... that is a money pit. it is why you don't have another youtube because you can't compete against free..... if you leave youtube by it self the company goes bankrupt... full stop. 

now you have to justify running a company at a loss.... since it is ran as a division of a other company you can use that money hole of a division to use for software development... but any only video based company is fucked because again this model doesn't work if it is just a video company....


how do they justify the millions or billions in losses well they use it to run data collection and software tends. 


now as they are a profit seeking company but they are offering a free unlimited service their costs to operate. the cost to operate is ever increasing at a faster and faster rate..... it costs more to run every year than the year before because billions of hours of video are uploaded every year. 

they are currently making the drive to make youtube actually profitable because it costs them to much money.."

2021-05-22 12:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Amc is the worst stock for ""the cause"", best to just go with whatever stock has the highest short interest and not stay on a stock that's imminently going to file bankruptcy"

Learned that lesson the hard way..."
2021-05-22 03:15:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes... the short squeeze here is just a rumor. Don't fall for this idiot.

Low P/E is not a reason for a stock to have a squeeze.

2021-05-22 09:02:17,wallstreetbets,Lol PLTR fundamentals????  They dont have the right units of economics. They blow their cash on paying salaries for their business consultants and entertainment for government lobbying! Talk about doing research.

2021-05-22 08:55:59,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha that would be a tall order for Palantir to ever be able to get there. I have doubt on their technical capability to scale. I mean their team are mostly high paid business consultants for government projects and that is why their overhead is insane.

Building out brands like Paw Patrol, Star Trek, NCIS, Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Dexter, Frasier, etc takes more than money.  

Top Gun 2 is coming soon as well, that alone will probably double their sub count when it comes to Paramount+.  One of the biggest theatrical releases in decades."

2021-05-22 12:44:00,wallstreetbets,"\^ This. Price of shares can't really be determined by fundamentals, because there aren't really any. Most of it is speculation and betting. If you went by P/E ratio (which you can't because it's not a profitable company yet), the shares are overvalued by around 11x. Buying shares in it is betting that they'll be ready to launch people, and be profitable enough to keep up an average of 100%+ annual revenue increases for the next decade. Maybe they can, maybe they can't. Who knows?"

2021-05-22 11:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Including yours? Also, the same can be said for some older accounts too."
2021-05-22 18:53:32,wallstreetbets,"You are exactly correct, so when those options expire they need to unwind.

MM buy shares to hedge calls that are bought to open, and sell to hedge puts that are bought to open."
2021-05-22 14:26:42,wallstreetbets,Lol.  Wow so insightful.  Rough week?
2021-05-22 14:39:19,wallstreetbets,Not really. I was just pointing out that you're not exactly a seasoned member either. And probably holding short.
2021-05-22 14:46:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not short.  Wish I were though.
2021-05-22 14:58:41,wallstreetbets,"If you weren't, you wouldn't be shouting scam because some accounts are newer than others. That's not even an argument. But it is a common ruse of those who are short."
2021-05-22 15:03:37,wallstreetbets,"Looks like They are currently being sued for misleading investors.  Their ceo was essentially kicked out of workhorse.

2021-05-21 20:54:59,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure there where any rabbits.  If there where I'll bet they are hats now.
2021-05-22 07:49:32,wallstreetbets,i survived the first paragraph.  thats a lot of words.
2021-05-21 20:19:55,wallstreetbets,Ppl do not know the history well. Cathie is not the first fund manager who tried these fancy investment and got successful for couple of years and then failed miserably.
2021-05-22 18:36:18,wallstreetbets,For a guy who never bought options or warrants what would you do if you‚Äôd be a share type of guy?
2021-05-21 20:28:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought an FD when the price hit 27 lol. 
I'm not actually blaming PRPL."
2021-05-22 13:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Not if you have RobinHood, you‚Äôll lose it how they want lol one of their well timed outages."
2021-05-22 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,"There is plenty of evidence on the internet for the drawdown buyback theory to work if we are talking about reliable diversified instruments. For example, indices or shares of holding companies. These options guarantee a stable base and the responsibility for your funds of a group of quality analysts based on the experience of agencies such as S&P. As far as holding companies are concerned, stable options can also be selected with the right analysis. For example, Crawford United and Elah holdings have performed well in 2020, more applied data based on my investment experience. I also expect a demand recovery in Europe and am personally betting on Gesco AG and MBH Corp.  
Discaimer: This is not an investment recommendation."

2021-05-22 02:23:58,wallstreetbets,GILT is looking pretty tasty
2021-05-21 22:11:00,wallstreetbets,"I think YOLO definition should factor in time left for options and also the % of the portfolio. $10k into a single ITM TSLA LEAP 12+ months out isn't really a YOLO, but $10k into deep OTM AMC options expiring next week sure is. Also Warren Buffet dumping $10k into an option isn't really impressive vs the ape that dumped 200% of his and his wife's boyfriend's life savings plus margin to dump into weeklies."

2021-05-22 14:33:00,wallstreetbets,"If I buy a $30 bottle of Bourbon every 3 weeks, or 5 drinks per weekend, then I‚Äôm at $520. Let‚Äôs say I also consume a 6 pack of decent beer every 2 weeks ($10) then that‚Äôs $260. Let‚Äôs also assume I have a glass of wine/beer when I go out every other week ($8) then thats $208. At this point I‚Äôm at almost $1000 annually on booze without crazy levels of drinking. If a husband and wife you could probably add 50% to those numbers if not double them."

2021-05-22 02:47:29,wallstreetbets,"If they were to actually execute this plan, they still do not provide what gamestop provides. The physical game market is alive and well. Netflix would surely be able to provide a cloud streaming service for games, but it wouldn't come anywhere near the library of games that gamestop provides. Sure they may have Netflix exclusive games, but will they have Nintendo IP's? Sony? Nope. Will they provide a service to provide retro games to the market? (HUGE MARKET) Nope. Will their service be as reliable or match the performance and resellability that physical games provide? Absolutely not. Their competitor would be google stadia if anyone. You can stretch this theory as far as you'd like, but if you don't know the market (which I have built a business on myself) then you won't realize you're comparing apples to oranges."

2021-05-22 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,SPY is fine as long as the MM‚Äôs want to extract funds from retail. Most investment is done through ETF‚Äôs with SPY obviously being one of the largest (or its variants). It‚Äôs easy to manipulate to keep positive with a few dips so that people can feel they‚Äôre catching a dip and it‚Äôs not rigged. All the while individual stocks are completely divorced from logic and trade at the whims of hedge funds.
2021-05-22 14:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Great summary. Now can we use this as evidence that the government and economists are just as incapable of predicting or writing good policy as the homeless crackhead and only appear right occasionally, purely through luck and random happenstance completely outside of any of their models and the more complexity they add the less accurate it will be (they read nice and give the warm fuzzies though)."

Also as bad as their company is doing, the entire rest of the industry is sinking the same amount.  The have a competitive edge in that smaller cruiselines have completely sunk knocking out many smaller competitors.  The ships are ready to sail as soon as CDC gives go ahead. Airlines are good and I made +50% off them, but going forward I see another 30-50% jump from cruises happening very soon.  Disclaimer: I just made all this up."
