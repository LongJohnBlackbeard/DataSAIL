2021-06-07 19:59:14,wallstreetbets,I believe 🚀🚀
2021-06-07 19:54:30,wallstreetbets,I am.putting 10k on it let's go

2021-06-07 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,Smells like bitch tantrums from that side
2021-06-07 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,How about making the hedges cover all the naked shorts? This government is so corrupt with people in high places taking money from hedge funds and banks to make sure no one makes a fucking dime but them. It  really is a joke at this point.

2021-06-07 19:46:38,wallstreetbets,Woulda been nice to hear about XL a month ago when the run started.
2021-06-07 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes... Every stock that is mentioned MUST be a short squeeze.

Yes... Totally not pump and dump."
2021-06-07 19:44:47,wallstreetbets,I stopped reading at “Citron actually went bullish on the stock”
2021-06-07 19:47:48,wallstreetbets,Its just started long in tho with that one
2021-06-07 19:29:29,wallstreetbets,Thats a really long way to say your a gambling addict lol
2021-06-07 19:23:52,wallstreetbets,"I trade predominantly SPY.  I only do 0dte sometimes, mostly weeklies.

If I'm playing it safe, i'll play ITM or near the money, 2-4 weeks out, and buy puts weekly if I'm feeling like there's a downturn.

With that said, works until it doesn't!"
2021-06-07 19:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Trend is your friend. I get most of my gains and the best luck usually in the first 2 hours of market. When the trend for the day develops. Usually around 10-11 I seem to notice whatever trend developed levels out and there’s not enough velocity to counteract theta. Not always, but in general"
2021-06-07 19:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Been daytrading spy for a while. Biggest things i’ve noticed is that it pivots off of precious support and resistance levels. Have not found a use for any MA’s. Wedges and triangles are the only patterns I’ve found useful. Head and shoulders, cup and handle, etc., are all useless. For th quick in and out 10% gains I would imagine you could do really well playing bounces off vwap. Spy bounces up and down off vwap several times a day."
2021-06-07 19:36:20,wallstreetbets,✅ I'm in this comment and I don't like it
2021-06-07 19:39:14,wallstreetbets,Haha that’s...why I’m here? Anyways it doesn’t seem like any less of a gamble than weeklies to me in the sense that the trends are almost easier to identify in a 0DTE. Especially in this choppy market
2021-06-07 19:26:39,wallstreetbets,What indicator do you like for 2-4 week range like that?
2021-06-07 19:36:53,wallstreetbets,Do you ever trade the open? It’s something I’ve been thinking about but have no idea what the execution is. Trading that early makes me hella nervous tbh haha
2021-06-07 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. I recently read that head and shoulders is accurate %83 of the time and I’ve observed that to be generally true as well. And yeah VWAP bounces are good, it just depends on what kind of range you can get from them. Sometimes it doesn’t move far enough away from it to warrant an entry"
2021-06-07 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,"My hella basic understanding of charting, RSI and volume. My most profitable has been taking the risk when there is VIX spikes. A good example was when we were last at 405ish. Vix spiked I bought 408Cs with a 14dte and caked.

With a choppy market and hovering near ATHs I'll admit it's been tougher. I picked up a 6/11 422.5C at close today for example, but idk where it'll go currently.

Keep an eye on VIX, and zoom out to find the last time we were in a similar range."
2021-06-07 19:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes depending on several factors. Like you might have had incredibly good news or bad news overnight or the weekend, base it off previous day direction, etc. 
I usually like to wait 10+minutes for the action to settle though."
2021-06-07 19:42:15,wallstreetbets,Well I quickly glanced at the last seven trading days and I don’t see a h&s pattern. Do you have a date and timeframe where you’ve seen a head and shoulders pattern play out on spy?
2021-06-07 19:43:03,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah May 14th I got torched by it. You are correct in saying that it doesn’t form often though
2021-06-07 19:14:28,wallstreetbets,45 shares and 8 calls locked in last Friday and this week is looking perfect! 🚀

2021-06-07 19:17:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s headed very high over the next few weeks, impossible to say how high and by when but I buy more shares at every dip and haven’t been let down so far!"
2021-06-07 19:16:22,wallstreetbets,I like your thinking ME
2021-06-07 19:22:35,wallstreetbets,I believe there's a simple rule. Old business model + AI = high profit margin. So $Clov could be a very safe bet.

2021-06-07 19:42:01,wallstreetbets,Why the 11th and 18th specifically? 📈🙏🏼
2021-06-07 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,Yep that was just one I’d close in a day or so take the profits and run. No end for GME held since Jan. So to the Moon or bust
2021-06-07 19:53:19,wallstreetbets,"21.2 million call option contracts expire and will need to be filled at the market price. 
Or filed a failure to distribute. These shares are all on loan from a prime broker and FTD will trigger a margin call on this scale. Their assets will be sold by the lender.
The hedgefunds are really fucked as long as people buy and don’t sell... it won’t happen over night per say. Be patient and honest the stock really could go to the moon. 1000s per share.

Take a look at Volkswagen short squeeze in 08... this is bigger than that"
2021-06-07 19:21:32,wallstreetbets,I love what the people are doing here
2021-06-07 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Agreed man, I started this with 3k"
2021-06-07 19:49:29,wallstreetbets,"Since we are going back and forth a bit. Would you mind me asking. How old you are? Is 3k all you had?
I’m 32 and married. My wife and I make what would be considered to be a good living but not rich don’t need to hold a job rich. We work hard but are paid well.
I have been managing a brokerage account since 18 and I have only traded equity. Secure blue chip companies and occasional some other quick flips/ sold some too early Moderna and Tesla for example. 
My position is 2.8% of my portfolio but my tolerance for risk is low. I just won’t sleep if I put too much hard earned money in.

I have just under 1,400 shares and I LOVE the concept behind this. I’m not selling what I do have in there. I’m playing my part. The best I can."
2021-06-07 19:55:35,wallstreetbets,"I’m 38, both my wife and I make good livings. This is one of many accounts I have. I like to keep them separated because I don’t trust these companies one bit. I’m also a vet so have some guaranteed income coming in monthly. We have 5 acres and a great home, we’re not rich but we don’t have to go with out either hoping to change that with my AMC, CLOV,GME. I started this play to pay for a new Kubota tractor now I want pay all our debt off"

2021-06-07 19:30:25,wallstreetbets,I've invested because someone said AMC to da moon when it was at 12 dollars. I don't see why someone drawing a cup on a chart is less proof of success. Take my money
2021-06-07 19:56:00,wallstreetbets,I thought BB wasn't shorted but it has good fundamentals thats why it will go up

2021-06-07 19:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Definitely buying puts, inverse this!!"
2021-06-07 19:33:27,wallstreetbets,"Fair Value

""We're increasing our fair value estimate for Biogen to $401 per share from $350 after raising our probability of approval for Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab (Aduhelm) to 100% from 40% and moving the launch from 2024 (following a confirmatory trial) to 2021 (before a confirmatory trial). We now model $7 billion in Aduhelm global sales in 2030, up from our prior $2.6 billion probability-adjusted estimate, after taking the drug's higher-than-expected price tag into account. We also include a 30% probability of approval and $2 bilion in probability-weighted sales by 2030 for BIIBO80, which is entering phase 2.We think combined global sales of Avonex and Plegridy will continue to fall, with low-double-digit declines annually because of new competition. We expect Tysabri to stay relatively flat around $1.9 billion annually. We include Ocrevus sales hitting nearly $7 billion by 2025. For Spinraza (nusinersen), sales began to decline in 2020 as new patients and treated Spinraza patients opted for either competing gene therapy (Novartis' Zolgensma) or smal-molecule therapy (Roche/PTC's Evrysdi), and as fewer patients initiate therapy (the first year of therapy is twice as expensive). In addition, COVID-19's impact on administration of Spinraza (which is injected into the cerebrospinal fluid at special treatment centers) may have been a more temporary headwind on demand.

Overall, we think Biogen's top line will return to 2020 levels by 2023, with steep declines in 2021 due to generic Tecfidera but growth returning in 2022 as Aduhelm launches. We include a placeholder for future litigation risk at roughly 1% of non-GAAP net income going forward (medium level relative to the rest of the branded drug industry).


We still rate the systematic risk surrounding Biogen shares as below average, and we use a 7.5% cost of equity assumption to align our capital cost assumptions with the returns that equity investors are likely to demand over the long run.""

2021-06-07 19:44:44,wallstreetbets,"$7 billion in sales at $56000 per person only puts it at 125,000 people each year on the drug. That seems far too low to me"

2021-06-07 19:26:13,wallstreetbets,"DD is great except RKT was added last year.

It’s also weighted by float adjusted market cap and RKT currently sits at number 985 out of 1000. But I’m just bitter because UWMC is having the same trouble getting in that RKT had last August. Voting rights issues due to company structure (RKT and UWMC have identical share structure).

2021-06-07 18:48:23,wallstreetbets,"what made it worse is ive been down 4k,(70% of my investment) for months, from chasin losses with options. that would have finally pulled me out of the hole and put me in the green. lol i cant relate to the cash value of your losses but the the percentage of savings lost hurts all the same.

2021-06-07 18:58:04,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine! You've got decades to make this up bro. You'll laugh about this in your 60s and warn your grandkids not to do the same!
2021-06-07 18:53:10,wallstreetbets,I’ll take 10 shares if you’re offering? I can provide a sob story to go along with as well..

2021-06-07 18:49:22,wallstreetbets,I regret. I just learned calls back in may and didnt have enough time to learn so I bought shares instead and now regret because I know what calls are now and couldve net me double in returns.
2021-06-07 19:30:27,wallstreetbets,"What are  call options? Someone please explain in a simple way, I’m new and retarded"
2021-06-07 18:16:06,wallstreetbets,Yea options are cool - you planning on loosing that stack?

2021-06-07 18:41:36,wallstreetbets,This boat is familiar.
2021-06-07 19:23:37,wallstreetbets,Boomer COST feeling pretty socially awkward surrounded by all those memes.

2021-06-07 19:54:57,wallstreetbets,I'm 17 so the brokerage is under her name. She wanted me to buy 10k worth of costco and she wanted to see me do it. I sold it a couple hours after I bought it.

2021-06-07 19:22:40,wallstreetbets,Yes! NOK to the moon 🚀🙌🏼
2021-06-07 18:48:39,wallstreetbets,I’m hanging on to NOK even tighter than ever.
2021-06-07 18:12:16,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I believe in NOK because I hate the CCP and WaiWei so NOK and other 5G corps must push back
2021-06-07 19:48:40,wallstreetbets,Hell yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2021-06-07 18:13:33,wallstreetbets,6G - what a crock of shit 😂😂😂

2021-06-07 18:34:33,wallstreetbets,I sold my NOK today for a tiny profit after sitting on it for 4 months. Came to my senses about the size of the float and the current market capitalization.
2021-06-07 19:27:16,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean? I remember they were talking about 5G when 4G just came out, like 8 years ago."
2021-06-07 18:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Next week: NOK teams up to create 7G one day.

So much crock of shit when most people don't even have 5G.

Companies exploiting these meme waves so hard."
2021-06-07 19:07:14,wallstreetbets,Hell i got Gs than that into BB

2021-06-07 18:33:21,wallstreetbets,I’m all about making money on the volatility - but let’s not get too delusional over here lol
2021-06-07 18:24:16,wallstreetbets,"A stock already at $600 is not suppressed lmao, if anything it’s the opposite. Nice try.

I enjoyed being in at $180 and out at $500."
2021-06-07 18:29:00,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia is not a meme stock. It’s got a market cap of over $420b. You know what a market cap is? Choose smaller stocks for your bs thesis next time

That being said Nvidia > $1 trillion before 2030"
2021-06-07 18:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Demand for their GPU is going to drop over the next 12 months and that means much of their growth from the last two years will be reversed. They’re already priced pretty high, and doing a stock split doesn’t increase their market cap."
2021-06-07 18:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Hedges were trying to convince people today to buy NVDA vs AMC, and stated it had a huge optional.  7 maybe 14% 😑"
2021-06-07 18:06:25,wallstreetbets,Sounds interesting but I’d rather be in EA before E3 2021 happens in the next couple weeks
2021-06-07 18:47:48,wallstreetbets,Dont worry my son.  The insiders just had to unload in the morning and rebought the dip.  It will keep climbing and Il keep making money on my calls while all these meme bois keep crying when they wish they choose NVDA instead of a soon to be bankrupt movie theatre
2021-06-07 18:17:24,wallstreetbets,Would like to get in on this one but rather over streached at the moment. Will have to take a serious look at some of my holdings.
2021-06-07 18:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't this logic make the shares cheaper and easier to obtain by retail investors, thus making it more likely we buy and price rises?"
2021-06-07 18:56:27,wallstreetbets,Why do you think 600 is high for a stock
2021-06-07 18:24:53,wallstreetbets,What about Tesla?
2021-06-07 18:22:38,wallstreetbets,What’s your reasoning for the demand of their GPU’s going down in the next 12 months?
2021-06-07 18:31:40,wallstreetbets,"You're pushing EA heavily, aren't you?"
2021-06-07 18:53:00,wallstreetbets,Thanks Dad
2021-06-07 18:43:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s the sentiment , but in reality no."
2021-06-07 18:29:25,wallstreetbets,"What does Tesla have to do with nvidia? There’s your problem. 

What about Apple? Did it moon? Exactly."
2021-06-07 18:30:42,wallstreetbets,"They are not just in gpus.  They are expanding into server chips, ai, and a number of other areas.  This company looks unstoppable, 1T market cap in a few years is my guess.  It's ran up so fast last week so there might be a bit of consolidation."
2021-06-07 18:57:50,wallstreetbets,very 🤑
2021-06-07 18:35:58,wallstreetbets,Actually it went up about 40% during its run. And Tesla went up 80%. Well just saying about how high Tesla’s price is but it is still getting shorted.
2021-06-07 18:34:55,wallstreetbets,"This company has been my baby since $170. During the trade war with China with orange man in office. Consolidation is buying opportunity. They do look unstoppable such a solid fucking company, wish I was older earlier so I could of gotten in earlier."
2021-06-07 18:36:54,wallstreetbets,I agree I'm kicking myself for not buying in when the market was shit and this was hovering around 500.  Don't see anyone coming close to this company in video card performance.  All sectors are killing it if you listened to the CEO on Kramer.  Very nice entry man.
2021-06-07 18:48:56,wallstreetbets,Appreciate it. I think any point is a good entry for this company. At least a 5-10+ year hold
2021-06-07 18:25:03,wallstreetbets,Well explained! May not be precise but clearly pictured due to BB potentials
2021-06-07 18:35:06,wallstreetbets,Dropped in 3 Gs last week. We will see what happens 🍇💯🍇💯🍇💯
2021-06-07 18:06:23,wallstreetbets,"June target 25-30.

Year end 50-80.

Just a gut feel based on comments and interest from WSB as well as ""news stories"" in media."
2021-06-07 18:20:02,wallstreetbets,"At $19 to accumulate 4x my money,  I think it's worth a few grand gamble.... I like BB. I think you are right! Only thing they need is Tesla or Amazon to pluck them up and then it will get noticed again."
2021-06-07 18:03:53,wallstreetbets,Be honest.You plucked those numbers out of mid air didn’t you?
2021-06-07 18:17:03,wallstreetbets,I approve of these numbers👍
2021-06-07 18:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I know about the deals, blackberry is so cheap I wouldn't be surprised a large conglomerate like Amazon just buy them up.... I plan to ride BB until it is back to glory days!"

2021-06-07 19:57:19,wallstreetbets,Moon bleep
2021-06-07 18:09:52,wallstreetbets,besides nowhere? nowhere
2021-06-07 18:21:43,wallstreetbets,"My guess is like I said 50-80 in this current cycle and then a pull back. Completely depends on what the biggest investors/whales want to do. Generally they like getting a new set of folks to buy at the top before the pullback. My guess is that is going to be high 70s to 80s before a rug pull back to 20s-30s for a new accumulation phase. No way those big boys aren't going to sell a majority of the stock at the highs, let it get nailed by shorts, and then buy it back and rinse and repeat. After a pull back from new all time highs in the 70-80s then it may take till the end of the year to rebuild back to 50-80. I'm guessing somewhere between mid-2022 and mid-2023 that BB will be regularly above a 100."
2021-06-07 18:11:31,wallstreetbets,"seems reasonable, given that it has absolutely zero things to make it moon or whatever the fuck people are dreaming of here"
2021-06-07 18:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is already partnered with them. BB is a speculative buy before monetization with Amazon, Baidu, most major car companies with QNX and that is where the real money is to be made or loss. I've been homeless and I've been relatively well to do. It's worth a shot to me. I actually like the stock and can sit on it for about 12 years. I've got time but I think we are going to see some awesome movement coming up. Who knows. Time will tell."
2021-06-07 18:50:17,wallstreetbets,They have big partnerships with Amazon already.  🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙
2021-06-07 18:15:02,wallstreetbets,Historic levels. Want to see the chart? I'll do one when I'm back in front of the computer later tonight.
2021-06-07 18:12:09,wallstreetbets,"He’s talking about the last three peaks it had in 2011, 2009 and 2008. I don’t think those numbers mean much though because their business model has changed so much hasn’t it?"
2021-06-07 18:33:50,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same thing😂
2021-06-07 18:55:32,wallstreetbets,Lol no 420.69? Funny story. I traded on a lark TSLA to that number when i bought in the 380s. The numbers are off of weekly highs going back to the late 90s.
2021-06-07 18:52:32,wallstreetbets,"It might, but I’ve got years to see what happens. I don’t think it’ll take that long but who knows."

2021-06-07 18:27:25,wallstreetbets,Gonna need some sound reasoning or else this just sounds like wishful thinking
2021-06-07 18:26:58,wallstreetbets,"

Hey you might be right. I'm betting though that Prem Watsa who has invested more money away than we will ever see isn't investing in BB because he feels it might make him a few more bucks. These guys treat it like a game. They make huge gains over months and years. We just have to play it with the cards they deal. 

Who knows maybe their playing poker and I'm playing go fish. Do your own DD and make your decision. I'm also not saying it is going to make 500K a share. If it does I'm buying Reddit and giving everyone custom snoos that buy BB."
2021-06-07 18:26:14,wallstreetbets,I'll be honest I only scan read it
2021-06-07 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,I would enjoy seeing that chart.
2021-06-07 18:16:32,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter. Day traders and institutions use those numbers for resistance levels. Doesn't really matter if it is a different focus for the business.
2021-06-07 18:32:13,wallstreetbets,I'll write something up over on my subreddit tonight. Time to take the kids to their scout meeting.
2021-06-07 19:00:02,wallstreetbets,"I mean there were quite a few call sweeps placed this morning for targets over 20. 

Bb - growth driven by hype?
Bb - growth driven by actual value?

Either way there is growth. Not fool proof but like you said it's their game. Let's see of we can make some headway for ourselves using the system that's in place."
2021-06-07 18:43:57,wallstreetbets,buy GME and dont play with the cards they deal. fuck THEY
2021-06-07 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻
2021-06-07 18:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Give me a 100k and I will think about it. BB is 16 bucks a share, GME is 280 a share. In ape language. I can buy 17 bananas of BB or 1 banana of GME. GME might double banana but BB can multiply by 4-10. If BB go boom up then I have a lot of bananas. I can give bananas to other hungry apes. I like BB banana and you like GME banana. Great thing is we can buy whatever bananas we want."
2021-06-07 18:52:57,wallstreetbets,sure. have you heard about GME squeeze tho? i sure as hell havent heard about BB 10x pottentialy anywhere else but on this shitsub
2021-06-07 18:57:42,wallstreetbets,I sure have but my conviction is that squeeze has squeezed. Could be wrong and if I am I hope you make a great return on your investment.

2021-06-07 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,"It makes sense to me. They already have a leg up on the competition, so now is the prime opportunity to keep on building infrastructure to widen the gap as much possible. 

Not only does more infrastructure = more revenue later, but more infrastructure also means that much more further competition will have to go to catch up. 

Basically, the logic, imo, is build up infrastructure while you have the market to yourself, then you’ll be rolling in the revenue money whenever competition is in the red year after year while trying to play catch up.

Really like the way they have been positioning the company this far. It’s worth looking into while it’s still being undervalued.

Long term is what I do, the only other one I might possibly suggest is L_W_L_G. They are more speculative in comparison, though. Great new system for transferring data, even big boy companies like MicroSoft have supposedly shown interest in their data tech. They don't have much of anything solidified, though. The best one of those three if you want pure safety is BNGO, R_D_G_L should still technically be safe since they are now able to earn money from their vet treatments, which were approved this January for official sale instead of just testing, and they can offer a higher return than BNGO if the IDE is a success. They have worked directly with the Mayo clinic since December so it's looking real good. They even started back with their Twitter (RadioGel) posting some very optimistic stuff.

2021-06-07 18:03:45,wallstreetbets,surely agree. Shorts main argument seems to be Inovio’s lack of bringing a product to market for 40 years.

2021-06-07 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,It's not 100M shares it's $100M worth of shares.
2021-06-07 17:36:27,wallstreetbets,"All is still on track for 18/6, we will all have $CLNE asses on the moo moo moon🐄☁️"
2021-06-07 17:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Let me correct a few things.  The offering is a shelf offering to sell $100m in shares..  not 100m shares.  That equates to under 10m shares at today’s closing price.

Second, this is a method that CLNE uses to funds their infrastructure projects.  It’s a back pocket rainy day fund in case they need some capital in a hurry.  Their previous offering was exhausted.

They are adding up to 5% of their shares at today’s price.  With price targets north of $20, this would only really adjust the target to $19 IF all the shares dumped today.  Keep in mind that the shares are not going into the market today with the announcement.

The higher the share price, the less shares actually come out of this."
2021-06-07 17:24:28,wallstreetbets,Yessir 🐄💨
2021-06-07 17:38:41,wallstreetbets,I'm strapped the fuck in.  Cow farts only go up 🐄💨🚀🌛
2021-06-07 18:05:04,wallstreetbets,Any panic selling tomorrow morning and I am loading up on some more CLNE stock rocket fuel!!!!!
2021-06-07 17:38:17,wallstreetbets,Severely undervalued! You’d be a retard to NOT buy now at this price point. Don’t go fighting the air after 6/18 either
2021-06-07 17:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Wasnt it 100m nominal value and not shares? But gee, what do I know"
2021-06-07 17:46:37,wallstreetbets,"It’s a shelf offering, they’re not diluting anything right now. The 12 million shares ppl talking about were sold in May and that’s done and priced in already. Ppl panic selling now will regret soon imho."
2021-06-07 17:42:20,wallstreetbets,How long until they delete this post?
2021-06-07 18:00:31,wallstreetbets,🐄🚀
2021-06-07 17:28:47,wallstreetbets,Get ready to keep buying a la AMC style
2021-06-07 18:30:23,wallstreetbets,"I am feeling quite confident about the offering. Surely, there are going to be a bunch of wet paperhands who are super eager to give hjs behind Wendy's, so they'll panic sell tomorrow. For all others, perfect opportunity to load up. CLNE did this in May, and in May the stock dipped around 8% before it just bounced back. I'm expecting the same to happen now. 

Not financial advice"
2021-06-07 19:15:08,wallstreetbets,$100M is 5% of the market cap.  That's about $0.52 per share.  The dip in AH was bigger than that.  This should be fully priced in already.  Any extra action is an overreaction.
2021-06-07 17:28:38,wallstreetbets,You got any links to this news? Not on any other financial site e.g seeking alpha or yahoo
2021-06-07 19:01:49,wallstreetbets,I'm here for CLNE. It's a solid long term pick.
2021-06-07 17:38:36,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info. I'll look into the company.
2021-06-07 18:57:27,wallstreetbets,3500 shares in deep I love the stock
2021-06-07 19:37:31,wallstreetbets,Amazing. Great write up!
2021-06-07 19:47:00,wallstreetbets,How was the $24 a share fair market value determine in your evaluation?
2021-06-07 17:52:18,wallstreetbets,You have to be short to make that statement. But after hours is tripping CLNE. Tomorrow dip will be heavy but i buy
2021-06-07 17:52:52,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-07 18:34:55,wallstreetbets,Mfs should I dump the 06/18 13Cs?
2021-06-07 17:27:54,wallstreetbets,Still keeping pace for 6/18.
2021-06-07 17:30:47,wallstreetbets,"I know, I have some experience doing this kinda stuff and I think it’s absolutely foolish the way these companies can’t read the room sometimes"
2021-06-07 18:38:57,wallstreetbets,They might not even have a PR team to be fair.
2021-06-07 17:38:22,wallstreetbets,You’re right I lost the ability to read reports. Edited

2021-06-07 18:11:01,wallstreetbets,Right? AMC the company with more than double the market cap of CLNE worth more? Yeah that makes sense... lmao
2021-06-07 18:59:21,wallstreetbets,It’s easy to love haha
2021-06-07 17:59:34,wallstreetbets,Why would I be short? What
2021-06-07 18:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Up to your risk tolerance my guy, but I ain’t dumping mine just yet"
2021-06-07 19:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Fwiw, I'm keeping mine.

But do what's best for you. Sometimes, dumping it early to avoid the stress and anxiety is worth more than any potential profit"

2021-06-07 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,Same. I’ve got a bit of $$$ loaded up in 6/18’s and I ain’t even that spooked yet. Especially if everyone is rationale for once and realizes that the offering means nothing
2021-06-07 17:20:10,wallstreetbets,Dang i did see your dd and it was good. However 80% of float in hands of so few is risky
2021-06-07 18:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Misleading title. I read YOLO and entered expecting some crazy shit, instead found peanuts."
2021-06-07 17:23:42,wallstreetbets,Congrats on holding this! Had this at $90 in early November and sold at $120 only to see it making good returns after many said the vaccine was priced in.

And thanks mate, the dd could have been better but it was my first.
But like i said in the dd 50% belong to twins early investors who are really smart. They dont sell fast before cancer research isnt done

And thanks mate for the compliment"
2021-06-07 18:21:27,wallstreetbets,"Your right,  i changed to gains.
Sorry for beeing poor, its still a yolo for me"

2021-06-07 18:40:42,wallstreetbets,I bought calls before close today. We ride at dawn
2021-06-07 19:18:08,wallstreetbets,"tldr; $ASO Printer go brrr

Bought in late just shy of $36.00 and poured my entire life savings into the stock (probably not a good idea). Bought 469 shares. I have heard nothing but good news for $ASO. Seems to be getting more attention over the past several weeks as I went in store and see more people actually buying stuff from there, mostly summer stuff.

I do believe this a good stock to hold both short and long term. Even if it doesn't pop immediately like we hope, it's going to gradually build up over time within the week. Granted it's no AMC/GME stock where it's possible to get massive gains, but those stocks are mostly about feelings and speculation. This stock on the other hand is backed by hard numbers and massive sales.

I'm just not really sure why people are passing on this solid grade-A stock. Is it because it's not going to make as much money in a short period?"
2021-06-07 17:06:48,wallstreetbets,I’ve saved this post because I think you’re probably correct!
2021-06-07 19:43:26,wallstreetbets,"This won't make gme money for you, but I think it's a good investment. I like the fundamentals when I bought calls 2 months ago. It's been a wild ride and I'm finally out of the hole after being down 65%. Not sure how much higher it can go considering Dick's sporting goods has an 8.8 billion dollar market cap. Maybe it's comparable to Dick's but I don't think it's equivalent. Either way good stock and I'm hyped for tomorrow morning.

Just don't get your hopes too high"
2021-06-07 17:06:41,wallstreetbets,So you are jealous that unskilled people made more money (thanks to skilled people/DD translators) than you?
2021-06-07 17:02:31,wallstreetbets,Should have sold before ER - playing earnings run up a few weeks ahead is not hard or big 🧠 strategy
2021-06-07 19:55:17,wallstreetbets,"You come off as a real cunt, do you know that?"
2021-06-07 17:04:24,wallstreetbets,So what do I do now?
2021-06-07 17:11:45,wallstreetbets,Even I like this one
2021-06-07 19:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Nice comment. I'm not sure either. I do think it going up so quickly since it's IPO has something to do with it.  I also think the unlocking of shares for the execs of ASO has something to do with it as well. There may be some sell off of shares despite the long term prospects.  Knowing ASO all my life I can't help but think for some of these guys the potential windfall at these prices is life changing. The store itself is very down to earth, non pretentious, etc.  In any case I have short terms calls, a few leaps, and 500 shares now."
2021-06-07 17:24:32,wallstreetbets,"awwwww.

I'm just playin tomhasser.  We're all in this together.

2021-06-07 17:01:09,wallstreetbets,Well. That makes me feel better about my -30% $620 calls.
2021-06-07 17:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Oof, you can make hundreds of thousands with Tesla options, or lose everything u put in."
2021-06-07 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,GUHH
2021-06-07 17:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Got one expiring 6/18 and one 7/2, $700 and $650… :/"
2021-06-07 16:59:45,wallstreetbets,Boy that money gone lol Tesla would have to have something amazing happen to get their stock back up

2021-06-07 17:10:16,wallstreetbets,3!
2021-06-07 17:21:10,wallstreetbets,The plaid plus was cancelled not plaid
2021-06-07 16:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but not for this sub."
2021-06-07 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,Mr. Market is a little bitch.
2021-06-07 17:00:25,wallstreetbets,"You can eat a fat one, Mr. MARKET. Why do you only get to have this bling  you speak of. Is investing in good stocks such as AMC considered bling? I think not. Don't come to our house and bash us. Fix the environment that you destroyed for our generation and generations to come.

He is parasite for the 99 percent and a golden goose for the 1 percent. He is not our friend, you peddler of swine."
2021-06-07 17:00:56,wallstreetbets,"Mr Market wants to friend this sub too 

even if ppl only care about FD’s and dumb ass “triple my money tomorrow” memes"
2021-06-07 17:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, you’re missing the point

The only way to beat the market (make it work for you) is to play incrementally on long term tickers that are fundamentally healthy and undervalued. This “hedge-fund vs me and the boys” mentality is childish af and unrealistic, and comes from those who want money and want it now, lacking the perspective that long term intelligent incremental investment is how small investors can profit, and that’s also what the biggest institutions do."
2021-06-07 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a KwikEmart
2021-06-07 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Well Mr.Market has friends here, just most people are too coked up to notice when someone else is talking"
2021-06-07 17:13:49,wallstreetbets,"No your missing the point. Your pushing your idea on us. We have other plans. Also there is no such thing as "" only one way"" stfu you dicator."
2021-06-07 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah and you guys are laundering the money.
2021-06-07 17:50:08,wallstreetbets,Unfortunate truth.
2021-06-07 17:49:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok mate I’m pushing my idea. Ever wonder if my idea that’s just a rerun of half a century old common knowledge about the market, tested over and over by the greatest investors, is a little better than your newfound pseudo knowledge?

Did you even know what trading was a year ago? 6 months ago?"
2021-06-07 17:52:28,wallstreetbets,"I’d say you probably found out about trading less than 6 months ago.

Already a fountain of market experience and wisdom 🤦‍♂️"
2021-06-07 17:53:23,wallstreetbets,"Now resorting to pleading with me and calling me ""mate"". Well if it worked so well why the fuck is there no middle class. Your insane. So your demanding that we try the same thing over and over to get the same result?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) I'm just trying to help you become a good person.

2021-06-07 17:55:10,wallstreetbets,Now resorting to insults when you cannot prove your point. I could comment on your spelling but I will be the bigger person. I hope you change your ways.
2021-06-07 17:03:59,wallstreetbets,"I lost a few grand on my May21 12.5c on clov so I'm still too butthurt to go back in. Ill be cheering you all on from the sidelines though! Looks like it had a nice run today though. But then again, of course it did, because I'm NOT in it 😂"
2021-06-07 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,$CLOV crossed 200 day SMA today 🍀🔥

2021-06-07 17:07:32,wallstreetbets,"Yup bang on about CLOV. Been long her from low 8s. Sold at 11 odd when momentum flushed out, she faked a breakout on 11 , got back in and just been holding from there. Waiting for her to squeeze hard to anything over 30$"
2021-06-07 17:28:07,wallstreetbets,Bought a $8 call option with an expiration of 6/18 back on may 25th when it was still trading under $8. The call option cost me $39 today at market close it’s worth $405 and should open higher as clov has gained nicely in after hours too.  This was only my second or third option play.  Still new to options but loving how this ones turning out.  I got lucky and got amc option right before the explosion. On a $20 call that I sold before expiration and used to buy actual shares of amc. I should’ve held it longer tho. I sold when they were trading at $18.50. That was my first option play
2021-06-07 18:53:06,wallstreetbets,"CLOV has the most upside I have seen in months.

MOON TIME APES !!! 
 
We need to get CLOV into triple digits 

Ape in"
2021-06-07 17:05:32,wallstreetbets,As long as CLOV goes up I'll be happy.
2021-06-07 17:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Just think what will happen If the Russell 2000 rumor is true… 

655+ CLOV and counting :-)"
2021-06-07 18:12:50,wallstreetbets,Waiting for Clov to hit 60$ Then to the MOON!

2021-06-07 16:58:35,wallstreetbets,Buying based on MA crossovers? I think you just struck gold! Congratulations with your infinite money glitch!
2021-06-07 18:21:51,wallstreetbets,"DNMR is a great long term play.  First to commercialize PHA resin with patents in over 100 countries and a decent list of major CPG firms as customers and/or investors.

The lawsuits are a result of Spruce Point who wrote a negative report against DNMR and coincidentally holds a major short position."
2021-06-07 17:03:32,wallstreetbets,CLOV has $16/$17 💼 holders.
2021-06-07 18:10:00,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-07 18:38:53,wallstreetbets,I lost 3k holding from 15 - 7 because while I believed in them I didn’t think think the recovery would be this quick. I’m back in with calls in a smaller starting position and I may make back what I lost and them some depending on how tomorrow goes. I might even buy more at the right price at farther out dates.
2021-06-07 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Always. The longer I wait to sell, the more likely it is that the price will skyrocket as soon as I move it. And it's always painful."
2021-06-07 19:01:19,wallstreetbets,In a VERY big way!
2021-06-07 18:57:20,wallstreetbets,Fantastic start. This should be an exciting ride!
2021-06-07 17:19:04,wallstreetbets,"That would be pretty amazing. Either way, this is still the first inning..."
2021-06-07 17:17:32,wallstreetbets,"I read about this after I lost 2 years pay in the stock market crash in 1987. It was a hard, painful lesson learned. I had never lost money up to that point, and it was a rude awakening. An analyst on TV explained why he sold everything and bought Puts as the market was melting down. This would have also avoided the carnage in the beginning of the Pandemic, and let you buy back in as stocks started bouncing back."
2021-06-07 18:55:31,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I think DNMR is a game changer. This is a stock to hold for the long haul. 3-5 years from now people will be kicking themselves that they didn't buy it.

I think CLOV is also a great long term play. I'll be very surprised if one of the bigger healthcare companies doesn't acquire them."
2021-06-07 19:11:21,wallstreetbets,I need to get better about taking gains once the position starts reversing against me. That and I need to do longer plays rather than FDs or 2 weeks etc
2021-06-07 17:33:29,wallstreetbets,At least you went big and got home
2021-06-07 17:27:59,wallstreetbets,Fuck you and congrats
2021-06-07 17:53:24,wallstreetbets,I like your all time invested total. Almost like you knew it was shooting through the roof.
2021-06-07 17:00:57,wallstreetbets,"Did the same.  Sold my 5000 shares so I can wait for the next squeeze. 
I am finally flat from pre COVID when I was down $150 K and had no idea how on earth I was going to come back up.

2021-06-07 17:32:52,wallstreetbets,"Seemed like a good time sell when up 100K. Still have some shares in my webull account in case it goes to the moon.

2021-06-07 18:05:39,wallstreetbets,Problem with the cash app is the $10k daily limit withdrawal

2021-06-07 16:59:19,wallstreetbets,Sold all of my shares on cash app still have my ones in Webull
2021-06-07 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,Keep holding what dipshit? REALIZED gains means he sold em all
2021-06-07 17:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Just shares, wanted to get out of cash app. Still holding the rest of my shares in my Webull account"
2021-06-07 17:14:41,wallstreetbets,I posted it as well. Really grateful.

2021-06-07 17:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Ahh gotcha, in that case congrats and I’m glad you’re still with us! Wish I’d had that much to invest"
2021-06-07 17:15:08,wallstreetbets,O shit thought he was just celebrating  hitting 100k profit. He can piss off. Bragging after taking the profit hurts the clause.
2021-06-07 17:16:15,wallstreetbets,You coming to hang with the BBros soon?

2021-06-07 17:19:41,wallstreetbets,"There is no 'cause'. This is the stock market. Every person for himself.

If you want to join some 'cause'/cult, go join the other subreddit dedicated to these single stocks.

Let me just tell you in advance. People come here to make money. They don't come here to lose everything for some 'movement'. That's some new WSB member garbage. And a 'movement' when the share trades sometimes like 600 million shares in a given day. Dude. There's plenty of 'paper hands', institutions, and all profiting from the cult. You either baghold and lose or take advantage of the hype and make money."

2021-06-07 19:35:58,wallstreetbets,I’ve got a bunch. Will sell covered calls at .10 deltas on weeklies to profit off of 400% IV.
2021-06-07 16:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Since when is this about helping? 

This is wallstreetbets not ""make a wish""."
2021-06-07 16:58:30,wallstreetbets,😂 calls def do help. I own GME and AMC shares but I made $40k in one day last week with only calls and was able to pay cash for a new truck for my husband. Tf they don’t!
2021-06-07 16:49:51,wallstreetbets,Id rather have 1600 shares in calls than 750 in shares
2021-06-07 17:09:31,wallstreetbets,"there’s always someone more retarded than you here bro, it’s a beautiful thing"
2021-06-07 17:04:22,wallstreetbets,Suddenly feeling better about my 20c
2021-06-07 17:23:45,wallstreetbets,32c 1/22 and 35c 1/23. This the way
2021-06-07 17:31:25,wallstreetbets,Simple and respectful answer. Thank you brother. I'm not trying to fight with anyone. Just wanted to see who all owns the stock.
2021-06-07 17:17:23,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying you won't maximize your returns. I'm just saying for those who post things like ""to the moon 🚀"" you're not helping at all. And you're not a part of the community. That's fine, if what I said applies to you cool. If it doesn't that's cool too. I'm simply asking who owns a real position with skin the game and who is posting without it. 

Make your money, that's why we're all here. I'm just tired of people being motivated to buy more when they see post from people only buying calls. Nothing more nothing less. Carry on my friend"
2021-06-07 17:30:32,wallstreetbets,It is about options. The point of my comment is to see who actually owns the underlying stock. If that's not you then it's not you.

2021-06-07 17:00:45,wallstreetbets,Pay ur taxes. Dont forget!

2021-06-07 17:39:38,wallstreetbets,How would buying OTM long dated calls not contribute with a gamma squeeze. HUH?
2021-06-07 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,Owning call options that were sold naked by a HF could force them to cover their position big time when exercised
2021-06-07 17:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Cranky retard

And are people buying wendys for the bag alert commercial?

Newly retarded here"
2021-06-07 17:33:28,wallstreetbets,What’s with the fake Ape comment then?  Bear in mind that this is a potential gamma squeeze DUE to options.
2021-06-07 17:09:35,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty good at reinvesting and write offs😬 more than one way to skin a cat. Plus, the IRS is about to be no mo. 😉"
2021-06-07 18:12:24,wallstreetbets,Will you explain calls to me like I'm 5?
2021-06-07 16:51:55,wallstreetbets,what
2021-06-07 17:51:43,wallstreetbets,"I should have been more specific so that's my fault. I'm talking about basic price alternation by outstanding share ownership. Aside from the Gamma squeeze aspect, there needs to be a big push for ownership of the underlying stock to put upward price pressure."
2021-06-07 17:36:57,wallstreetbets,Fair point my friend. Fake Ape portion was a bit abrasive. I'll edit that.

2021-06-07 18:41:30,wallstreetbets,"Oh, no I honestly appreciate your reminder. I’m a stranger on the net, you were just being helpful. But look into it😉"

2021-06-07 16:56:06,wallstreetbets,The optimism is cool but he needs to 100x his money to be a millionaire. That’s not particularly a common feat
2021-06-07 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze because of high short interest and positive catalyst. Similar to what happened to $GME and $AMC. Don’t miss the train.
2021-06-07 16:57:06,wallstreetbets,"It depends; Options are valued on extrinsic and intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is calculatable by hand. He'd make the difference between his strikes and the price of the option at expiration, minus however much he paid for the options. Extrinsic value is a beast that's calculated based on volatility and the utility of an option. Basically, options aren't worth exactly just how much money they would be worth at expiration, there's a premium you pay on top because it's beneficial to you to have access to that option. So if it runs up to 22, he would make a shit ton more than the simple intrinsic but you'd need a stock wizard to guess how much he'd make on his options. sorry to be unhelpful"
2021-06-07 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,About... treefiddy
2021-06-07 16:50:22,wallstreetbets,It depends on when it hit $22
2021-06-07 17:19:53,wallstreetbets,that'd be about tree fiddy
2021-06-07 16:58:51,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot more variables at play but his 30x 22c will intrinsic value worth at least 30000. There will also be a lot more extrinsic value but it depends on when it hits 22 and how fast so i won’t even guesstimate that
2021-06-07 19:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Never too late ol' sport. The more people like you jump in, the more we win."
2021-06-07 19:22:47,wallstreetbets,I will probably add more tmrw.
2021-06-07 16:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Teach me how to do what you just did. I got a good amount of money to play with. I'm thinking about buying shares, but I know options net in much higher rewards."
2021-06-07 16:58:38,wallstreetbets,Right. The stock has to move fast and wild and in upwards.

2021-06-07 16:51:34,wallstreetbets,Options also give the potential to lose everything. I wouldn’t dive in if I were you
2021-06-07 16:56:58,wallstreetbets,Watch videos explaining options then play around with a simulator before you spend money otherwis you’re asking to just burn it
2021-06-07 17:26:50,wallstreetbets,"If you’ve never traded before, I recommend waiting till you know wtf you’re doing before getting into options."

2021-06-07 16:25:57,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people do not realize as long as the institution shorting the stock has enough capital to stay out of margin they do not have to cover at any certain time. They could also be shorting at the new prices to try and make it up. It’s impossible to tell. That being said volume is so high it is making it very interesting. There are a couple of scenarios that could really blow this thing up !!!!!!!!!

2021-06-07 16:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Fellow apes: in order to enjoy never ending tendie time we me must focus on a small amount of tickers to squeeze FIRST - eg GME and AMC.

Key is to focus the amount of retards lowering the float so that Kenny and friends can’t possibly cover their shorts. The true diamond hands among us will then be able to ask for whatever price they want and Kenny and friends will have to deliver. That’ll result in many lambos per ape. After that we can hunt down the next ticker to squeeze - eg BB.

Let’s not spread ourselves thin but act as a true collective of retards so that tendie time will be one the prevalent time.

No financial advice. I’m retarded and can’t even read.

EDIT: spelling because I’m retarded."

2021-06-07 16:15:53,wallstreetbets,I wish people understood that AMC is the closest you’ll get to shorts needing to cover.  CLOV has HUGE potential.  They can’t afford to keep losing on AMC at these levels.
2021-06-07 18:02:37,wallstreetbets,AMC Loading Up
2021-06-07 16:18:26,wallstreetbets,What are the chances AMC goes 70+ and what are the chances AMC only goes down? Does anyone actually know? I’m new here and never worked at a Wendy’s before.

So they are constantly bleeding interest, run a time bomb of a share recall, and risk competing HFs that will cover their short position  which will squeeze the price up."

2021-06-07 16:25:59,wallstreetbets,Give me a goddamn frosty! AMC go past 70. Amc go moon.
2021-06-07 17:46:56,wallstreetbets,"Clearly it can go 5x lower as it was there just a couple weeks ago. It is extremely doubtful that it can go more than 1.5x up, and even if it did stock might only stay at that super high level for a short while before dropping so all diamond handers will be left bagholding."
2021-06-07 19:28:16,wallstreetbets,yup.
2021-06-07 17:23:12,wallstreetbets,That is correct. Also if dividends are involved they will be quicker to cover. They must pay the dividends on the borrowers stock. But I’m assuming we are talking AMC.
2021-06-07 17:11:04,wallstreetbets,I believe just some of the institutions have temporarily stopped shorting. I’m not 100 percent sure of this though. I read the same thing. But honestly they can still do whatever they want. That’s how they make their money. If they think they can make a profit borrowing against it they will.
2021-06-07 17:47:12,wallstreetbets,They still allow selling calls though. If they get exercises the seller can get a short position anyways.
2021-06-07 17:24:12,wallstreetbets,"I averaged up on GME from $45, to $80, to $115, to $150, I still don’t regret averaging up…."
2021-06-07 16:51:26,wallstreetbets,Averaging up is better than averaging down. It means your position is profitable already. When you average down you still have a losing position.
2021-06-07 16:37:04,wallstreetbets,All my friends are averaging up at this time. NFA
2021-06-07 17:06:56,wallstreetbets,"They are trying to distract everybody from the big squeezes (GME, AMC)."
2021-06-07 16:24:37,wallstreetbets,Not everyone has the same strategy as you. Lots of us have more than one play. Both BB and AMC have been good to me.
2021-06-07 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,BB cannot move without AMC. Short interest is to low for a short squeeze.
2021-06-07 18:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Not everything needs to be a “sQueEZE” to be a money maker. The recent GME and AMC movement has simply priced out a lot of newer investors. BB is cheap, but certainly not a squeeze candidate. It’s better, it’s is a solid long term EV/security reinvention play, that has no issues being along for the ride on the “meme wagon”."
2021-06-07 17:43:57,wallstreetbets,Yes I know but it was predicted to hit 90 by Friday
2021-06-07 17:53:16,wallstreetbets,That’s how I’m seeing it but people get so mad when you point it out.
2021-06-07 18:23:49,wallstreetbets,That's why I'm fucking glued to the charts 6am to make sure I don't miss the high point.

2021-06-07 16:45:15,wallstreetbets,"You reach a point, where the play has already happened on AMC. Between its current price,  and IV levels. Theres a lot of risk. Without so much upside anymore. Reasonable people move on to other plays. Where the stock hasn't already went up 8x with 800% IV."
2021-06-07 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,Sure am. Literally said I was new here.
2021-06-07 18:05:31,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, the play hasn’t happened and it consistently has the highest returns. Besides if you diversify into other meme stonks, you are still at risk. Gme or amc tanking will still pull all the others down. You don’t diversify to get into essentially the same thing with a different ticker."
2021-06-07 17:00:02,wallstreetbets,"He’s right^ but by moving, you can always play with free $$ you made from AMC and BB. Don’t know why he got down voted other than some twatcicle didn’t prefer his educated reply and wanted a played diamond hands reply. Grow up turd burgler"
2021-06-07 18:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Theres no play left for me. I dont believe in the short squeeze, and options are unplayable at the current IV unless you believe in a squeeze. BB still has relatively safe plays. CSPs at 200% IV. And the stock isn't even 2x. So of you miscalculate and get assigned your not left with a lifetime of bags that you can never unload"
2021-06-07 19:37:03,wallstreetbets,He's not right because the play hasn't happened.  Short interest in AMC has only increased over the last week.  The squeeze hasn't started.
2021-06-07 19:06:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I only got into AMC for 100 shares when it was in the $9s and below...because I believed (after a big institutional buy at a higher price) that this was at least a $12 company. A mid-teens to $20 company—and I believe that truly.

It just so happened that after I sold off 70 of my shares, it started going fucking nuttttttts! I'm still in for some of my original investment, but I'm not trying to gamble it all on a short squeeze I'm not super convinced of.

but like let's moon it for my last 10 shares plz rocket rocket rocket fire fire fire"
2021-06-07 18:14:04,wallstreetbets,"True, sometimes you gotta know when to stand back and watch."
2021-06-07 17:22:02,wallstreetbets,"In terms of transformation, GME is today what Blackberry was 8 years ago. GME looks to be starting a transforming  from a Brick and Mortar shop to digital. Blackberry underwent a major transformation from hardware company to software as a service. It is now starting to heavily market the products resulting from that transformation and is expecting double digit growth going forward according to management."
2021-06-07 18:49:00,wallstreetbets,$GME I’m jacked to the TITS! 🚀🚀🚀🚀letssszzgooooooo
2021-06-07 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,"It kind of follows it a bit cause of the association as others have mentioned. 

However, GME’s market cap is 2.5x as large as BB’s. AMC’s is 3.5x as large. These multiples need to be applied to BB appropriately with the buy and sell orders + options trading to reflect the same *magnitude* of movement. This means that 2/5ths of the volume vs GME and 2/7ths of the volume vs AMC. In other words, it takes way less to move the price of BB.

Now this is where I get a bit perplexed… BB has been the lead ticker in this sub for the last week and is not moving at a larger magnitude relative to GME and AMC. In addition, this stock is not only a hidden gold mine but also has its dick beaten down for 5 months straight. Just my honest opinion, but I see WAY more promise in terms of future growth and value a few years down the line compared to most amped up stocks in this sub. BB is the play. Always has been. Many are realizing now that this company has a short term opportunity with very minimal downside in the long term. It’s the perfect place to park money for massive returns. HOWEVER, the *magnitude* of these movements in BB are not 2.5-3.5x larger than GME and AMC. That is very very weird. Perhaps buy and sell indicators for day traders are being primarily based off of AMC is my theory. 

This is all going to change though! I am sure most of you dumb asses know recently it has followed suit of AMC, but I don’t think it will anymore for long, but instead it will break free and find it’s own pattern. I actually think it will end up being the leading pattern pretty soon here. More and more people will realize that BB can make way more money from this point forward. It has only doubled from it’s low a few weeks back. AMC has grown substantially more than this. 

Would you rather FOMO into AMC that already exploded or get into BB before it has exploded? Why can’t we see this shift in sentiment reflected into the market cap of BB? If it were to catch up to AMC’s current market cap, that would make it priced in at $55+ per share. PLUS, this isn’t even a fair comparison because AMC as a company does not have the same promise in the future as BB. It could go way way higher than $55 per share. 

PS. I think AMC still has room to grow but I see better opportunity with new money in BB from what I discussed above.

This is not financial advice. I am retarded."
2021-06-07 16:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Cause it's the same group of people who is buying into all these meme stocks.

And then high frequency trading just following the trend/momentum."
2021-06-07 16:31:04,wallstreetbets,BB is just like AMC.  Look at that chart as well.
2021-06-07 17:34:36,wallstreetbets,It's likely BB apes are GME apes and GME apes are BB apes.
2021-06-07 16:54:06,wallstreetbets,BB is the only out of the meme stocks with true potential

2021-06-07 17:03:40,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 4 weeks
2021-06-07 19:08:59,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking a lot about the lack of movement as well and think it's going to get very interesting this week. A lot of January bag holders and long time BB holders took profits off the table when it hit 20$, but now we are exactly back at 16 and growing by about 15% a day (which is in itself already huge).

I see the main problem that a lot of option buyers purchase at the money option, and don't gamble on the 40$ calls or higher, meaning there is a smaller chance for a gamma ramp to be hit.

I can still see this though happening, just as AMC went from 30 to 40 and then straight to 70. That's market makers buying shares to cover part of their call sales and get their delta back to neutral. If WSB can be retarded enough to buy a few thousand more 30 and 40 calls, MMs will be forced to buy up the shares and we could very well hit 50 in a week or two."
2021-06-07 16:15:03,wallstreetbets,Is there a hilltop this can be shouted from that will ensure we don't see some variation of this question/observation 20x a day on wsb and the various stonk subs?
2021-06-07 16:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Unlike GME, BB has a lot more going for it then GME did at the beginning of their spike. If BB doesn’t get tampered with by retail platforms could be pretty crazy."

2021-06-07 17:37:05,wallstreetbets,"You don’t get to post gains until you sell. 

It’s all magic and dust until you realize it."
2021-06-07 17:38:58,wallstreetbets,I think if you sold some of the shares then bought a few hundred calls for a dollar lower than whatever you sold at to make the market makers buy 100 shares that would be a clutch play. then also buy a few hundred calls for a dollar over whatever the current price is when you go to sell your shares in the morning.
2021-06-07 17:40:04,wallstreetbets,Cant you do any better?
2021-06-07 17:42:12,wallstreetbets,Good fucking shit. Looks at my 5k gains on CLOV
2021-06-07 17:42:14,wallstreetbets,"Fuck's sakes. I so wanted to buy Clov but couldn't verify my account soon enough because the address on my bank is outdated..

This could be me!.. three orders of magnitude lower."

It was a super safe investment in a company that he believed had upside and it just happens to have some really good immediate upside.

Clover is not it. Opendoor and Virgin Galactic were the first 2 from Chamath and those are very promising. Opendoor especially is great.

Clover is an absolute trashcan that Wall Street sold off on as soon as it was announced and then backed up by the short report from Hindenburg. 

It drilled 40% upon IPO for good reason. It's an awful company. If you want a good Chamath company, opendoor is the best imo."

It gets remade every morning and will serve as a hype den for 24 hours based on what the 3 top talked about stocks are. I added some reasonably crafty mitigation for ticker spam so **don't bother spamming your favorite ticker**, it will get ignored.

2021-06-07 16:57:43,wallstreetbets,"I think there's a bit of a misunderstanding running around about CLNE. They actually already did this exact offering back on May 10th, finished their sell-off AS OF June 7th and started their second round. This means that the price has gone up in the recent few days despite this.

And to clarify, they're not selling 100M **shares**, they're selling enough shares to **raise** $100,000,000."
2021-06-07 16:59:54,wallstreetbets,"CLNE reaction really shows most of you are actual apes and not retards.

For a company like CLNE, it is actually not a bad thing in the long term as they need to expand their network. Sure on the very short term it is not bullish, but it s a legitimate expansion.

Market was neutral today. It was red at opening and started climbing back up before market closed today. Inflation news was brought back this morning and caused the market to go red. Guess any new inflation news will still scare everyone to sell. Bought a $423 put on SPY this morning. Hard to say which direction the market will be going this week as we had a lot of bulls the past week. Taking a chance on SPY going down to $420 this week"

2021-06-07 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,"Holding CLNE, CLOV, and RKT.

CLNE issuing new shares is something 2 other incredibly popular meme stocks did to clear out debt and grow the company. So far its just a filing and not actually a sale. They probably believe that the squeeze at 13 will happen and want to cash in as well. Same thing others did.

CLOV is just straight a beast today!

RKT I am up on.

 I think each one is a long term hold with meme capabilities."

The yield will stay at this level or go down. The unemployment numbers might continue to disappoint and not meet expectations - and take a long time to recover. In the Short term inflation could be a problem. But in the long run, the real Fed problem still remains disinflation. [Link](https://twitter.com/EconguyRosie/status/1400064931060387840?s=09)

I have been flip flopping between being a bear and a bull over the last 3 months. But now I am beginning to lean towards the bull side. I think we have between in the accumulation stage for a while and hence consolidating, especially for tech stocks.

Institutional investors are most likely all in on the reflation hypothesis. They have sold tech whenever they have got a chance. Hence the underperformance. But now, the narrative is probably shifting now. Nothing big cap has moved much of late. But tech is slowly making a comeback.

Now I am bullish on Nasdaq names again, because of the above reasons. It can only go wrong if Fed announces something unexpected - like interest rate hike or taper or something. Which I don't think they will. They are balls deep in QE now. So much so that now if they turn back, it will break a lot of things. They can't afford to do that."

2021-06-07 16:18:13,wallstreetbets,My prediction: CLOV will continue to move upwards resulting in a herd mentality to mention it in the daily thread. It will then go to the Top 3 meme thread. On day 2 in that thread it will begin to fall while simultaneously a new ticker will have an upward spike and be constantly mentioned in the daily thread. Rinse and repeat
2021-06-07 16:27:32,wallstreetbets,CLOV ftw
2021-06-07 16:33:24,wallstreetbets,Speculation! I think CLOV is going to be the biggest thing behind GME… why do I say that? That dang chart today looked like a trajectory straight to Mars(it isn’t following the same trends as other meme stocks) and it has some solid fundamentals. I like the stock.

True statement. Another true statement is that it's also abused heavily, in ways that our regulatory framework is unwilling to, and in some cases, is not empowered to, penalize appropriately.

The first real restrictions my smooth brain can think of anyone imposing on short-selling, since the uptick rule went away, have been a direct response to the billions of dollars lost by HFs gaped by surging meme stocks.

To protect the banks, really, since enough of these high-frequency low-analysis fucks in fitted suits overextending themselves could crash the market (again)."

2021-06-07 16:12:49,wallstreetbets,"I had said in my own reply to this thread:

>It didn't perform as well as I thought it would today from perceived   
hype... but all it has to do is average a 2% bump per day to trigger a   
Gamma Squeeze on the 18th... And even if it doesn't, projected valuation  
 over 12 months place it between $12 and $20 conservatively without the   
hype bump. so at a min, it's +20%, and likely +100% increase, with   
potentially +200% increase."

I'm very fortunate to have gone from $2,600 to $174,000 in seven months, but as GME, MVIS, NIO, and AMC - the majority of my gains - have inflated in such a silly manner, I can always wonder: ""Why not more?"""

I’m talking not only balls but the cuck ring I was wearing as well, was swallowed up into the ass of AMC. This meeting of bawls and ass sired many gains.

I’m pretty sure that I planted such an inconceivable genetic mutation into the ass womb of AMC that she will birth me the most astounding, albino, triple cornea, 4 balled water baby. I can’t abort.

I can lose the 20% entirely and still retire in about six years.  But... if I can get even one of these moonshots to hit big, I'm looking to move that date up to as early as this year.  In order to do that, I am willing to risk the significant gains I'm sitting on with CLOV, UWMC and GME.  If one of those pops big, I'm retiring in two years.  If all three of them pop - I'm retired by Christmas. 

If I did not have the level of financial security I have, I would probably have cashed in my chips on these three stocks already.  But it isn't life changing for me to take my current gains and run, so I'm letting it all ride."

2021-06-07 16:02:01,wallstreetbets,Some people are in it to join a collective bigger then the money. Joining together against the big establishment is almost impossible and these apes stumbled upping a way to fuck the hedge fund guys who are scum bags. This will change how things operate but when everyone cashes out then it doesn't have the same affect. I'm all for making money so do what you feel is necessary for you but together we are greater than the sum of the parts.
2021-06-07 17:33:57,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhh CLOV you are blooming so nicely. 

310 @ $9.94 in “trading account”
375 @ $9.83 in “Roth account” nothing better than massive gains in a 100% tax free haven. ;-)"
2021-06-07 19:20:49,wallstreetbets,Umm bc gme moon soon duh. Clov not having bad run either.
2021-06-07 15:56:04,wallstreetbets,Wish I'd read this a week ago before I got my oil change. Noted for next time.

2021-06-07 15:48:40,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-07 19:36:05,wallstreetbets,Fuck ain't that the truth lmfao one night i yolo'd 3k on a creditcard for some online casino spinning 75 dollar bets lost it all in an hour put another 3k and was down to my last 200 and hit 13k never again though but what a fucking rush lol
2021-06-07 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,Get out of my mind donkey!
2021-06-07 16:08:44,wallstreetbets,The truest answer. It's not the money. We want hedge funds to burn.
2021-06-07 16:28:40,wallstreetbets,"So true. I am sick if the filthy rich owning everything, giving us little people nothing and everyday is a struggle with the hope that one day will be fine. If me holding my shares can screw up some rich peoples ass I am so down! This is not about the money. Its personal! Financial freedom is what drives me. Getting an opportunity to work with whatever I want whenever I want. Do whatever I want. And more than anything. Help others in my situation!"
2021-06-07 16:21:31,wallstreetbets,Don’t panic unless it’s an option.
2021-06-07 16:12:50,wallstreetbets,Why would you panic sell? Its going to the moon.
2021-06-07 16:12:48,wallstreetbets,When's the expiry?  Or did you go in on shares?
2021-06-07 15:50:34,wallstreetbets,It's good.
2021-06-07 16:57:38,wallstreetbets,It's what apes crave

2021-06-07 16:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've taken to cashing out half of every position once it doubles. It takes most of the stress away - once you're guaranteed to break even, it's just numbers on a screen.

Probably makes me a paper handed wimp, but it helps me sleep and night, and my wife's death threats against me are down 60%."

My whole DD:Tendies in the front, blowies in the back.

2021-06-07 16:54:54,wallstreetbets,I mean this is the exact issue. To someone who can’t buy groceries $150 might feel like cashing out money. To someone who was about to retire in 2007 and lost it all and has to work they might not be able to cash out until they hit two million.
2021-06-07 17:16:46,wallstreetbets,Right? What happened to post or ban like post the position you say u have or get banned?

2021-06-07 16:09:15,wallstreetbets,"Yup, the good old leverage story. Learn your derivatives and stonk properly."
2021-06-07 19:21:49,wallstreetbets,"This is very good analysis. Thank you!! And since TQQQ is triple leveraged, and 30% drawdown is around the tipping point where things get tricky to start climbing back out of...that means a 10% drop in underlying shares triggers some recovery issues."
2021-06-07 16:48:55,wallstreetbets,You can always switch to.the sqqq / qqqs when the crash occurs
2021-06-07 17:36:29,wallstreetbets,"I posted this article a few weeks ago in a thread about TQQQ. As soon as TQQQ draws down to $55, I'm going all in on this strategy. Until then, too much sideways trading and there are plenty of better opportunities."

2021-06-07 16:34:40,wallstreetbets,"This has to be a shitpost.  What kind of new, low-value trader plays on 10x leverage without even knowing the difference between confirming a long vs short?  It doesn't make sense at any level.  


Unless he knew about the leverage and somehow got confused about long vs short.  In which case, it puts the whole thing in a different light where greed instead of stupidity led to ruin.  Which is perfect for this sub."

Absolutely don't let your dad pick a wife for you...unless he picks a rich one, then you might make more money divorcing than you ever would trading.

Then again, I doubt your dad is gonna find a way to contractually obligate you to marry a girl in the future...so maybe just take the money then blow him off when he tries to pick a bride.

Also, you're not in the red, you're just broke. Is your dad gonna break your legs if you don't pay him back right away? I don't understand why you'd try to take out a loan."
2021-06-07 15:57:34,wallstreetbets,"Ugh, another karma prostitution post. Ban this guy already and with his bullshit story.

2021-06-07 15:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Says discussion. I hope it's fake, but my interest is peaked. I'm new to this shit too, at 31 years old, so I'm hoping someone can give this kid some sound advice."
2021-06-07 15:54:17,wallstreetbets,I heard it's one mulligan per account.
2021-06-07 17:25:22,wallstreetbets,Insurance is a must in this economy. I pay my $420.69 every month just in case.
2021-06-07 16:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, it was $4k! Dude could pay his dad and be back in the game in two weeks putting in time behind a Wendy’s."
2021-06-07 17:38:11,wallstreetbets,"""She's got huge.... tracts of land"""
2021-06-07 17:04:51,wallstreetbets,"Wrong wording sorry, was typing this while really stressed"
2021-06-07 17:25:19,wallstreetbets,I have spoken.

2021-06-07 15:58:04,wallstreetbets,Piqued.
2021-06-07 16:20:29,wallstreetbets,Whoa 😳 i didnt know that
2021-06-07 16:54:56,wallstreetbets,With the margin?
2021-06-07 16:00:40,wallstreetbets,"The traditional idiom is to pique one's interest, with pique meaning “to provoke or arouse.” Like perk, however, peaked can also make sense in context. Peak means “to bring to a maximum value or intensity,”"
2021-06-07 16:00:19,wallstreetbets,I always thought it was peaked too but I was once aggressively reminded that it is actually piqued. Now I will never forget
2021-06-07 16:00:50,wallstreetbets,Mom? Get the fuck of reddit!
2021-06-07 17:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh damn, that’s a good point!"
2021-06-07 16:30:49,wallstreetbets,Now I feel more retarded...
2021-06-07 17:06:45,wallstreetbets,I actually peeked thru a window once

2021-06-07 15:58:01,wallstreetbets,"That CLNE buy wall at $10 and sell at $11 reeks of something afoul. Could be just my arse. On second thought, it's my arse. Carry on."
2021-06-07 16:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Long Options on CLNE and SNDL, BB as a short position, CLOV not savvy enough to say. IMO."
2021-06-07 16:11:36,wallstreetbets,CLNE will go the distance. I'm ready!
2021-06-07 15:29:40,wallstreetbets,Just got in on Blackberry
2021-06-07 16:17:01,wallstreetbets,Just bought 162 more shares at 3:59 of CLNE — at 507 now. 9.89 cost basis! 🚀🦍

Just compare it to Crowdstrike and you’ll understand. If not, buy anyway. 🚀

2021-06-07 15:32:44,wallstreetbets,"I’m a SNDL bear and it’s well known, but it’s a garbage company. Horrible books, management has screwed over shareholders multiple times. Wouldn’t get into that if I was paid to. With that said, CLNE ganggg"

BB was already worth it for me."
2021-06-07 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,"I bet heavy on BB, paid off. I moved it to SNDL. I feel like it’s next. I did miss the CLOV run."
2021-06-07 15:46:11,wallstreetbets,CLOV has 105% institutional ownership on Nasdaq. Very very shady here. It also has the highest SI in the market after WKHS. CLOV is the DADDY OF ALL SQUEEZES. DOASS!!!!!!!
2021-06-07 16:13:31,wallstreetbets,20k shares long on SNDL

2021-06-07 17:42:19,wallstreetbets,Holy shit actual DD? Someone get this man an award
2021-06-07 18:01:50,wallstreetbets,Marijuana is going to be fully legal here soon in the US. The momentum is on its side but the problem is finding the companies that will be the bear bringers. SNDL looks good but surely there is something better right?
2021-06-07 18:14:45,wallstreetbets,CLOV I’m all in!
2021-06-07 18:19:41,wallstreetbets,I can’t see any downside up here from the moon 🌕🚀
2021-06-07 15:49:25,wallstreetbets,CLOV I like the stonk. Plus I believe the short interest is somewhere around 30-40% and people are aware of the relationship between WSB and shorts
2021-06-07 15:50:05,wallstreetbets,$clov got good fundamentals with a bright future and a very high short float. So I cLove them 🍀💎🚀
2021-06-07 16:42:45,wallstreetbets,CLNE offering. FML
2021-06-07 16:32:23,wallstreetbets,Pot stocks are just strong long term buys right now. This is an industry that is about to explode. Every state in the US is just falling one by one to legalization. It is only a matter of time before this business is HUGE and not operating in the shadows.
2021-06-07 16:36:18,wallstreetbets,Let’s talk booty cheeks
2021-06-07 15:49:32,wallstreetbets,BB or Clov 🤔 both.
2021-06-07 15:32:34,wallstreetbets,"No chance they have any downside, the massive short interest is all wrong I'm sure."
2021-06-07 16:12:48,wallstreetbets,I'm currently long CLOV for the short term but its downside is it is backed by a schemy SPAC pusher. Chamath is a fraud
2021-06-07 16:53:28,wallstreetbets,"I was down on another option call, saw the DD on CLOV and sold off what I had and dumped it in CLOV calls. Thanks Apes for the push! Now just need to put some into shares."
2021-06-07 19:24:34,wallstreetbets,They all have shitty fundamentals. But that's not the point of all this.
2021-06-07 19:53:05,wallstreetbets,fundamental? give a date and strike you fucking retard
2021-06-07 18:09:48,wallstreetbets,"SNDL is a fucking joke, there was absolutely 0 fundamentals in this post. Also you're preaching to retards...so you're trying too hard. Do less."
2021-06-07 15:41:26,wallstreetbets,"everyone talks about YOLO plays, so I make YOLO plays, if you know what I mean

this is not financial advice"
2021-06-07 16:12:09,wallstreetbets,"be careful, I had most of them, and I lost half of them, did not buy them back based on fundamental, they are all speculative, so the price you see today won't hold"
2021-06-07 17:40:18,wallstreetbets,Been posting on Daily Discussion in WSB  all good on CLNE 💎🤲 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-07 17:39:39,wallstreetbets,"I made a DD that was very developed and followed rules, got deleted immediately.  The mods straight up have an agenda against it lmao"
2021-06-07 16:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Lots of CLOV posts have been getting removed too, some very developed. Just think the mods have something against anything that isn't GME or AMC"
2021-06-07 19:49:01,wallstreetbets,Look for those 6/18 calls. CLNE has potential.
2021-06-07 16:19:05,wallstreetbets,"it's almost as if we can't talk about CLNE alone in a post, or it will get removed, so we have to include it in with other tickers...even though it's the number 2 most mentioned ticker in wsb."
2021-06-07 15:46:56,wallstreetbets,From dog coin to cow stock. CLNE 💎
2021-06-07 17:09:52,wallstreetbets,CLNE!!!!!
2021-06-07 16:42:00,wallstreetbets,I bought clne at 1.15 sold at 18 I'm good
2021-06-07 18:43:18,wallstreetbets,I got suckered into buying BB for some reason but ya my favorites are CLOV and CLNE.
2021-06-07 16:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I see a downside. 
 
Whenever I check the profile of anyone YOLOing huge amounts of cash into one of the above stocks, their profile is almost always EXTREMELY sketchy. 
 
We’re talking three day old accounts or 5 year old accounts that have been dormant for the last 4. Karma in the low hundreds. Multiple “all in” posts that contradict each other. Sudden changes in the stocks they’re “100% passionate about” that make no sense. 
 
**There is something going on here, but it ain’t fundamentals.** 
 
Be careful what you read on WSB."
2021-06-07 16:36:51,wallstreetbets,CLOV has HUGE potential in a space with TONS of money and major problems. The real downside is that the payer space has huge barriers to entry and there are so many failures with people seeking to truly disrupt US healthcare. CLOV seems to be adopting tech into healthcare though in a way that has not been truly successful in the past. The issue with healthcare IT is that so much of the space is outdated (especially end users) so coming in with flashy new tech sometimes is too much to be adopted. Its like dropping a lambo on a farm..you can't drive it anywhere. If they manage to actually achieve what they set out to do it should be a very strong long play.

2021-06-07 19:13:14,wallstreetbets,It is well known that FalconGhost is a SNDL bear.  Everyone knows that.
2021-06-07 15:45:53,wallstreetbets,I disagree with you about SNDL but also CLNE ganggg.
2021-06-07 16:34:18,wallstreetbets,If there’s one thing I love with my weed it’s plastic and mold
2021-06-07 16:34:03,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't 105% institutional ownership mean they have the most to gain from it?
2021-06-07 17:15:01,wallstreetbets,How many employees does clove have?  Robbin hood shows only 4 employees?? Wtf? Lol
2021-06-07 15:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Equity growing....

Your equity in the company has exploded to the downside. The debt is down because they took your money, made it worth less, and paid down the debt

Imagine if you needed home repairs, so you just let 10 million more people own your home. That’s how equity works, yes you paid off your mortgage but you own way less of your home

Just look at the year 1 chart lol"
2021-06-07 18:51:41,wallstreetbets,GME did great today.  I can't believe that's still a thing.  Cool though.
2021-06-07 16:06:41,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-06-07 18:52:29,wallstreetbets,Cannabis industry ETFs? I've got POTX which SNDL and TLRY are both held in.  Im just a retard but that seems like the way to go for things with actual growth potential in the next decade or two. Clean energy too.
2021-06-07 18:53:08,wallstreetbets,Yep.  Like sharks that smell blood.  Load up on CLOV now.
2021-06-07 17:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Expected, wont be enough to prevent us shooting up, hopefully, can go south tho, dont know..."

2021-06-07 19:44:02,wallstreetbets,India*n 🤢🤢🤮
2021-06-07 18:50:08,wallstreetbets,That’s why i get hella skeptical when i start seeing floods of AMC or CLOV posts. Mods are known to be compromised so it’s fishy when they allow low effort spam posts through and filter out legit DD
2021-06-07 18:36:57,wallstreetbets,"It's wild seeing people say the mods have something against things that aren't gme and amc given how many of those posts get deleted.

The mods just delete a lot of everything, it isn't a conspiracy, they're just retarded."
2021-06-07 18:23:29,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much , i got clowned just for even bringing up bb awhile ago."
2021-06-07 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,\^\^ This.  Mods are balls deep in one particular meme and only allow that stock to have posts.  Instantly delete anything else.  Worse than Melvin.  At least Melvin never pretended to be on our side.
2021-06-07 16:40:09,wallstreetbets,Interesting. I haven’t read a developed one yet but I haven’t really looked closely either. It burned me once so I’m averse LOL
2021-06-07 16:27:20,wallstreetbets,Start on wsb and then move or create a page for CLNE
2021-06-07 16:57:44,wallstreetbets,"If you're lying, fuck you, if you're telling the truth, awesome but also fuck you."
2021-06-07 19:43:50,wallstreetbets,"BB is good, just longer term than CLNE even.

Just tuck BB away and forget about it for a year. You'll be happy."
2021-06-07 17:46:31,wallstreetbets,Good Call.  I like my odds.  20 years in and around the game. I see CLNE to the upshot.
2021-06-07 18:11:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to be doxed via my main. My intuition says that it's better to separate talking about money from my other identities. WSB has 150K users online right now. That's a lot of eyes. I figure if you suddenly gain/lose a bunch of money, people have more of an incentive to dox you. Good chance you're either rich or desperate."
2021-06-07 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,True.  WSB has been compromised.
2021-06-07 17:37:00,wallstreetbets,"How is having an old account scetchy? I created my account 4 years ago for a completely different purpose, then in february I heard about GME and has since bought meme stocks such as GME AMC NOK and CLOV to ride the hype train. What's sketchy about that?"

2021-06-07 18:58:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's not even fishy at this point considering how blatant they're being lmao.  I just treat wsb as entertainment and use other subreddits for actual discussion.

2021-06-07 16:53:38,wallstreetbets,Agree but he should have a price range in mind and used an option calculator to maximize gains based on that price range.  I wanna know his price range.  My guess he picked it blind 😂

2021-06-07 15:32:10,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised no one seems to be talking about the memestocks that are going the opposite direction from BB/GME/AMC.  Think that may be a signal to buy up some BBY
2021-06-07 15:27:34,wallstreetbets,People are noticing CLOV now. I still don't get where all the hype for BB is.

2021-06-07 16:12:16,wallstreetbets,Not GME?
2021-06-07 17:43:45,wallstreetbets,Because they are honestly hands down clueless what’s really going on  and think everything is going to “moon”
2021-06-07 16:48:32,wallstreetbets,it doesnt make any sense for 10M people to be fed a single ticker when there’s so much opportunity
2021-06-07 17:15:55,wallstreetbets,yea but you're not supposed to just come out and say that or the paid campaign will b compromised
2021-06-07 17:10:11,wallstreetbets,I hope it hits 13 tomorrow
2021-06-07 16:44:43,wallstreetbets,I guess the wife will have to unpack her bags now

2021-06-07 15:29:52,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-07 15:46:25,wallstreetbets,"What's good with CLOV? 30% up today so far damn      
Preach to me"
2021-06-07 15:59:26,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, where did you hear about this? Did you just look into sector's that benefit from the pandemic ending? That's what I did. Picked parks and rec services for the summer"
2021-06-07 15:32:06,wallstreetbets,that's what I thought too...he posted one here and one in his own sub.
2021-06-07 17:16:08,wallstreetbets,"Wait, apes wear clothes???"
2021-06-07 17:54:42,wallstreetbets,"I think they're upset at GME still being a thing, it ain't our fault robinhood suppressed the price and now we're trying to make our money back or make a profit. They act like we were wrong about GME going to the moon."
2021-06-07 17:52:36,wallstreetbets,"i get that but it really isn't, like having $500 in GME is same as $500 in AMC, just more shares in AMC but I guess new investors don't get that."
2021-06-07 17:20:27,wallstreetbets,Stop being a clown no ticker over 1bn is banned.
2021-06-07 18:30:11,wallstreetbets,"ur right, and it’s waste. sorry to be that guy"
2021-06-07 16:18:17,wallstreetbets,Absolutely GME. Mods compromised
2021-06-07 16:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Already dropped that bag. GME has been good to me. But, so does AMC, BB, MVIS and now CLOV. Some of us can carry only few bags."
2021-06-07 16:00:11,wallstreetbets,"It started trending on r/wsb, I followed along and I like what I see"
2021-06-07 17:57:32,wallstreetbets, LOL yeah it’s comedy and then they jack our memes and add dfv to other stocks  acting like they are going to “moon” also   Don’t get me wrong thing they will have a little squeeze but nothing like gme. And that’s where the hate comes from
2021-06-07 17:55:17,wallstreetbets,GME was and is always the way. AMC and a few others have diluted the effort. Now things have spiraled
2021-06-07 16:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but GME will be the louis vuitton bag and the rest are 99c store knock offs."
2021-06-07 17:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Bro he don’t get it don’t waist energy
  gme!!$"
2021-06-07 16:26:59,wallstreetbets,We are only here for the profits. Not just aimlessly carrying bags. If you made your money find other plays or just stay there.
2021-06-07 16:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, and its why opportunity cost is king. If you feel those will get you the biggest bang for your buck… more power to you."
2021-06-07 16:36:28,wallstreetbets,Unless you have unlimited funds. Some of us can't play all of them at the same time. Buying AMC at just over $9 and buying GME over $200 which makes sense to you?
2021-06-07 16:54:50,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, i bought my AMC at $3, and my GME everywhere from $14-$260. The share price itself isnt as relevant as *how far will it go from this purchase price*."
2021-06-07 16:50:11,wallstreetbets,"GME every time.  14 days a week, 36 hours a day, until the end of time.  It's the only real play."
2021-06-07 17:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Everyone has their targets. I have a monthly target to hit. If i make substantial profit, i will always run for the hills. I did went to back to GME twice. Eventually took that money and placed it on other plays. MVIS, AMC and BB have all been good to me."
2021-06-07 15:08:41,wallstreetbets,Yes I would like fries to go with that logic please. 🍟

2021-06-07 15:17:13,wallstreetbets,i sell nothing untill 150 USD
2021-06-07 18:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Thats how I got burned. I was up $2200 within 5 minutes of opening my May21 calls and thought to myself, ""If its up this much in 5 minutes, how high will it go!?!?!"", instead of taking the obvious gains and then getting back in later. This is a flaw of mine that Ive made the mistake of repeating several times now."
2021-06-07 18:43:12,wallstreetbets,"But it's also how I miss out on large gains. Every position in profit I sell early goes up further, every position in profit I hold goes down."

2021-06-07 19:11:57,wallstreetbets,"But how do you justify getting back in later? You mean after it dips? In which case, how would you know when it's ready to dip? I did that for crypto and *almost* got burned. Fortunately, it came back up again, and I was able to sell my position with a minor profit."
2021-06-07 18:04:26,wallstreetbets,Europoor student whose life won’t change with 20k? You belong here

2021-06-07 19:14:26,wallstreetbets,"Thats the problem isnt it. No one knows. Thats what makes it so difficult to get out of losing positions and so difficult to time a good entrance.

Companies don't """"print"""" from turning a profit, they do from investors investing. If this clinical turns out positive, the raw potential in the company will be apparent to investors and it will go to the moon. 

Imagine being so autistic that you think biotech is a static field that can't change."
2021-06-07 19:59:57,wallstreetbets,Imagine being so retarded that thinking 2-3 years is enough for a 200% price increase because of a single study thats not even guaranteed to yield positive results and will probably take over 3 years to conduct

2021-06-07 15:20:49,wallstreetbets,"There aren’t too many things more funny than the countless Wendy’s jokes on here daily. Marketing is second to none and I can only imagine the trendy ass posts from their Twitter if the share price started upward movement because of WSB. 

$WEN chicken nuggies are arguably #1 on the planet (spicy or original it doesn’t fucking matter) and with enough apes behind this maybe we can get the company to add tendies back nationwide in the US. And don’t even get me started on the chili 🤤

It’s just meta enough where it makes damn good sense. Fundamentals are for squares I’m in with 12x 8/20 29C.  Not financial advice I just like the menu 🏃🏾‍♂️"

All in Wendys"
2021-06-07 15:48:16,wallstreetbets,"It's silly, but I honestly don't think this WEN play is as dumb as some people make it out to be. If it catches on, you make bank getting in at the start. If it doesn't, the stock prbly just goes sideways and you lose little, if anything. Makes more sense than a lot of the plays I see on WSB"
2021-06-07 15:03:32,wallstreetbets,Should we add it to the already other thousand names that are already on the list for the next big short squeeze
2021-06-07 15:08:36,wallstreetbets,The next squires will be to save our trusted companies that are being bankrupt
2021-06-07 15:14:48,wallstreetbets,I could see Wendy’s potentially gaining traction in a few months now that restrictions are loosening. Plus their $5 baggie is pretty decent too
2021-06-07 15:32:12,wallstreetbets,"You know what. WENDY’s HAS ALWAYS fuckin been there for me when I needed those $1 chicken sandwiches. 
Fuck it, im going in on WENDYS. wendy’s is next APES 🦍📈🦍📈🦍"
2021-06-07 16:26:41,wallstreetbets,"WEN is going to explode once people realize the potential. Retail is now moving the market wherever it wants and Wendy's is going to start looking real cheap once a lot of the new players realize how absurd 300% IV on options is. 

If this moves even 10% it will be a huge options play. Just buy stocks as well. Obligatory, this is not financial advice."

2021-06-07 19:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Rapid International Expansion To Drive Accelerated Growth. With a view to achieve its targeted global footprint of 8,000 restaurants by YE2025, WEN signed several agreements with foreign master franchisees over F1Q2021. Specifically, it inked deals to introduce 50 restaurants in Central Asia by FY2030 and double its restaurant footprint in Quebec in Canada. In addition, in a major development, WEN is positioned to debut in the United Kingdom, with the launch of its first two restaurants during FY2021. Moreover, the firm is currently evaluating 20 franchisees in the geography, and believes that it could eventually launch 400 restaurants in the region. Furthermore, 130 additional foreign franchisee applications are in various stages of processing.

Importantly, at the end of the first quarter, WEN had 6,838 stores in 31 countries comprised of 5,885 stores in the U.S. and 953 stores in international regions. 95% of the U.S. footprint is franchisee owned and operated. International stores are entirely owned and operated by master franchisees. The company has set a long-term annualized new unit development growth objective of 3%, comprised of 1% and 10% potential growth from the U.S. and overseas.

We believe that WEN's international diversification strategy is the right maneuver at the right time. Given, its growing brand recognition across the world, the company is in a position to attract well funded and competent master franchisees, which is critical to ensure long-term success. In addition, the firm's operations and unit economics are sufficiently well developed to replicate the success it has achieved in North America in other key regions of the world."

2021-06-07 17:09:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, which makes it even better.  My nephew always asks why the burger hangs out from the buns and I always tell him it’s because Wendy’s burgers are square and they don’t want to cut corners off lol"

2021-06-07 16:53:05,wallstreetbets,"have a hunch the next test flight will be announced this week, and will possibly take place this weekend or next (weather permitting). this would then allow Sir Richard to fly on the the third (second to last) test flight to space on his birthday, July 18th.

it's still early in SPCE, sub $9bn market cap.. SpaceX recently raised at a $74bn valuation, wouldn't be surprised if BO was in that ballpark as well, just because,  well, its Bezos 🍆...

i think SPCE has a lot of room to run over the next 6 months,  happy to be along for ride 🚀"
2021-06-07 17:33:09,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is the most obvious long term investment and potential squeeze candidate.

It should be exactly what wsb is looking for, but the mods here are hellbent on running an AMC/GME cult. They have been deleting so many SPCE posts here it’s insane."
2021-06-07 16:19:34,wallstreetbets,"It’s gonna break $100 I just see it. Some might say the valuation doesn’t make sense or whatever but the interest is so high in the space that it’s very hard to put a proper valuation on it. Everyone is guessing anyways so the space is dominated by 2 to 3 players at most so they pretty much have a duopoly! 

To the moon 🚀🚀🚀 💎🙌"

2021-06-07 15:11:35,wallstreetbets,Another point ill make is spce is pre revenue and wsb doesn't give it any attention yet it has been steadily rising the past month. One would be crazy to not have some of this stock in their portfolio.

I mean we already know they can get to space. They’ve done it multiple times. Just one more launch until they launch Brandson, and then open for business, commercial space flight here we come.

2021-06-07 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Gambling and wsb shenanigans aside, this is something you’d want to invest small portion of your portfolio in and set it aside and forget it. You can’t invest in Blue Origin or SpaceX so this is next closest thing, although I prefer VG approach over BO. For SpaceX, I have its competitions shares, Rocket Lab. 

Anyways,

It will moon and crash multiple times I envision but over the long haul it will reward the holders well, IMHO. 

VG never had a demand problem, they had a supply problem and every Rocket company will experience that like NASA. Now they’ve seem to figured it out. The new problem is scaling which I think they’ll nail with Spaceports. There is plenty of demand for their services from recreational to research, and eventually vertical expansion through hypersonic flights. If they scale this well, they’ll be printing a lot of money for next decade and that will fund future projects. It’s a great company to look forward to. 

I bought few hundred shares and forgot about it last year. Not gonna touch it for another decade. This and VACQ for Rocket Lab!

Is it risky? Yes. But I think the risk is worth it here and the pros outweigh it."

Never mind the military aspect of it all. Have a group of elite soldiers show up to a conflict anywhere in the world in three hours or less. 

NASA has signed a contract to train astronauts and to do testing on board these planes. 

Then there is as I stated earlier what would one prefer. Being launched on top of rocket coming back into the atmosphere in a capsule with  parachutes deployed landing whereever the wind takes you or a hypersonic plane and a runway. I'll take the runway"

A Google with ""Virgin Galactic proprietary technology"" brings up Virgin website fluff and very little hard details about it.

2021-06-07 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,I agree. I don't see an hour in space replacing the main stream family vacation or even a college break. Ticket price would need to be so low its something you do while on vacation or a weekend. Then you'll get the masses.
2021-06-07 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,"You don’t need the masses for this. Space tourism is projected to be a huge market further divided into:

1) orbital flights (ticket most expensive with only a few people able to afford it: SpaceX, Blue Origin, Space Adventures - high competition)  
2) suborbital flights (ticket cheaper with a lot more people able to afford it: Virgin Galactic - no competition)  
3) Parabolic flights (ticket price affordable for the broader masses - peanuts)

With orbital and suborbital being about 90% of the whole market. If you want to earn money in this market you concentrate on suborbital first, which Virgin Galactic does."

2021-06-07 18:38:52,wallstreetbets,"don't disagree with you at all, SpaceX has clearly accomplished more in space at the moment which justifies their valuation.

my point was that its still early for SPCE (as far as investing in the business)... they had a successful test flight a few weeks ago, and seemingly another test flight announcement is imminent - and perhaps they can finish the rest of the test schedule within the next 3-4 months (on their earnings call they mentioned that subsequent flights could be \~1 month after the previous test flight, if all goes well). so they are on the cusp of beginning to send customers into space and start realizing some revenue - which IMHO will allow the stock to run up a little bit as things are starting to look up!

i also think they have done a great job recently with their marketing/PR efforts,  hopefully they can keep that up as they continue to reach milestones!"

SpaceX is the company to beat - that company has already eaten the lunch of most other launch providers (ULA - formerly Boeing and Lockheed, as well as Ariane, the Japanese, etc).  And now they are going after the ENTIRE global telco industry with Starlink.  They only have to nibble off the edges of that industry to make Elon the first trillionaire on the planet."

2021-06-07 15:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Well if the short interest stays above 69 with a hedging of 130,000 shares and 40 million synthetic shares we could theta squeeze to the upper regions of $18, but that's only after the SEC releases information about the current data on the lastest synthesis of shareholders meeting as per the FDA calendar. This means shorts would now be long and would have to cover at the price set by entire propagated hedge interest in the Q3 earnings. 

If my math checks out, when the earnings report is a direct conversion from the previous earning, divested  by the float of synthetic AND actual shares, we will experience what is commonly called a Vlad squeeze.  So, realistically, we can expect the price to plateau around $86 before it squeezes tommorow."

As of last update according to Ortex data SI has increased over 3% on the day.  


Since mid-April SI has increased exponentially and presenets an auspicious opportunity as they are deep in the red right now.  


If we HODL then the shorts that cover will send this to >$10 and beyond easily.  


This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to Ortex along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone. Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60% premium from ATHs. Shorts have hammered the stock, and I think an opportunity may have presented itself, if you all agree?  


This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious (likely to succeed) business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY."

2021-06-07 15:34:22,wallstreetbets,So this sub shouldn’t discuss tickers other than GME and AMC? Fuck off lol
2021-06-07 15:20:15,wallstreetbets,Who cares call me a hedgie cause I have clove calls lol
2021-06-07 18:49:15,wallstreetbets,So do more coke and buy more $CLOV. Got it.
2021-06-07 16:17:14,wallstreetbets,These tinfoil hat threads are nauseating stop worrying about the next man and buy the stocks you like
2021-06-07 15:25:35,wallstreetbets,So buy BB?? $BB GANG
2021-06-07 16:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Understood, I will buy more bb"
2021-06-07 17:55:17,wallstreetbets,"Making money, don't care."
2021-06-07 15:08:29,wallstreetbets,So don’t buy BB?
2021-06-07 16:23:46,wallstreetbets,GME is the one and only play. Wake up folks… bots doing everything they can to downplay GME

2021-06-07 16:41:42,wallstreetbets,finally a real person in this forsaken subreddit
2021-06-07 16:51:34,wallstreetbets,I bet Shitadel is trying to raise enough capital to cover a bit on 6/9
2021-06-07 16:55:20,wallstreetbets,On the money. I wish the mods would sticky this post.
2021-06-07 16:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Hey, you leave BB out of this, that's my long play! xD"
2021-06-07 17:12:52,wallstreetbets,The level of aggression is just equal to the level of aggression shown towards those stocks from gme/amc apes.
2021-06-07 19:50:32,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, there is no comparison to the main two memes when it comes to flooding or aggression. Half the people believe seem to believe that any other ticker mention is a Deep State conspiracy to distract the apes."

Nothing wrong with making money. And really not trying to bring hate on anyone who has positions in them. Just trying to spread information"

2021-06-07 15:44:49,wallstreetbets,"well, hot, it was mostly discussed as bagholder example"
2021-06-07 18:15:56,wallstreetbets,"Exactly part of the issue is these funds have their toes dipped in so many different stocks. BNGO has a diehard community and is undervalued & shorted quite a bit that’s why it’s been mentioned, and unfortunately citadel has a long position. Same shit with clov and tilray"
2021-06-07 15:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Go check the 13f filings. Whalewosdom is a great source, you can just type the ticker and they'll show the disclosed holdings."
2021-06-07 17:56:21,wallstreetbets,Right...
2021-06-07 17:31:54,wallstreetbets,That was my take on it.  Ape buy BB
2021-06-07 15:09:48,wallstreetbets,I’m not going to suggest positions but I do find it interesting that BB has seen such a huge push to the front page when others have had more success over the past couple weeks you could say. Especially when there’s less evidence BB is shorted to any of the extent others are.
2021-06-07 17:56:32,wallstreetbets,meh
2021-06-07 17:52:34,wallstreetbets,Tickers you’ve seen being pushed like crazy on here are the same manipulative hedge funds involved in shorting GME & AMC. Except they’re long on the propagated tickers
2021-06-07 17:21:36,wallstreetbets,Citadel owns a shitload of AMC shares though. They WANT Amc to go up in price. Whereas BB has been a WSB favorite last year before the whole GME thing mooned in the beginning of this year.

2021-06-07 17:55:45,wallstreetbets,Which tickers have been put in their own threads or had that same thread removed before?
2021-06-07 15:09:43,wallstreetbets,Its a great observation and should be discussed imo. Good luck to you and your karma.
2021-06-07 16:22:28,wallstreetbets,How can you guys not realised wsb is filled with hedge fund bots since months ago… most of these post are not even written by humans lol…
2021-06-07 18:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Serious question:  
I've seen the ""married options"" and a small amount of stocks declared in the 13F many times. 

Does this mean they are long on this stock? Or they shorted it and are using the married options to fuck with people and adjust the price, getting people to sell?   
Would really appreciate the answer."
2021-06-07 18:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Follow up question:

If I'm trying to find shorted stocks that I believe have a shot at taking off soon (not already in significant green movement): Should I avoid ones that hedge funds have significant married options of?

I'm considering a few."
2021-06-07 15:54:28,wallstreetbets,"No. It was always the play after gme, until amc took over"

2021-06-07 15:56:45,wallstreetbets,"CLOV and CLNE were the most obvious pushed ones, BB still had some leftover apes from January so I can understand some of the movement. But in my eyes it is also overhyped."

2021-06-07 17:15:21,wallstreetbets,Maybe because they're taking off or at least catching wind now too and would like to spread word on wsb? It's not some grand conspiracy that multiple stocks are doing well at once and when people who don't talk about one of the approved 2 stocks get called bots or plants yeah they're gonna be a bit aggressive in thier approach
2021-06-07 15:13:23,wallstreetbets,"This was linked in another daily discussion, and yes I absolutely agree- this is a great read IMO- at least for myself and other smooth brains. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-07 16:25:32,wallstreetbets,"I have and I’ve tried to call it out for months. But nearly impossible to get past the flood of bullshit posts or comments. Or you’ll be ostracized by people who are in those tickers. Happy for anyone who’s making money, just trying to bring attention to the bigger issue and it’s challenging."
2021-06-07 19:03:08,wallstreetbets,"I’ll try to get back to you with a more detailed answer when I can but short answer for rn is that married options can be deceptive on both ends. Just depends on the overall position and generally, at least from what I’ve noticed, they are extremely abnormal. Go into more detail later 

But the majority of these 13F suggest they are long on these tickers with the exception of gme, amc, and mvis"
2021-06-07 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,"BB and CLOV account for more than half of the top 20 “hot” posts right now. With all of the CLOV posts being from users active less than 150 days and suspicious accounts to say the least. It would be ridiculous to expect the mods to play god. If people want it, they can have it. Just might be worth doing your homework before following what might not be genuine posters."
2021-06-07 17:54:12,wallstreetbets,Someone mentioned BB is a OG play from Nov.  It was undervalued and this brings it to where it should be.
2021-06-07 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Just as an example, I'm looking at BCEL, which is below cash value + with an upcoming catalyst + Short interest 27% of float stocks.

Puts: 140,000.  
Shares: 365,000.

I have no idea what to make of that.   
Does it indicate a long position?"

2021-06-07 15:37:31,wallstreetbets,Just for the record. Every stock I am bag holding because lack of researching needs to be short squeezed.

2021-06-07 14:52:40,wallstreetbets,"Hard times create strong WSBers. Strong WSBers create good times. Good times create weak WSBers. When DFV first came up with his GME thesis, very few agreed with him. I read his stuff and was also quite skeptical. The skeptics forced him to strengthen his arguments. After he was proven right and WSB got 10 times bigger in wake of this insane meme stock bull run, people stopped being so skeptical of investment theses. Hardly anyone plays devils advocate in the comments anymore. This has significantly lowered the quality of investment ideas here"

2021-06-07 14:44:59,wallstreetbets,"there's a fair amount of new comers and potentially less than savory individuals who are coming in attempting to influence the sub.

There's already been a fair amount of people developing data analytics using data from this sub- I would know, I'm one of them.

But if we have a half dozen or so people publicly doing this, you can imagine that every single large investment firm out there probably has some data analysts either doing it themselves. It would make sense to attempt to flood this sub with notions of a short squeeze to hype the next target in an attempt to game the system."

2021-06-07 17:48:35,wallstreetbets,"TBH if I see a DD thread where I think it's at least convincing enough it'll get apes to start buying for the squeeze (regardless of squeeze or no), I'll throw in a few hundred bucks if the downside risk seems minimal just because apes will try to moon it and I'll make money just from that. Whether I get 2x or 10x depends how many apes diamond-hand it."

2021-06-07 14:44:55,wallstreetbets,"BB did **not** double in a week because people “realized its value”. 

It doubled because for whatever reason it got caught up in the momentum of WSB mania back in January and is still linked to that. We have like 5 months of movement to prove that. 

Truly undervalued companies don’t double their market cap that fast organically.

That said, you’re right that it isn’t a short squeeze.

None of this is to say that it isn’t/wasn’t undervalued, but you are kidding yourself if you think the last couple weeks of movement are likely to sustain long term before first correcting"

Back in high school in a finance class we did a group project on investing in stocks, just paper trading but we got to choose the stocks and why, total free reign for that but we had to provide DD and presentations on why they are good plays. We were graded on our DD and our research, as well as how we presented the information. If we gained or lost was irrelevant, that part was just a competition for who wins a small prize from the teacher.

My buddy and I picked GME (around the time CoD took over the world between 09-10) and we came in I think second last in the class.

Lo and behold I was playing the 12 year long game."

2021-06-07 14:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes! It’s a long-term play on BB. AMC is more of a squeeze but it also is valued more than it was last-year when it tanked to $2. So maybe it lands around $18-25 they think for AMC in 2022-23 or potential bankruptcy. I think AMC just needs a switch up on their technology or new plans for development. They just don’t have a way to diversify their business more. Theaters have only changed the seats, sound systems and the quality of film. That’s all what we can get at home. They need more to bring up the theater numbers."

2021-06-07 17:51:39,wallstreetbets,The market only provides what the market provides. There are plenty of high short interest stocks out there but BB is around 10%. OP is right in that GME was over 100% shorted so a squeeze was possible where as 20-30% of float will cause a large price volume on coverage but it will not be a squeeze.
2021-06-07 17:52:00,wallstreetbets,But what about CRSR?!
2021-06-07 17:52:20,wallstreetbets,people are just trying to cash in on hype at this point and it's sad
2021-06-07 18:19:04,wallstreetbets,Short and gamma squeeze is a good indicator to weed out the people who discovered trading this year
2021-06-07 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I’m playing BB not because of squeeze potential, but because it’s undervalued (imo). However, if there is a little bit of a squeeze I won’t be mad at it. 2000@11"

2021-06-07 15:22:35,wallstreetbets,Nice post brother.  Spot on.  🚀
2021-06-07 16:40:47,wallstreetbets,"**SHUT UP**

I’m trying to make money off of hype, here."
2021-06-07 16:51:43,wallstreetbets,is there a right way to interpret wsb picks from the noise on the sub?
2021-06-07 17:12:56,wallstreetbets,BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-07 17:55:24,wallstreetbets,SNDL has a short squeeze backed by Ortex signals.
2021-06-07 18:30:16,wallstreetbets,BB was hyped up last year. Would've made sense to buy calls then. But now on wsb maybe a fraction of the members play options. The OG idea from November just hasn't been understood
2021-06-07 19:23:28,wallstreetbets,$WEN Moon
2021-06-07 19:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze is so 2008

We're calling them midget hugs now"
2021-06-07 19:45:55,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna squeeze your balls
2021-06-07 14:45:01,wallstreetbets,Most of these are not short squeezes or people 'realizing the value' in a certain name. Most of this is because of degenerate level call option purchase volumes causing Market Makers to continually purchase stock to manage risk - a gamma squeeze
2021-06-07 14:30:18,wallstreetbets,we can make it a short squeeze
2021-06-07 14:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Why you have to put use all caps for your title. I don't like being yelled at 🥺. Anyway at this point we already all know BB is not a short squeeze lmao. BB is a long term play, they are a transitioning company going into the software business, and many of us apes are impressed by what we are hearing."
2021-06-07 15:34:36,wallstreetbets,"Did he say BB and Short squeeze in the same sentence?? Thats it! drop my life savings on the peak, take out loans to buy the dips, to the MOOOONNN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-07 15:39:43,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this.

God damn, too many actual idiot apes around here."
2021-06-07 15:42:19,wallstreetbets,"It’s been this way for months and months now, and you can’t bring it up because these clueless shits just downvote the fuck out of you lol"
2021-06-07 17:00:43,wallstreetbets,The only play is Gamestop.
2021-06-07 17:47:28,wallstreetbets,And on the inverse any time a stock goes down it’s “OMG SHORT LADDER ATTACK”
2021-06-07 14:39:16,wallstreetbets,it absolutely is not a short squeeze play and anyone who tries to promote it as such should not yolo their entire life's savings into it like haha how could.... some person........ be so stupid................................................................................................................![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
2021-06-07 14:24:33,wallstreetbets,~~\*Not~~ Every Stock Is a Short Squeeze! Fixed it for you OP.
2021-06-07 14:38:48,wallstreetbets,GME AMC & BB those the three
2021-06-07 17:12:17,wallstreetbets,"I agree but I'm not sure about the once in a decade statement about gme. This isn't about just short squeezes, this is short and options squeezes.

If you read any textbook about options they discuss downside tail risks, but never mention upside tail risk. I believe, combined with the increase in options sales, a structural flaw has been identified in the way that call options are priced and hedged that is being exploited, particularly on short stocks as this gives the profit and options the fuel. Before 1987 there was a similar mispricing with puts that left a load of hedge funds destroyed and I think this is the reverse, calls are being exploited with upside risk not being properly priced and calls are being shown to be inherently cheap."
2021-06-07 17:49:51,wallstreetbets,"This is true. The borrow rate on $AMC is ridiculously low, which makes sense being as how the company added 11 million shares to the float. Still, I'll trade in and out and sell covered calls to help meet the demand for them."
2021-06-07 18:52:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree that not everything is a short squeeze, however retail has been making bank on these heavily shorted stocks for this past 6mo. Its like easy mode trading compared to how things were before, and you better believe itll get milked until there isnt a drop left to squeeze and regulators finally crack down on some of the shady stuff going on with these large HFT's/HF's/MM's, etc."
2021-06-07 14:48:47,wallstreetbets,My $DICK is prime for a short squeeze.
2021-06-07 17:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Just FYI I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares and keeps the price down. Stair steps it down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB will be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months because unlike AMC or GME this has historic levels to work off and institutions will absolutely make a killing at keeping this going till it is trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes."
2021-06-07 14:21:26,wallstreetbets,"What's a short squeeze? I lost half my initial investment in a certain phone stock a few months ago and I've been inching my way back up using some DDs combined with conservative buying dips and selling peaks.

Oh yeah 💎🤲 because memes."
2021-06-07 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,"P. S. BB is no GME but not for nothin', 24% of volume is still trading short."
2021-06-07 14:48:21,wallstreetbets,"This is why people buying GME right now are making a huge mistake. The short squeeze on GME already happened. The rest is just hype.

AMC short utilization is 99.5 percent. AMC to the moon. Sell your GME and buy AMC."
2021-06-07 14:31:05,wallstreetbets,"The short squeeze of GME was an event that we shouldn't really see for quite a long time. The stock was shorted over 100%, none of the stocks claiming to be amidst a short squeeze don't even come close. As soon as a stock even gets close to #1 on that short interest list, people jump in on it as quick as they can now."
2021-06-07 14:34:30,wallstreetbets,This post has massive short interest obviously it will be on the front page.
2021-06-07 14:44:03,wallstreetbets,So...WEN LAMBEAUX?
2021-06-07 15:51:12,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s meme-fueled, but I always wonder how much is squeezing vs. sheer hype/momentum."
2021-06-07 16:07:22,wallstreetbets,"So what I gather from this is… $WKHS is the short squeeze of the day!

2021-06-07 16:35:45,wallstreetbets,I think this is important as that word is more common than Apes or GME these days. I think its vitally important for us to take profits when the going is good and we are up cause eventually the money will move somewhere else
2021-06-07 16:35:45,wallstreetbets,What stocks have a 30% short interest? Asking for a friend
2021-06-07 16:47:52,wallstreetbets,"“That’s why it’s going up lately. Because the market is realizing its value.”

Horse shit. Are you kidding? It is having big swings perfectly in sync with AMC... and you think THAT is the reason? 

I’m not saying you’re wrong about BB not being a short  squeeze play (Idk if it is or not). But come on... it’s going up because it’s a WSB stock, and because it’s shorted. It may go up for legit reasons someday soon, but that’s totally not what’s happening right now."
2021-06-07 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,"Ya WSB wasnt always associated with ""ape strong together diamond hands bro"" now that dumb shit is everywhere, not just in here. it's kind of fucking annoying to be honest. 

DFV is a legend, but I prefer the days where legends of past like WSBGOD posted plays and made money. Now its ""what's the next short squeeze apes let's go!!"" Theres even an annoying irony to the entire thing that is the opposite of the WSB yolo mentality. People want herd mentality comfort to help them buy into a trade."
2021-06-07 18:45:53,wallstreetbets,You are wrong. There is a lot of stocks being naked shorted. You’ll see.
2021-06-07 18:49:47,wallstreetbets,What if I just like the stock?
2021-06-07 19:05:26,wallstreetbets,AMC ape now hungry for blackberries…mmmmm blackberries…
2021-06-07 19:19:07,wallstreetbets,Lol. BB is a not a short squeeze. AMC only
2021-06-07 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,Is amc a short squeeze
2021-06-07 19:30:58,wallstreetbets,"On the other hand though, have you considered the fact that every stock *is* a short squeeze?"
2021-06-07 15:04:33,wallstreetbets,You're not trying hard enough.
2021-06-07 15:01:16,wallstreetbets,Squeeze Big Boobies

2021-06-07 15:19:17,wallstreetbets,Instructions unclear--bought more BB
2021-06-07 14:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Not sure whats more cringy, seeing retards call for a short squeeze on any stock, or seeing retards calling each other apes"
2021-06-07 18:42:54,wallstreetbets,">You apes need to understand that having a 30% short interest doesn’t mean the stock is going to squeeze.

But when it's actually more like 300% due to massive amounts of illegal naked shorting, chances of that squeeze increase substantially."
2021-06-07 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,Agreed…my question is tho is there any reason to think black berry wouldn’t be in the same ball park stock price wise compared to other cyber security companies such as crowdstrike??…remeber im retarded so if you answer explain it like I’m 5
2021-06-07 15:09:32,wallstreetbets,"But WTF is going on with TAL though. Its been free falling for a long time and I don't really see any negative news.  


Did their HQ explode? Or is it manipulation. Zero wrinkles, just a thought on the worst performing asset I own."
2021-06-07 15:18:04,wallstreetbets,"There could very well be a short squeeze on BB, just saying. Not even that, I'm willing to bet we see one soon.

Not to mention, the sub has been hunting for stocks that have high SI%, which is why you hear that a lot."
2021-06-07 15:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Bro....if u think about it, every squeeze is a short squeeze...or a long squeeze

I like the long squeeze more 🙄"

2021-06-07 15:30:14,wallstreetbets,Every time I rub one out it’s called a short squeeze…
2021-06-07 15:33:22,wallstreetbets,User name checks.
2021-06-07 15:34:52,wallstreetbets,Not according to the otc penny gurus and Twitter stock experts. When their stock gets clobbered every day . The excuse is the suits are keeping it down while they lose 75% of their investment even though the markets are booming. Covid created and broke so many financial gurus
2021-06-07 15:35:43,wallstreetbets,Your last sentence made me smile so thank you!  😁

2021-06-07 15:39:23,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  But try telling the AMC people.  Shorts obviously couldn't have covered when 3.5 billion shares have traded hands over 8 days....
2021-06-07 15:43:57,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-06-07 15:45:21,wallstreetbets,"I support you tryina say it straight, but this isn’t a battle we’ll win. Ever since GME this place has become BuzzWordBets.

2021-06-07 15:46:01,wallstreetbets,very true
2021-06-07 15:52:52,wallstreetbets,"The short interest just means that the potential for a squeeze is there. Even the short interest on gme was not inherently indicative of anything except that institutions thought it was worth even less than it used to be. 

I think your just reading the posts wrong or looking too far into from a centric point of view."
2021-06-07 15:54:10,wallstreetbets,So buy Wendys?
2021-06-07 15:56:10,wallstreetbets,But the volume is very high !!

2021-06-07 16:06:45,wallstreetbets,"""Lately""?   


You mean like, ""Absolutely non-stop since late January""?"
2021-06-07 16:09:42,wallstreetbets,"You kind of defeated your point by pushing BB. Whether they are undervalued or not, they are tied to the memes. If Gamestop/AMC drop, BB will also drop. 

They are all tied in this tangled meme, retail hype, economy."
2021-06-07 16:10:29,wallstreetbets,AMC GME are most likely going to pop off around the same time BB could any other articles not coming from Wallstreetbets is fud or a bots ploy to dilute the attention
2021-06-07 16:13:40,wallstreetbets,Has any meme stock experienced a squeeze yet? I'm just here for the volatility.

2021-06-07 16:15:33,wallstreetbets,"PREACH IT! Literally every ticker with 25%+ Short interest = ""Buy now, Short squeeze dadada"". I am holding all three tickers but mostly GME. Also, I have penny stocks in my portfolio, which have been slowly climbing, yet some people are trying to paint it as ""This stock will SS, buy now or miss out"". I'd just like to reiterate that not everything in the stock market is a short squeeze. Do some due diligence and research what that company(ticker) is all about. I've been in a fortunate situation wherein some wrinkled apes do the due diligence and I just fact-check every single point they have made.

If I'm confident in the company. I'll invest and I only invest with money that I don't need in the short term."

2021-06-07 16:20:29,wallstreetbets,THAAAANKKK YOUUUUUUU
2021-06-07 16:21:52,wallstreetbets,Finally someone read my mind.
2021-06-07 16:22:46,wallstreetbets,$V has a 1.5% short interest. Thoughts on upcoming squeeze?
2021-06-07 16:23:37,wallstreetbets,AMC is squeeze tho
2021-06-07 16:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Still, though, if you're not on SPCE by now you'll wish you were... 24% of float isn't anything to turn your nose up at."
2021-06-07 16:24:27,wallstreetbets,"So, GME was a rare case where there were more shorts than the total float, but hasn’t been true for a while now. How do you figure it’s still different from any of the other heavily shorted companies?"
2021-06-07 16:26:23,wallstreetbets,Finally some sense in here
2021-06-07 16:26:34,wallstreetbets,Amc has a rating from forbes of 10/10 for a short squeeze. Gme is not the only damn stock. People who say a stock is a distraction is just annoying af. Amc to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🤚
2021-06-07 16:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Totally true, I bought 400 shares of BB and 750 of NOK 6 months ago and also think both companies are very much undervalued and can easily be $30-50 in a year or two, but short squeeze is a bit unrealistic with such a small percentage being shorted."
2021-06-07 16:26:58,wallstreetbets,"You are right - it's not a short squeeze.  But I am sorry - the BB run has zero to do with fundamentals.  It's pure hype.  So you owe your fellow apes here more credit for the run up - than the ""fundamentals"" of the company."
2021-06-07 16:27:36,wallstreetbets,This is true. We should change that.
2021-06-07 16:27:40,wallstreetbets,Everything with any short interest is SQOOOOEZEEEEEEEEEEEEE OMFG APE RETARD what you got for dinner crayons ?
2021-06-07 16:28:17,wallstreetbets,I squeeze my shorts real tight whenever I buy a stock. Does it count as a short squeeze ?
2021-06-07 16:28:22,wallstreetbets,So... its a short squeeze?
2021-06-07 16:28:28,wallstreetbets,CLOV does
2021-06-07 16:28:54,wallstreetbets,fuck it im in. you had me a short squeeze
2021-06-07 16:30:29,wallstreetbets,It’s either Short squeeze or Long Squeeze … whatever strategy you like 😂😂
2021-06-07 16:31:01,wallstreetbets,">Like come on don’t be so retarded

Now this is asking a lot"
2021-06-07 16:31:02,wallstreetbets,GME is a one-off opportunity. That's the only chance we get at something this big. There will literally never be another play like this.
2021-06-07 16:32:22,wallstreetbets,It's because you are dealing with actual gutterbrain kids and morons who have actually never done any trading before. They latch onto buzzwords and make le reddit face and yell SQUEEZE.
2021-06-07 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you for saying this. I love GME but damn did this “short squeeze” just get tossed around for almost any ticker
2021-06-07 16:32:58,wallstreetbets,"I think you're discounting the idea of contagion. Once XYZ ticker squeezes, the meme group goes ape shit right along 🚀

2021-06-07 16:33:43,wallstreetbets,"It's running up because hedge funds are long on all of this shit to suppress GME further, come the fuck on. If you aren't a bot or were here in January it's only gotten more apparent since."
2021-06-07 16:33:44,wallstreetbets,BB to the 🌙 🚀
2021-06-07 16:34:19,wallstreetbets,Ok but TLRY is totally a squeeze right?
2021-06-07 16:34:53,wallstreetbets,"BB is a nice gamma squeeze play but clearly not a short squeeze. And, clearly, it’s undervalued and a long term game."
2021-06-07 16:35:28,wallstreetbets,THANK. YOU. APE FRIEND.
2021-06-07 16:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes it’s true but GME and AMC it’s the proof: 
People together can do everything!
So stay strong stay together and we can reach moon or Mars when we want"
2021-06-07 16:35:42,wallstreetbets,People posting about random ticker squeezes aren't good faith actors. I'm sticking with GME.
2021-06-07 16:35:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is. 

Squeeze all the way up"
2021-06-07 16:36:23,wallstreetbets,What about 72%
2021-06-07 16:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Guys, when is the squeeze on $ASS and $CUM? I have 69 shares of each"
2021-06-07 16:37:45,wallstreetbets,FSR short squeeze is in! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
2021-06-07 16:38:06,wallstreetbets,"for a short time there, there was a potential gaming of the current system to be had by retail piling in and memeing a shorted stock and forcing a squeeze.  i'm pretty sure that glitch has long since stopped working"
2021-06-07 16:38:21,wallstreetbets,Was. Uh oh
2021-06-07 16:38:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't know shit, but I agree"
2021-06-07 16:38:44,wallstreetbets,"I agree, it's not a squeeze, but:  
  
> It was an undervalued OG play of WSB from November. That’s why it’s been running up lately because market is finally realising it value  
  
That's a dumb fucking take to explain away concurrent >+13% days on around a dozen under-performing companies with dogshit earnings potential, at the same time. That's just as retarded of an explanation as calling them short squeezes."
2021-06-07 16:39:23,wallstreetbets,Apes thinking they could short silver was the reason GME didn't go to 1000000

2021-06-07 16:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Most Excellent-ly said.  I feel the same way, though I do believe $AMC has good potential for a squeeze.  I think though that it depends on what happens in terms of naked shares...If it's real  to even a small degree of what is speculated (which I think it is), and they are exposed legitimately, then fasten your belts. lol"
2021-06-07 16:39:39,wallstreetbets,"It does my head in. Every DD post is accompanied by the term ""Short Squeeze"". And sadly, its spread even to other reddit such as SPACs. 😂😂"

2021-06-07 16:42:41,wallstreetbets,BB is not a squeeze play. Anything under 140 is a dip 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-07 16:44:52,wallstreetbets,This is the most sensible thing I’ve seen on this sub in weeks
2021-06-07 16:46:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but every short squeeze is a stock"
2021-06-07 16:46:31,wallstreetbets,buy more bb ok
2021-06-07 16:47:03,wallstreetbets,"GOODRX GDRX is a short squeeze. 80% of the stock is owned by institutional investors. They are likely to hold the stock for the long term. 28% of the float is shorted and the stock is a real company, set to 🚀 off to the Mars"

2021-06-07 16:48:40,wallstreetbets,but clov is
2021-06-07 16:48:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget Nokia guys
2021-06-07 16:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Here's a thing though :

I am under the impression that stocks shorted at 30% and more are quite rare. In that it's not in the norm for stocks to ever be shorted that much and that it was a significant contributing factor to the GME situation because it was way above 30%. 

If true, then I don't blame people for equating 30% short interest or more = squeeze will happen even if that is not the case."
2021-06-07 16:49:44,wallstreetbets,Finally some sane answer to clear all the BB doubts
2021-06-07 16:50:06,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure 30% short on a stock is actually high as f but idk I’m a retard welcom to Wendy
2021-06-07 16:50:42,wallstreetbets,"Well they're not going to squeeze themselves,  if that's what you mean. There needs to be a lot of short interest as fuel, but it still has to be set on fire, or it won't explode."
2021-06-07 16:51:10,wallstreetbets,Don't be retarded?
2021-06-07 16:51:19,wallstreetbets,We're retards man....
2021-06-07 16:51:20,wallstreetbets,If people thinking it is a short squeeze causes a rapid price increase via gamma and hype does it really matter?
2021-06-07 16:51:24,wallstreetbets,"Good god, people are still talking about squeezes? Recently sold my $BB leaps after temporarily having them lose 90% of their value when the stock tanked. I'm glad for that, as I always thought it was a more long-term play. Not everything is a fucking squeeze - whether gamma, short, or your wife's boyfriend's balls, it doesn't matter."
2021-06-07 16:52:34,wallstreetbets,Sounds like some FUD a short seller would spread
2021-06-07 16:53:15,wallstreetbets,"LUCKY FOR YOU GUYS I JUST DID MY FIRST COVERED CALL WITH $20 STRIKE WITH 6/11 EXPIRATION! IF ALL MY PAST OPTIONS ARE CORRECT THAT MEANS THAT BB WILL BE $40 MINIMUM BY END OF WEEK, ALSO MY CAPSLOCK IS BROKEN"

2021-06-07 16:59:16,wallstreetbets,I thought we all knew BB is only going up because its riding with AMC's squeeze. Same thing happened in january.
2021-06-07 16:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Argument to be made that it’s deeper than a once in a decade opportunity but yeah, you’re speaking facts

All I see is people constantly trying to push the next squeeze and believing in their echo chambers that every stock they’re told to invest in, will be the one that makes them a millionaire overnight. They want so badly to be the person that goes all in on gme back at $2 a share. 

Got bad news for them."
2021-06-07 16:59:44,wallstreetbets,I can’t help it my brain is like play-do

APE Font turned off 

I definitely disagree and based on my technical analysis would suggest it is a possibility to create such an event such as a squeeze. I do hope you consider posting that although it's not happening at the moment it could and make alot of profits for some.

2021-06-07 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Lmao like this sub is going to listen to definitions on the only stock term they ever use. 

Stock goes up - squeeze!
Stock goes down - hedge fund conspiracy!
Stock trades sideways - it’s about to happen!

Every. Fucking. Day."
2021-06-07 17:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  The amount of idiots talking about any stock and saying it's gonna ""Short squeeze like GME!"" is so damn stupid.  I hate it"

i’m looking at you CLOV"
2021-06-07 17:06:14,wallstreetbets,"ITT: apes who think they discovered momentum trading. 

None of y’all are geniuses. Don’t worry"
2021-06-07 17:06:19,wallstreetbets,Too many people have not done their research & need to understand that a lot theses stocks were shorted & they were worth investing in. But it doesn't mean they were shorted enough to get a squeeze per say. Therefore they are a value stock; need to verify fundamentals & re do analysis since fundamental can change from day to day.  What has happened with AMC & GME is not the normal; it is a very unique situation & should be treated as such.
2021-06-07 17:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Wait, we're trying to MAKE money here?"
2021-06-07 17:06:48,wallstreetbets,"BB was exactly what they wanted everyone to buy to take the heat off gme/amc 

I watched wsb get flooded with it and it’s ashame. Yall should be gettin frac shares of amc/gme if you cant afford hole instead of throwin money at BB

They said this would happen months ago and sure enough"
2021-06-07 17:07:01,wallstreetbets,"How is a stock determine whether it can be a short squeeze? AMC, GME & BB to the moon!!🚀🚀🚀💵💵💵💸💸"
2021-06-07 17:07:42,wallstreetbets,CLNE is not a short squeeze. Simply Apes discovering a solid undervalued company with huge potential!!!!
2021-06-07 17:08:26,wallstreetbets,"if by stock you mean my dick, and by short you mean short, then still no. My dick really is a short squeeze."
2021-06-07 17:08:26,wallstreetbets,"> I currently hold 350 shares of BB at 14$ and I see apes throwing around short squeeze on BB. Like come on don’t be so retarded. BB isn’t a short squeeze play. It was an undervalued OG play of WSB from November. That’s why it’s been running up lately because market is finally realising it value. Not because there is a short squeeze happening. 

If you don't think BB is going up because it's in the meme club I think you're mistaken, it was part of the first wave and is still is following suite.  You think everyone just figured out it's got some magical value at the same time it's trading with all the other ones?"
2021-06-07 17:08:43,wallstreetbets,"I just like Gamestop, not much more to it."
2021-06-07 17:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Goodluck convincing this group of this. 
Every time I ever comment about how stupid some short squeeze theory is, it ends up getting downvoted to hell.  Surprised this even made it up to 5k upvotes, maybe there still are a few people around here that aren't complete retards lol"
2021-06-07 17:09:30,wallstreetbets,And yet we are squeezing the berries. We APES love the juice!

2021-06-07 17:09:56,wallstreetbets,Neither is AMC but they're calling it a squeeze....
2021-06-07 17:10:06,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC are the only stocks that are gonna burst into the space. Everything else is a distraction unless it's your long play
2021-06-07 17:10:39,wallstreetbets,Can you guys let me know if this post is going to short squeeze? I'm going to go to McDonald's because they have a short squeeze on big macs. Maybe short squeeze dairy queen and hit up Walmart because I saw they had a short squeeze on jeans. Short squeeze my dealer for some cocaine and short squeeze a escort if she doesn't dark pool with her pimp. So just let me know.
2021-06-07 17:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, but what if entire market is secretly super shorted...? Then everything would be a potential short squeeze, lol."
2021-06-07 17:11:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah... I'm loving the GME train but its seriously ruined this subreddit.

2021-06-07 17:15:08,wallstreetbets,Not every stock but there's at least a dozen or so that are shorted to oblivion and could possibly squirt
2021-06-07 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,Can’t find “Not every stock” on Fidelity. How do I get in on this short squeeze?
2021-06-07 17:17:02,wallstreetbets,These posts you complain of are by paid bad actors spreading fud

2021-06-07 17:19:06,wallstreetbets,"I would say BB is a short squeeze, but it isn't the same type of short squeeze. It does have 9% which is fairly high short interest, most of which under $12.

Meaning the shorts are suffering unrealized losses, or have already started to realize those losses. This does create buying pressure and buying pressure created by shorts covering their position is a short squeeze. The reality is, short squeezes happen quite often, but rarely do they go hyperbolic like GME/AMC."
2021-06-07 17:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Like Rocket... they smashed last Q earnins and right now is so undervalued it will eventually go up... 16% up last week in 2 days, wait and see..."
2021-06-07 17:20:40,wallstreetbets,"any stock with a THIRD OF THEIR FLOAT ON LOAN is prime for a squeeze, its just about getting bodies on the stock.

Also, BB has LITERALLY been following AMC/GME/KOSS on this journey. to act like it's not part of the ""meme squad"" is gonna cost ya."
2021-06-07 17:21:31,wallstreetbets,Stock goes down = naked shorting. Stock goes up = shorts covering

2021-06-07 17:27:06,wallstreetbets,"In order to get a short squeeze you usually need low float, high short interest, and some news event or a big player to act as a catalyst.  Low float is critical since a short squeeze is by definition a liquidity driven bubble."

You schmucks realize that the more apes that jump on board a play, the faster it’ll rise up to the moon, right? Why not just start a thread for “bad jokes”?

2021-06-07 17:53:43,wallstreetbets,"You know what isn’t a short squeeze. Fricking ASO, it’s just goooooooood business"
2021-06-07 17:55:26,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GAMESTOP are rare. 

What truly defines a short? Newbie here. 

My thought was if you buy a few hundred shares price just up a few bucks sell them off for a nice little gain. Is that not “short squeeze”?"
2021-06-07 17:55:42,wallstreetbets,nah but Nokia looks like its primed for a short squeeze - get your LEMONADE
2021-06-07 17:55:48,wallstreetbets,You lost most of us at don't be so retarded.
2021-06-07 17:55:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought a bunch AMC last year because it was like $4 and I compared it to previous years and decided it was undervalued.

2021-06-07 17:59:31,wallstreetbets,"In such a highly volatile market, none of the stocks are truly undervalued. What makes these stocks high are not only because of the short squeeze but also a belief. What we apes are buying is the belief in ourselves and our abilities to fight the hedge fund. I don't care whatever the officials have been to the moon or not. We are definitely going to the moon!"
2021-06-07 18:00:26,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ; I'm exasperated.

2021-06-07 18:04:38,wallstreetbets,CLOV for sure is
2021-06-07 18:05:06,wallstreetbets,When a stock is shorted as heavily as CLOV then short squeeze is very possible.
2021-06-07 18:06:14,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget ladder attacks
2021-06-07 18:06:47,wallstreetbets,And not all short squeezes are sudden.
2021-06-07 18:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Ok, ok. But is this the squeeze or do I keep holding? If i buy all of the stocks will it squeeze faster? IS SQUEEZE A METAPHOR? ??"
2021-06-07 18:08:34,wallstreetbets,i thought short squeeze was a reference to some sort of midget fetish
2021-06-07 18:08:42,wallstreetbets,Your mom is a short squeeze.

2021-06-07 18:11:45,wallstreetbets,Amc and bb are the distraction
2021-06-07 18:11:50,wallstreetbets,Why are you discouraging people? Who cares if you know better? Can still get desired results with mass buying shares/options. Mr know it all
2021-06-07 18:12:10,wallstreetbets,"7.98% Of all shares of BB are shorted.

1.43 Short Ratio.  Which means at normal volume it would take a full day and a half of trading, just of the shorts, to cover all of those shorts.

So so many sheep here.  This guy says it's not a short squeeze, so it isn't?"

2021-06-07 18:12:59,wallstreetbets,BB was a real value play that got caught up in the GME hype bc of timing on WSB. Tbh I'm pretty sure most of tHe nExT sQuEeZe posts are planted crap to get idiots (not true retards) to buy whatever isn't GameStop.

2021-06-07 18:18:12,wallstreetbets,"you say once in a decade opportunity, but AMC just did the exact same thing. Not to the exact scale but enough to matter. The more this stuff gets pointed out the more the little guy can exploit it."
2021-06-07 18:19:56,wallstreetbets,"So, you mean,  shorting actually has market value?!?! Lol. Love how often this sub contradicts itself. Great entertainment!"
2021-06-07 18:20:14,wallstreetbets,"BB was never a short squeeze. I bought amc before it hit $10, but it also was not overshorted. WKHS and PLTR ~~are~~ were great value picks, but now are powered by memes. GameStop remains the best and likely only chance to cash in on naked shorts, and frankly, there are so many tricks and delays, the moon may possibly never be seen."

2021-06-07 18:21:59,wallstreetbets,Isn’t the big deal in detecting naked shorts? Not just short interest which is not inherently bad as there may be very good reasons to believe a stock is going down. Bit the naked short catches the big guys far ahead of their skis.
2021-06-07 18:22:47,wallstreetbets,I call that Tuesday..

2021-06-07 18:24:37,wallstreetbets,Sure but plenty of shit really is a short squeeze play but I can’t count how many times people have claimed you can’t squeeze CLOV 😂
2021-06-07 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,ive been seeing this for stocks that dont even have a 1% short interest in webull comment section.

2021-06-07 18:31:31,wallstreetbets,BB trades in a bucket with the meme stocks unfortunately
2021-06-07 18:32:15,wallstreetbets,Is CLOV a short squeeze?
2021-06-07 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,I think the bb plug is synthetic. Orchestrated if you will. But spend your own money how you will.
2021-06-07 18:34:29,wallstreetbets,tldr: everything is a short squeeze
2021-06-07 18:35:12,wallstreetbets,"I got an advertisement a while back suggesting there'd be Silver squeeze.... And saw a clickbaity article suggesting one of those crapcoins would squeeze soon..

2021-06-07 18:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I think AMC it the only stock that can squeeze after that the squeeze days are over, then us retail investors can play on a even field."
2021-06-07 18:37:17,wallstreetbets,350 shares isn’t that much
2021-06-07 18:37:26,wallstreetbets,Is this financial advice?
2021-06-07 18:38:32,wallstreetbets,"i agree and there's very few to the degree gme has seen, but if there's short interest at 30% and the stock price goes up forcing the shorts to cover, it's squeezing the shorts money into yours, is it not?"
2021-06-07 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Volume last week was higher than in January for BB

2021-06-07 18:59:07,wallstreetbets,"A lot of professional managers will hold short positions as a hedge for underlying equities that they own large bond positions in or large positions in the credit market of that underlying security. This is a very common hedge strategy because if you own a bond and it doesn’t mature at 100c on the dollar then the equity is generally worth $0. Therefore, you hedge your long position on the debt with a short position on the equity (or put contracts). You’d be hard pressed to find any stock without short interest for this reason alone nevermind all the other reasons."

2021-06-07 19:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Gme has always been the play. Still is. 

Problem is, all the people here in wsb want to make every stock a short squeeze and make it the next GME.

People think that it's too late to get into it, but just wait. It'll go even higher and then you'll have wished you jumped in on it.

I thought 33 was too high in January. Proven wrong.

Thought 120 was high in Feb, proven wrong again.

Granted, I still bought in at those prices. Glad I did though."

Shitadel and Melvin I’m sure have short positions in all of the meme stonks hence why we see sympathy reactions whenever one of them decides to go up, others follow... once shorts begin covering we will see all of them squeeze..

2021-06-07 19:05:43,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Besides all these other stocks are just a distraction to the real upcoming squueze which is amc. All them other stocks that you be hearing like bb wkhs clov are just distractions from the next big thing AMC.
2021-06-07 14:21:36,wallstreetbets,This is NOT the way!

2021-06-07 16:17:30,wallstreetbets,You guys do realize that there’s a specific reason this is happening right?  The more stocks that people believe will squeeze the less funds there are to squeeze each stock and therefore the smaller the squeezes will be.  🤔
2021-06-07 17:02:40,wallstreetbets,"unfortunately i think wsb needs to put a temporary but long ban on the term short squeeze + ticker, it is low effort low quality content, and detracts from the original ethos of the sub, which was to make stupid risky plays, and to explore different routes for how to capitalize on market events like earnings, product launches and world events."
2021-06-07 15:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Also, a short squeeze doesn't mean you get to name your price when the shorts cover. They don't need your shares. I just had to explain this to a coworker who has $0 invested outside of his 401k because a friend of his told him that."

2021-06-07 18:56:26,wallstreetbets,I mean you have people saying AMC is going to hit 500k a share non ironically so... Pandora’s box is open and people who don’t even know what a Bloomberg terminal is to get the joke in the side bar are investing their life savings into stocks and doing “DD” that is as accurate as a covid denial info.

2021-06-07 18:16:22,wallstreetbets,"When people hear a new phrase or concept they'll often latch onto it, that's really what a ""meme"" is - an idea that is easily or readily understood, the easier it is to replicate the more likely it is to become a strong meme. Of course, the definition of ""meme"" has changed drastically but this is a perfect example of what it actually is.

I see it everywhere. People hear the term ""gameplay loop"" and it begins to spread like wildfire, soon everyone is talking about ""gameplay loops"" without a real understanding of what that means. 

The problem with memes is that it's often the most simple ideas that are transmitted and replicated become the most successful memes with no regard towards anything else aside from replication.

It's actually why the poorest and most vulnerable people often have the most children. It's the exact same concept but with ideas."
2021-06-07 18:29:59,wallstreetbets,So what are we supposed to squeeze if not our wiener stonks?

Everyone's a genius with hindsight. I saw the original GME posts and blew them off like 99% of everyone else because it was Gamestop, the store everyone made jokes about. If it wasn't for Coen's big buy-in, GME probably goes bankrupt, everyone laughs at DFV's loss porn, nobody talks about short squeezes or hedge funds, the other stocks don't pop, CNBC doesn't do daily segments on ""meme stonks"" and a whole bunch of other things don't happen. It's pretty remarkable though, the chain of events that took place and the implications, both good and bad, that it's had on the market and for retail investors."

2021-06-07 17:39:29,wallstreetbets,DFV never made any investment decisions based on whether there could be a squeeze. He was pretty clear that it was a very outside chance from his perspective and not a factor in his evaluation of the stock.
2021-06-07 15:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Mate you can't play devils advocate. I've been watching for a while and this sub has really changed. Obviously success and massive amounts of new people will do that but most original DD was typically countered back and forth. Steel gang, silver gang, Guhh gang, tanker gang, I've seen it all. Not saying it is a bad thing but at some point there are going to be massive bag holders. May not be this week, month or even this year but at some point there will be massive amounts of losses.

So I didn't join all this undervalued theses and didn't gain 1000% in a week. But I also sleep well at night, even though working late when I can stop early, investing my time and effort in work that I enjoy and made me valuable regardless my possessions. Moreover, reducing my risk of having Sudden Wealth Syndrome that lottery winners usually experience due to the lack of experience and understanding on how to manage money. For me, investing 100$ was huge 5 years ago, now 1000$ loss is just a day in the park. Having said that, I do INVEST in some of the aforementioned tickers, due to the fact that everyone else does.

2021-06-07 16:20:54,wallstreetbets,"But sir, this is a Wendys"
2021-06-07 16:13:40,wallstreetbets,I’m skipping the tendies and just headed straight to Wendy’s. Sparred you all the emojis and loss porn lol.
2021-06-07 16:47:33,wallstreetbets,I’m reading this comment at Wendy’s. Only squeeze happening right now is the ketchup packet I’m squeezing on my fries
2021-06-07 16:55:56,wallstreetbets,">	Squeeze or not squeeze, still making more tendies than at Wendy’s

Well, to be fair, I’ve been telling you for weeks that you need to raise what you charge for BJs to atleast $2.

It makes the rest of us out behind the dumpster look greedy…"
2021-06-07 17:12:18,wallstreetbets,"Squeez may be a tease, but still makin more tendies than at Wendy’s"
2021-06-07 15:44:03,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze it goes back to 25.   
Not Squeeze it stays at 15. 

  
Pretty huge difference if you actually care about making money."
2021-06-07 16:17:42,wallstreetbets,I thought this was a Wendy's.
2021-06-07 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,Ever squeezed your TENDIES before you eat them? Yeah give it a go you'll thank later. How does an ape eat a banana squeezes the shit out of it....

2021-06-07 16:14:49,wallstreetbets,"SEC just announced that they're also investigating this sub to make sure no one's doing exactly what you're suggesting.

It's crazy that a bunch of idiots have YOLO'd the system so hard that CNN has to analyze it as newsworthy and the SEC is keeping an eye on it to make sure no one is exploiting our autism for their personal gain."
2021-06-07 18:25:13,wallstreetbets,"> ou can imagine that every single large investment firm out there probably has some data analysts either doing it themselves

They also likely have data anlysts that go, ""Look, I don't fucking know why it happens but here is what the data says: When GME/AMC have big days, these other stocks take off soon after.""

Then someone programs that into a trading algorithm and some hedge fund is front running the meme-ery."

2021-06-07 16:49:04,wallstreetbets,I think that was the quiet part you're not supposed to say out loud. OP was just being polite.
2021-06-07 16:25:12,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, OP was making a lot of sense at first with the ""not everything's a squeeze"" part.

But to think BB doubled in a week just cause people are now realizing its value (at the exact same time all these other meme stocks are mooning) is some real smooth brained thinking."
2021-06-07 16:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Definitely needs to be upvoted more.  The movement between GME, AMC, BB and their retarded little brother NOK is very much identical. The link is not most likely not going anywhere soon either."
2021-06-07 17:51:32,wallstreetbets,">but you are kidding yourself if you think the last couple weeks of movement are likely to sustain long term before first correcting

You shut your whore mouth with that blasphemy. I need confirmation bias only. Otherwise how am I going to maintain this erection"
2021-06-07 16:55:06,wallstreetbets,"There have been dozens of posts overlaying the charts of GME, AMC, BB, and others and the relationship is undeniable. GME was not the only stock that was shorted beyond belief and heavily manipulated by hedge funds. They did it to an entire portfolio. The magnitude of the squeeze for GME caused the hedge funds to react across the entire portfolio and this is the effect."
2021-06-07 17:17:51,wallstreetbets,"BB is absolutely undervalued as most investors are yet to comprehend what IoT is and how it's probably just gonna keep becoming bigger exponentially, but yes ,the massive moves on $BB recently are completely WSB memes and just unrealistic/unsustainable."
2021-06-07 15:43:35,wallstreetbets,"This is it... there is some meme stuff going on with it still... I got caught up in the first craze and bought 2 high... used this Opportunity to break even and I'm sitting on the cash for a better entry point.. even though I think 15 is OK long run.. id like to be in under 10... or 8 even...

But I'm just a degerate and I don't care about money 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-07 19:20:19,wallstreetbets,You said “organically” and I read “organismally” 🍆 my bad…continue.
2021-06-07 18:00:15,wallstreetbets,BB is a legit trash company.  theres a very good reason it was shorted to shit.
2021-06-07 16:26:20,wallstreetbets,I'd argue that the investor meeting announcement was probably the catalyst and it simply being a part of the squeeze hype here was all it needed to go boom.
2021-06-07 18:22:26,wallstreetbets,I sold my CLOV calls today for amazing percent but should have greeded because it’s still going nuts AH

Fundamentals are good, market cap small, float small, SI% high, very undervalued. And the price target to put these shorters underwater is very close. Another day like today and they'd almost all be drowning. 

Just wondering why you're dissenting from this."

With a massive influx of retail investors from WSB, it's no longer about the stock or the market, it's a game of psychological analysis of what people *want* to happen and then you make money from there. The fundamentals don't matter when it comes to making money in this market, because it's being built on the back of a loose hivemind without a leader. The way to build a fortune isn't to hunt the squeezes or whatever, it's to observe which way the wind is blowing around here and adjust yourself accordingly."

2021-06-07 16:42:03,wallstreetbets,Are you just saying that or are you for real? I can't tell anymore lol
2021-06-07 17:48:11,wallstreetbets,"BuT 2 dA mOoN. Seriously though, when the market corrected last march some of the best DD came out of this sub. I remember a post that could have been in an academic journal about the looming corporate debt crisis coming to a head late 2020. The complexity was explained so well. While the only thing that kept that from happening was the fed bailing out corporate debt (which they did) but the real thing that keeps the crisis alive is the collateral chains behind corporate debt. Learning how highly levered companies continue to get loans and issue debt by merely borrowing treasuries through private transactions/arrangements to swap and borrow A+ assets from private parties to use as collateral to make their balance sheet look good enough to get a decent rate on debt. Seriously thought provoking and amazing content and I actually learned something I wouldnt have otherwise learned on my own. How has this sub gone from that to ""buy $BUKKAKECOIN its going to the moon... short squeeze... hold for $50000000000000000000000k"" ? All of the new followers since January dont even know what FD stands for or what it means and that should be a prerequisite to join."

2021-06-07 14:26:05,wallstreetbets,"I apologise my dear ape, but average IQ of this sub is 70 therefore in order for ape to understand an ape must shout. And honestly yes BB will be a fucking machine in the near future. Their QNX software is amazing and as EV carries on increasing their revenue will significantly increase too. Current 8B market cap is severely undervalued for the potential BB has. Also don’t get me wrong, past couple of weeks of volatility did increase the short internet on BB (especially Friday when it dipped) so short interest may be higher now but BB deffo long term ape."

2021-06-07 16:26:58,wallstreetbets,"Well depends how badly it is shorted. In the instance that there are more shares than the float, and whoever is holding them decides not to sell for less than $50k per share, or whatever price, it would reach $50k per share after a margin call. However you're correct in the sense that they don't need to buy my specific share and if my price is higher than everyone else's that price may not be realized. But once margin called, as long as the shares that need to be bought back can't be bought because they are being held the price will keep going up.

EDIT: also if GME does squeeze it means the DD since February is correct and more importantly verifies that apes truly do own the float. Otherwise they would have been able to cover over the past 5 months."
2021-06-07 18:18:23,wallstreetbets,I did and got a 1up!

The sequence of events for us to have arrived here is incredible though. I will tell grandchildren these stories assuming I procreate and then my spawn proceeds to procreate."
2021-06-07 19:37:21,wallstreetbets,I'll never forgot the first GME post i read (Thanksgiving weekend). Bought in that monday at $19 and watched it tank. Held thru earnings. I think I was down $6K at the time...but it paid off bigly. Did it again when it was down to $60. Upset I missed AMC recent action.  Sold all positions in commodities and now in BB.
2021-06-07 19:55:19,wallstreetbets,"Same bro. I went back and checked DFV’s old posts and I even commented on those and said something like “yeah, a brick and mortar video game store during a pandemic and with things like Game Pass- this is bullshit.”

I was wrong but the newbies don’t realize that DFV was a one in a billion situation. 

Now every fucker goes to look up short interest and yells “muh short squeeze fellow apes. Reeeeeee!!”"

the longer it drags on, the more time Ryan Cohen has to implement changes and show results.  i believe in GS2.0 as an amazon competitor.  i feel that’s also why most MsM articles focus on past results and don’t mention the team of new hires from Chewy, Google, and Amazon.   i expect he has a vision to be the Chewy of Gaming.    competitive pricing, better customer service, and a different retail experience.  that was my original investment driver.   not investing advice,  do your own due diligence and drink your own mountain dew."

2021-06-07 17:07:11,wallstreetbets,I'd love to give you details but almost all of them ended with them signing nondisclosure agreements with Robinhood
2021-06-07 18:02:21,wallstreetbets,I think it's typically when people have bought on margin and gone 100s of 1000s in the red
2021-06-07 16:26:38,wallstreetbets,Right? Back when a 5 digit loss wouldn't even get you into the VIP section
2021-06-07 19:09:38,wallstreetbets,You're nuts. There's no easier way to make money than to make it on the back on people blindly giving their money to you. Stop waxing poetic about the before times and instead use the newfound influx to stuff your pockets with their money
2021-06-07 18:35:36,wallstreetbets,You would have to get off reddit to make a board that was similar. The media is constantly sending people here. Don't worry. The sub will probably evolve in more retarded ways.

2021-06-07 17:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Yea, plus they where always unique and interesting plays atleast. Not the current ""sold my car and house to buy more gme....something something ape moon...""

The whole ""ape"" thing is so fucking stupid too...not even retarded....plain stupid"
2021-06-07 18:39:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah and it's too bad. I think WSB used to be more of a release for those of us who lost a fuck ton of money. I lost $30K on a $LULU earnings report and this sub helped me get through it mentally big time by roasting me. I feel like anyone who posts a massive loss anymore gets a lecture about risk management from kids with a $200 RH account.
2021-06-07 17:10:12,wallstreetbets,When you find a RH glitch that lets you YOLO $50K that you never had and then lose it all.. you're going to need a lawyer. And then I think Ironyman somehow withdrew or deposited an additional $5K of to Robinhoods money  to his own account somehow.  Those were glorious times.
2021-06-07 17:22:01,wallstreetbets,"But what if you used an infinite money glitch to exploit Robinhood's risk algorithm and lever up margin up to your own personal risk tolerance, and then lost it all?"
2021-06-07 19:03:41,wallstreetbets,"smart doesn't work, just be your retarded self and you'll do fine"

2021-06-07 18:21:43,wallstreetbets,If BB gets what they are trying to right it's probably a really good long term play. It has nothing to do with shorting though.
2021-06-07 19:42:22,wallstreetbets,Typically buying calls at open on a hot start is an easy way to lose all your money so I wouldn’t say you made a bad choice. Wait for easy entry on GME
2021-06-07 17:54:35,wallstreetbets,You can send me $500 on paypal.
2021-06-07 17:34:34,wallstreetbets,"Its not over yet for GME. AMC just started on the side. 

Dont know much about BB other than i'm bagholding since 20$ lol... But we'll see how it goes"
2021-06-07 17:53:57,wallstreetbets,"I misunderstood your message. Apologies, sir."
2021-06-07 15:24:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m using it in the context of there being only so much funds the ape army has to pump into something for its price to go up without having to write a dissertation on price action that will go unread. Ape money finite and currently largely tied between amc and gme. 

All the meme money can be pulled from amc and gme right now and thrown into Nokia and it’ll hit what? A whopping 10-12$ a share. Nokia has been a money trap for the truly retarded of the meme army since this nonsense started. These people think they’re making a smart play “getting in early”. When in fact the only moon it’s going to is a moon bounce.

Tldr: most of this sub think every share of every company is basically identical and think Nokia can hit the price of gme which just as much ape money thrown into it. Gme at 5$ a share not the same at Nokia at 5$ a share. And market cap comparisons are a pretty brainless way of expressing that for anyone that’s not actually autistic. If GME has a market cap of 30 billion at 250 a share and Nokia has the same cap at 5$ a share anyone but the truly retarded can realize why Nokia ain’t going anywhere."
2021-06-07 15:45:38,wallstreetbets,"I think he's trying to highlight how deceptive it can be to look at share price over market cap. Low market caps have the highest likelihood for astronomical % growth. Since newbie millennial retards often confuse share price and market cap, they might wrongly think NOK is a good candidate for high % growth."
2021-06-07 16:19:45,wallstreetbets,Can’t they sell more shares? WKHS has just as good a chance as going bust as BB.
2021-06-07 16:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t everything around here? I didn’t mean it that way, I just meant we need someone short to hold our bags if we’re going to squeeze- that’s a perfectly safe thing to say in front of the HR department at work, right?"

Hurts real bad..."

I guess I can't complain too much about 10x my original investment though. Put in 3k and I'm sitting at 30k now."
2021-06-07 17:39:09,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $38, rode the initial spike and then couldn’t look away from the ticker all day. I exited at $160 and I’m glad I did. I can’t do my real job and also be obsessed with a stock ticker from 9-5."

Why though? I have fond memories of the place too, but currently I have absolutely no needs that would be served by a blockbuster.

If people want to hand over their money to me for buying it up too fast too early that’s fine. 

QNX not perfect though, and companies have tried to move away and things have changed. I’m still overall bullish long term, but I don’t think it’s a sure bet."

But GME and BB are getting in the light right now thanks to AMC, like AMC and BB got in the light thanks to GME in January...

I don't think GME is ready yet to explode again and brighter than before,  and I will personably wait for GME and BB to go down again to buy more. But I'm also not selling cause we never know, right?

Anyway, this is not financial advise, it's just my own opinion...

They cannot actually dump the price back the way they were able to after Jan. 27 that's for sure.  If they could then that would show that they can afford it but at this point, I'd say hell no they cannot afford it.  

Good sign for us.  Besides, Citadel may be able to afford the price hike but guess who can't?  Smaller hedge funds like Melvin Capital, Susquehanna, etc. When it reaches a certain price, they fuk'd."
2021-06-07 18:18:39,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's public info. Everyone would probably know it otherwise. We don't even know their exact position, so we can't know how expensive it is. Just that by nature it will continue to get more expensive over time."

2021-06-07 18:32:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean sure but you know it has to be over sometime right?  You also know there won't be some big announcement it's over, there will be posts here about the squeeze happening and a bull rush to sell in the squeeze which will tank the price.  While some will get rich off this some will lose their shirts.  Not everyone will be rich, and as I learnt you haven't made any money until you've sold."

2021-06-07 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,Wow. Thats amazing. Just recently got into options trading. Hopefully i’ll be able to pull nasty gains like that

2021-06-07 19:27:55,wallstreetbets,I still have shares but tbh I don't see it blowing up much more than it already has.
2021-06-07 18:53:54,wallstreetbets,"No it's not,  200 million volume traded daily last week, that's half the float. The real play is GME with real research not youtubers."
2021-06-07 17:08:09,wallstreetbets,Ahhh fuck lmao you know what I meant
2021-06-07 17:43:01,wallstreetbets,Give and you shall receive
2021-06-07 17:32:41,wallstreetbets,"its pretty well known it's part of the job, when you see the Wendys employee that goes to take out the trash , they also have to look behind the dumpster to see if anyone is waiting. it's in the job description. at least that's what my manager told me, I wish he'd trust me more, he's always waiting back there."
2021-06-07 17:45:48,wallstreetbets,You have to spend over 10$ it’s part of combo 11 got to ask for the extra large frosty with it
2021-06-07 18:41:20,wallstreetbets,"Semantics probably, the individual burger patties are never frozen. The side of beef that the patties came from, that's another story."
2021-06-07 19:04:10,wallstreetbets,"Idk what you've been watching but AMC had multiple days that had 500-600m volume last week and the week before. AMC is cheaper than GME which WILL bring in more buyers that's just straight facts.

And the fact that you bring up bankruptcy means you haven't done your research.  Adam Aaron won't let that happen.  He stated in the interview with Trey that almost all of their ~5B  debt isn't even owed until 2025 and 2026.  They have over 2B cash on hand, and with Theaters opening up to max capacity soon this isn't anything to worry about.  I really don't see why so many GME lovers hate on AMC. The two stocks actually help eachother."

Sell Wednesday near EOD or Thursday morning, price should be above 20. There's a correction coming starting Thursday and the price will plummet between Thursday and Friday. This isn't just for BB, but across the board.   


Look at the VIX, any meme stock (excluding GME), or the RSI."

2021-06-07 16:45:22,wallstreetbets,"Baby ape here, (sort of, loose understanding of options) 

How do I read this? I understand that he has a large amount of profits right now. And I understand that a call is basically saying that the price of the stock will get to or exceed a set price (a put is the opposite but dropping to a certain price) 


What does the rest of this mean? Again, I know green = good"
2021-06-07 16:48:44,wallstreetbets,Same I missed the jump on amc bought a few AMC at 26. Now I put my Canadian benefit money on BB. Got myself 28 shares. Let's fly boys!
2021-06-07 16:50:31,wallstreetbets,Boys if you can get it up to $31 by 11th I will feed yall grapes for the rest of my ape life

2021-06-07 17:40:30,wallstreetbets,If the paper hands fck off maybe we can see a return to $35 within the next few weeks!
2021-06-07 17:40:40,wallstreetbets,What a mad lad 🔥🔥
2021-06-07 17:41:46,wallstreetbets,"You might want to sell some. Those are $13.50 calls, right?

Sell some to convert to shares.

Intrinsic value on those are $2.27 ($567,500) (less than the $626,932 you put in there). Get some of that extrinsic value and get stock. That’ll actually help the price of the stock (and your remaining calls).

I don’t like the calls personally. Let’s others buy them and execute them to cover shorts. Makes you look like a fape (fake-ape)"
2021-06-07 17:45:09,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-06-07 17:45:20,wallstreetbets,so many 500k+ accounts on RH... so fucking sus ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)

2021-06-07 18:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Hope that works out, was looking at it the other day because I want to diversify more. Maybe after this week if my amc calls work out I’ll send some that way as well. Can never have to many profitable stocks"
2021-06-07 18:11:35,wallstreetbets,Damnnn
2021-06-07 18:14:28,wallstreetbets,Do these people with these crazy gains use margin to buy the contracts? That’s a lot just to get those.

2021-06-07 15:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Jfc. How can anyone be so confident about something? Not only to yolo so much but with so little margin for error. It expires at the end of the week.

I'm not talking shit so stop downvoting me. I'm thinking about buying calls too."
2021-06-07 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,That $16 share price was looking so sweet
2021-06-07 15:33:10,wallstreetbets,Wear your brown pants.
2021-06-07 13:59:55,wallstreetbets,"f. I wish to express my anger here. At 16.50 a hedge fund just pops the price down 10 cents, causing panic selloff, everyone if you see a sharp drop do not sell. and we need  a retail hedge fund to combat that bs."

2021-06-07 14:00:18,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s Robinhood that is dumb. It assumes anyone who uses their platform is probably too stupid to understand what “strike price” means, so they don’t show it.  Yeah. Stupid."
2021-06-07 18:42:28,wallstreetbets,He’ll come back once the moon is full.
2021-06-07 15:10:17,wallstreetbets,Damn that would be a huge return
2021-06-07 14:45:49,wallstreetbets,This is clearly a casino.
2021-06-07 14:15:30,wallstreetbets,"MMs are buying plenty of shares on my behalf, believe me. Also I have plenty of shares in a cash account."
2021-06-07 16:06:56,wallstreetbets,It is fake. No way he made that much on it today
2021-06-07 16:52:37,wallstreetbets,"Download Robinhood.  Open an account and buy BB stonk.  Buckle up, hold on, to the fucking moon."
2021-06-07 16:42:00,wallstreetbets,Couldn't he execute then sell shares if no liquidity for the contracts?
2021-06-07 17:16:40,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-07 13:57:05,wallstreetbets,Just buy stonk.
2021-06-07 15:44:39,wallstreetbets,"BB is a long term investment, it's not terribly volatile. I wouldn't expect a squeeze but it will definitely go up. 

I know some people will crucify me for saying that but everything I've read basically says that."
2021-06-07 15:42:36,wallstreetbets,Google their product. They will be the brains behind every EV in the near future. Only company to not have gotten hacked. Target is between $60-$140
2021-06-07 19:52:48,wallstreetbets,I see this thought quite a bit. Would you mind explaining why? I’m a newbie and would love to learn more!
2021-06-07 16:16:01,wallstreetbets,Started with a $600 stimulus check 🍻
2021-06-07 16:57:13,wallstreetbets,Sir. This is a casino

2021-06-07 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah except you’re never supposed to sell. I bought two shares today because I’m scared. 🥵
2021-06-07 15:38:31,wallstreetbets,🦍
2021-06-07 17:13:44,wallstreetbets,How does one send their rèsumè to the apes?
2021-06-07 19:51:21,wallstreetbets,"True. I’ve been slowly collecting. Up to 40, bought a few more on the dip this weekend. And in all honesty BB is a solid company with its hands in a lot of different products. Good potential in my opinion"
2021-06-07 16:56:18,wallstreetbets,I would keep those shares. Just resist the temptation to sell. I'm just an ape though not a financial guro
2021-06-07 16:37:04,wallstreetbets,Yes! It’s $BB time 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-07 16:41:09,wallstreetbets,Yes! It somehow feels like BB could be the next big move after AMC. As GME obviously
2021-06-07 17:00:42,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it will make any difference, seeing that both AMC and BB goes up together by the same ratio."
2021-06-07 17:01:35,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I did, I moved all of my gains from AMC to BB, sit back and watch it go"
2021-06-07 17:32:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol bad choice BB has zero chance of squeezing, good luck anyways ape"
2021-06-07 19:52:17,wallstreetbets,20 shares is better than no shares ape
2021-06-07 14:52:15,wallstreetbets,Even with the obvious market manipulated that hit all meme stocks at around 1:50 they all rebounded. Apes cant be stopped. SEC do ya jobs
2021-06-07 14:23:18,wallstreetbets,Big Boobies 🍇
2021-06-07 14:04:25,wallstreetbets,Even AMC took a hit. Interesting stuff but this ape isn’t running
2021-06-07 14:12:03,wallstreetbets,"That was a hilarious effort, but they underestimate our will to lose money"
2021-06-07 14:09:06,wallstreetbets,We just eat up the price at a fucking discount and see it pop up stronger lol
2021-06-07 16:23:13,wallstreetbets,I noticed that as well a big boy came in
2021-06-07 15:06:37,wallstreetbets,My wife’s boyfriend will be paying a visit. Cool dude.
2021-06-07 18:22:13,wallstreetbets,I 100% thought I was gonna get rickrolled
2021-06-07 14:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes, this makes sense, and I knew I was dumb."
2021-06-07 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,"So how much would this have cost to place? That’s what I don’t get. You pay the 2.50/share but in theory if it’s ootm you could just not exercise or try to sell before? 

This is why I don’t do options"
2021-06-07 14:47:27,wallstreetbets,"you see it clearly, you literally click the order (BB $13.50 Call) to get to this screen on mobile and it shows on desktop. If you can't remember what option order of yours you just clicked on (mobile), who's the dumb one?"
2021-06-07 15:05:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, RobinHood HIDES YOUR STRIKE PRICE. You literally cannot be more wrong if you got paid to give out shite info. Please quit."
2021-06-07 15:39:19,wallstreetbets,📃 ✋ 🍔 👎 ➡ 💎 ✋ 🎰 💯 🦍
2021-06-07 14:36:00,wallstreetbets,Buying in the money options does effect the price
2021-06-07 16:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the broker. I believe Fidelity let’s you execute then immediately sell if you don’t have the cash to hold these 250,000 shares (assuming he doesn’t have 3.375 mil of cash sitting around lol). I haven’t really looked at this method."
2021-06-07 19:59:10,wallstreetbets,"When everything first started with GME, Robinhood only allowed people to close their positions and removed the buy button entirely. You could say they were sucking their hedge fund daddy’s dick. Once they corrected the “glitch” during that whole shitshow, they restricted people to only being able to buy a certain amount of shares for the meme stock companies. If I remember correctly, at one point you could only buy 10 GME shares / 25 AMC and you would get an error trying to buy more. Same thing went for options."
2021-06-07 19:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Dude no body knows everything, relax cuz I bet you learn somehow also, we are here to learn"
2021-06-07 16:43:27,wallstreetbets,Something about eating crayons and stonks

2021-06-07 14:54:16,wallstreetbets,I just read an article on how the feds are looking into a way to stop reddit investors by coming up with violations.
2021-06-07 19:42:02,wallstreetbets,"> Even with the obvious market manipulated that hit all meme stocks at around 1:30 they all rebounded

Even I as an illiterate ape noticed the massive coordinated selloff at 1:50pm. 

It's kinda fun to watch them try that stuff and instead of panicking, we all just say ""thanks for the discount"" and double down on our positions."
2021-06-07 16:59:16,wallstreetbets,"No, that's ATOS."
2021-06-07 14:09:21,wallstreetbets,Its REBOUNDING LIKE CRAZY

2021-06-07 14:15:35,wallstreetbets,Wondering why these charts seems so similar?
2021-06-07 14:40:11,wallstreetbets,"2.51 (premium) x 100 (shares/contract) x 2500 (contracts) = $627,500"

can also look at 260K was 41% of initial investment --> 260K * (1/0.41)"
2021-06-07 15:41:16,wallstreetbets,"You, for using Robinhood"
2021-06-07 18:22:57,wallstreetbets,Was curious thx for the info
2021-06-07 19:31:44,wallstreetbets,"You’re asking how to put an order on options. You want to do it then do it. Learn from you tube or Google. But if you don’t know what you’re doing don’t come here crying about it. These big b mofos making big money know the risks and know it can easily go to zero just as fast as it’s at a mil. Buy shares if you don’t know how to do options, Atleast you’ll help the share price."
2021-06-07 16:44:27,wallstreetbets,My co worker and I We were talking about CLOV today and he said if it hits $100 he’s putting his security badge on my bosses desk no questions
2021-06-07 17:15:22,wallstreetbets,So if I'm packing a big banana I have a better chance?
2021-06-07 17:02:40,wallstreetbets,You should not be investing... just saying

2021-06-07 14:13:26,wallstreetbets,Are we really assuming they’re not hedged or covered on ITM or near ITM calls?

I don’t want to appear in your dm without permission"
2021-06-07 19:36:40,wallstreetbets,"That’s why it’s a forum! I learn how to do it on YouTube and goo, if you know how to read I ask about How to make a correct option order for BB  on this bull week, that’s it!

2021-06-07 16:47:38,wallstreetbets,That video would be the pure definition of gain porn.

I think this may have been what they are talking about."
2021-06-07 15:21:29,wallstreetbets,"The only way to do that is to take a bullish position on the stock which drives the price up. Then they will dump their own shares to cause people to be nervous.

I’m sure they are doing that but it only works so long. Plus the more shares in the hands of apes they pay more and more.

It’s a vicious cycle and we are whooping ass right now. Trust me they’re panicking.
If everyone really worked together and understands our power right now. It’s not for fake my man. It’s as real as it gets, we can take ALL THEIR MONEY ALL OF IT!!!"

2021-06-07 17:18:12,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Today a lot of people is talking about SEC watching illegal activity from HF and MM and he talks about Feds wanting to stop Reddit investors 😂

2021-06-07 19:06:12,wallstreetbets,"Haha I love the hate. You go ahead and type a god damn novel on options trading.
We buy we hold we win. I’ll see you after June 18th when these contracts expire in the money and they need to be filled at the current market price. 
I live it and I’m going to keep the positivity up. Keep pounding away at Google and fast purchasing call options on Robinhood if it makes you feel competent. I know how it works my friend. 

Yes a hedgefund can purchase shares of equity on a company they are shorting and sell before contracts expire to cause a panic sell off. Knucklehead."
2021-06-07 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah we deadass had a discussion about it. He told us ‘ if any of you guys make it big on a meme stock. Don’t bother with a two weeks notice id quit too’

2021-06-07 18:27:53,wallstreetbets,Musk said is it is really bad for the environment after buying a $1B worth. Cathie woods said it was going to 500k in November 2020 and said Tesla would be some insane value of which it bubbled up to half. She is like the to the moon version of Burry.

2021-06-07 13:53:39,wallstreetbets,"I've been following UWMC for a while now. I made a little fast cash a while back when it jumped up, then re-bought in around 9 bucks. It tanked for a while after that, but when I started looking into the company more it boosted my confidence and I ended up averaging my costs way down when it dropped under 7 bucks.

It seems to have a new floor of 9 bucks, or at least the high 8s. I've been selling OTM covered calls on this to generate extra income. Add that on top of dividends and I'm happy to hold this for a while."
2021-06-07 14:32:06,wallstreetbets,"This looks good, I have shares and calls expiring next month.  Looking forward to seeing this one play out, tons of potential with the upcoming catalysts and little downside if you just buy shares."

2021-06-07 15:26:47,wallstreetbets,Expecting lots of shorts to cover by tomorrow to avoid paying out dividends which should give the stock price a major boost!
2021-06-07 15:47:32,wallstreetbets,UWMC!!!
2021-06-07 14:32:54,wallstreetbets,"Borrow rates for short sellers at 38% plus. Buyback, index inclusions, dividend coming up and a float 1/5th the size of bb makes this an actual  squeeze opportunity. The price moves alot on just a little volume."
2021-06-07 13:48:54,wallstreetbets,I went hard on UWMC- the options are cheap as fuck. The shares pay a dividend. They're buying them back and it's heavily shorted. What's not to like?
2021-06-07 15:14:31,wallstreetbets,JUST ADDED :)
2021-06-07 14:54:53,wallstreetbets,UWMC to the MOON 🚀

2021-06-07 13:19:07,wallstreetbets,short volume dropped from 22/23% of the last week to 19% (fintel data). Seems that someone started to cover with divitendies in sight.

2021-06-07 15:15:36,wallstreetbets,Slow and steady up to $20

2021-06-07 16:04:52,wallstreetbets,Boomers must have been sweating sitting on their 3% gains for the day resulting in the quick sell off before the bell.
2021-06-07 17:02:14,wallstreetbets,The best part is how cheap options are. I think it’s a potential goldmine
2021-06-07 13:18:41,wallstreetbets,"My 6/18 10 calls are getting dangerously close to tanking 

Running out of time"
2021-06-07 16:13:33,wallstreetbets,They have quite a few catalysts and good fundamentals. Can't possibly go tits up.
2021-06-07 16:44:50,wallstreetbets,In for 4100 shares and down 22%. Bought the Spac before it converted to UWMC.
2021-06-07 19:07:54,wallstreetbets,"This is all upside, the risk/reward ratio on this play makes it a no brainer"
2021-06-07 16:45:35,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock (1,130 shares @ 6.80), but I'm not sure a $0.10 dividend is going to force anyone's hand here.

2021-06-07 15:11:00,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-06-07 15:14:51,wallstreetbets,Do stocks not go DOWN after dividend is handed out??
2021-06-07 15:20:30,wallstreetbets,I like this stock !  Got 710 share at 7.80$ and few 7/18 c that are in the money .

2021-06-07 15:51:32,wallstreetbets,I'm all in let's go boyz
2021-06-07 17:52:40,wallstreetbets,"Holding 100 shares at $7.99. Just seems really undervalued when you look at the p/e and consider they pay a cute dividend. Looking forward to reinvesting my dividend into 1 more share and bringing my cost basis down to $7.98. I like the stock, i like the leadership, and I think $9-10 is a worthwhile entry price when you step back and look at the earnings per share this company hits. Most of you retards are just used to seeing negative earnings and YOLOing on IV with tech stocks based on some future “potential”. This company makes a shit-ton of money — right now. My price target is $12 by September 1."
2021-06-07 13:29:16,wallstreetbets,This is gambling
2021-06-07 16:01:24,wallstreetbets,Let's get this show on the road!
2021-06-07 16:54:49,wallstreetbets,how is this technical analysis
2021-06-07 16:08:15,wallstreetbets,"I can't imagine anyone buying right before the dividend in order to get it.  All that does is create taxable gains which funds generally want to avoid.  It doesn't create any profit because the stock drops by the amount of the dividend when it goes ex-div.

There are lots of good reasons the invest (the stock is hugely undervalued given its present and future earnings -- a DCF amalysis suggests that it's worth at least 2x what it's trading for) but buying just to get the dividend is a pretty dumb move -- there is no way Vanguard, or any other big fund, is doing this."
2021-06-07 16:17:51,wallstreetbets,I really wish my UWMC shareholder brothers and sisters would stop posting on this damn sub. They’ve made it clear they are anti UWMC... We don’t need day traders making money on our investment. This is coming from a guy with 1466 shares at close to 12 cost.

Let them pay for the hate when we make profit. Nothing good comes from posting on he site unless it’s about MEME stocks people are trying to sell off.
2021-06-07 15:18:23,wallstreetbets,Just another distraction from GME
2021-06-07 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely a bag lmfao.
2021-06-07 17:45:39,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-07 14:53:30,wallstreetbets,$8.68 is where I think we'll find strong support now based on TA.

2021-06-07 16:09:17,wallstreetbets,"The potential is definitely there and always has been. The problem with this one is, that people have been buying calls and not shares. The volume has been too low for the price to climb and then everyone complains about shitty stock when their calls expire. Same show every month... Buy the shares and this will fly!"
2021-06-07 15:23:16,wallstreetbets,I'm in!

2021-06-07 15:17:07,wallstreetbets,It was a prime short target because it was a SPAC and the entire SPAC market tanked

2021-06-07 15:35:17,wallstreetbets,This week is gonna be crazy!!
2021-06-07 15:16:06,wallstreetbets,What's a good option to purchase here if I'm trying to dip my smooth brain into the options game and learn?
2021-06-07 13:21:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, not so much a short squeeze play but the amount of calls that would be ITM at 9/10 could lead to a gamma squeeze (if exercised). This stock just needs some damn volume to shine."
2021-06-07 13:37:20,wallstreetbets,Should I add your exit as a catalyst? We all have that one person we know that we invest opposite to their portfolio.
2021-06-07 16:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Sent you a message, hopefully just an issue with your posting that we can figure out and let you post it. I don’t like this much attention :)"

2021-06-07 15:23:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, by the amount of the dividend."
2021-06-07 16:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Before you factor in the drip reinvestment, yes. Let's assume that most UWMC shareholders reinvest, it's about 1 million shares purchased at today's price, or about 25% of today's volume. More than enough to compensate for the dividend payout."
2021-06-07 13:30:19,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino

2021-06-07 16:25:21,wallstreetbets,Do you have to spam 4 times? Maybe it wasn’t this subreddit being anti UWMC but being anti-spam. I think a lot of the negativity towards this stock is the sideways movement during a time when other meme stocks were gaining 10-15% daily. This stock is a low risk with potential upside( unless you go options then the risk is there). Sorry to tell you but due to the amount of shorting volumes daily this stock is already being day traded.
2021-06-07 16:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Nah, GME is the play for you if that’s what you’re into."
2021-06-07 15:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Ok, i have a stupid ape question about calls.... Can you exit the position if youre not going to meet your strike or are you obligated to buy? When you say you lost 10k does that mean just in fees?"
2021-06-07 18:17:13,wallstreetbets,"Options are garbage for this stock, I’ve fortunately broke about even but have lost thousands on some attempts.  Up about 15% on my shares though."
2021-06-07 16:31:51,wallstreetbets,Especially with the dividend.  Much easier to hold the bag when it's paying a return.

2021-06-07 17:45:16,wallstreetbets,"correct me if im wrong but doesn't a gamma squeeze have nothing to do with exercising/not exercising? my understanding is that shares are bought up by market makers to cover any calls they've sold that are getting near the money, which drives the price up further and causes call sellers at higher strikes to begin covering as well."
2021-06-07 17:51:29,wallstreetbets,Aren't they automatically exercised by the brokerage if you dont have cash to cover the calls?

2021-06-07 17:01:26,wallstreetbets,"**$300M Buyback**  
May Q1 Earnings Quote: “As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.” That was at a price of $7  
**CEO**  
Mat Ishbia. NCAA 2000 Tournament champion, Mat Ishbia. He owns a 69% stake in the company (nice). Bloomberg news service estimates his personal fortune at $9.42 billion, ranking him as the world’s 244th richest person. Yet he still credits Spartan basketball coach Tom Izzo, along with his father, lawyer Jeff Ishbia, as the mentors most responsible for his position today. Still showing his love for the game, UWMC just announced that they are the exclusive mortgage partners of the Detroit Pistons.  
“There's no detail too small. I know exactly what the sales team is doing … If you start to outsource the little things, the big things don't get taken care of. So we focus on every detail of the business. Another one is to outwork everybody. When I coached for a year with Izzo and saw the meticulous attention to detail and the focus he had on outworking everybody — we'd work until 1 in the morning and come back at 7 in the morning. I don't have our people work like that, but I'm here at 4 in the morning and out at 6:30 at night. Izzo used to say this: ""I'm not the best X-and-Os coach, but I'm going to outwork everyone.' I'm not as smart as Jamie Dimon. I don't have as much money as Dan Gilbert. Whatever it may be. But I can work three hours more a day than them, and if I do that for 18 years, I'm going to eventually catch them. And that's what we've been doing."" -Mat Ishbia  
**Reddit sentiment**  
Honestly, I can barely find any negative sentiment on this stock on reddit.  
r/stocks likes it (1, 2, threads)  
r/investing likes it (great thread)  
r/stockmarket likes it (""exploding stock of the week"")  
r/wallstreetbets likes it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  
Even fucking r/dividends likes it (very informative thread, tl;dr: boomers say it's a 10 year hold)  
Everybody fucking loves this stock. If you think I cherrypicked threads, google “UWMC stock reddit” and open up the first 50 reddit threads. Read every comment on every one. Everybody. fucking. loves. this. stock. apes.. boomers.. value investors.. whatever the fuck the r/stockmarket people are called, they all like it. Plus a lot of these threads calling this a steal are from when this was at $11+/ share. currently at $9. This thing could go up 20% tomorrow and it would still be a steal.  
**Price target**  
This is a $15-18 stock trading at $9. My bull case: current fair value of $20. Easily $40 by 2023, wouldn’t be surprised to see $60+. If this squeezes, we could see that in the next few months.  
**Bear case**  
The main one I see is the debt, but even that is not so bad. They do have a sizeable amount of debt, see chart above. But the Fed will do anything and everything to preserve rates. This precious stock market will be caudled all the way to UWMC $60. So the debt is not such a bad thing. They’re betting on themselves and the Fed isn't stepping in. They’re invested in the future of this company, and the revenue growth makes me less worried about this.  
**Catalyst**  
Ok so what’s the catalyst for the pop?  
1. What was the catalyst in BB/AMC/SENS/WKHS popping? People saw the short interest? Probably, but not sure. I think people just need to look at it and say would you look at this. I think shorters are now scared to get involved with reddit stocks, so WSB interest in this could scare them out. As we’ve seen with all the other stonks, once the shorts are out, the sky is the limit  
2. Check out this DD by u/icedknee, on how Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular stocks. “Now the hedge funds can’t keep adding to their position at higher prices to avoid getting margin called.” Once it starts to run, it’s gone. These upward movements are going to be a snowball effect.  
3. Dividend this week, people are going to want in before that. plus it’s on 6/9 lol  
4. UWMC had a mishap in getting their stock listen on the Russel index. There is a lot up in the air as to if/ when it might be listed, and question marks around this inclusion. Once the dust settles, a listing on the Russel could start the snowball in motion. From u/ swamipro, “1. Institutions have been shying away from adding the stock because they view the inclusion as not guaranteed- Fintel is showing about a 30% institutional ownership-only 10% increase from May 15th- added stocks are at least at 60%. Folks don't fully grasp how much pressure this is...Excited about a $300 million buyback over 2 years? Institutions have to buy 25 million shares over 15 trading days!”  
5. Buyback. I don’t see it staying this low for that long. They've said they think the stock is a steal at current prices (which were $7) so I could see more of the aforementioned buyback happening sooner rather than later, as the run up appears to have started.  
6. Quad witching. Did you feel that? that’s 70% of WSB wincing. “This time will be different” ™️. For apes: quadruple witching refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days, derivatives (e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility. With the current IV being so low (66%), even if nothing happens, calls going up. This is the IV play we talked about earlier. 6/18, mark your calendars. Or wait.. dates are already marked on your calendar.  
7. Earnings run up. Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings  
tl:dr UWMC has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, static stock relative to peers (for now), 5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now), plus half of WSB already fucking owns the stock. tons of bag holders waiting to be saved. Anybody know what UWMC stands for? Ultimate WSB Moon Cruise 🚀🌜"

2021-06-07 15:58:06,wallstreetbets,"More like $18, if you wait until year end, look at rocket, and realize that when the market shifts, uwmc is going to benefit while most other lenders are going to get hurt by it. Wholesale benefits."
2021-06-07 15:26:16,wallstreetbets,"If the call doesnt hit the strike price, the contract is worthless.  You do not have to purchase the shares.  The 10k he lost was the premium he paid for the contract.  My personal opinion, uwmc is so cheap, just buy the shares if youre throwing 10k at options.  This thing is a slow mover and consistently misses the catalysts that are supposed to run the price up.  Rumors are swirling they might miss inclusion into the russel again."
2021-06-07 18:30:45,wallstreetbets,Shares are garbage but you're up 15% on shares? I'm guessing you meant to type options at least once?

2021-06-07 16:19:41,wallstreetbets,"It's hugely undervalued.  That's a great reason to buy.

Borrow fee is very high.  That's another good reason to buy.  I've been getting 17-19% for the past few weeks for lending my shares out.  That adds up fast.

Squeeze seems pretty unlikely but if it happens you won't find me complaining.

But there is no way that a fund is buying just to get the dividend.  That's literally just giving money to the government."

2021-06-07 17:35:24,wallstreetbets,How are you collecting the 17-19% fee?  I’ve just always assumed that the brokerages are the ones pocketing the lending fees.
2021-06-07 17:48:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm signed up for fully paid pending.  A decent broker will split the fees with you if you sign up and agree to lend your fully paid (excess margin, or cash account) shares.

2021-06-07 15:34:32,wallstreetbets,"The fact that the pandemic didn't cause massive, sweeping reforms to our healthcare system makes me worry it'll probably never happen. I can't think of a bigger indictment on our ass-backwards system than what he just all beared witness to. 

Tying healthcare to employment has never made any fucking sense, but we got to see first hand why. The pandemic causes shutdowns, shutdowns cause layoffs and now we have all these uninsured people during a pandemic. 

My state actually did a decent job of getting everyone on Medicare last year, proving that it's affordable and a viable option. However, most, including myself, got kicked off and had to go back to the private insurance racket. 

[This](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries) is a list of the biggest lobbying industries in the US. Pharma is far and away the biggest spender. Insurance, hospitals, and hospital administrations are in the top 10. There's a fuckton of money being spent because the healthcare racket does not want to lose its golden goose. Once people realize that M4A is a cheaper and simpler solution, it'll be difficult to ever convince anyone we should go back to our old system. 

Those industries always push these narratives that people suffering under socialized medicine in Canada or Europe have to deal with an imperfect system. Yet, I've never once met anyone from a country with universal healthcare saying ""hey we should scrap this and do our healthcare like the Americans!"" Like you'd get laughed out of the room for suggesting it. 

Americans are conditioned to just not seek out treatment unless they're literally dying because of the costs and bills. Moreover, it's funny watching all these people push for ""mental health awareness,"" while completely missing the forest for the trees. Like certain NFL players or other celebrities like to virtue signal about mental health awareness, but totally seem to miss that most Americans are already hyper-aware of their mental health, but they can't afford treatment. Who gives a shit if you're aware of mental health issues if you have no access to affordable treatment? When I was younger, I was diagnosed with a pretty severe mental condition: the pediatrician told my parents that, ""best case scenario I would be retarded."" Have I been able to live a happy and fulfilling life, despite being fucking retarded? Sure. Have I had affordable access to treatment and counseling to mitigate my retardation? Fuck no I haven't. 

It doesn't matter if you watch Fox News or MSNBC, you're going to be hit with countless fucking advertisements from pharma or insurance companies. Those networks obviously will never bite the hand that feeds them and promote universal healthcare because those private industries pay all their bills. 

It was not shocking for anyone that we heard about Covid patients ending up with a bill for thousands of dollars. That's just what we've come to expect. Healthcare is one of those things that doesn't really follow other trends in economics. For instance, if I want to buy a Pepsi and they tell me it is $5,000, I'll tell them to get fucked and go buy an RC Cola instead. With healthcare, lots of people are put into a situation where it's either ""pay a ridiculously high price or literally die or fall ill."" They can gouge the ever-living fuck out of prices and people don't really have the means or the option to tell them to get fucked. 

A big point of single payer is that the US would negotiate drug prices and they won't be getting bent over and gouged like the rest of us. The US isn't going to spend $1000 of your tax dollars to buy a single EpiPen or they're not going to spend $700 a month to treat one junkie with Suboxone. 

That's why they lobby way more than any other industry. That's why they spend so much time influencing leaders and advertising on television. Our system is so ridiculously ass-backwards and it makes zero sense, and they know this. They spend a metric fuckton just pushing narratives and leaders to pretend like our system makes a lick of sense, but it doesn't."
2021-06-07 15:49:49,wallstreetbets,"I’m riding the AMC train but I was an idiot back in March so my basis sucks now. CLOV price point and potential are attractive. Bought options today, they’re currently up. I like when stuff like that happens."
2021-06-07 19:44:12,wallstreetbets,Nobody should go broke paying for health insurance. For profit sucks. Single payer pooled risk is the only way this works.

2021-06-07 14:57:03,wallstreetbets,Buying stonk does not equal social activism. Even if clov shoots up the gain will be short term and the health care industry will remain the same. Hedge funds will lose money but the health care companies will keep theirs as well.

2021-06-07 16:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentally speaking Clov isn’t groundbreaking.  I’m not a financial advisor, but I am and advisor of sorts in healthcare specifically in the geriatric population.

With that said, if clov plays its cards right, it could very well hit 25-30 range by 2022.  Their hire who was a former Medicare chief has a lot of connections to legitimize clov as a major handler for Medicare.

Biggest obstacle for cost containment will actually be some seemingly mundane quality measures such as fall prevention, chronic care management, and infection prevention.

Under 15 is a good value... as long they don’t hide shit that could cause a political shitstorm."
2021-06-07 19:12:12,wallstreetbets,"I honestly make fun of NA healthcare but seeing how my one share of Clov is helping Is like giving hope and wishing in some way that US healthcare becomes better.

2021-06-07 19:08:08,wallstreetbets,You spelled Gme wrong bra.
2021-06-07 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,"CLOV seems like a solid play. The fundamentals are there, debt-free and cash positive. Being added to an index this month. The short term potential looks great (see today's 40% gain). I can only imagine what the future holds."
2021-06-07 13:03:05,wallstreetbets,I am so anti CLOV and people hate it. But this is a cry for bagholders to get out. Shorts are not threatened. Many people here also don’t want anything to do with CLOV because the focus is on gme and amc. I’m feeling sorry for those who are going to get stuck in this one. My puts are ready to go just going to time it perfectly.

2021-06-07 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,Mind if I ask through which trading app you bought CLOV through?
2021-06-07 14:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, but I'm waiting to see if it drops back down to around $10. I was caught bag holding @$10 a month ago. I cut my losses, but she dropped 30% before she turned around.

2021-06-07 13:48:02,wallstreetbets,It all depends on this sub Reddit. It could slow down. But if everybody simply purchased some shares like 5-10 and the full 10 million bought this stock then there wouldn’t be any turning back. There where already some large orders so I’m wondering if maybe they are starting to cover?
2021-06-07 13:53:49,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there.....
2021-06-07 13:49:07,wallstreetbets,But if this happened how would we take there money? Let’s be honest they will continue to get a slap on the wrist and that’s it. This is how we get back at the system!

2021-06-07 14:39:22,wallstreetbets,what tells me that we are all holding and buying is the volume up until we reached and passed $16 we did over 145million shares and when it started the roller coaster since then we have only done 15million in shares. This makes me believe that the shorts are trying to sell naked shorts as they don’t have real shares to short. So please hold and reward at the end.

\+bonus I found a comment you posted yesterday

""Only reason I bought into AMC is because it was affordable and undervalued at the price I bought in, GME at 250 is kinda expensive right now.  
EDIT: Not saying GME isn't worth 250, just saying I'm outta ammo, with little to no ammo left might aswell buy some cheap AMC. My bank gives 0.5% return on all my savings untill 12k, after 12k it's 0.01%. Might aswell make GME and AMC my life savings.""

2021-06-07 13:01:22,wallstreetbets,Less active shorts = less squeeze juice. 13% of the float short with AMC right now vs 141% of the float short with GME at its peak is a pretty significant difference.
2021-06-07 12:48:33,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀
2021-06-07 12:54:20,wallstreetbets,Naw. Neither poor nor miserable. I still feel very good about my trade here. And even if I lose this trade I won't be poor or miserable. Nobody wins them all.
2021-06-07 14:20:26,wallstreetbets,If that were true GME wouldn't have been at -141% short. GME was at -141% and we were aware of it because it was public knowledge. ie if naked shorting was not included in short estimates then the maximum we would have ever seen in public was 100% short on GME (or more likely 30-40% short on GME). So at least to as far as I know naked shorting by MM's is both tracked and publicly available information.
2021-06-07 14:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Facts are not FUD. GME was at -141% short which to me says naked shorts were absolutely tracked and public knowledge. ie if naked shorting was not included in short estimates then the maximum we would have ever seen in public was 100% short on GME (or more likely 30-40% short on GME). So at least to as far as I know naked shorting by MM's is both tracked and publicly available information. 

If you guys have evidence to the contrary I would be interested in seeing it."
2021-06-07 14:22:12,wallstreetbets,There hiding there naked shorts by selling call options then buying a synthetic and then telling the clearing firm we bought to cover......look it up it’s all over the news and option chain reflect it
2021-06-07 13:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Will see how this unfolds. No worries, we will come back for GME. We like the stock!"
2021-06-07 14:25:07,wallstreetbets,That seems like a key premise for your position - a key premise I disagree with. I think this thing has more juice to get to $100-120 because of the naked shorts. I’m thinking we see a market train wreck coming in the next 20 days with funds getting margin called and closed out of their positions to deliver the shares.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB - Blackberry to participate in upcoming Investor Conference 9 Jun 2021 Blackberry will be discussing the latest developments in BlackBerry’s technology and strategy, which is something I sure a lot of investors and a lot of us will be interested in listening to.

Link: [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference)

BB holds up on its own. I suspect the volatility we see is from the reasonably cheaper price it commands compared to favorites GME and AMC, where people from all walks of life are trying to sell off at every peak that occurs. Who knows, by Wednesday this shit shoots to $20 or more.

And now my honest opinion - fuck all the moon shit, because frankly all I see happening is people left at the peaks holding bags. You want to do something with BB, just like GME and AMC? Buy and hold, and let the market catch up to the potential that BB will become.

I'm sure a lot of you heard that GME and AMC might be added to RUSSELL 1000 based on performance by June 25 - well BB's earning report will be out at around the same time, June 23. So we shall see by then if BB stands strong, and not just because it is a meme.

This is not financial advice, good luck, and fuck the hedge fund fucks."

2021-06-07 12:24:25,wallstreetbets,BB $169 EOW
2021-06-07 12:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Of all the companies that get labeled the next apple this one actually has a real but small chance of following their footsteps.  

Like apple, $BB once dominated a market they lost and had to pivot into new places.  Apple did so successfully with the iPod and the IPhone.  $BB has a chance with Iot and cyber security.  

I am not claiming $BB is a can’t lose trillion dollar company in 10 years but if they get this right they have a chance to absolutely dominate critical markets of the future.  Not to mention that they are strategically important to both Canada and the US government. 

This is the type of stock you buy with money that you can lose and then promptly forget you bought for a decade or 2.  Then when you remember to check your account one day when you are fat and old you will die of a heart attack because your 2K investment is now worth 2 million."
2021-06-07 12:41:34,wallstreetbets,Fk yes!!
2021-06-07 12:27:26,wallstreetbets,"The higher BB goes, the more strike prices it hits, the more options exercised and shares bought which leads to the higher share price.  I think."

Let’s go"

2021-06-07 14:39:09,wallstreetbets,what tells me that we are all holding and buying is the volume up until we reached and passed $16 we did over 145million shares and when it started the roller coaster since then we have only done 15million in shares. This makes me believe that the shorts are trying to sell naked shorts as they don’t have real shares to short. So please hold and reward at the end.
2021-06-07 16:44:47,wallstreetbets,BB to $69.42

2021-06-07 18:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Finally, some reasonable BB discussion. I like BB long term. Has a lot of cool things they are offering up and those things have a lot of great potential. That's a long term play though, not short.

No one has the right to tell other people what to do with their own money.

Hard rule. Counts everywhere. 

I am pretty sick and tired to hear of some media, self appointed expert, govs, and whoever is breathing and has a higher opinion of himherself than warranted (so always) what to buy or to sell or to get.

F it.

Do what you think is right. Buy what you think is right. Sell when you think it is right. If you want advise, you frigging ask for it and it doesnt get forced on you.

THIS is financial advise

2021-06-07 14:13:01,wallstreetbets,Been buying slowly since january. One of those moves that everyone can get behind. They're good for autists but have a solid long term strategy so everyone gets a lambo

2021-06-07 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,108 @16.21 we bought to see some GREEEEENNNNN
2021-06-07 13:46:57,wallstreetbets,Why are you guys buying $BB?
2021-06-07 14:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Its really hard to take anything seriously when they say stupid shit like ""this is not financial advice"" or ""fuck the hedge funds"" 

You sounded almost sane until that last bit."
2021-06-07 11:43:22,wallstreetbets,"Potential? you mean return to phones with physical keyboard? Sorry, but there is no potential. However, I buy, because I like this stock 🌔"
2021-06-07 16:03:29,wallstreetbets,Take your gains and reinvest if you believe. Y'all gonna end up poorer than you already are.
2021-06-07 13:46:47,wallstreetbets,AMC Kollegen
2021-06-07 14:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Sold at 14 after holding for 6 months, tempted to try again but the stock seems high atm"
2021-06-07 13:36:53,wallstreetbets,"I love seeing all you young apes looking at BB.  Not remembering when it was RIM(M) 

All the same arguments being made today about BB, we were making about RIM,  but the company just couldn't turn their technical superiority into investment and stock growth."
2021-06-07 13:56:28,wallstreetbets,I want a BlackBerry phone
2021-06-07 14:03:54,wallstreetbets,I am asking a genuine question because I want to understand it.
2021-06-07 14:29:22,wallstreetbets,This is embarrassing. Some of your bags are clearly still heavy from Jan
2021-06-07 15:04:38,wallstreetbets,Ah! So this is the good news that will be the catalyst that tanks it back down to $10 a share
2021-06-07 17:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm so happy this shit is taking off, I've had the BB bag since early January

Friends asked me what I was doing, I just liked the stock. BB has a very bright future if it can shake up its public image"

2021-06-07 17:30:24,wallstreetbets,No doubt about that.
2021-06-07 14:37:12,wallstreetbets,All of those things are one-time pops. They should have almost no bearing on the long term valuation of the company. Tech patents can also become dated quickly so I’d be careful of putting too many eggs in that basket. BB’s share price going up needs to be based on real long term fundamentals and future cash flows.
2021-06-07 13:21:58,wallstreetbets,I’m glad I bought extra shares.
2021-06-07 14:23:53,wallstreetbets,On 6/9. Nice.
2021-06-07 11:57:25,wallstreetbets,"A good start, and we have already learnt that paper handing only ends up hurting all of us. Just hold. Fuck it, I'm gonna leave this earth with none of my cash but with a damn fine story to tell."
2021-06-07 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,"I bought in for 4 today at $14.26. It’s not much, but it’s mine!"
2021-06-07 12:07:39,wallstreetbets,I like this number better than last week's $50.

2021-06-07 19:26:14,wallstreetbets,28 at 9$ here
2021-06-07 13:56:45,wallstreetbets,Its blowing up. Went well past 15usd. Great buy for a tech stock
2021-06-07 13:50:41,wallstreetbets,This stock is going to 50USD. Super under rated for a tech stock. They also just locked contracts with the Canadian Government past year for tech security.
2021-06-07 12:50:42,wallstreetbets,Got in around the same… let’s goo
2021-06-07 13:34:57,wallstreetbets,"40 @ 14.37 last week

2021-06-07 16:55:22,wallstreetbets,"20 @ 13.65 from 5 months ago. holding strong.

2021-06-07 13:50:39,wallstreetbets,56 @ 16
2021-06-07 13:53:04,wallstreetbets,You are lucky to get in before it hits 50usd
2021-06-07 13:45:40,wallstreetbets,100 @ 8.17 via CSP
2021-06-07 13:19:53,wallstreetbets,Lmao🤣

2021-06-07 13:56:10,wallstreetbets,"This. 

I'm disabled, don't have much money, $20usd here and there to invest, but made a small goal of buying my 6yt old his first big boy bike. Took a bit, but after GME rose again, made enough to reach it, and enough left over to get him an LED mohawk helmet. 

His smile was this retard's Lambo"
2021-06-07 13:34:37,wallstreetbets,This. Hoping BB gives me that little boost needed to pay off my debts so I can start saving in earnest.
2021-06-07 14:19:48,wallstreetbets,"I think I'm gonna stick around for the investor call at least. I don't care if it goes down. Canadian Finance laws are pretty strict. If I take it out I split profits with the government 50/50 in taxes.

I want a new gaming console, but I only put in a few shares, just what I could afford to lose. I'm up from when I bought in last week but if I sell so what? There aren't many new next gen games coming out. I'm gonna go Buffet style and buy and hold, the only thing that would convince me to sell would be an all-time high of $250.

I like being an investor already and I don't think there's any other company I would choose to invest with that's Canadian that I like. I'm a big movie guy, but AMC is American and I want to support my own country."
2021-06-07 14:53:56,wallstreetbets,...I'm out here to buy a 4Runner.
2021-06-07 12:24:17,wallstreetbets,"If my weeklies cash in like I'm expecting them to, I'm going to roll some of those gains into long calls too.   BB is more than a meme get rich quick scheme."
2021-06-07 14:28:26,wallstreetbets,The expectations are pretty low too.

2021-06-07 19:23:10,wallstreetbets,You know it is
2021-06-07 17:20:12,wallstreetbets,I wish
2021-06-07 12:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Essentially my take on it as well. I'm not sitting here thinking this is an ""F You"" to Hedge Funds. I think cyber security is going to have a huge marketplace in the future and BB looks like a promising bet on it."
2021-06-07 13:55:44,wallstreetbets,50 shares here. My body is ready.
2021-06-07 12:25:51,wallstreetbets,"All the signs were there last Wednesday but the AMC nosedive took all the BB momentum off the table.  It's taking off this week, no question."
2021-06-07 12:22:22,wallstreetbets,"I did 186 @ $17.5 because if you're gonna go retard, go full retard.

Also got some 6/11 18c's because YOLO to the moon lambo"
2021-06-07 12:24:56,wallstreetbets,"What really gives me the satisfaction is that I do nothing remotely related to investment as a job. And all I gotta do is piss around and meme with people, while hedge fundies that work watching the markets all day, seeing things go belly up and their red digits? Satisfying. Knowing that all their indicators mean fuck all in the face of a whole bunch of people who could give less fucks about RSI and BOLL? Yeah, that makes me feel really good."

2021-06-07 15:23:10,wallstreetbets,Those short term cash flows can be used to create long term ones with competent management. They’re just betting on the team.

2021-06-07 14:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.....

not buying that.

Point blank.

Reasons.....

Investor News Conference is coming up this WEDS Jun 9th with amazing positive news along with insight on what the bright future of BB holds and Financials Get Release Jun 23rd. So plenty of amazing news coming out. Price in under rated especially for a tech company.

&#x200B;

2021-06-07 16:12:15,wallstreetbets,"I think the last earnings target was including the patent sales profit.  Patent sales didn’t go through before end of Q, and showed up as poorly missed earnings target.  Not sure where they are on that patent sale thing now."
2021-06-07 17:16:54,wallstreetbets,"long term play is that BB is the only company that will lead the cybersecurity pack. Entire federal gov is going to a canadian company BB to secure their infrastrcture...recently air force! if other companies like CRWD or MSFT had better security don't you think air force and feds would have went to american companies!!? use your brain dude! BB is the only company that can protect smart cars(BB qnx), smart cities, and enterprise network. 

all recent ransomware attack could have been prevented if they were using BB spark cybersecurity! This is all coming to light now. this company will do over 500 in coming years. wait and hold."

2021-06-07 14:49:44,wallstreetbets,Someone has to buy high.
2021-06-07 13:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Yup, just slept on my BB investment cuz I was fine with my 30 shares. Didn't have any extra money for awhile, that I was willing to spend on BB anyway."
2021-06-07 14:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Well. Usually when something crashes there’s a catalyst that makes you think “oh shit maybe I was wrong about this company after all”. 

For BB it was the really bad earnings last quarter. For me personally (LMND) growth slowed down a lot. 

Hence why a lot of people buy high and sell low. 


That’s why I think investing in the team is more important than investing in the product.  A high quality ceo can pivot in any direction. Something happened to TSLA/AMZN? It’s ok Bezos and Musk are geniuses. They’ll figure out how to solve this issue."
2021-06-07 15:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Not my personal strategy, but the buy high and sell low is the way of the apes.

If it had not been approved the stock would certainly have gone down, but not to $0 (Biogen is not a one trick pony like some of the small cap biotech companies. They have other approved drugs.)  


Maybe a covered call would have made more sense? To give you the chance to profit in case it was approved, but protect you from too much downside in case it wasn't."
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC technical analysis 6/7 **DISCLAIMER:**  I am retarded and this is not financial advice, and my wife's boyfriend is not a financial advisor. **Credit** for TA at the bottom of the post

EDIT: AMC STOCK is at a record high because of us apes. As a business with no ape backing, it is not worth what it is now. I guess I made it seem like I would be holding post squeeze? That is not the case. I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. 

**Derp:**

We are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. 

**Technical Analysis:**

We are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.

Let's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first ""Volume support"" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the ""last point of support"" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.

However, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the ""reasonable"" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.

Note: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.

2021-06-07 12:03:17,wallstreetbets,">~~If entering a trade, don't forget to use a stop loss.~~ Don't trade with what you're not willing to lose.

FTFY

Using stop losses fucks everything up for everyone, including yourself. It's a terrible piece of advise in consensus with everyone that's been following this thing for months. This stock is highly volatile and will be hitting bottoms that will none the less be ricocheting upwards before you even have time to notice.

Everyone should just stick with your second sentence there, don't trade with what you're not willing to lose. So if you're only comfortable using $60 to wipe your ass with then just buy that 1 singular stock and let it rocket or tank. If everyone just follows that then the squeeze will be inevitable. If people are putting on stupid ass stop losses then the entire millionaire potential goes to shit."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV - Short Squeeze is probably about to start What’s going on y’all. We got crazy action with GME, AMC, BB, short squeezing, and a bunch of stocks being added to the Russell. Few examples, (MindMed, PLTR, and many other “meme” stocks).

But guess what? Guess who else is being added to the Russell? You best believe it, CLOV is also being added to the Russell index.

As of time of writing, CLOV has gone up 20%.

Also as of time of writing, Ortex is reporting an estimated 39.36% SI (Short interest).

I believe that CLOV is about to match the uptick with the likes of AMC and GME.

Keep your eyes out on this stock.

Edit: Original post was removed I think because I put the DD flair instead of the discussion flair.

Edit: Can you guys upvote my comment where I tagged zjz and unpopular mods in the comment section to see why they took this post down? Thanks 🙏

Edit: The beauty mods of WSB have resurrected this post, thank you!

Final Edit: I just want to confirm when I said the “short squeezing” in my first paragraph, I meant stocks that fall under the “Squeeze Potential” category, whether it be a Short Squeeze or a Gamma Squeeze.

Also, holy moly donut shop! Thanks for the awards and engagement on the post everyone! Wish you all many tendies!"
2021-06-07 15:17:04,wallstreetbets,"When this hits $12, so many calls are going to be ITM. Oh lawdy.   


Low float? Check. 

High short interest? Check

Solid fundamentals? Check

And don't forget: insiders can't sell until this sustains $30 for 30 days, so they can't dump on us. This is going to go parabolic."

&#x200B;

That short report came out in February when the stock was trading around $13. This is going to have to go into the teens, the borrow rate is going to have to go up, and it's going to have to touch the $20's before we get any real action.

This is just the start, plenty of time to get in, but when this thing goes it's going to fly."

At those prices.  I'll get my cost basis back  eventually I guess but this and BNGO and AMC are my account

2021-06-07 15:23:14,wallstreetbets,"The short squeeze should begin at around $15. On average for the moment when the shorts were made, and the average risk commitments of funds, at $12.50 they should be pretty nervous, at $15 they should be selling or covering.

edit: grammar."

2021-06-07 12:35:44,wallstreetbets,It was 36% last week. Now up to 39%. It’s on! Squeeze those fuckers!
2021-06-07 12:37:16,wallstreetbets,Yep.  Loaded up last week while you guys were having fun with AMC.  Looking forward to going to the moon.  Hey... fun fact... did you guys hear Bezos is actually literally going to the moon?  Or at least for a short rocket ride?
2021-06-07 12:39:03,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t focused on clov this morning and great push up! Hopefully to add on a small correction so I don’t get burned

2021-06-07 12:56:13,wallstreetbets,Rockets loaded CLOV!
2021-06-07 12:57:41,wallstreetbets,Not yet. This is just retail buying. They won’t even start to cover until price hits at least $20 per share.
2021-06-07 13:12:54,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding a $12 bag since February. 

Thinking I should wait for it to get higher before buying more???"
2021-06-07 13:13:48,wallstreetbets,This is FUD. GME isn’t in a short squeeze.
2021-06-07 13:15:07,wallstreetbets,"totally agree, #squeezeclov.  been watching this for a while, glad people are finally catching on."
2021-06-07 13:15:21,wallstreetbets,Checking in with 100 shares and 5 call contracts for june 18th at $7.50
2021-06-07 13:17:20,wallstreetbets,would be great if they added weeklies for a real gamma squeeze. Any idea when that might happen?
2021-06-07 13:30:53,wallstreetbets,I have had 200 shares of $CLOV for a bit now at $9 ISH.  BOUGHT ANOTHER 400 this morning at open... went ahead and topped of the sunday with some options plays.  Retard like Brrrrrrrrr
2021-06-07 13:36:13,wallstreetbets,The covered calls I sold this morning are sad I didn't wait until it went higher.
2021-06-07 13:40:01,wallstreetbets,Wait - I thought they closed in January??

2021-06-07 13:45:27,wallstreetbets,Can’t we focus at one STOCK ? And squish it to the limits ? Then proceed to others
2021-06-07 13:47:04,wallstreetbets,You didn't use your crayons to draw pretty color doritos. How are we supposed to do with all those words?

2021-06-07 14:02:57,wallstreetbets,"18 shares at $11.18.  Should still be fine, right?"
2021-06-07 14:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Ihor from S3 partners says the shorts are still up $90m for the year so we need to bring that number down. Once they are in the red they will begin covering.

(I’m assuming we need to raise the stock price naturally to put them in the red? Then they will cover to send us to Mars and beyond? Plz correct me if wrong😅)

2021-06-07 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,"hah, my 6$ cost basis and i sold the 12's.. maybe getting called away this week.

Edit: cost basis 6, not 3. I bought 3$ itm calls when it was in the 6's and found a call with -% break even during the sell off making it about a 6.25$ cost basis"

2021-06-07 14:50:08,wallstreetbets,"I FOMO'd in when it spiked about a month ago, got in at $10.02 then it took a nosedive.  Decided to average down instead of sell, got average down to 8.70 over the past weeks, what a great decision that turned out to be."

2021-06-07 15:06:06,wallstreetbets,"Got in with 2k on Friday then averaged up with a 10k purchase when it started to run today.

2021-06-07 17:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Can someone break this down for me? I just don't understand what I'm missing. 

I'm looking at the option chain for Clov and the deep otm calls ($30 8/20) are increasing in value at multiples of the $11 calls I picked up this morning."

2021-06-07 19:14:27,wallstreetbets,"paper handed 2 days ago when I finally was in the positive, then it started plummeting and I sold for a small loss. I think I had 350@ 9.22. I’m such a dumb bitch 🤮"
2021-06-07 19:17:08,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been hella sick these past few days.  High grade fever.  Muscle aches, extremely sore throat, headache, shortness of breath and hurts to breathe.   But the worst part is I apparently sold all my CLOV today.  I thought it was a dream. I have held for so long and I had bought in at 8.60.  Hell I sold a lot of shit today.  

I am sad."
2021-06-07 19:21:11,wallstreetbets,"I bought 420 shares, see I’m hip too ya young son of a bitches"

2021-06-07 19:59:41,wallstreetbets,RKT also just added. Fucking love CLOV too though
2021-06-07 11:27:42,wallstreetbets,Ahh the same pumper that was WRONG about UWMC is now pumping CLOV.  It’s not going up Bc of the squeeze it’s going up Bc of russel and it’s still riddled with bagholders from $16. Look. This stock isn’t going anywhere 🤡
2021-06-07 12:46:31,wallstreetbets,GME hasn't even got going yet
2021-06-07 13:02:27,wallstreetbets,"Everything is a short squeeze nowadays. Funny how before now last one that got this much attention was in 2008, now we have one every week 😂😂😂"
2021-06-07 14:46:51,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy gme instead lol
2021-06-07 15:05:21,wallstreetbets,"I have a hard time believing this when it comes from an account that’s only been around for a few months. With the current insane action of AMC and GME there’s a lot of incentive to get people to buy into other stocks by piggybacking on the hype. 

I’ll be watching CLOV and for your sake I hope you’re right, but the timing of this post and age of this account do not inspire confidence."
2021-06-07 12:30:11,wallstreetbets,GO GME AND AMC!!! Price action is looking good. Thanks I think I will continue to look to GME and AMC. Love the distractions by hedge funds
2021-06-07 13:04:46,wallstreetbets,Lots of new accts pushing this stock...
2021-06-07 13:24:00,wallstreetbets,Yes if course every Stock is about to short squeeze of course!!!!!!!!
2021-06-07 15:53:50,wallstreetbets,God you guys are dumb.
2021-06-07 12:01:14,wallstreetbets,"I want to get so good at TA that I know when the squeeze will start, unless that’s because shorts are running out."

2021-06-07 12:53:17,wallstreetbets,Why is this not deleted like all the sndl ones. Hmm
2021-06-07 12:53:19,wallstreetbets,Not only is this incorrect (short squeeze vs gamma squeeze) it’s also info that’s been posted with nothing new added
2021-06-07 13:29:42,wallstreetbets,"This is not the squeeze or gamma its buying pressure 

This is only the beginning for the squeeze , Short hedge fund won't give up with out a fight hold those stocks and don't panic ,"
2021-06-07 14:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong 20% is nice but, how long before the real money starts to come in?"

2021-06-07 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,"For shares, what do you think CLOV will get to? What price point should I sell?"
2021-06-07 19:14:58,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a squeeze. Positions or ban
2021-06-07 11:09:38,wallstreetbets,ban
2021-06-07 12:38:57,wallstreetbets,GME was and is still the main play. Every stock is now the next GME. GME is the next GME
2021-06-07 13:15:52,wallstreetbets,What a load of bullshit.OP isnt even retarded.
2021-06-07 12:27:12,wallstreetbets,I have lost money in this damn thing before. No squeeze here.

2021-06-07 14:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't call PLTR a meme stock as it has substance and quite a few new contracts. I hold it for the medium term. BB I am in, as in SNDL, though missed the last train on AMC and GME. Wish I had gone for AMCX when I entered BB, could have been some sweet dollars.."
2021-06-07 14:18:10,wallstreetbets,Clov turned down a bit on the minute chart.
2021-06-07 14:20:45,wallstreetbets,"Keep your eyes on Mind Medicine MNMD, this stock is going to be big.  Time to buy now!"
2021-06-07 14:31:35,wallstreetbets,What’s the designated goal to this stock ?
2021-06-07 14:37:25,wallstreetbets,Got a call option in with a strike of $8 (expires June 18th) that cost me $110 and is now around $350. I need ape help again... at what point do i consider exercising and watch the 100 shares grow vs watching the call grow? Right now the gain on the call is more than the gain on exercising and selling but is there a tipping point where that's no longer the case IE typically within a week of the call expiring or something?
2021-06-07 14:38:31,wallstreetbets,In 100 @ 11.52
2021-06-07 14:38:53,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 7.56 

Bought in before this train started catching speed"
2021-06-07 14:52:03,wallstreetbets,So how many shorted synthetic shares do they have in ratio to the float?
2021-06-07 15:01:52,wallstreetbets,Does anyone care to point me to where to buy clov stocks in Europe?? I would really appreciate the help.
2021-06-07 15:10:14,wallstreetbets,Funny thing is no one is talking about CLOV. IMAGINE all of sudden the word got out about CLOV
2021-06-07 15:10:27,wallstreetbets,Check out $CUM
2021-06-07 15:13:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't get y'all. My 100 calls I bought at open hit 40% before lunch, and I was out. Half the loss porn on this sub are from people jumping into stuff because they see these discussion posts. 🙄"
2021-06-07 15:19:38,wallstreetbets,"When sell? bought a bunch of June 18 11c a few weeks ago. up 400% today, only 98% total lol"
2021-06-07 15:21:20,wallstreetbets,Good cos i just sold
2021-06-07 15:40:31,wallstreetbets,Zjz sucks
2021-06-07 16:22:06,wallstreetbets,Match the uptick with GME.... What exactly do you mean by that considering it's shorted only 39% ...? Are you expecting it to also go up.... Or are you saying it will go up as much as GME?

2021-06-07 15:25:38,wallstreetbets,Wtf is CLOV? You all heard of GME or AMC or is the whole sub just completely fucking compromised from top to bottom now?
2021-06-07 13:09:50,wallstreetbets,Lmmfao! Everyone look at the distractions that are being thrown out trying to get people to sell GME and buy into *”The Next Big Squeeze.”* Don’t fall for it. GME is the way! Buy hold and vote (if you haven’t already). Don’t fall for the FUD tactics. This is not financial advice. I’m a retard and I obviously eat crayons. GME go Brrrr
2021-06-07 18:51:15,wallstreetbets,Do you people even know what a short squeeze is? Jesus Christ this sub.

2021-06-07 12:19:21,wallstreetbets,"Yea I threw a 500 dollar gamble on my first options buy, if CLOV could get past $15 by June 18th that would be great thanks. I would like to see what the color green looks like."

2021-06-07 11:36:18,wallstreetbets,"You maybe missed the memo, but anything that causes a stock price to go up is now a ""short squeeze"" here on WSB"
2021-06-07 12:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeezes around here are artificial and not really gamma squeezes too. There are (as of this writing) 15,000 contracts @ $11 and 17,000 @ $12. If this goes past $12 that's roughly 3,200,000 share volume that would need to cover which isn't even 10% of the days volume SO FAR. It's a drop in the bucket, but the price would soar on the excitement that the price will soar past those thresholds. This is what happened last week with AMC."
2021-06-07 11:41:51,wallstreetbets,What is gamma squeeze?
2021-06-07 12:47:14,wallstreetbets,imagine both a short squeeze + gamma squeeze
2021-06-07 13:17:17,wallstreetbets,would be great if they added weeklies for a real gamma squeeze. Any idea when that might happen?
2021-06-07 13:39:29,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference
2021-06-07 14:25:10,wallstreetbets,"Curious if they're going to try to manage this by surpressing the move until June options expire...

AMC didn't really pop until after May expiry.

If this takes off ahead of June expiry that's when the fun will really begin!"
2021-06-07 15:04:37,wallstreetbets,works 70% of the time....all the time!!!
2021-06-07 16:04:39,wallstreetbets,I don't know what that shit means I just know I bought numbers and now more numbers keep getting bigger and I like this.

2021-06-07 13:44:34,wallstreetbets,"Just wondering, what did you set your trade at? I haven’t made my order for my first option yet and was wondering what kinda move that someone who traded for their first option made."
2021-06-07 13:57:20,wallstreetbets,What you get?
2021-06-07 15:48:39,wallstreetbets,Now you're addicted.
2021-06-07 13:28:25,wallstreetbets,I checked at 8 am EST this morning and it showed 39% so that means more shorts have hopped on board 👀

2021-06-07 18:15:41,wallstreetbets,">  great stock

Have to disagree. It dropped because it is a shit stock in a over saturated field. Doesn't mean a squeeze isn't in order, but it wouldn't have dropped so drastically if it was a ""great stock""."
2021-06-07 12:56:24,wallstreetbets,"Probably not. 25% growth isn’t steep enough to push short sellers to close their position. If short interest stays the same and momentum carries over into after hours trading, there could be a huge surge tomorrow that puts the hedgies with naked shorts or puts into being margin called. CLOV management also can’t sell any class A shares until the stock has been trading at $30 for 90 days, so there’s no stock dilution like there is with AMC. Your money, your risk, but I think there’s enough momentum going to carry this way, way, way beyond what it’s trading at. This looks like the trajectory AMC was on early last week and the week before."

2021-06-07 18:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Clov only has monthly.  June is riskier and cheaper but higher profits to be made short term.  I’d do closer to ITM personally.

Or to be safer you can do July, but then you can hold past the 18th if you doubt it’ll rise that quick before then."
2021-06-07 13:33:53,wallstreetbets,"Complicated question with a complicated answer tbh.  Long story short, the closer to ITM you buy the more you will benefit from delta.  I’m holding 9$ calls and shares.

2021-06-07 16:14:46,wallstreetbets,"When market makers (the people who sell you options) have to buy shares to hedge otm calls that appear to have a better and better chance to get itm. Buying makes stock price rise. Added to other buying activity, more otm calls come itm, forcing more hedging. A lovely feedback loop if you're holding calls or shares."
2021-06-07 11:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze is when a stock goes up due to buying pressure forcing shorts to cover. A gamma squeeze is just much greater and same typical function but the price surges upwards quickly due to buying pressure and large short interest. Remember when GME shot to almost $500? That’s a gamma squeeze.

Edit: As I didn’t explain myself correctly here and people were confused when I wrote buying pressure, here’s the explanation for Gamma Squeeze via google.

“The gamma squeeze happens when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.”

Short Squeeze - Price goes up as stock price increases forcing shorts to cover

Gamma squeeze - When more call options are bought, MMs need to actually buy more shares of the stock to hedge themselves from the options. Having a high short interest is indirectly related as more stock is purchased and price keeps going up it’ll force shorts to cover, so it can be like a double whammy type of situations. But Gamma Squeeze by definition has nothing to do with short interest.

Please refer to probable-maybe Reddit user who commented below who explains a gamma squeeze in more detail."
2021-06-07 18:40:37,wallstreetbets,It's basically a gramma squeeze but without the R.

The same fund that’s short a ton, could have even more money in long calls, and might want to deliberately trigger a squeeze. They also might be short from a much higher price, and might not be underwater at all.

But there are probably at least a few firms out there that are just fucked, and will be soon forced to hedge."

2021-06-07 16:36:53,wallstreetbets,True but even amc the %%% rise isn’t enough to kill off short selling. It’ll just hold. It’s max 10% interest. Can wait all year.
2021-06-07 17:41:49,wallstreetbets,Same trajectory minus management offloading shares
2021-06-07 11:24:39,wallstreetbets,"Damn son, your toilet paper hands aren’t even 2-ply"

2021-06-07 12:32:17,wallstreetbets,I'd suggest just buying stocks and not gambling with options. Especially with meme stocks

2021-06-07 11:38:46,wallstreetbets,"People aren't buying into BB for a squeeze.  Maybe some crayon-eaters are saying that because everything's a short squeeze for them, but BB is memeing on fundamentals in a bizarre turn of events."

2021-06-07 12:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Until these stocks come crashing back down to match their fundamentals, they haven't finished their squeezing. the chart will look like mt everest climb up up up, then drop back to earth as profits are taken and a new wave of bag holders sweeps in."

Edit: sold all shares and 4/5 contracts for a 2,500% gain... will likely rebuy after a healthy pull back."
2021-06-07 14:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Worthwhile. Today I bought 13 $20.00 calls expiry 7/16 and I'm up %74.26 on the day. Try to buy them before the implied volatility gets priced in, and don't hold them long enough for theta decay to eat away all of your gains. Most of all, try be quick on your positions with volatile retard stocks, or you ***will*** find yourself tits up. Mostly most of all, don't listen to me. I'm just a fellow ape who gets lucky from time to time."
2021-06-07 15:05:35,wallstreetbets,I spent a few months learning the ins and outs of calls and finally started pulling the trigger in December. Luckily I knew enough before GME squeezed.
2021-06-07 17:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Start with something cheap, way OTM, and expiring soon. You'll almost certainly lose, but you start to get an idea how it works without losing much. Shit, buy a NOK call for $7 expiring 6/11. It'll probably cost you like $5. Might even make you some money.   


Do that a few times, check out Investopedia's explanations for Delta, Beta, and Gamma. Will help with more traditional style options.   


Good luck, retard."
2021-06-07 13:41:14,wallstreetbets,Ya calls are awesome I put one in at 11$ with 87 contracts and I’m up 9k rn
2021-06-07 17:58:53,wallstreetbets,"Youtube. 

That's where I learned. Take your time and watch a video or two. Sucks because it is confusing, but when it clicks, it will all make sense."

2021-06-07 14:58:24,wallstreetbets,I bought back on Thursday of last week when a $9c was $0.90
2021-06-07 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,"But with so many being in the money, will this raise the price with a gamma squeeze or could people be ready to take profits and ruin my calls?"
2021-06-07 15:08:04,wallstreetbets,"thanks for taking the time to explain it to a crayon eating retard.  
I dont plan to write calls or puts, thats too much risk for me. I did get a couple calls for 18 this months, i plan to exercise them on the expiration day if im in profit"
2021-06-07 13:58:12,wallstreetbets,"Yea you are quite right, so I can just resell the entire option for a higher premium? I thought they were basically worthless until fully ITM. I bought 15x 15 dollar calls for 30 cents per that expire 6/18 last week. I know I 'break even"" at 15.30 share price, so anyone willing to pay more for them is just thinking its going to go even higher? 

Unless I am missing something, lets say the stock makes to exactly 16.30, I would make 1 dollar per share so exactly $1500 dollars in profit right? Or does it make more than that somehow? Is it somehow better to sell ITM options than excise them and sell the actual shares?"
2021-06-07 13:40:20,wallstreetbets,I had about 560 left over in my Robinhood account that is just my gambling money. All my shares and real shit is on Fidelity. Rh just asks like 5 questions and then gives you an example of options and says good luck basically.
2021-06-07 14:13:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm on a TD Ameritrade and my account is nowhere near 25k and I can trade options, just bought a couple for ATOS.

They only require a 25k minimum for PDT, but I think that's required by law."
2021-06-07 13:53:09,wallstreetbets,I haven’t heard the dreaded ladder attack mentioned in over a month. Mythical move by the HFs that used to be responsible for every 1% drop in GME back in January.
2021-06-07 13:33:12,wallstreetbets,^^^  this 😂👏👏😂!
2021-06-07 13:51:27,wallstreetbets,"Wash sales are, as I understand it, when you see low volume but large price drops. Not many people trading the stock but somehow losing 5% or 10% in value."
2021-06-07 14:18:52,wallstreetbets,"A good example of this is the 2007 housing market collapse.

2021-06-07 13:21:29,wallstreetbets,Should’ve gotten some calls on $CUM
2021-06-07 13:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Didn't you hear? Every stock with short interest is about to squeeze. Short interest is the new fundamental. 

But when they get hyped over it and people jump in, it becomes self-fulfilling. Glad I bought CLOV calls on Friday."
2021-06-07 12:28:45,wallstreetbets,Or your greed is preventing you from possibly accepting the fact that AMC will not reach $1000 per share so you’re deflecting your frustration on those who are not listening to your nonsense.
2021-06-07 12:28:39,wallstreetbets,"this is a casino, not a team."
2021-06-07 12:51:45,wallstreetbets,The SEC and brokerage restrictions will likely step in long before GME and AMC reach above the $500 range. Ameritrade has already restricted AMC and it's not even back to where it was last Wednesday. Pumping all the stocks that have a high short interest rate (CLOV currently sits over 36% shorted) as a way to stick it to the institutions shorting them is likely our best bet.
2021-06-07 12:22:37,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know if you’re joking but that’s not a gamma squeeze... gamma squeezes aren’t explicitly related to shorts at all (although they have complimentary effects). Gamma squeezes are caused by MMs hedging/rebalancing positions based price movements. MMs aim to be neutral so when us retards buy 1 call option the MM that sold it to us buy 100 stock so they can always win on premium. Most of the time gamma squeezes are caused by an influx of call purchases followed by MM stock purchases so they happen quickly after options are first written.

However, sometimes MMs want to be more efficient and make some assumptions meaning they aren’t in a completely neutral position. So if their position balances out to neutral-short and the stock trends upwards, they will buy stock to bring them back to neutral (or neutral-long if they buy too much) and that’s what causes gamma squeezes like the more extreme ones we see. Gamma squeezes are especially evident when stock maintains a high price exceeding that of any strikes that exist which is what happened a few times during GME’s first run up because it means all calls in existence will be exercised and MMs will have to write new options and buy more stock when they do.

Gamma squeezes are nowhere near as simple as a short squeezes in terms of how they work. If you see short covering and gamma squeezes taking place together that’s how you end up with $500 GME but they’re two independent concepts."
2021-06-07 12:18:08,wallstreetbets,A gamma squeeze is not based on short interest lmao
2021-06-07 12:05:18,wallstreetbets,"So same concept, just higher intensity/volume?"
2021-06-07 12:53:27,wallstreetbets,Did this just happen with AMC or is AMC sustainable at this market value per share by fundamentals? Curious ape
2021-06-07 15:15:18,wallstreetbets,yeah but it would help
2021-06-07 19:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Nice fuckin rip dude.  What strike / exp?

2021-06-07 11:50:41,wallstreetbets,It means they’re being added to the Russell index which also means a percentage of shares need to be purchased by the index as being part of the index.
2021-06-07 16:43:23,wallstreetbets,.15😎 only one contract tho. But I got 2 9$ strike at .70 and now they’re at 3.70🦍🦍🦍
2021-06-07 16:39:43,wallstreetbets,"So when you buy options you pay a premium. Let’s say I paid a $.20 per share premium for this $30 call option. Well, as the stock rises people start to get the same idea and value this option contract more, and they are willing to pay $1.60 for the option. Well that’s a 800% gsin"
2021-06-07 14:46:56,wallstreetbets,honestly i dont know why theyre up that much the only thing that comes to mind is that the momentum this has people are buying any call they can get their hands up hence driving the price up.
2021-06-07 14:45:25,wallstreetbets,Ask when she takes it out to feed you crayons

2021-06-07 11:40:38,wallstreetbets,Well of course…it’s daily volume and retail interest is significantly higher as a result of its coverage. I still don’t get why that leads you to believe it hasn’t been squeezed yet. How can you be so sure shorts haven’t been covering?

2021-06-07 13:43:02,wallstreetbets,woah … so call options is the way? got into this around january and have been doing great just buying and selling very small amounts. Haven’t done much homework on better investing practices though just keep picking the right times to move in and out of stocks.
2021-06-07 15:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah IV is still fairly low, but slowly rising. I'm in for 20 $10c with the same expiry.. I bought a week ago at $2 but now my average is $1.61.."

2021-06-07 14:32:03,wallstreetbets,I don't think you should be playing with options...
2021-06-07 14:06:25,wallstreetbets,You can sell your stake before it's Itm yes. You would sell to close in your brokerage
2021-06-07 15:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Breakeven only matters if you're exercising, realistically.

Check out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMiRVQJuTj3NpZZP1tKShQ for more options info. He covers it well. And do it before you buy more options."
2021-06-07 16:58:28,wallstreetbets,"bro they're not worthless OTM, that's why you had to pay money buy them. they have two components: intrinsic value and extrinsic value. intrinsic value is the value you'd get out of exercising an option right then and there. stocks that are OTM have zero intrinsic value. however, they may have lots of \*extrinsic\* value. extrinsic value is the value associated with an option based on how likely it is to go ITM (or further ITM if it already is).

an option that is OTM is all extrinsic value (it's worthless to exercise it right now but it might be worth it in the future and that possibility has a calculable dollar value).

an option that is ITM at market close on expiration day is all intrinsic value (no time left for it to go deeper ITM).

&#x200B;

\>  Is it somehow better to sell ITM options than excise them and sell the actual shares?  


almost always"
2021-06-07 14:05:18,wallstreetbets,"lookup intrinsic versus extrinsic value.  you are correct, however the option might be worth more prior to expiry even if the price is below the strike, depending on volatility."
2021-06-07 14:48:36,wallstreetbets,"They have intrinsic and extrinsic value with the extrinsic value being time

Time is money 

That extrinsic value will decrease exponentially with it fizzling away in the last week til expiry if it isn't in the money"
2021-06-07 15:12:45,wallstreetbets,"Imagine that when you placed your order for your position, given its trajectory and distance (in %) from the strike, it was assigned a certain premium (.30). Depending on whether you’re outpacing or falling behind that curve, you’re contract will be worth more or less than what you originally paid. Look up the Greeks of options and watch a couple YouTube videos to get a better understanding of what makes up that calculation of value."

2021-06-07 12:25:19,wallstreetbets,"I just skimmed what you wrote and can tell your correct. But that’s what I mean about buying pressure is the MM’s having to buy more stock to hedge. Also, shorts amplify this reaction as well which is what I meant when I wrote that."
2021-06-07 12:19:23,wallstreetbets,You’re right as a gamma squeeze is based on buying pressure but a high short interests amplifies it that much more.
2021-06-07 13:39:40,wallstreetbets,AMC’s price is way past its fundamental value. But if you’re in AMC right now fundamentals don’t matter as much as the market dynamics of squeezes around it right now so that’s what you should focus on.

2021-06-07 12:42:34,wallstreetbets,It's a what you call it when there are a bunch of rockets because of stuff on charts but DVF didn't post it so it's not officially a short squeeze.
2021-06-07 12:22:19,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze is caused by excessive options buying and little or no float to cover. So market makers have to buy actual stock causing price to rise.
2021-06-07 12:20:39,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze isn’t based on buying pressure. It’s based on the stock price surpassing high volume strike prices which forces naked sellers to cover contracts they sold
2021-06-07 13:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Ok keep losing money?

Man i thought the way im trading was mostly gambling... but youre gambling gambling."

2021-06-07 17:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Hold on so that confuses me again. 

I thought one of the major advantages was that you know up front the most you can lose. 

How does one that doesn’t ‘win’ or end in the money cost you everything? 

I’m really just a fuckin retard so if the question sounds rude it’s not on purpose I really would love to hear back"

2021-06-07 12:46:14,wallstreetbets,For sure I’ve updated my comment for this reason haha and thanks to all of you as well for chiming in to ensure it’s correctly translated and explained!
2021-06-07 14:17:52,wallstreetbets,My original comment was already edited to better explain it. Plus probable-maybe wrote a great explanation on it.
2021-06-07 12:22:12,wallstreetbets,"How does a stock price surpass the high volume strike? With buying pressure ...

What you wrote is correct but it’s buying pressure that causes this to occur.

Edit: By buying pressure I mean more options are purchased resulting in MMs buying more shares to hedge."

2021-06-07 15:57:57,wallstreetbets,"An inexpensive way to learn about Call options first hand would be to buy 1 option on a relatively stable stock at a very inexpensive fee.

For example, Apple right now is $125.65 and you could buy a Jun 11 call option at $133 for a cost of $0.03 meaning a total potential loss of $3.00.  Spend the up to $3.00 and monitor your option and what happens to it's value, it will be money well spent and you may in fact make money."
2021-06-07 14:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the easy education is paper trading. Some apps or platforms offer this - all fake money, no risk, only there to teach you. Take notes for yourself when you make each paper trade ie what DD did you follow to make the decision, and then check your work after you “sell” the paper trade later - was it worth it? 

Really is the best way to jump in if you think trading is for you vs investing."
2021-06-07 15:57:17,wallstreetbets,You're better off just buying shares. You can win it big. But ask those guys how many times they lost first lol
2021-06-07 14:11:45,wallstreetbets,"The hardest part of options is understanding time value. Someone is making a bet against you that the price will not rise above that amount by x date. So for you to win, someone else has to lose. If you mess up the dates, you lose all of your investment. At least with stocks you can usually sell and regain some of the investment."
2021-06-07 16:22:15,wallstreetbets,So go do it then retard

2021-06-07 17:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I should have been more clear. You are correct. However, if you put all your money into an option and it goes sideways or the other way til expiry, you lose it all. 

This happened to me. I got cocky and was rising volatility up and down with CHWY. It was the only thing I kept actually making money on, so one day I decided to just put it all into chewy options and lost everything. Went full retard."
2021-06-07 16:08:06,wallstreetbets,"LOL, you're singin' my tune. 

I'm going to try to sell off my initial investment and let the rest ride as close to the fucking line up to expiry as possible."

2021-06-07 14:25:05,wallstreetbets,"I’ve heard of paper trading but didn’t understand the concept. I’ll look into that. I would very much like to see myself try this out without a real risk/reward. It will also probably force me to actually learn and follow DD. I’m doing well moving my money around but right now but it’s just getting lucky in these meme stocks. But ya i think i’ve got a good amount of awareness/self control that i need to trade. I also have a job that will allow me to take time to learn this and put a decent chunk of cash in every week that i’m okay with fucking up on. Well, thanks for the knowledge i’ll head to google 😂"
2021-06-07 16:57:23,wallstreetbets,So that's what they meant by paper trading competition. I thought paper trading was some sort of slang for bonds or some shit. Didn't realize they were talking about fake money when they were banning people.

If it falters a bit, you still have some premium left to decide what to do with. I’ve got a few of those too.

2021-06-07 15:48:31,wallstreetbets,Yes. Those options are very expensive because they’re the closest to the earnings announcement. I took some profit on it and moved out to the July strike the theta was much too high for me.
2021-06-07 18:36:46,wallstreetbets,"yeah you got risky options lol. I got 8 45c 12/17 calls, bit more time. 

The thing is, big players bought options right at the close today for 6/18. I think this is a winner, no reason to go down."
2021-06-07 10:39:53,wallstreetbets,Premarket tomorrow.
2021-06-07 10:40:55,wallstreetbets,oops you're right thanks

Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 06/08/2021 before market open. The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Apr 2021. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 2 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.96.

They are lower priced than other stores almost all the time. That's the thing. You can get the same stuff there as you can other places, but with the lower price. They sell a ton of non hunting stuff. Guessing by the floor layout and the people I see shopping there, I would bet their biggest selling section is apparel. I would say half the store is clothes and another 10% is shoes."
2021-06-07 11:45:56,wallstreetbets,"ASO is a competitor of Dick's sportings good or whatever. 

A lot of people like ASO cause they allow 2A in their store whereas Dick's doesnt. 

Lots of people are like how you selling guns but don't allow them in your store lmao.   
By that logic ASO > Dicks"
2021-06-07 17:46:04,wallstreetbets,Look at the year chart. IPO’d at 13 in October 2020. Today in June 2021 it’s 38. How is that “always trading sideways?”
2021-06-07 13:25:05,wallstreetbets,"In the last filing they had 781 million in debt while having revenue in Q4 of 1,597 million. That puts their annual revenue around 8 times their debt. That is not a lot of debt.

Even including their lease obligation is $1,185 million, but looking at the 10-k the current portion (due in one year or less) is $80 million. That puts the average lease around 15 years. 

On an annual basis that is 6 billion revenue to 2 billion in debt and lease liabilities. That is still not a lot of debt."

I mean, you drive a car, your car uses gasoline, gasoline is directly tied to oil, oil has fueled countless wars in the ME.

War aside, as you typed that comment, did you think about the fact that part of the device you typed it on was likely made by a wage slave in China under totalitarian rule?

And as another points out, you pay taxes to your government which in turn uses those taxes to purchase weapons or prosecute wars?

Basically, you need to get rid of your modern lifestyle and go live off of nature in the woods if you truly want to avoid causing human suffering other than your own."

2021-06-07 12:08:39,wallstreetbets,"By “allow 2a” what the actual fuck do you mean?  Dick’s is not the government, so by not allowing you to carry guns, they are not denying your 2nd amendment rights.  

I think most people (at least most people i know) tend to buy their guns from gun stores.  Better selection, better service, more knowledgeable, lots of them let you try out if they have a range.  And guess what?  Most of those places aren’t too keen on people walking in flashing their guns.

Most importantly, this is a shitty weak-ass reason to think the stock will perform well.  I would bet guns and ammo make up a small fraction of their total sales."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"To the guy who recommended Wendy's stock($WEN). (Proper DD) Stick with me here.

[This, This right here.](https://preview.redd.it/vpfxsmf2lu371.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a510b9f00a2ce223f5cee290e7abf0a2c30765c2)

Of course now im in, it makes perfect sense. **Literally its the perfect stock for this sub, let me explain.**

&#x200B;

**First**, they just came out with their new summer salad. Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))

&#x200B;

**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the ""Roast Me"" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term ""metapragmatic roasting"" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)

Here is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence. [https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef)

&#x200B;

**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media ""Beef"" or ""Metapragmatic Roasting"" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))

&#x200B;

[Coincidence? ](https://preview.redd.it/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)

**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.**

&#x200B;

So lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10% short which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).

&#x200B;

With an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad.

&#x200B;

Im in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys."

They’ve been doing the meme thing for years, it’s not new. So do a lot of fast food companies. Also, I don’t think a salad is gonna make the stock go moon. Not giving out any financial advice on this, just my thoughts. Personally, I feel like the WEN thing is a distraction from the squeeze plays."

2021-06-07 14:14:00,wallstreetbets,">First, they just came out with their new summer salad. Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.

First of all, who tf are the ""experts"" reviewing this salad? Karen from Calabasas who picked one up on her way to drop her kids off at soccer practice after her morning yoga with Fernando?"
2021-06-07 11:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me Sir, this is a Wendy's. Would you like to try our new tendies? Bullish."
2021-06-07 16:12:00,wallstreetbets,I bought puts on Wendy’s the second they didn’t name their giant breakfast sandwich the BaconEgger

2021-06-07 11:52:16,wallstreetbets,"Who are the ""experts"" that choose the ""salad of the summer""?"
2021-06-07 11:54:27,wallstreetbets,My issue is them not having employees. I went to Wendy's due to T-mobile Tuesday and while in the Drive thru so many cars left due to how slow the line was going. This is due to people not going to work and Wendy's and these joint begging for people to work for them.
2021-06-07 11:55:50,wallstreetbets,i'm in
2021-06-07 11:56:40,wallstreetbets,The original stores were built to be easily converted into carwashes in case they failed at food service. True story.

You immediately lost me in a burst of laughter. I’m going hard puts on Wendy’s now."
2021-06-07 12:34:18,wallstreetbets,"I eat at Wendy’s more than I’d like to admit because they’re directly across the street from my terrible paying job and the 4 for $4 is a no-brainer for lunch. Unfortunately, they do not sell chicken tenders, only nuggets. Therefore, this DD is wrong and you should feel bad."
2021-06-07 12:40:49,wallstreetbets,But do they have a “big salad”
2021-06-07 12:44:17,wallstreetbets,Saw summer salad and bought deep OTM calls

2021-06-07 12:47:31,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at it as near all time high and just needs volume for a breakout, but, eh, I can go with the summer salad reasoning here, provided it comes with a frosty."
2021-06-07 12:48:13,wallstreetbets,Thanks in at $22.98
2021-06-07 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,"Not one Wendy's I've been to in 10 years was clean, well run or crowded"
2021-06-07 12:49:36,wallstreetbets,Damn.  That's actually DD without numbers and charts.  I love it!  Thanks for posting.
2021-06-07 12:51:14,wallstreetbets,I can see a Wendys out my office window. Drive thru literally always packed.

2021-06-07 13:21:55,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about Wendy's stock, but I have to say that I absolutely love getting their taco salads from the drive thru.  You get a crapton of food when you get it drive thru vs walkin."
2021-06-07 13:29:56,wallstreetbets,You're missing the best part. The salad has rocket on it!
2021-06-07 13:35:10,wallstreetbets,White boy summer salad
2021-06-07 13:50:02,wallstreetbets,Who doesn't love the frosty?
2021-06-07 13:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Too long, didn't read. Is this gonna be like when Wendy's released their breakfast menu and this sub freaked out?"
2021-06-07 13:52:17,wallstreetbets,"Hot damn this is the meta now

All DD has to include short interest"
2021-06-07 14:00:08,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."

If you google $BIIB chart in November 2020 then you would notice a huge spike up and then a plunge back down. This was the Advisory Committee to decide if Alzheimer was safe & effective. 

It mooned hard pre-Adcom to ATH of $363.92 and the Adcom voted against $BIIB drug, which plunged to $236.26 a couple days later. 

https://i.redd.it/s09ttexalu371.jpg

The stock rose about $30 into PDUFA. If rejection = plunge and approval = moon. It is not likely to be approved as Adcom voted...

>1 yes, 8 no, 2 uncertain - Evaluating Biogen's drug was enough to demonstrate efficacy. (Study 302 without regard of study 301)

>0 yes, 7 no, 4 uncertain - Evaluating if Phase 1 study demonstrate supporting evidence of efficacy (Study 103)

>5 yes, 0 no, 6 uncertain - Has BIIB presented strong evidence of their drug effect on AD

> 0 yes, 10 no, 1 uncertain - Is Study 302 primary evidence of effectiveness of the treatment of AD.

2021-06-07 11:26:42,wallstreetbets,It’s halted because it just got announced that FDA approved the drug... wondering how high this could go!
2021-06-07 14:28:55,wallstreetbets,Gives the exchange time to reset a new opening cross to try to limit price volatility which require 15 min halts every 5% move in less than 5 mins so they just have 1 halt so the price will jump to the correct price immediately rather than taking half the day.
2021-06-07 11:28:11,wallstreetbets,I would guess something like a 50% increase atleast but probably could go much higher
2021-06-07 14:40:40,wallstreetbets,So? Please explain. Why halt it just because of news? I wanted to buy and got closed out. That seems kind of fucked up.
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ACADEMY & THOR Tues Earnings Thoughts on the earnings call on Tuesday for Tho and ASO. After launching it's IPO in October ASO has been on a tear and it's competitor Dicks trades at 80+ a share. I really believe ASO is WAAAAY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY undervalued. I live in Texas where Academy is the ""Go to"" for sporting goods and having watched the lines of 100+ people at 7am waiting for ammunition outside I believe it's going to have a big move on Tuesday after beating earnings. 

Thor- They are the Ford+GM+FCA combined of the RV world. They make over a dozen different brands and are represented all over the place. The shortage of supplied and material in 2020 seems to be overcome as units are back on the lots now and demand has never been higher. 

I think both of these are set to move this week with both of them substantially beating their earnings. 

And ASO being a long term play that's got a lot of value to it over the next 2 years. I see it trading at the level of Dicks after a year of crushing earnings calls. 

Thoughts?"
2021-06-07 09:09:58,wallstreetbets,ASO is super undervalued and a great buy my brother.  Thank you for helping spread the word 🙏🏻
2021-06-07 09:49:29,wallstreetbets,Big ASO fan. I think they are the hands down the best sporting goods store out there. Hopefully their stock price jumps some too. LFG!!!
2021-06-07 10:09:33,wallstreetbets,I believe is ASO. There are two stores I wish I can bring to Washington state from Texas Academy and HEB.
2021-06-07 11:51:26,wallstreetbets,"Bought both, don’t know what I’m doing but the apes seem to know what’s up. Bought 2 shares of ASO and 1 share of Thor lol"
2021-06-07 10:02:17,wallstreetbets,"ASO has truly been the only sporting goods store that didn’t price gouge their ammo, while maintaining a strict 2 box limit per customer per day. While that limits the returns on the items sold, it ensures a large group of people commit a loyalty to their brand, I know that personally I will never put another dollar into sportsman’s warehouse, dicks or cabelas again. I expect them to smash through earnings and continue to thrive in a greedy market. Ammunition is a small part of their business, but a die hard loyalty amongst customers. Good call OP!"
2021-06-07 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,40x 6/18 $35C and 500 shares! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-07 10:55:07,wallstreetbets,I'm in ASO for the long run but have some July $35 and June $40 calls that are starting to print! I hope for a pop to $50 - $55 but that might be a bit overzealous.
2021-06-07 12:50:45,wallstreetbets,"This is the confirmation bias I logged on for. I really like the stock. Earnings will open a LOT more eyes on ASO. Also, what are your thoughts on them being 88.1% institution-owned? I don’t see many companies with that high institutional ownership."
2021-06-07 19:26:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna second this. How this stock flies under the radar after basically doubling since the IPO and still is a 10 P/E with a kick ass business, I have no idea. 

I’m sitting here thinking my options I loaded up on all week was enough, and now I’m regretting not doing more. 

Tomorrow is such an easy day to make a 5-10% jump on this stock. And it still has long term upside up to at least $50-60/share I think. 

Not that this is investment advice. Cause it isn’t."

2021-06-07 10:32:11,wallstreetbets,"I can only say from the previous 6 months or so, but they haven’t raised prices as far as I’ve seen, and have maintained about a 20% cheaper rate than their competitors, while more importantly, maintaining their supply chain on a consistent basis, dispite often selling out of all calibers pretty much every day they receive. I’ve also heard rumors that they even spread out when they put it on the shelves, so the guys who wait in line before opening (which is what I do) don’t get everything, while those who just can’t do that,  for whatever reason, can still have a chance to get their fill too. Overall I think they way they have handled the pandemic and subsequent ammo shortage will work wonders for their future growth, even once all prices and availability start really stagnating"

We as humans are fascinated by asymmetrical returns, I see articles people ""Yoloing"" their life savings on these worthless stocks. Yes, the share price does rise, but don't just believe a handful of people on this subreddit are responsible for it. There are hedge funds that run quant strategies which buy and sell stocks based on momentum alone and would have possibly made a ton of money on the AMC stock price run-up. So the whole narrative that you are going to stick it to ""Hedge funds"" or ""Wall Street"" is just plain wrong.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.  Don't believe me, go check it out here for yourself. You believe you are doing well saving a dying company, but you are just helping company insiders become rich.

Please always do your own DD, and please apply some common sense, it would go a long way in saving, and eventually making some money.

Not everyone will get rich eventually, sure...but people HOLDING and deliberately losing money for the greater good, or for the other people in this group, only shows some level of humanity that I haven't seen in a long time. Especially not by corporations, banks, Hedgefonds, politicians, governments and even the fucking people next door.

I think everyone here knows that this is kind of apeshit crazy. The risk is high, possible reward is high, but there's a lot of unknown.  


So what...we all probably lost a lot of money in other investments, I think German seniors lost 12 billion in the last year ONLY because of the wirecard disaster.

There is no safety or guarantee for anything in life and more so in times like this, where people lost their jobs, or family members to a global pandemic that made billionaires even richer."

Just because the share price is, say, $100 for AMC... that doesn't mean you can sell it at that price. Someone has to buy it there. Maybe nobody will buy it until it's down to $90. It can take precious minutes (or hours) to complete the trade, and the whole time the price could be fluctuating, especially with meme stocks that are this volatile.

Playing meme stocks is fine. But don’t join “movements”. Those people are going to get destroyed and a lot of them are not playing with fun money."
2021-06-07 10:24:17,wallstreetbets,Ur gonna get shit on for this but keep fighting the good fight
2021-06-07 08:40:00,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't waste your time trying to talk any real sane thoughts to most these people. Its pretty much hopeless. Hilarious though that the large majority dont know what options are and yet, seem to trading pros at the same time? If you took a couple of grand and turned it into 12k + or especially the people that were 50k or 6 six digit gains, that DIDNT TAKE PROFITS , i hope they lose it all. Literally. How stupid can you be? greedy as fuck too...Just like the same people you're ""gonna teach a lesson"" to."
2021-06-07 08:26:54,wallstreetbets,"So what I’m getting out of this is, buy more GME, yeah?  Thanks for the advice."
2021-06-07 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,"GME and BB are worthless companies? GME makes billions in revenue per year alone and if their switch to e-commerce pans out, they're worthy of their market cap. 

BB is the future of car tech. Is that worthless?"
2021-06-07 15:08:06,wallstreetbets,"The thing I never understood about the GME second squeeze hypothesis is.. why wouldn't other hedge funds just market order a ridiculous number of shares and go buy Europe with their gains the next day?

You'd think these self-interested actors would be fine with making more money than they could anywhere else if the opportunity presented itself. If that continues to not happen, maybe it's not what it appears to be."

2021-06-07 15:03:00,wallstreetbets,I only see someone talking about some numbers🦍🦧
2021-06-07 08:04:37,wallstreetbets,Gme is undervalued even without a shortsqueze. The ongoing changes that are happening as we speak brings new live in the company and the fundamentals are getting stronger and stronger.

2021-06-07 09:19:24,wallstreetbets,"paper hands is about trading out of fear, diamond hands is trading from position of control.

If you enter a position and have decided in advance that you'll close it when 20% change happens, then sticking to it is diamond hands. Leaving early is paper hands"
2021-06-07 08:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Its diamond hands long enough to where I feel good about paper handing for profit, leaving you bagholding. Without you diamond handing because you thought we were both diamond handing to the end of time, the stock never would rise high enough for me to cash out."

2021-06-07 09:24:51,wallstreetbets,GME undervalued at 250? You are delusional.
2021-06-07 09:11:06,wallstreetbets,my sentiment exactly.  I will not sell a single share unless its buying rocks on the moon.
2021-06-07 12:37:56,wallstreetbets,"that ""profit"" doesn't exist until you find a buyer and commit to the trade. Until that happens, you are de facto at a loss."

2021-06-07 14:44:49,wallstreetbets,"On the contrary, your dollars are worth nothing until you find someone who will exchange goods, services or AMC stock for them.

2021-06-07 11:25:14,wallstreetbets,"I doubt CCL very much. In case you’re not aware, they diluted their stock a while back. Fundamentally it’s valued at the same as it was pre-covid.

Of course this doesn’t take into account the thousands of boomers ready to take their masks off and go cruisin’. It’s just up in the air at this point, anything could happen. Good luck"
2021-06-07 12:08:31,wallstreetbets,$70 by year end?  Lets come back down to Planet Earth now. Massive dilution happened as another member mentioned. You will not see the pre covid highs again with the dilution thays happened in the last 12 months. Massive!!

2021-06-07 09:44:40,wallstreetbets,"It’ll dilute it — how much depends on what they use the cash for. Usually when we model this out, you assume they buy back shares with the cash raised from warrants which mitigates the dilution depending on the spread between the current share price and the exercise price. So for example if the warrant exercises at $11.50 and the share price is $20, you pay them $11.50 for a share and they can buy back 11.50/20 = 57.5% of a share. If the share price were lower, they can buy more per warrants exercised so dilution will be lower. This is called the “Treasury Stock Method” if you want to read more on it.

But even though it mitigates dilution if they do buy back shares, it’ll be dilutive money matter what as long as the share price is trading above the exercise price. That being said — all respectable institutions model share prices out on a fully diluted basis. So they’ve been incorporating the warrant dilution into their models all along. So while there behaviorally might be some noise, you may see less of a market reaction to the news than you’d think depending on the shareholder base."
2021-06-07 07:17:30,wallstreetbets,Dilution therefore price goes down in theory
2021-06-07 07:15:11,wallstreetbets,"More shares = single share has less value = stonk go down.

Had a healthy pullback on Friday and i'm guessing today will bring us closer to 20 again. I would think a nice spike could happen early this week before CPI data shakes out pants shitters at the end of the week.

2021-06-07 06:38:45,wallstreetbets,"Futures are pointing to a lower open, with tech stocks seeing most of the selling. Nasdaq is off 0.5%. S&P 500 0.2% lower. Dow Industrials flat. That’s as of 0630.

This may be due to comments by Janet Yellen over the weekend, that higher interest rates would be ‘a plus.’ My thoughts on this in the audio, don’t feel like typing them. It follows a ‘just right’ non farm payrolls report on Friday that led the S&P to approach record territory once more.

This week is going to be all about the inflation report, due out Thursday. It’s the CPI report, so not the one watched by the Fed. Should still generate plenty of noise. More on that later.

For today we’re looking for anything that come in to move the broader indexes. There isn’t anything on the economic data release calendar, so maybe the more speculative parts of the market will continue to be where the action is. To wit, AMC and BlackBerry are seeing bids, already up 2% this morning."

an **unidentified** flying object, is by nature, not identified. meaning, it cannot be definitely proven or disproven that it's aliens. So, any report about **unidentified** flying object will obviously not identify anything as ayy lmaos. 

what we **should** be asking for is a report on **identified** flying objects. I.e., objects that the gubbernment HAS identified to be aliens. 

In summary, the UFO report will be a nothingburger and it's by design."

2021-06-07 12:49:54,wallstreetbets,"for those wondering whats going on with CLNE this week and next:  
  
An insane number of calls have been sold in the last few days. 2.8 million shares worth of calls that expire on 6/18. A majority of those have a strike price of $13. So if we can hit $13 by 6/18 those calls expire in the money and institutions have to buy them back. Buying back such a high number of shares on a stock with such low market cap will send the stock price soaring. This makes MORE options expire in the money, and the process repeats sending the price higher"

2021-06-07 08:20:15,wallstreetbets,"When buying puts isn't bearish (not financial advice, just my thoughts):

If the stock you just bought made a really strong move, but you suspect the shorts and profit-taking will bring it down some, at least temporarily, and you check the options and *accidentally* (since we all know you're there to check on how your calls are doing) notice that the puts have fallen off a cliff...

Buying those at stupidly low prices doesn't make you a bear. You're just setting a floor, through expiration, in a way less likely to get pushed out of a position than if you had set a stop loss. And one that still exists outside of regular market hours.

When you're covered like this, then even if the market strikes hard and fast no mercy, you don't break a sweat. Ice water now runs through your veins, as you wait patiently for the buying volume to re-materialize. Much more humane than training the family dog to bite your paper hands if you try to confirm a sell order.

Or if you do get bear-curious later on, say, because some HF you didn't know was balls-deep in shares of your favorite ticker got margin called, or due to a wider market correction, you might have time to exit a position that's going bad above the strike. Holding onto those puts as they become little money printers. Maybe even using them to cover your ass when you re-enter the play."

So if we can hit  $13 by 6/18 those calls expire in the money and institutions have to buy them back. Buying back such a high number of shares on a stock with such low market cap will send the stock price soaring. This makes MORE options expire in the money, and the process repeats sending the price higher"

I guarantee you that the station is owned by Clean Enerygy (CNLE). This is a gas station used by Clean Natural Gas vehicles. The number of CNG vehicles is going up every day. And all these vehicles have no choice but to refuel at CLNE's gas station. 

CLNE has essentially monopolized a whole sector of the oil/energy market. They have partnerships with amazon, BP, chevron, Total and Metro. Stock is undervalued big time right now and is primed for a gamma squeeze. anything from 13 to 20 dollars is possible in the next 2 weeks"

“It is extremely tempting to short these stocks, but unless you have huge liquid resources, please try to resist the temptation because these prices can go to unimaginable highs before they settle down to a reasonable valuation, and you may have to cover on the high point,” the online brokerage pioneer said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”"

Wall Street average expectations for CPI this Thursday is 4.1% YOY increase. While it seems logical to assume stocks will sell off on high inflation. You should acknowledge that any CPI reading of less than that will spark a ""relief rally"". It is very unlikely that the fed will move from its ""transitory inflation"" stance unless the May CPI shows accelerating inflation.if 4.1% is priced in, then a reading of 3.5% would be extremely bullish, even though its almost 2x the fed mandates."

2021-06-07 13:38:16,wallstreetbets,"Instant DD on BIIB after the price spike following FDA approval for the Alzheimer's drug aducanumab:  


It is possible that the controversy surrounding the drug’s approval will hinder sales. An outside panel of experts assembled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly not to support approval last year for lack of efficacy. Some prescribing physicians may agree.  
And even if those concerns don’t end up limiting demand, Biogen might not enjoy market exclusivity for as long as Wall Street thinks. Rival drugmakers have mothballed similar treatments over the years and could now choose to revive them, given the FDA’s evident flexibility.  
Those concerns won’t likely matter to Wall Street any time soon, however. Biogen was trading at less than 12 times last year’s earnings on Monday before the news broke. Its shares were halted on Monday morning, but in a sign of what could be in store, a broad index of biotechnology stocks rallied more than 4% on Monday afternoon.

Even a 40% rally would still leave Biogen shares at 16 times earnings, according to generally accepted accounting principles. That hardly seems unreasonable. After all, the stock traded as high as 25 times earnings back in 2015, when aducanumab showed promising results in early trials."

Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery and these have been addressed  
  
They now have a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.  
  
They've teamed up with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies to h. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.  
  
The lost $6 billion contract with the USPS is in dispute and the postmaster general is being investigated by the FBI. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions and several Ohio Congress members are requesting a halt on it. If this contract comes up for grabs once again, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it.  
  
Out of 8 analysts who have recently ranked WKHS none recommend a sell and some of the price targets are $24, $20, $20, and $17.

Yes, it's TRUE that the U.S. Stock Market used to denote changes in prices using fractions. You would hear Uncle Bauer's scruffy voice as he check the newspaper in the morning running his finger down the paper cursing about down a point and 3/8ths.

The London Stock exchange switched to using decimals to make it easier for the average investor to understand and a lot of people in America clamored for the same simple understanding but it wasn't until 1998, when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table."

WSB was worried the $CLNE play was starting to resemble price manipulation and collusion.

Unfortunately for them, the $CLNE squeeze is inevitable

They're trying to hide the fact that there are so many contracts at $13. And there is no other way for MMs/institutions to hedge those positions without buying up more shares. 

It's simple. $CLNE hits $13, $CLNE moons

2021-06-07 13:57:46,wallstreetbets,"After yolo-ing 10K into BB this morning, I looked down and saw my hands had grown in size, and my skin was leathery and dark like my Ape brethren.  A Banna appeared before me in one hand, and a BlackBerry appeared in the other.

The Jovial rush of coming to adulthood brightened the world around me, and I rushed to the mirror to see what I have become. My eyeholes were moons and I had the build of a full blown Stonkey Kong.

I glanced once more into my hands and noticed my sweat started to harden and crystalize. My hands have become Diamond...

2021-06-07 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,"An article I read today said retail traders are being duped into investing in these companies.  If making money is being duped plz keep duping me fellow apes..

Honestly, I think the whole system forgot what investing is.  Its not some squiggles or candles, its not all these strategies, triangles, and casino shit, its putting your money behind a company and people that you want and expect will do well.  Reddit is showing the world what investing can be and what it can create.  It can bring companies back to life, create new players in old games, give options to people.  Screw the monopolistic billionaire creating machine it has become.  By where we put our money we can generate competition, reward good business and choose to assert valuing of employees instead of the sprint to the bottom through corporate slavery track we're on."

Only thing I don’t have is GME is my portfolio but I will most likely be buying some on the dips tomorrow because you GME apes KNOW they are going to short attack it the day before earnings this Wednesday. 

Speaking of this Wednesday, Blackberry is holding an important investors meeting to discuss the future of the company and investments! You can find that link [here.](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference)

AMC, you already know what’s up! We now know naked shorts have happened, SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED YET AND INTEREST IS CLIMBING, and we haven’t beGUN to see the TRUE squeeze yet!!!

This is beginning of something AMAZING my apes! 

DIAMOND HANDS, ALL YOU GLORIOUS BB, AMC, and GME APES! 🦧🦍👐💎"

2021-06-07 09:51:06,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck BB
2021-06-07 09:52:10,wallstreetbets,GME $265 is worth celebrating!
2021-06-07 09:54:25,wallstreetbets,We need to break 57.45 AMC🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-07 09:55:26,wallstreetbets,BB to 15!!
2021-06-07 09:59:42,wallstreetbets,Guess I was right about AMC breaking out 😎😘
2021-06-07 10:10:12,wallstreetbets,You need AMC on that wall... You want AMC on that wall!!!
2021-06-07 10:19:47,wallstreetbets,"GUYS UNDERSTAND THIS

AMC is used to balance GME by Citadel.
5% growth in GME means $16 up, AMC percentage wise needs to go way harder to cover that. Same is true for BB but we havent done quantative analysis there. I know it sounds like FUD but its with the best intentions.

Its normal and expected to see bigger percentages short term on AMC and BB

HOWEVER this stops at $107,1 for AMC. This is the point where covering through popcorn isnt viable anymore. 2 shares are needed instead of 1. Quickly decaying its hedging ability 


# THIS IS WHY ALL THREE MOVE AT THE SAME TIME

Look at the dollar increases, not the percentages. If GME goes up $16, that's 5%. To correct for that AMC and BB have to grow harder percentage wise to cover the dollar figure.

# if you want to daytrade for gains AMC AND BB are better

# For squeeze / MOASS GME is your ONLY play



**This isnt a simple situation where green determines what to buy and hold. Understand what is happening so you can make informed moves**

I can show the DD on AMC if you want, cant direct link here. WSB removes messages with links to the subreddit"

When a large investor exits, we see a drop, but then the continued fall is the panic of these new retail investors who think the world is ending and don't understand and don't care how the market works. Most are using money they can't or think they can't afford to lose, making only the most perfect positive scenarios with not a dip of a penny a situation they can remain holding in."

2021-06-07 10:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I want to be hype for BB, but look at this movement! It needs some more oomph. AMC is always a hype train, now that is moving in full dollars daily. GME I always expect a wild ride of ups and fuckery (this one is my boi)

Edit: Didn't expect this to be one of my more controversial comments.... I keep seeing it spike up and rocket down... What is this? The GME daily ticker?"
2021-06-07 08:01:15,wallstreetbets,GME is the play
2021-06-07 10:48:06,wallstreetbets,AMC & BB boring right now. I guess I’ll come back when it’s 12
2021-06-07 14:53:01,wallstreetbets,"Buy this shit, the SEC is investigating the naked shorting of $AMC. When this gets brought to light, they will be obligated to pay out to all retail investors holding their ACTUAL shares. This is an awesome price to buy at currently. Will be worth much more in the near future 💎🙌"
2021-06-07 16:35:46,wallstreetbets,GME takes over place 1 as meme king this week
2021-06-07 18:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Unlike amc and gme, the future potential of BB as a company is actually very promising."
2021-06-07 12:14:03,wallstreetbets,Let's be honest AMC will make us the most money
2021-06-07 09:19:43,wallstreetbets,Just seeing bb has a premarket of 5.4M ... is that High? Seems high to this noob
2021-06-07 09:46:32,wallstreetbets,Today is going to be a flat/red day for BB.   You can always tell by the volume.  The days it's mooned or jumped around a bunch it had 40-60 million first 15 minutes.  Today first 15 had 15 mil.  It's not moving today.
2021-06-07 10:34:38,wallstreetbets,Anyone still In NOK?

2021-06-07 19:21:41,wallstreetbets,"TBH when I see people use the word ""fight"" when it comes to stocks, I just picture them sitting slouched in their chair/couch, staring at their phone without moving for 7 and half hours, while praying to one of the many made-up entities for the arrow to move one way rather than the other

Not like you are literally fighting in ancient Roman colosseum for prize money to buy more shares of your chosen stock."

2021-06-07 11:28:29,wallstreetbets,Unlikely. The share price is rising following the T+21 and T+35 Failure To Deliver cycle. Eventually the price will trigger margin calls and *that's* when the fun gets started.
2021-06-07 13:35:40,wallstreetbets,No that has never happened before. Stocks only go up.

2021-06-07 17:29:32,wallstreetbets,The only reason these three are in the title is because they're the most talked about.

2021-06-07 11:59:33,wallstreetbets,The 400+ price was during market hours but it crashed afterwards due to the RH scandal.

2021-06-07 08:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you aware of the DD proving that AMC is being used as a tool to hedge liquidity positions against GME?

DD isnt in favor of AMC squeezing comparibly to GME. There is a reason GME apes are negative about AMC and its not because we are ""jealous"" of OR angry at AMC.

At a price of $101.7 AMC will lose its usefulness, since then two shares of AMC are needed to hedge one share of GME, then quickly two or three. Quickly decaying its usefulness and there for buying pressure. This may either cause a small squeeze or instant sell-off and crash.

However, GME is the endgame squeeze. There is nothing else that has its unique properties like a small float, more than 100% short and even Michael Burry acknowledged so.

Read for yourself.. Google ""
I Got What You Quant - 6/2/21 Trading Analysis and a Deeper Dive Into Today's Tape"". First hit. Cant direct link WSB blocks it

Im not telling you what to do, but I honestly cannot understand why you would take a position when we have DD and observed proof that shows AMC is used as a liquidity tool to suppress the stock that you also hold and are hoping to squeeze. More is not better...

Its not about telling people theyre stupid or wrong. Most are actually uninformed OR unaware. Im just trying to inform."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WDC Western Digital DD: Part 2 Link to part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntqwp7/wdc_western_digital_is_being_driven_up_by_chia/

Chia, a 'green' alternative to GPU mining has caused a global shortage of hard discs. I commented on the increased demand, and the earnings expectations in my previous DD.

Chia uses a proof of space approach to mining that relies on using empty hard disc space. The high profitability of mining thiscaused a surge in demand for hard discs.

However, Chia mining is largely popular in Central and SE Asia right now, with some movement in the West. I expect as more people become aware of this, particularly in the West - it will lead to a shortage of hard discs and SSD's much like the current GPU shortage. There is already a shortage of HDD's/SSD's due to the initial surge of Chia interest causing a buyup of these items. However, as it gains traction, and as people realise how this is much more highly profitable in comparison to GPU mining currently - the demand will be similar to that of GPU's. 

This initial surge I mention, has indeed already caused a surge in the stock prices. With Western digital share price being $52 at the start of the year and now around $77/78. Seagate is also up from $60 to $99. 

Hoffman, the president of Chia Network, says he 'is suprised at the speed at which the hard disc capacity devoted to Chia has grown and admits that this is likely to caused disruptions to the supply chain for some time.'.

In summary, Chia is more profitable (currently) and more energy efficient than GPU mining. Hard drive demand has already spiked leading to shortages. I expect as this grows in popularity in Asia and the west, it will lead to further shortages much like that we see of HDD's.
Therefore driving up the stock price as already has been shown."
2021-06-07 07:52:46,wallstreetbets,"> I expect as this grows in profitability in Asia and the west  

Err, no, the profitability it's dropping like a stone as the reward is fixed per day; basically what you're getting is precisely **inversely** proportional with the [total netspace](https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace?period=1m). Yes, it's 10 times worse than it was one month ago and getting worse and worse and worse. This is by design."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVAX 
Phase 3 US data > 85% sp will increase 100% and we will see $350-380 in a week

Reasoning: UK trial was conducted on 15 k people . US trial 30k people . If US data is also good then government all over the world will bat an eye on NVAX. Why?? Cheapest most effective vaccine. Once this data get released, all hell will break loose. Manufacturing issues??? Resolved.

More orders coming?? SK Bio is there to handle. SErum I is there to handle.

Some study already publishing the benefits of protein based boosters.

IMHO only US data will take this stock ATH.

And it’s going to be at least half of MRNA mkt cap at the end of year. Which will put the stock price close to $700-$800.

People are thinking US data don’t matter only EUA matters. Let me tell you folks Once US data gets published, media will push government to give EUA to NVAX ASAP. So if the data is stellar, all hell breaking loose with NVAX stock. GL longs

Somehow, they all ""short squeeze!"" when short squeezes are very rare in first place. Stupidly rare.

BB can have a gamma squeeze but not likely a short squeeze. Not every stock is a short squeeze just cause GME had one.

If there is a gamma squeeze though, it's an extremely temporary spike. Anyways, I hope I am wrong and every stock from now on that WSB blesses is a short squeeze play. Who knows."

2021-06-07 14:39:26,wallstreetbets,what tells me that we are all holding and buying is the volume up until we reached and passed $16 we did over 145million shares and when it started the roller coaster since then we have only done 15million in shares. This makes me believe that the shorts are trying to sell naked shorts as they don’t have real shares to short. So please hold and reward at the end.

2021-06-07 12:29:42,wallstreetbets,It with me
2021-06-07 09:05:51,wallstreetbets,Let’s go to 100
2021-06-07 08:31:02,wallstreetbets,Oddly true
2021-06-07 14:51:23,wallstreetbets,"I listened when the boomers told me to sell my AMC at a loss a few months back. Never again. Disregard boomers, acquire tendies. BB."
2021-06-07 15:32:40,wallstreetbets,"Fuk it, $4900 of $42 call 01/20/23

Hue hue hue"
2021-06-07 08:31:31,wallstreetbets,The collateral for covered puts is cash. The collateral for covered *calls* is shares. You may want to rethink that trade if you don't understand the difference...
2021-06-07 08:32:29,wallstreetbets,Have you been living under a rock for the past few days ?
2021-06-07 08:36:39,wallstreetbets,"BB pop and short at the open, please DM and I’ll report gains lmao"
2021-06-07 08:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, hello. Is it better to buy b4 market opens? Or after?
Please help"
2021-06-07 06:09:42,wallstreetbets,"It's Patema Inverted, a really good movie!"
2021-06-07 05:50:57,wallstreetbets,This is a 200IQ play literally cucking hedge funds into their graves. You have my love brother 🦍 ❤️
2021-06-07 04:13:59,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-07 08:10:25,wallstreetbets,There is no we
2021-06-07 12:21:00,wallstreetbets,This aged welll
2021-06-07 08:11:53,wallstreetbets,I feel like trading options is frowned upon in this sub (or at least without owning shares) but I doubled my money on some put options Friday and I don't even really know wtf I'm doing yet. I grabbed some $16 call contracts for 06/11 with the profit and I might grab up like 100 shares while it's still low. I'm still a small fry compared to some of you retards but I'm not here to YOLO just trying to ride the waves and make some decent side money
2021-06-07 09:14:25,wallstreetbets,fake
2021-06-07 10:50:50,wallstreetbets,I bought in January.  Thanks for coming back for us.
2021-06-07 12:24:31,wallstreetbets,Oh thot it waz a new phone coming out. The banana phone
2021-06-07 08:42:46,wallstreetbets,BBBY
2021-06-07 04:31:29,wallstreetbets,"Thanks dad, please buy at least 400 more shares tomorrow during the early morning dip.  Thank me later."
2021-06-07 08:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Actually, if you were here before the GME debacle and when WSB was less than 2 Million subscribers, you can see BB was a supremely undervalued play, and that’s why folks piled onto it. It wasn’t because of a short squeeze or any shit like that. 

This place used to be full of smart people pretending to be dumb making wildly risky plays. Now it’s just a bunch of Apes."
2021-06-07 05:29:11,wallstreetbets,There was a Gamma last Wednesday...
2021-06-07 03:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there’s a suspicious amount of BB posts, seems more then when GME first went up"
2021-06-07 05:24:10,wallstreetbets,"GME only ever had a gamma squeeze. The shorts still haven't covered, they've just hidden the FTD's. AMC is gamma squeezing and now BB might gamma squeeze but we still have not seen the GME short squeeze. These preceding gamma squeezes are likely short tactics to spread out retail investing in an attempt to keep retail money from actually causing a real short squeeze in GME."
2021-06-07 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeap, it's not very shorted because the hedges agree with this play, and have been saying so for a few years.  It's just a solid long term stock...

The hype is strange and the BB ""fighting the man"" posts smack of every politician and their demagogue shenanigans.  It's concerning IMHO"
2021-06-07 10:49:50,wallstreetbets,I only know buy and hold 🚀
2021-06-07 08:22:29,wallstreetbets,And soon that will be considered a great buy in point!!

I just wish there was a prequel to see how the world got like this or a sequel to see them with kids that can levitate at will. I'm sure they could eventually figure out how to make kids even though gravity has opposite effects on them."
2021-06-07 03:29:04,wallstreetbets,Patema Inverted :) Epic movie you should watch it.
2021-06-07 03:26:48,wallstreetbets,Ya I’m wondering the same
2021-06-07 11:39:19,wallstreetbets,Patema Inverted
2021-06-07 11:27:49,wallstreetbets,"Patema Inverted.

The girl lived underground to avoid falling into the sky. Eventually she ventured outside though and they fall in love. The guy holding her initially runs an authoritarian regime like in Divergent I guess. Inverted people are regarded as demons for performing expirments that destroyed cities and made them inverted."
2021-06-07 03:06:38,wallstreetbets,For what?
2021-06-07 10:56:58,wallstreetbets,I get the feeling you don't know what that means
2021-06-07 11:50:53,wallstreetbets,The important part is that their kids are going to be able to fly at will.
2021-06-07 12:01:17,wallstreetbets,I know and we need a sequel. It was so good.
2021-06-07 08:28:51,wallstreetbets,his foot was hooked under a thing
2021-06-07 11:51:50,wallstreetbets,Crunchyroll and piracy sites.
2021-06-07 11:53:51,wallstreetbets,"They survived and probably are going to have levitating babies.

The movie is called Patema Inverted"
2021-06-07 11:44:19,wallstreetbets,"Patema Inverted and we need a prequel or a sequel.

It had a happy ending but I'd like to see how the world got like this and what their kids are like. They could probably levitate at will."
2021-06-07 04:58:59,wallstreetbets,Jep. Me. But don't Listen to me. I eat crayons
2021-06-07 09:14:26,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't mind a physical keyboard, but Blackberry isn't in the hardware or phone business anymore so the question is pretty irrelevant to the stonk."

2021-06-07 10:57:13,wallstreetbets,why not invest in a few things?
2021-06-07 04:09:26,wallstreetbets,"You are just as tin foil-ed.

First of all, Alphabet market cap is over 1.6 trillion dollars.

Even some of the biggest hedge funds in the world like Citadel only has \~$35 billion in total management.

Google doesn't give a damn about these 'they'. That kind of money is like pocket change to Google.

&#x200B;

Also, Google does have premarket prices. It's listed. And unless you haven't been aware, Google Finance isn't the place to really be to check up to date pricing. It's not always up to date and many times delayed especially pre/after market."

The movie is Patema Inverted. Highly recommend."
2021-06-07 12:00:18,wallstreetbets,"It's a movie, Patema Inverted.

Would definitely like a sequel though."
2021-06-07 11:50:09,wallstreetbets,"I'd recommend watching the movie, it's called Patema Inverted.

The answer is that a science experiment went very wrong and caused a city, maybe multiple to fall into the sky. Some people managed to stay on the ground and hide underground so they wouldn't fall into the sky.

This didn't happen to everyone though, and inverted people are regarded as demons. Patema eventually found her way to the surface and met this boy though."
2021-06-07 11:46:17,wallstreetbets,"Broooo

There might be some doujins with that premise though. They do start dating at the end so if there were a sequel their kids could probably fly at will."
2021-06-07 11:02:51,wallstreetbets,Its not supposed to focus on anything. This is a trading sub not a cult
2021-06-07 09:22:35,wallstreetbets,I get terrible investment advice from this sub but always good anime recommendations.

Why is it so hard to give money to someone so you can watch a freaking anime..."
2021-06-07 09:58:15,wallstreetbets,You the goat
2021-06-07 10:52:07,wallstreetbets,That was not exactly true but he's about to find out later.
2021-06-07 10:52:48,wallstreetbets,I love anime but sometimes their concepts are pretty wack. She lives in the clouds where gravity is reversed? Lmao
2021-06-07 11:03:01,wallstreetbets,so........buy calls on flat earthers. got it
2021-06-07 11:14:38,wallstreetbets,"No she lived underground so they wouldn't fall into the sky.

I really want a sequel to this or a prequel about how people became like that.

Most importantly I want to know how they'd make kids and if their kids could levitate instead of just fall up."
2021-06-07 11:27:00,wallstreetbets,Is there a dubbed version?
2021-06-07 11:59:56,wallstreetbets,Thx gonna watch it now!

edit: Upside Down, 2012. Paterna Inverted 2013. Hmmm, why so many influences all the same at the same time

edit edit: even the wikipedia article, quoting a New York Times reviewer points this out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patema\_Inverted"

2021-06-07 09:57:24,wallstreetbets,It's ok. I'm double red so far. Avg buy in at 17.65 and and dollar is weakening towards the SEK as well. Expecting the dollar to bounce on the resistance though so off we go!

And the weight is still attached to her leg throughout video (can see the weight still on her leg when she jumps to him). So he was able to hold her down in beginning but at end they fly off.

Not to mention she should have shot immediately up Into the air as soon as she pushed away from the bad guy lol

Seems like a consistency mistake to me, but, it’s anime lol, correct physics and/or internal consistency with made-up physics often doesn’t happen. I was just making a joke"

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Shorting is not bad / not going away As a 20+ year daytrader I thought I just weigh-in with this fact: 
shorting is an indispensable tool of the financial markets. 

As a 60/40 short biased trader, I’m not saying that for my self-interest. I can, and do, make money both directions each and every day. I’m saying it because this sub (WSB) has (rightly or wrongly) been ascribed an aversion to, and a desire to abolish, the ability to short stocks. 

Everyone should be against NAKED short selling. That is an abomination that should absolutely be stomped out - and I also believe it is rampant. Naked short selling makes a mockery of the entire market and I’m proud the apes are finally on the verge of exposing it to the world. 

Every time I’ve been asked in my life what shorting a stock means, I’ve gone through the same numerous factors that make shorting possible: and they always include locating shares to borrow, and paying a fee if necessary, to initiate the position. The idea that institutions are filling retail buy orders with shares that don’t even exist really blows my mind and should shake the faith of all market participants. 
 
But retail and institutional investors being able to short stocks they feel are highly overvalued really does serve to prevent the pervasive & consistent mis-pricing of assets. This prevents small groups of persons/entities from ‘cornering the market’ on numerous low float illiquid stocks (and others). And of course there’s the liquidity argument. And on and on blah blah. 

Thoughts???"

this is the crux of it. *this* shouldn't exist. it's not wild to think 'shares should have to exist to make this transaction involving said shares'.

i'm not a fan of how the past 4 or 5 months every post has the words ""short squeeze"" in it but then they're like 'it's 35% short interest' like that's suppose to cause me feelings. that just means some people do not like that stock. 🤷‍♀️"

2021-06-07 09:14:19,wallstreetbets,"Personally I'm not against short selling in and of itself. It's a valid tactic that actually is a huge risk so it's not something that's done heavily.

What people are unhappy with is that the tactic has been clearly abused. Not just naked shorts or synthetic shares but shorting a company and then aggressively trying to destroy it while the shorts just pile on harder. It's the manipulation and bullshit that people are sick of. Hedge funds looking for easy money shouldn't have the power to tank a company's stock to intentionally make money on shorts. Short selling is supposed to be *risky.*

Really what people are fundamentally sick of is the financial industry rigging everything in their own favor so no matter what happens they make money. It's becoming increasingly clear that it's a rigged game with rules that change to suit a handful of rich assholes while the rest of us get stuck with the bill."

It is more efficient than the SEC because the investors who are short are motivated by profit to find these cases where corporations are potentially distorting their numbers, for example, or mis-allocating investor capital.

No defense for naked shorts; but this perspective made perfect sense.

2021-06-07 03:21:12,wallstreetbets,"But why?

Here's an idea.  Invest in companies you believe in.  Do not invest in companies you do not believe in.  It's as simple as that.  If you find a company to be garbage and you expect it to drop, either buy puts or don't bother with it.  Do not actively force the price down.  The only individuals who should be able to sell shares should be people with shares.  Not people who want to borrow to sell.

If you can't handle the concept of ""not investing"" instead of ""actively trying to force a company down"", maybe you shouldn't be playing the game.  When you buy, you buy something you don't have.  When you sell, you sell something you do have.  The float should be a set quantity decided by how many shares actually exist instead of how much huge shareholders are willing to lend out and re-buy."

Short selling has a good purpose, but it's been abused in the past to manipulate share prices in the market. The SEC put in a modified Uptick Rule sometime in 2009 or 2010 I think, so it *shouldn't* happen, but then you have all of these naked (illegal) shorts using shares borrowed from borrowed shares that were lent and borrowed and borrowed and lent. There's a huge difference. 

So yeah, I agree. It has a place, and it's a valuable tool even for retail investors. The trouble is when people f\*&k with the rules and change the game for everyone else.

*Also this sub seems way too focused on short interest and seem to think every stock is about to squeeze due to GME hype and it's really, really bad to use that as the rationale behind buying a stock.

Now, there has been considerable DD done on sec “fines” for misclassifying shorts as longs to cover margins. That is like the number one fine, they don’t mark a sale as short and creates false liquidity. Shorting in itself literally drives price down artificially, since you never paid into the stock. In essence it’s the casino effect of stacking odds in your favor. The more you short, the more drastic prices change, causing potentially good companies to come crumbling down. This process has set back our medical research by decades. It shouldn’t exist in a fair market, it is literally a tool of the wealthy to keep people down. You dont like the stock? Buy a put. That’s fair and equal.

Edit: to clarify sec fines are like 150k 3-5 years down the road, when misclassifying is making/saving funds millions. Is just the cost of doing business, or a bribe. That’s also only on ones caught, because obviously they don’t check every record."

Second, the object I borrow in question will more often than not have more value than the value its sold for, which often means that this idea burns the borrower when they pay more than they sold it for.  

Finally, there's this idea going around that doing this kind of trading stabilizes the market and helps prevent crazy spikes in demand, and I find that to be definitively false on the securities side.  If you friend agreed to let you borrow his PS5 so you could sell it then buy it back for a profit, 99 times out of 100 you'll be the one who gets burned because you sold it at the wrong price, the fees kill your profit or your friend forces you to buy it back.  As for securities, the ongoing instability with GME and other highly praised stocks proves shorting doesn't help stabilize crap, and that 99 shorts out of 100 got burned because they shorted at the wrong price, the borrowing fees kill their profits or the margin calls forced them to buy it back.

If a given stock was at the maximum possible price it could sell for on the market, then theoretically, I might be open to the idea of shorting if the stock was within 90% or so of the maximum price allowable, the stock could not be split to lower the price, and the margin risk of reaching the maximum price was acceptable to the broker.  But that's all nonsense, the truth is if I had power over the laws in the market, I would make shorting illegal because it does more harm than good."

If you think about the distribution of outcomes for opening a short position, if out of the 20% that are most profitable, half only happen to that degree because of naked short selling, that kills the overall returns."

2021-06-07 05:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Morally I'm not sure I agree with profiting off the failure or downturn of a stock, price should be set by buyers and in order to profit off a downturn you should aim to sell at the peak and buy low. If something is overvalued that's a consequence of the collective mindset of the market, you see this with various other markets for other types of assets, you can't profit off of the depreciating value of a painting for instance without selling high and buying low. If everyone decides a share is worth way more than it should be, perhaps there should be other ways of fixing the overvaluation

That being said if shorting came with restrictions that made it impossible to abuse (legally or illegally) then I suppose it is fine. The entire stock market seems like a joke when it comes to regulations, either keep it unregulated and simple ie. you can buy or sell a share and that's it, or actually heavily regulate all these additional mechanisms. If something is exploitable big money will find a way to do it."

As long as the shares are located in time for voting and dividends are financially accounted for, then the only thing naked shorting does is make squeezes less imminent. It's not clear to me that a short squeeze serves any useful purpose outside of profiting from the gamified version of the market that everybody wants to play.

I can make a side bet with somebody where we bet on the price of a stock as if one of us had bought and the other had sold it. Nothing particularly bad about that. And that's all most people are doing when they buy/short shares here anyway. Especially if naked shorting is used as a temporary measure to provide additional liquidity and the positions aren't maintained especially long term. The MM's are basically just taking on the financial risk of not having the actual shares, as long as they have sufficient capital to cover those positions it doesn't bother me."

2021-06-07 06:00:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah the real issue is that they're allowing the same share to be lent repeatedly which means you essentially dilute the stock out with nonexistent phantom shares. They need to require not only that you locate the share to borrow but to track the borrows and disallow relending. Meaning you can borrow and sell the share just that once but that same share can't be relent. Of course that would lead to issues as well since you'd have basically two classes of shares since shares that have already been borrowed can't be lent out to juice returns.
2021-06-07 08:03:50,wallstreetbets,Those are not the way.

It also is stealing money away from uninformed newbies that visit WSB because they heard about it online. 
They then see 20 posts about Blackberry, a few posts about some other shorted stock, and then not a thing about what's happening in the Gamestop, naked short, story.

If youre shorting because the stock is fundamentally overvalued or the books are all fucked then thats just a regular play on the market to make money. If youre shorting a stock though just because you dont like the business and you want it to fail, or any other reason outside of the view that the stock is fundamentally overvalued and that you see a possible downward movement to catch some money on, thats when its a bit disgusting. People dont like shorting because they A. dont understand it (like anything else in the world people dont like) and B. its betting on a companies stock going down, and ideally for the shorter, technically as much as possible. But like I said before, if its shorted because of fundamentals theres nothing wrong with it, shorting because ""fuck such and such company I hope they go bankrupt or fail"" thats just in bad taste."

As long as Wall Street controls the corps the corps do whatever wall street wants. If wallstreet shorts a company and then promises to buy back cheap stock a company might just fuck up that quarter maybe issue a recall or smg and boom hedges make money, and then buy more company stock and value goes up for next quarter. Quite simple rly. The world is controlled by a select few some of which earned those positions, many of which inherited it, stole it, killed for it, got it through bad means"
2021-06-07 00:56:49,wallstreetbets,Which tech companies you talking about?  Plus tech is more risky to short.  Something perceived as innovative can spring up and cause the stock to spike off speculation.  The movie theater and used game market is dying with the rest if retail

2021-06-07 06:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Being saying overvalued for how long? 5 years? 10 years?

Techs will continue to look overvalued in the present because that's the nature of a growth stock. You know, companies that actually GROW rather than being stagnant for the last 30 years. And if you only want to compare to historic averages, you can say some staples stocks look overvalued too.

Value is such a subjective term from person to person. *One person’s trash is another person’s treasure.*"

2021-06-07 08:34:54,wallstreetbets,"I know why things work the way they do.  Greed.  Dumbasses bought the story for years that shorting companies is a vital tool for a healthy market.  It's not.

Do we see people short selling things like first edition shiny Charizard cards?  That would be pretty profitable, wouldn't it?  They're rare, they're desirable, and certain collectors would pay a lot for them.  So why not just flood the market with tens of thousands of them?  *Because they don't exist*.  ""But OP, just borrow one and sell it to someone else!""  If I do that, the person I borrowed from *no longer has the card*.  That person no longer can claim ownership of the card because it's simply not there in their possession.  There may be a contract saying that they are owed a shiny first edition Charizard Pokemon card, but that's not a shiny first edition Charizard Pokemon card.  We know how many cards exist, and the people claiming ownership are the ones with the cards.  If you lent yours out, you no longer have ownership, the card now belongs to someone else.

This isn't the case with shares.  If I have a share of a company and lend it to you to sell, I still own one share.  Someone else now also owns that same share.  There's two people claiming ownership over this share, and one other person who walked away with cash.  The other person who owns my share can now also sell that share to someone else or lend it out.  This inflates the size of the float.  Now I have the ability to force recall my share, meaning the person I lent to is forced to buy a share and give it back to me, but if the people further down the line with my share didn't want to sell, they aren't obligated to sell back to the guy who sold the share.  I, as the lender of the share, have power over the person who I lent to.  Now what happens when I have *millions* of shares?  Suddenly I have the power to *force* a stock to spike in value.  I can demand my shares to be returned, which increases buying pressure.  It creates an upward trend with volume behind it that people follow and keep the momentum going.  I create my own price movement.  Doesn't that sound like manipulation to you?  That sounds like manipulation to me.

So instead of being brainwashed by the asshats that want to have that kind of power with full intention of abusing it, why not speak up against it?  Yeah, it's the system we have right now and we have to play by the rules that already exist unfortunately.  But that doesn't mean we have to be happy about it or blindly follow the shitlords that do nothing but cheat and lie to make a quick buck.  It's bad for the market."
2021-06-07 08:12:02,wallstreetbets,"If people want to sell their shares because the company they have shares in is fraudulent, then they can sell their shares.  But if you don't have shares in the company, you shouldn't get to sell shares.  Because you don't have shares.  It's a simple concept.

Let the shareholders decide what they're willing to sell for.  Let the prospective buyers decide what they're willing to buy for.  If a company is fraudulent, the demand will drop.  You don't need to increase the supply of shares through shorting to make supply outpace demand in this scenario, supply will quickly outpace demand in this scenario."
2021-06-07 08:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Literally everything is way overvalued right now to the point that we're changing what we consider to be ""overvalued"" into ""fair valued"".  It's been going like this for a while.  🌈🐻's have clearly done a shit job of driving down prices if that's what their purpose is.

We don't need 🌈🐻's.  When bulls want to take profits, they'll sell.  When a company becomes overvalued, traders will sell.  When 🌈🐻 deserving bullshit goes on at a company, the shareholders lose a bit of faith and they sell.  The selling shouldn't be amplified with outside help from super 🌈🌈🌈🐻 asshats that decide to double the float with shares that others own and have a claim to."

2021-06-07 08:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen this stock market...?  This is one of the most untrustworthy markets that exists at this point.  And why is that?  *Shorting*.

Practically every stock is being shorted.  INO as an example, has never once released a product and has never once finished a vaccine despite always being in the race every time a pandemic hits.  It was a huge BUY here on this sub a while back despite their borderline fraudulent behavior simply because ""STONK IS BIG SHARTED, BUY BUY BUY"".

What about this is healthy?  If the company is fraudulent, just don't buy shares.  If the company is failing, just don't buy shares.  If you already have shares and you see that the company is a fraud, sell your shares.  If shareholders sell and buyers aren't willing to buy at higher prices, the value goes down.  Simple as that.  Fraudulent companies don't need shares sold short to be exposed.

And it's still worth it to expose fraudulent companies because puts exist.  Exposing the fraud from INO?  Get puts.  Is the IV too high?  Then wait a bit for it to drop before releasing the report.  If people keep buying it, driving up the price, that's their own problem, they should have done their research before putting money into a company they barely know anything about.

In case of blackberry, a pure software company, the wallstreet suppressed it for last 5 years by shorting every ER. By suppressing the stock they prevented the company from going to market for more funding. The plan was to suppress to a point where it would be unsuccessful and sell the company to some American company like apple google Microsoft or etc.

This is investment advice, by the way.  You should do it.

&#x200B;

This is called trading the Dow/Gold Ratio.  I took the example from this article and made it a little easier to understand.  [https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/dow-gold-122020181)

The jist of it is that in 1918, a man has 10 ounces of gold.  For this example below, we want to look at real purchasing power, not inflation , so while 10 ounces of gold would have cost $200 in 1918, we are going to say it cost him $20,000.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------ ONLY HOLDING GOLD ---------------------------

&#x200B;

If he had held the 10 ounces of gold from 1918 until today, our original 10 ounces of gold would now be worth $20,000.  There is no gain from only holding gold.  In this scenario it is a shiny rock.  (we know that if he held cash, he would have LOST $19,800 purchasing power)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------- ONLY TRADING THE STOCKS ---------------------------------

&#x200B;

By comparison, an equal and simple $20,000 ""buy-and-hold"" investment indexed to the Dow from 1918 to 2018, with dividend reinvested, would have yielded an annual return of 10.44%  The gain on this trade would have been $4.26 million.  The total return was 21,200%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------TRADING THE DOW GOLD RATIO ------------------------

&#x200B;

Using $20,000 and trading the Dow/Gold ratio, we end up with $8.4 million a century later. That's a 41,000% return, or double the above investment.  (a forty one thousand percent return of real purchasing power)  I know some of you might be able to throw 100k at this - it seems like a pretty easy way to make 40 million.  Or just use 20k of your 100k to get to 8 million.  Is this BAD advice?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8m4nky8nvr371.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a694e1ab6a10b8b619e065ee58f3156f5fa15af

&#x200B;

As we saw in the first example, just holding the shiny rock didn’t provide any return, it only protected against inflation.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, if gold or silver were merely inflation hedges, they would actually follow inflation, right?  They would follow the money supply or any other stable number.  You wouldn't have these wild swings.

https://preview.redd.it/6hnk6iyvvr371.jpg?width=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6b52920640c943cbd3ac04663f8353b53f781f7

&#x200B;

Another way to look at this is ff you bought gold in 1980 for $800 an ounce, and then sold it in 2000 for $300 an ounce, you would have actually LOST money.  During this time the CPI and cost of everything didn’t go down, it went up.  So gold should have risen.  It would NOT have performed as an inflation hedge.

&#x200B;

This tells us that if we buy at the wrong time, we lose money.  However, if we buy at the RIGHT time, we have huge gains.  And when we combine that with buying stocks when they are cheap (not right now, although the Dow could hit 40,000 in a melt UP) we get massive gains.

&#x200B;

41,000% of REAL purchasing power gains.  Again, this is not inflation adjusted, if so it would have been a 4 million percent return.

&#x200B;

If you buy gold at the right time, you actually do gain purchasing power, and more importantly, you don’t lose during most stock market corrections.  Then you buy the cheap stocks and hold them while they go up.

&#x200B;

Even if you are not on board with this, think about making 10% of your portfolio gold, silver, or computer money, whatever you think is stable and won't lose.  For gold, you only have to look at what every central bank is doing. (except Canada, lol)  Use the amazing power of the internet to see what China and Russia are doing with gold right now.

&#x200B;

For silver – well – you literally have silver in your hand right now.  It’s used in electronics and solar panels.  70% of silver is used by industry, so it’s definitely not just a shiny rock.  It’s actually a critical metal that will be in short supply for the rest of our lives.  In 2100, there will actually not be any more silver in the ground to mine.

&#x200B;

I don’t know about computer money.  I am not big on real estate right now…because it’s in a bubble.  I think that if you have 100k and you buy silver, that will increase to 500k!  And then you can sell it for cheap stocks or then buy a house.  Again, look at the above charts.  Silver and gold have massive swings during these bubble pops and stock market corrections. 

&#x200B;

If you bought a house for 100k, I think that bubble will pop and you will lose 80k – you will be underwater on your mortgage because it’s only worth 20k.  When this bubble pops, how many 20k houses could you have bought with the 500k of silver?  Twenty five?

&#x200B;

This would be similar to trading the Dow/Gold ratio.  The silver/real estate ratio.  It really does look like most things are in a bubble.  This might expand before popping, or who knows, it might never pop again.

When you get massive gains from the recovery of the stock market, you sell the stocks once they reach the desired gain and you can use those gains to purchase far more gold than you started with. The gold protects your assets in times of economic hardship by being adjusted against inflation, the stocks provide you with massive gains in times of economic recovery.

2021-06-07 01:00:51,wallstreetbets,I hear the next squeeze is Charleston Chew. But lets keep that between you and me.

2021-06-07 02:42:17,wallstreetbets,Yep.
2021-06-07 11:20:31,wallstreetbets,Diversifying your portfolio so that you are ready for future events/opportunities is not the same as timing the market.  A less diverse strategy works until it doesn't.
2021-06-07 17:15:50,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know what I’m talking about but it seems like it’s less about intuition and more about making your portfolio flexible enough to move like water with the changing tides of the economy. You don’t dump your gold into stocks when you THINK the stock market is gonna crash, you dump the gold into stocks WHEN the stock market crashes."

2021-06-07 11:28:46,wallstreetbets,Changing how you diversify based on some algorithm is timing the market
2021-06-07 18:04:17,wallstreetbets,"I mean that’s a terrible idea. If you sell your stock when the market crashes to buy gold. And then go from gold to stocks when the market rebounds, you’re literally buying high and selling low. 
The whole point of this strategy is to sell you stocks when they’re high based on this index and then buy low. That just isn’t actually possible to do."

2021-06-07 18:18:03,wallstreetbets,"No, I’m sorry, when I say dump the gold into stocks at the crash that means you’re buying low. Sell the gold when the market crashes and use that money to buy stocks while they’re in the dip."

Buy gold before it crashes. But stocks during the dip. That it literally timing the market. Every study ever done shows this cannot be done reliably. You’re just as likely to be selling high and buying low, as selling high but buying higher."
2021-06-07 08:27:54,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-06-07 18:32:34,wallstreetbets,Okay so how do you suggest trading? When the stock market crashes most people would recommend buying stocks when they’re dirt cheap. I don’t know what you want??? Is your advice to NOT buy low and sell high simply because it’s impossible to accurately time it every time? The stock market is literally gambling so what is your point right now?
2021-06-07 08:54:38,wallstreetbets,Also Zachary-pro stock on Twitter is good. More on tech and growth stock options plays from a technical analysis side. These dudes will answers questions too. I’m working a MS put option Zach had a technical alert for right now.
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Some CLOV technicals from a dummy A few things to note from the CLOV chart:

&#x200B;

* Volume bars on 4/16 and 4/19 are totally insane. Has to be institutional accumulation, a great sign.

&#x200B;

* Anchored VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) pinch from high and low of 2021 — watch for some bouncing around in this area and a break to the upside (hopefully).

&#x200B;

* Price now above curling upward 50-65 SMA cloud **and** curling upward 20-23 EMA cloud.

&#x200B;

* Resting on volume shelf below — if it dips, watch for a bounce (hopefully) off the $8.50 - $8.75 area, buyers seems to be interested in that level.

&#x200B;

* Breakout levels to watch marked on chart with the thick dotted line: $9.25 and $10.56. These are levels I drew myself and are definitely **not** 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

* Above $10.56 looking at a resistance volume shelfs between $12 - $13, then a smaller shelf between $14 - $14.30. Above that looking at relatively smooth sailing to break through all time highs of $17.45.

&#x200B;

* Maybe all these levels get blown away by a squeeze? I don't know.

&#x200B;

* Remember that I'm dumb. Do your own thing.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FIGS: Waiting can help with risk management FIGS, Inc. (NYSE:FIGS)

Sector: Consumer Non-durables

Industry: Apparel/Footwear

Market cap: [\~5B](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=FIGS)

FIGS qualifies as an “emerging growth company” and will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of:

1. The last day of the fiscal year in which there is more than $1.07B in annual revenue
2. The date FIGS qualifies as a “large accelerated filer” with at least $700M of equity securities held by non-affiliates
3. The date on which FIGS has issued, in any 3-year period, more than $1B in non-convertible debt securities
4. The last day of the fiscal year ending after the 5th anniversary of the completion of IPO

&#x200B;

**PROS**

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US, employing over 20 million professionals in 2020. Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15% for all healthcare professionals vs. 4% for all occupations. Men on average represented 25% of the US healthcare workforce in 2019, while men’s business represented only 17% of net revenues of 2020. In 2020, the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated $12B in the US and $79B globally, according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned. The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.

FIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community. In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships. Through the #FIGSLOVE program, FIGS aims to be part of a professional's career by sending special gifts to them after career milestones like graduating from school or opening a new practice. Among US healthcare professionals and medical students, FIGS has aided and unaided brand awareness of 55% and 22%, respectively. From 2017 to 2020, FIGS grew net revenue from $17.6M to $263.1M with a 146% CAGR. Of the customers acquired from 2017 to 2019, approximately 50% returned for a second purchase.

&#x200B;

[  Quarterly net revenues generally increased quarter-over-quarter during 2020 primarily due to new customer acquisition coupled with strong retention of existing customers. There were higher levels of net revenues in the fourth quarter driven by seasonal holiday demand. Gross profit generally increased quarter-over-quarter during 2020 primarily due to the increase in total number of orders.](https://preview.redd.it/k3dmr6rorr371.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09cd37832bd5e822abbff6d5ba04c6440e4abe1)

&#x200B;

[  FIGS have demonstrated continued strong quarterly performance in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Beginning the second quarter of 2020, there was an increase in the Adjusted EBITDA margin, primarily due to decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.](https://preview.redd.it/dwin9jmvrr371.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=54ba3072152142259a79185abd9fa065f7f5c757)

&#x200B;

**CONS**

FIGS relies heavily on word-of-mouth advertising which can be a blessing and [a curse](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/us/figs-scrubs-video-women-do-trnd/index.html). FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth, and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time. Shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations. There is reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain. FIGS also operates within a highly competitive market with 202 employees and [will be focused on the healthcare community](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/figs-will-focus-on-medical-scrubs-now-but-could-set-its-sights-on-other-industry-uniforms-in-the-future-11622215256) for the medium term. [Some competitors](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/figs-inc/357446828) of FIGS include:

* *Uniform Advantage*: $105M in revenue, 390 employees
* *Jaanuu*: $36M in revenue, 172 employees
* *Nixon Medical*: $82M in revenue, 400 employees
* *Barco Uniforms*: $25M in revenue, 225 employees
* *Careismatic Brands*: $221M in revenue, 730 employees

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

Given the recent IPO, I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks. I will wait for a better reentry price. With that said, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand. FIGS has room to grow over the next 3-5 years and I like it as a longer term investment.

2021-06-07 00:54:24,wallstreetbets,Ayeeee so figs used to be a client of ours. I work ecommerce/fintech. Was super cool to see them ipo.
2021-06-07 00:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the post!

I find FIGS to be an intriguing company and I also like it as a long term investment, and potential compounder. Saying that, I also have not started a position as I find the current valuation too rich and waiting for a better entry."
2021-06-07 01:15:17,wallstreetbets,"as someone who wears figs as a healthcare nurse, NOT a long term investment. There's plenty of other brands you can buy for same quality and cheaper prices. Also a lot hospitals provide healthcare workers with uniforms and they are never overpriced apparel like figs (usually dickies, AVE etc). And once you buy a set, you're not going to replace them for a year or two. just my 2 cents 🤷🏽‍♂️ good luck."
2021-06-07 00:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. 

I could imagine your bull case for this. More healthcare jobs are inevitable; all healthcare workers need uniforms; athleasure apparel sales are going up; healthcare apparel hasn’t fully caught up with new comfort fabrics and fits. 

Do you know specifically which suppliers they partner with? I’ll try and find out myself if not."
2021-06-07 01:24:01,wallstreetbets,"I deliver figs almost every fucking  day, almost same people  too. The same with lulu lemonade."
2021-06-07 10:29:07,wallstreetbets,"I work for a large health system and have to visit a bunch of our hospitals.  In any department where they’re allowed to wear them, every nurse I see has FIGS, or wants FIGS or is complimenting their coworkers in their FIGS.

I invested in Apple when I realized that everyone I needed to communicate with in my life wanted an iPhone and that wasn’t a bad play.  I don’t know about FIGS’ fundamentals, but if the ability to attract and hold a customer base as a premium brand is a strength then they are setup well for at least the next five years or so.  Something may come along and replace them because fashion is fickle, but this is the LVMH of healthcare attire and Bernard Arnault isn’t poor."
2021-06-07 10:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Nurses usually wear hospital issued scrubs, I’m wearing figs right now as a dentist, they’re popular for staff (assistants/hygienists) but they usually don’t get replaced too often as a lot of staff wears gowns when they do messy work or they wear a lab coat over it"
2021-06-07 04:12:57,wallstreetbets,"Figs are basically nike tech fleece for surgeons in their 20s. Unless they diversify the style or start supplying whole institutions with clothing and laundry services, I think there’s a limit to where they’ll go. Speaking here as a long in the tooth healthcare professional who likes their free scrubs."
2021-06-07 03:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Figs are super popular with nurses. They're the name brand scrubs that every nurse wants to look good wearing. Nurses made A METRIC FUCKING TON OF MONEY during Covid. What's the first thing they'll buy with their hard earned covid cash, probably a car. Then figs"
2021-06-07 07:28:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  I initially had a small position and made a small profit, last week, but I'd like to reenter around $20-22"
2021-06-07 01:43:36,wallstreetbets,FIGs are great. I wear them every work day
2021-06-07 06:10:57,wallstreetbets,What are the other brands?
2021-06-07 08:01:00,wallstreetbets,The best I could find was they created a [vertical supply chain](https://www.fastcompany.com/40589057/female-founders-give-scrubs-a-functional-fashionable-makeover). I have been unsuccessful at finding specific suppliers.
2021-06-07 05:10:44,wallstreetbets,"Um, surgeons don’t wear figs because they wear OR scrubs. Maybe more non-surgical fields like EM"
2021-06-07 09:25:18,wallstreetbets,Jannuu is 100x better cut and more comfy than Figs especially for men.
2021-06-07 11:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I’ll check this out. 

I looked up FIGS on the popular garment wholesale distributors sites and didn’t find them. In a way, that’s bullish because once they get distribution their sales will 🚀 - but it’s also bearish because it suggests they don’t have production capacity to handle wholesale distribution yet. 

If they can get garment decorators (the people who embroider the doctor’s name on it) to sell/promote their products, then they can sell a whole lot more without paying anyone to do it. Looks like they handle all their customization in house now though. 

Thanks for turning me onto this company. I will keep looking and post what I find later this week."
2021-06-07 09:26:10,wallstreetbets,Figs can become the OR scrub supplier no?
2021-06-07 10:17:18,wallstreetbets,"I think FIGS can currently sell fashion for a premium because healthcare professionals buy out of pocket to look good. Hospitals will not pay a premium for scrubs, they will get the cheapest scrubs available for the OR to cut costs since they are laundered frequently and would wear out quickly"
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Any thoughts on WOOF? WOOF stock currently has 33% of short interest as a percentage of free float. However, considering the company’s growth outlook, the stock looks primed for a squeeze.

For Q1 2021, the company reported revenue growth of 27% to $1.4 billion. For the same period, the company acquired 1.2 million new net customers. This was the third consecutive quarter where more than one million customers were acquired.

It’s also worth noting that the market for pet care was worth $109 billion for FY2020. Over the next five years, the market size is expected to increase to $157 billion. Therefore, there is a big addressable market and this is likely to ensure that healthy growth sustains.

From a financial perspective, the company [reported a positive free cash flow of $68 million](https://ir.petco.com/static-files/8bdadd25-38b8-4469-81f4-7b75f73aa355) for Q1 2021. For the comparable period last year, FCF was negative.

With positive FCF, the company is well-positioned to deleverage. Another important point to note is that the company’s [comparable sales increased by 28% in Q1 2021](https://ir.petco.com/static-files/00b6a6e5-47ad-48e3-a13c-699dfce70beb). If comparable sales growth remains strong, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will continue to improve."

>Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular meme stocks.

>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., MicroVision Inc. and GameStop Corp.

However for hedge funds, who had to keep shorting to sustain the momentum, and reset their ftd's, this is catastrophic, end of the line.

????? Um... What the fuck ?????

Shorting a stock necessarily requires that the seller doesn't own the underlying security. The very nature of shorting is to BORROW stock from someone else, sell it on the market and hope to buy it back at a lower price. How is Bloomberg employing people to report on stocks who don't know how stocks work?

And to be clear: Naked shorting *of calls* means you don't own the shares you wrote contracts for. It's extremely risky because you're on the hook for those shares at any given price if the calls end up ITM. But shorting a stock and naked shorting of calls are not the same thing."

On Friday, tons of brokers restricted call writing for same-day expiration, it's possible that actually had a dampening effect.

And that’s ok , They get their asses handed to them via short squeezes ."
2021-06-07 01:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Going back to the days of Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, nearly every claim that someone was nakedly shorting has proven to be bullshit.

Yes, it is illegal to nakedly short a stock.

However . . . almost no one ever nakedly shorts a stock.

For the arrangement to be illegally naked, there must be no proof that the shares exist to back the position.

OTOH, lending shares that have already been used to short a position is 100% legal. This creates synthetic shares that can allow short positions to go well north of 100% of the issued shares without breaking the law.

Bear in mind, if your goal is to squeeze the shorts, this is all good for you. Eventually, their broker will want to close the position or obtain money or collateral to defray their risk. The short then has to either pony up or find the shares to close the position.

This creates a potential cascade of shorts who have to keep closing their positions. As each broker tells each synthetic short to pay up or close out, it leads to a rout as more of them have to do the same.

Unfortunately, if it all goes tits up and the short can't close the position due to lack of shares or money, it's the broker who gets fucked. The broker is responsible for closing the position and finding the share, even if it means they take a bath on the sale.

However, that doesn't mean the short position is naked. It merely means the investor who was short fucked their broker, and the broker now has to unfuck the situation to stay on the right side of the law.

The broker then has to go after their customer for what they're owed. In some scenarios, those customers may even have to downsize from a 300-foot yacht to a 250-foot yacht to make things right. Of course, if the investor is truly and rightly fucked and broke, there is always bankruptcy and litigation. Then the broker can fight other creditors to repo the yacht."
2021-06-07 03:59:03,wallstreetbets,Naked options are legal though. The restricting of naked options (selling calls and puts) is like raising margin requirements on volatile stocks.
2021-06-07 03:11:15,wallstreetbets,I believe so yes. I think the distinction here is that they are no longer providing naked OPTIONS (which I believe are legal).

Maybe you could argue what is completely new in a way is that we have so much access to short data.  We can SEE when they overplay their hand.

2021-06-07 12:31:08,wallstreetbets,There's many ways to show this.  Increases in SI have corresponded to larger recovery rallies.  The correlation between FTD cycles and price gains are basically clockwork at this point for AMC / GME.

Food in the past century in America is a great example, the time you’re thinking of “trustworthy institutions” (some 50ish years ago?) is probably about right about the time corporations lobbied for lax regulations on food and drugs and basically spread rampant misinformation that was recognized by the FDA generated America’s obesity crisis. Why do you think the food pyramid has changed so many times? 

Plus, progress in energy and agriculture and most likely plenty of other things is also being completely halted due to rampant lobbying leading to ridiculous subsidies on archaic industries that allow should-be-dying industries to flourish. Capitalism is literally halting innovation, which is supposed to be its strong point.

2021-06-07 18:09:44,wallstreetbets,"No.

Most likely, Fidelity already loaned your shares to one of the shorts.

The short owes Fidelity the share, and then Fidelity owes you the share.

I don't think there's anything random about what you're asking. It's a down-the-middle question about making sure everything reconciles when the dust settles.

BTW, this is one of the ways the broker takes a bath if the short fucks them. The broker *legally has to* find the share to get it back to you.

Bear in mind that brokers don't fuck around. We're talking about the nerve centers of trading. The SEC does not allow dickery in this zone.

Remember, they're not just loaning your ape money retail shares. Retail doesn't own enough shares in most cases to satisfy the market. They're loaning big money's shares, too. Big money will use the government to push the broker's shit in if the broker doesn't make them whole.

Also, bear in mind that there's usually so much liquidity in the market that this is a non-issue. In any given minute, there are thousands of automated trading systems vomiting liquidity into the market trying to leverage fractions of a cent in price changes.

It's almost never that hard for the broker to get you the share back."

I think the banks and others today just don't give a shit. Any penalties that are assessed are just another cost of doing business and mostly an insignificant one at that. There no longer is any social stigma attached that actually causes the bad players any pain. 

Beyond that, I actually was referring to the watchdog agencies who are supposed to be enforcing the rules and not the industry companies. There was, when I was growing up, my perception which I don't think I was alone in, (right or wrong) that the regulators actually did their jobs - maybe through the 1940's - 60's (a whopping two decades but that is what I experienced). It seems to me there was much more respect and much lees tolerance for anti-social and predatory practices. I'm not saying it did not happen. I'm saying it was not acceptable and there was shame involved. Seems like no longer the case. I also think that there is much more selfishness across all facets of society today which accounts for much of what we are seeing."

You have to trust me on this one statement: I am probably the most cynical person I know. Keeping that in mind, up until maybe the 80's I didn't really think about the value of my investments being manipulated behind the scenes or companies/funds selling or being allowed to sell securities that don't exist for example. I don't know if it is the proliferation of computers that made it easier or if that is what brought nefarious practices out where they could be seen, if one knows where to look.

I don't trust any of them anymore. I don't trust the agencies, I don't trust the banks, I don't trust the brokerages. Sometimes, I'm not sure I trust my wife he said tongue in cheek. The trust I had in my younger years might have been naive but if not for that, I probably would have stopped investing altogether.

You had human experimentation that we are just learning more about, and doctors didnt even anaesthetize babies. While the government was testing diseases on the black and native population, but hey you didnt have to lock your doors so it was a great time! Selfish damn boomers can only think of their own experience."

Except for the evidence that citadel securities the market maker front ran client trades for years and paid pennies in punishment;

Over a two-year period until September 2014, the market-maker removed hundreds of thousands of large OTC orders from its automated trading processes, according to Finra. That rendered the orders “inactive” and so they had to be handled manually by human traders.

Citadel Securities then “traded for its own account on the same side of the market at prices that would have satisfied the orders,” without immediately filling the inactive orders at the same or better prices as required by Finra rules, the regulator said.

In February 2014, a sample month reviewed by Finra, the market-maker traded ahead in nearly three-quarters of the inactive orders. “Based on this review, in 559 instances, Citadel Securities traded ahead of 415 inactive OTC customer orders,” the regulator said.

2021-06-07 00:57:59,wallstreetbets,"I disagree heartily on the idea that it’s undervalued. I would argue quite the opposite. It’s a store that sells video games that has said they plan to transition to online sales. Maybe they were undervalued at $4, but right now they’re WILDLY overvalued if you ask me. 

People have been saying for months already that there was going to be a squeeze soon. People keep setting dates and it keeps not happening. And, no offense, but the people who write about how the shares are gonna be worth a million each and shit like that? Every one of those “DD” posts I’ve read is clearly written by someone who has no clue what they’re talking about. You won’t find any veteran traders who have actually made a lot of money trading and who have a deep understanding of the market setting those ridiculous price targets for GME. 

The reason I don’t buy a share “just in case” is because, like I said, I consider the company to be wildly overvalued. I fully expect it to drop back to $30-40 at some point and stay there."

I disagree with you though that for most of those people gamestop is “more than a store”. If it went out of business tomorrow and was replaced by a different company that served the same purpose, I doubt that many of the big gamers I know would care much, as long as they could still get their games and new systems. I don’t think a passion for gaming translates to a high stock price for gamestop in quite the way you seem to think it does."
2021-06-07 10:38:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree except - I used to buy literally everything gaming from GameStop and now I buy 99% direct from PS or XBOX or STEAM. Unless I want a collectible, there isn’t a reason to take the extra step to buy through them.

I don’t argue the points about to the moon and what not, but if we’re talking about actual fundamental value?

they had the opportunity to be the one online retailer that fixed the bot/reseller problem for next gen consoles, and lock in future clients, by creating an ordered reservation list and only allowing 1 per reservation. Could have used those GameStop console sales as an access pass for premium content. Keep Powerup rewards program, but instead of putting it towards Game Informer and Used Games and Kongregate and whatever other garbage, put it towards things like season passes for certain AAA game releases: a value proposition that increases exponentially as more games are billed as “live service” or have a full year of post release content planned. Could have done literally anything as a differentiator when people were desperate. Didn’t. It’s sticking out from the crowd now due to WSB, not due to business decisions.

I guess time will tell."
2021-06-07 11:38:05,wallstreetbets,"Lol, that’d be dumb. As many people have said, the ticker no longer seems to trade on fundamentals at all. I believe it to be overvalued, and I expect it will drop - that doesn’t mean I want to bet on it. Stock never does what you think it’s gonna. Doesn’t change my opinion on what I think it should do, though. 

I don’t know why all you GME folk always seem to think that anyone bearish on the stock should have to short it. You do realize that often people will have thoughts about tickers they don’t actually hold positions on, right? It’s not all that rare."

2021-06-07 17:10:18,wallstreetbets,"If you fully expect it to drop back to 30-40$ wouldn't the fundamentals be telling you to short it because you can gain money?

You do realize that people who say you do realize are grand standing self important fucking pussies. Put your money where your mouth is or put it back to work behind Wendys.  


Also your flair is cringe and I bet you didn't shower all weekend."
2021-06-07 09:28:59,wallstreetbets,"To be real though, how much money do people need to make on these meme stocks before you accept that as absolutely ridiculous as it is, it’s just the state of the world and relying on fundamentals means missing out on the profit? Take the money and laugh."
2021-06-07 17:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. Damn bro. What has you so angry?

Like I said, I have my beliefs about what the stock is gonna do. That’s why I don’t buy it. Doesn’t mean I trust it to do that or any other one thing. It doesn’t seem to trade on fundamentals. 

As far as my flair, I didn’t set it. The mods do that. I do kind of like it, though. That was a great movie. I also shower twice daily. 

Look, I’m sorry you’re so angry that I don’t think GME is gonna make you a millionaire or whatever your expectations are. Just because I’m bearish on a stock isn’t a personal attack on you. You’re welcome to have your opinions on the stock too. Or if it’ll make you feel better you’re welcome to keep throwing out sad little personal attacks like a hurt child. I’m sure if you just throw enough angry tantrums the stock will do what you want eventually! Lmao"

High oil price markets are good for American jobs because we are on a better footing to compete globally.  When the prices drop too low we are unable to match them and people get laid off so we can buy cheaper oil from the middle east.  Most people don't realize we export more petroleum than we produce. 

High oil prices are of course not compatible with populism because individuals don't like the price of consumables to go up.  However we can't have our cake and eat it too.  There's a physical reality in which oil must be brought out of the ground and refined before being sold on a market to you or I, and no amount of game playing or grandstanding will make that process as cheap as we would like ad infinitum."

2021-06-07 00:06:02,wallstreetbets,"My advice on WKHS, dont be greedy or you'll be doing some serious bag holding. Take reasonable gains and walk. I bought last year at $27 before the Postal Service contract announcement. Contract decision got postponed, and the stocked dropped $4 a share and sat there for months. Contract decision came back up, it ran up to the low 40s. I cashed out at $38, contract went to Oshkosh, Workhorse fell into the teens. 

Outside of a squeeze, this stock will hit the bottom and stay there. The Postal Service contract is one of the only substantial things the company had going for it. If you FOMO on this, you will lose your ass. This will not recover like AMC. 

I hope you all make money, but get in and get out. This will not be a pleasant long term hold."

2021-06-07 00:27:25,wallstreetbets,any previous positions of note?
2021-06-07 14:03:47,wallstreetbets,"You cant read. I made money, but dodged a really big bullet at the last minute. 
They make a small electric work truck on a very small scale, in a sector that is down and has been down for a while. They wont be considered for that Postal Service contract or even part of it if and when it gets reconsidered. They couldnt provide enough parts to service a fleet of Postal Service trucks if they sold them. 
If this sees a squeeze, the first of the bag holders selling out will drop the price into the single digits and it will stay there for a while. Its you're money, waste it if you want."

2021-06-07 14:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Oh you're totally right that they are producing electric trucks on a very small scale, but can you please name a single company currently producing electric trucks on a large scale? Workhorse has a 10% stake in Lordstown and even Steve Burns himself said they would be willing to help with capacity were they to secure a contract that warranted the help. Are you also going to disregard the partnership with Hitachi, a global company very experienced in mass production and operations management?"

2021-06-07 07:50:56,wallstreetbets,28% of WKHS gamma is due in June 18th. Idk what this means but I read it in a couple of sources and it seems to be a good thing.

2021-06-07 15:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Bottom line, I've followed this stock since September of last year, and it has done nothing but depreciate outside the two spikes in price when the Postal Service contract decision date came around. I bought in on the same info you just posted and had high hopes for it. It has tanked constantly. The numbers dont lie. Is it a bad company? No. It's just not worth what some people are going to pay thinking they are going to strike it rich on a squeeze. It's a $9-$12 a share stock. Period. If you pay more than that based on WSB hype, you are going to either lose money or be a long time bag holder, possibly both."
2021-06-07 16:15:18,wallstreetbets,How the frick did we get to 50% to 72% that quickly?

2021-06-07 17:01:07,wallstreetbets,It's the highest shorted stock on the entire stock market. It doesn't take a genius to understand that wall street has been slamming this company for little to no reason. Please do explain to me how Nikola has a market cap of 7 billion while workhorse is still only sitting at a 1.7 billion market cap.

2021-06-07 02:22:14,wallstreetbets,I’m amazed that her Spanish matched the subtitles like verbatim. I thought this was like a meme at first but once I listened I was genuinely shocked that that’s actually what she was saying. I’m assuming I mean I don’t speak Spanish but it seemed accurate from what I’d imagine that to sound like if spoken by this woman. Anyways fcuking amazing job on the vid. I laughed until I stopped.

Now I guess her main asset isn't her brain but then again she says what's on the teleprompter flawlessly I just didn't hear any of it. Still watched the entire thing tho.

2021-06-06 21:19:50,wallstreetbets,"There was a news article prior to the IPO that said there were people placing limit orders beforehand up to $20,000. Those people really dodged a bullet by ending up with shares at $350-$400+."
2021-06-07 01:22:31,wallstreetbets,Bought it at $375
2021-06-07 00:03:48,wallstreetbets,Haha. Me too.
2021-06-07 05:24:02,wallstreetbets,"Rule number 1 of IPO.  Unless you're paying to get in front of the IPO line, wait 3 days for the prices to drop.  Always wait for the T+2 play/sell from the big boys to see what's going to happen to the IPO.  99% of the time, people sell as soon as their T+2 settlement is processed on an IPO."

2021-06-07 08:01:37,wallstreetbets,I like coinbase but there is no sane world where their valuation made an iota of sense.  even now at ~200 COIN is wildly overvalued.  I wouldnt touch that stock with a citadel sized pole until it hits 160.

2021-06-07 04:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I guess there's a middle-ground where you get a weather report like this."
2021-06-07 01:43:49,wallstreetbets,I don’t know about the Middle East but in Scandinavia we mostly have middle-aged men in sweaters. I don’t watch the weather lol
2021-06-07 02:09:21,wallstreetbets,Wtf you retard? You just watched a South/Latin American weather girl teasing and wonder where the sexist countries are ?
2021-06-07 07:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, I watch her and I barely speak a word of Spanish. I’d try to focus and listen for words I do know (queso, porquito, mota, por favor) but dat ass."

Bill Hicks was right about everything."
2021-06-07 03:29:25,wallstreetbets,One way to find out.

2021-06-07 07:38:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah. It can be hard to tell “pro-sexuality”  from “sexist” at a distance.
2021-06-07 07:58:57,wallstreetbets,In MN they have overweight gay men giving us the weather
2021-06-07 06:44:18,wallstreetbets,Get out into the real world. I'm not talking about Reddit. You need to chill out too and stop looking for a fight online when there isn't one.
2021-06-07 10:34:40,wallstreetbets,Those that smelt it delt it?
2021-06-07 06:20:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that's just government backed sexism. Societal sexism is one thing, but anyways I would say only in progressive societies that are more liberal on what women do with their bodies do they happily condone this sort of stuff. Sure you might think it's sexist because she's being objectified in a way men aren't, but A) she knows and chooses to do this and B) it's not really sexism but more human nature that makes humans and especially men want to see attractive people on TV."
2021-06-07 05:22:36,wallstreetbets,Not true in every location. Some food courts aren't  inside the main warehouse
2021-06-07 07:09:35,wallstreetbets,They also buy their stuff with cash (like Trader Joe). Most stores just renting shelves to middlemen. They both have outstanding return policy because they only sell good quality.
2021-06-07 07:26:22,wallstreetbets,My Costco allows non members to buy food from the food court. Which is risky imo because it’s on the campus of a Big10 school filled with broke college kids who could seriously test their will to lose money on hot dogs and pizza.
2021-06-07 08:34:33,wallstreetbets,Are they cheaper than Aldi though?
2021-06-07 08:54:46,wallstreetbets,People wonder how grocery stores make money on those cheap whole baked chickens. They don't. Loss leaders are the way.
2021-06-07 11:35:25,wallstreetbets,The thing is it was the wife’s boyfriend that wanted the hot dawg. I wanted tendies. He said no

2021-06-07 07:06:35,wallstreetbets,Calls on prostitution?
2021-06-07 12:02:28,wallstreetbets,"I have nothing against this. My complaint is that in my country (and all of Scandinavia, actually) you could never get away with this level of objectification on national television. So yeah, I agree we have taken things too far here."
2021-06-07 07:37:39,wallstreetbets,My local Costco scans the membership card before food can be purchased. Food court is outside. May just vary depending on the store.
2021-06-07 09:15:56,wallstreetbets,Its at the back of the store for a reason.
2021-06-07 10:56:58,wallstreetbets,Profit margins are really narrow in retail.

2021-06-07 13:43:10,wallstreetbets,Source on this ? I thought he just needed to focus on his career without distractions..
2021-06-07 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,Perhaps she saw he was well endowed with exceptional hidden talents.
2021-06-07 07:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the market is bullish with divorce rates rising and cheating on the rise. Long calls on prostitution are a great play, I kid you not. This is no pump and dump my friend."
2021-06-07 07:53:49,wallstreetbets,I thought it was company policy to not require membership for the food court. I've been in about 10 Costco's and never been asked at the food court. Maybe it's an East Coast thing.
2021-06-07 09:20:40,wallstreetbets,"My grocery store has em at the front. But only because that's where the deli is, otherwise they'd have em in the rear I'm sure."
2021-06-07 10:08:20,wallstreetbets,Kind of sad though isn’t it? To never remember your loved ones of your previous life again? Is there a way to stay connected forever?

2021-06-07 08:50:58,wallstreetbets,I live in Socal and can confirm I was asked for a membership card at food courts outside the main building at two different locations. I think its a recent change and its not just East Coast.
2021-06-07 11:21:30,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the state. Many states it’s illegal to require private club memberships for certain things. I know in Cali if you said you were just buying booze they had to let you in, and I’ve never seen a costco that scanned memberships at the cafe, my local one now certainly doesn’t."

Before the dream I had an episode of sleep paralysis unlike ever before. This time I seemed to have got up and looked in the mirror. As I was looking at myself I was vibrating so hard as to maybe my soul’s frequency was changing. In the dream I was shown all my previous lives and we were all on a huge plateau. Making synchronized moves akin to taekwondo. Also, there was a part where one of my selves showed me this stream of consciousness that flowed into an endless Taurus shape. When I woke up I was in awe and shaken up. I got up and went into the living room and it was around 4:30 am. As I sat down the radio turned on by itself and blasted this beautiful song and at the very end the radio turned off by itself. It was a very surreal experience and will forever be in my memories. Also, I got over my existential-crisis."

Just a recap of last week, the overall gain was 6.42% bringing the overall to 19.49%

This week the marbles are kicking off 6/7 with $CRSR, $USO, and $CLNE. 

As promised I would add some instructions along with how the marbles are calculated/played. When playing the marbles an equal amount of money is divided into the stocks that are picked, stocks are bought at open and sold at/before close the same day. 

Or don't, I'm not your dad, do what ever you want.

2021-06-06 21:22:26,wallstreetbets,Just sell 64 weekly CCs when the price and IV spike. Then buy to close for a discount on a pull back. Say by Tuesday it is at $18 just sell 64 of the 6/18 35c. Worst case you you exercised for more then double your price and get the premium. Best case you make 5k+ over a few days and rinse and repeat
2021-06-06 23:50:41,wallstreetbets,$15.54 is cheap. You got in early wait until we  smack that all time high.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD **UPDATE 6/08/2021: The squeeze has not happened yet, CLOV is set up nicely for both massive short squeeze and gamma squeeze. Not a single share has been covered, in fact there were more borrows this week (yes Hedges are shameless). I also want to emphasize on the lock up period for CLOV. The insiders cannot sell a single class B shares until the price is $30 for at least 90 consecutive days and have 700 million in cash so no need to fear any insider dumping/dilution like other companies. I have not sold any shares. I expect a much much bigger return for my investment**

I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I’m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what’s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company’s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I’m keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they’ll pay a fine and that’ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it’s related to Medicare. 
* Biden’s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They’re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it’s unclear when it will be settled. Although it’s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd’s constant attacks despite insisting they don’t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren’t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg’s report was created to hurt all of Chamath’s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I’ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you’ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let’s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it’s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it’s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it’s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won’t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren’t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won’t be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let’s talk about CLOV’s P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV’s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV’s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I’m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers’ manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren’t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they’ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they’ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don’t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there’s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

2021-06-06 23:06:52,wallstreetbets,Glad to see some in-depth DD on this finally. I personally think the stock is highly undervalued. The inside investors cannot sell shares until it maintains $30 for 90 days. CLOV is at LEAST a $30 stock. I'm planning to add as many shares as I can these next couple weeks prior to the listing on the index.
2021-06-06 20:35:28,wallstreetbets,Was looking into buying first option and was considering CLOV. 9c for 8/20. Good position or should I opt for a longer one if I can? Buying Monday open

2021-06-06 23:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Good post, one thing I'll add is that they're almost certainly also being added to the Russell 2000 since they're slotted for Russell 2000 addition, it's just not finalized yet due to still needing to confirm the details for addition but they're on the draft/preliminary list which you [can view here](http://www.ftse.com/products/index-notices/home/GetAttachment?id=ec17aaa4-2922-4471-b5a5-2a37e608471f&title=Indicative_List_of_Affected_Securities_June_2021_Further_Update.xlsx) (requires signing up on the ftserussell website for a free account first).

That's actually even better, since numerous ETFs and mutual funds invest based off the 2000, like IWM so that's a TON of money coming CLOV's way before the end of June.

The clock has begun ticking for short sellers so this is going to be an interesting few weeks, I don't know if they're going to continue to double down to try and scare people away to cover on the cheap, but it's just a matter of time before the flood of money from the Russell additions start.

Bears R Fukt on this one."

Totally not promoted to have another ""squeeze"" like they did with silver. No nothing suspicious going on here."
2021-06-07 06:58:39,wallstreetbets,"don't, shit stock"
2021-06-07 00:32:35,wallstreetbets,Workhorse short squeeze
2021-06-07 07:17:52,wallstreetbets,looks like it was shorted from Dec '20 to Mar '21. I think it has squeeze potential but not a big daddy squeeze. Other stocks are more ripe.
2021-06-07 12:49:00,wallstreetbets,GME is the one. Don't fall for the rest
2021-06-07 12:08:15,wallstreetbets,Love how the title is “big daddy of ALL squeezes” but the first sentence says “ this is not comparing to GME AMC”

2021-06-06 22:24:58,wallstreetbets,"well fuck, now I am on board as well. DD was killer, but Clinton nepotism? Mess with that and you get disappeared. I'd love to be able to prepare DD for myself; good book to start with?  Thanks OP."
2021-06-07 01:40:29,wallstreetbets,That's a really good point!
2021-06-07 09:28:47,wallstreetbets,Clinton should have been President

We have to keep buying More shares !! And hold that’s the way we win"
2021-06-06 22:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure buying options doesn't help with the squeeze,  but I'm going to buy some Aug on a yolo plunge. I have a chunk of shares as well.  So I concur."
2021-06-07 09:24:40,wallstreetbets,I own shares as well. I brought in @9.88 on Apr 19th and I still think it's a good play. I never felt like I needed to sell off or anything like that. I'm already so invested that it's hard to pick up more because it goes against my personal principals of being somewhat portfolio diverse. BUT if it dips in the 8$ range again soon I'll probably double my holdings because I have always felt that CLOV is worth more than it's being traded at. I think it's worth 15/share at least and I hope it gets that recognition within the next few months.
2021-06-07 16:49:19,wallstreetbets,Sounds low.

2021-06-06 22:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Longer is always better if you have the $$$ on hand. I bought some 8/20 14c last week and then sold them on Thursday with 70%+ profit.

2021-06-06 20:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Buy what you want, but I’d advise not to do it at open. This stock sells off for the first hour or so of seemingly every day . You’ll likely get a better price if you wait a bit."
2021-06-06 22:28:53,wallstreetbets,"Totally. It’s “and” not “or”. $CLOV and $AMC and $BB, good luck to all !"
2021-06-06 23:10:59,wallstreetbets,I agree 100%. Too many people are focused on one single stock while they miss potential opportunities.
2021-06-07 00:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Why are you not in on gme as well? Honest question. You don’t have to be all in, but am curious why you would not see potential there? CLOV has my interest"
2021-06-06 23:57:10,wallstreetbets,Seriously. All this stock needs to do is get enough volume to get it to $12-13 a share and you got yourself a squeeze.
2021-06-07 16:43:10,wallstreetbets,I just used some amc profits for CLOV. Win win.

2021-06-07 00:12:42,wallstreetbets,That's because it's heavily shorted. We need to keep up pressure and drive the price up to force shorts to cover. Squeezes don't happen quickly
2021-06-07 02:57:09,wallstreetbets,It’s 400+ and they’re currently hiring.
2021-06-07 13:08:37,wallstreetbets,Anything mid-long term are the options I play. I do not get short term even though in these times those can be more rewarding.

2021-06-07 02:42:00,wallstreetbets,You’re right.
2021-06-07 11:58:56,wallstreetbets,What dis mean exactly?
2021-06-07 11:19:33,wallstreetbets,Pretty standard for a growth company. Their burn rate is what matters and they've got plenty in the tank to reach their milestones and achieve $30 per share by 2023.
2021-06-07 03:44:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to pick up some purely down to market watch showing 37% of the float shorted. With all the squeeze hype happening at the moment, that’s potentially all it needs for retail to push the short squeeze."
2021-06-07 02:56:11,wallstreetbets,"That’s almost every fast growing early company. They aren’t yet profitable because it's investing heavily into itself, accelerating their growth."
2021-06-07 16:24:42,wallstreetbets,Oopse yes remove the zeroes. But yes 1% would still give it 10x value so yeah. Thanks bro I appreciate the help.

2021-06-07 04:07:42,wallstreetbets,Been keeping an eye on it and it’s being down voted a lot more it seems. Without downvotes from certain bag holders that believe this is a conspiracy to “distract from GME/AMC” this would be well above 1k atleast.

2021-06-07 10:08:49,wallstreetbets,They have to be very close to itm but the thing is you have to defend against the shorts and buying shares is the absolute best way for that. If the shorts push the price down MMs can unload the shares they bought to hedge.

They all do this, and there are several articles about urgent care up charging as oppose to regular hospitals.

2021-06-07 13:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, especially if it was trading at $105 pre-pandemic since as economies reopen as vaccinations progress oil & gas will be in higher demand and the production has only recently been agreed to be increased per OPEC+."
2021-06-07 13:42:54,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly it. The demands for oil production for the summer will be established at the next OPEC+ conference. What’s funny is I was watching some videos from a few months ago from CNBC and whatnot to see price targets and they were calling for $70/barrel EoY. We crushed that last week LOL. It’s a rocketship that’s going to keep climbing faster and faster. The part they’re not considering is other countries rely on high oil prices for their economy. Plus, Putin usually gets what he wants. Novak is already threatening to terminate US oil contracts if they don’t remove sanctions and that’ll further skyrocket the price as our supply grows scarce. It’s heating up for sure."
2021-06-07 13:47:53,wallstreetbets,"The only thing that makes me cautious is the shale gas production in the US since we have seen domestic production ramp up every time the price per barrel gets to high levels that then drive the prices back down.  Other than USO's average stock prices being essentially double their current price how do we know any kind of production increase in the US won't result in hampering the rise in stock price?  Granted, it appears that the USO stock still never dipped below $72 in the last 5 years which would have included increased production in the US."
2021-06-07 14:29:34,wallstreetbets,That’s kind of my reasoning too. Plus oil can be considered a hedge against inflation. I’m feeling like we’re rolling into a hybrid inflation/recession period similar to ‘08 and ‘11. Look at what USO and oil did during the ‘08 recession 👀
2021-06-07 14:39:18,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow I just looked and that was an insane spike hitting just under $1,000 per share, though it looks like it had normalized for a bit.  What caused the stock price drop in both late 2014 and again in 2016?"
2021-06-07 15:07:41,wallstreetbets,"For 2014 and 2016, maybe the Keystone Pipeline? I was doing an analysis of barrel price trends overlaid with different presidents, and what was crazy is the pricing was nearly inverse for Republican vs Democrat presidents. Right now, Biden’s trend is online with Obama’s and Obama’s takes a super high spike in the next month. So, if Biden’s follows, we have the child tax credit to help shift away the pain of super high gas prices. I’ve had a gut feeling we’ll see a $5+ national average soon, but only time will tell."
2021-06-07 15:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Seems mostly speculative and hopeful more than anything, otherwise I would agree that this stock *should* grow.  The US will definitely prevent $5/gallon at all costs unless supply chain issues result in a further price shock.  Our country is pretty incompatible with expensive fuel prices and without meaningful transit (infrastructure bill required) in most places $5 a gallon are unlikely to happen because it literally cannot work and all parties will do what they can to prevent such a price.  This is also speculation on my part though lol."
2021-06-07 16:11:13,wallstreetbets,"I would say that I agree if I haven’t seen it before. I remember back when this was all going down that a few of the gas stations in my area in SC went over $5/gallon. We have no reason for it not to do the same again + 10 years of inflation factored into the price. That’s why my theory on this happening around the child tax credit period keeps coming up lol. Uncle Sam may seem generous, but he always gets what’s his. Obviously only time will tell, but man, it’s happened before. I think the play on oil will print, but the speculation on extremes panning out will be the icing on the cake if you’re invested in oil."
2021-06-07 16:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Are you sure you're remembering things accurately?  I'm in PA, with the second highest gas tax in the nation (as well as some of the highest prices in continental US) and we never hit $5 a gallon, though we got between $4-5 at some point around 2007 or 2008.

I was honestly just curious if you had actual knowledge as to what caused the price to normalize downward twice in the span of 3ish years since that would give me a better feeling than just straight up speculation lol.  I don't disagree about the US getting their revenue, but our country's design cannot work with high gas prices, I mean we have gone to war for gas in the past after all.  Compare western Europe's gas prices to ours and it is night and day since they do not rely on personal vehicles to the degree that we do here as a lot of their price is due to high taxes.  Still speculation on my part like I called out before lol, but I just don't want to rely on $5 a gallon unless it would be for a very short term during inflationary bumps during global economic reopenings this year."
2021-06-07 16:49:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, to answer your first half I distinctly remember it going into the $4.70s - $4.90s for 87. Then the few Exxon’s near my house spiked $5.11 or $5.21 (can’t remember now) for 87. That was for one day, but it hit it lol. It was pretty ridiculous. 

To answer the second half, I haven’t dug into what caused the 2016 dip. It can’t get much worse than negative$ barrel prices like last year though hahaha"
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WELL Health Technologies has every ingredient for a short squeeze With all of the CLOV hype, I've seen WELL Health Technologies (WELL) thrown around as another potential play. Both companies are billionaire-backed and are leading the healthcare game but I think WELL not only outperforms it fundamentally but they seem to have every component needed for a face-ripping short squeeze. WELL has been consolidating for roughly 9 months in a very similar fashion to its 2019 consolidation period before it took off from just under CAD $2.00 to just under CAD $10.00 in less than a year. The On Balance Volume Indicator (OBV) measures cumulative volume action. Similar to the November/ December 2020 bottoming pattern, a rising OBV tends to come prior to bullish price reversals by demonstrating that the stock is under accumulation.

Over the past 6-weeks, short-term Momentum Indicators such as the RSI & MACD have been recovering and are on the verge of reclaiming bullish territory. In addition, further confirmation that momentum is positioning to provide underlying support for a price breakout above the 3.5-month downtrend at $7.00 is the Buy signal recently established by the MACD indicator.  
More importantly...   
\- short interest has increased from 1.2mm shares to almost 5.00mm shares at an average of $7.17 per share representing a $35M short position.  
\- shares available to short have decreased from 3.4mm to only 1.9mm meaning the cost to borrow is getting significantly higher, while the available shares to short is significantly decreasing.  
This is literally the same fundamental reason we saw short squeezes in AMC, GME, and many other names. Could WELL Health be next?  
I think this, in parallel with a US IPO onto the NASDAQ with Fenwick & West is lining up WELL for what could be a face-ripping short squeeze..."

Compelling coincidences on why I think Amazon (AMZ), Apollo Global Management (APO) and Albertson’s (ACI) will bring Rite Aid (RAD) into their Fold.

Aug 8th 2018 Failed Merger of Albertsons and RAD due to shareholder concerns of undervalued deal- Unfinished business?

July 27th 2019 Amazon launched flagship “Counter” Service with RAD the first of its kind.

May 20th 2020 Apollo Global Management paid 1.75Billion for 17.5% Stake in Boise based Albertsons IPO

Aug 5th 2020 Rite Aid names Paul Gilbert General Counsel after Mr. Gilbert assisted RAD as a legal facilitator starting May 21st 2020. Mr Gilbert assisted with the company’s virtual annual shareholders meeting via Law Firm Epstein, Becker & Green. While working at the firm Mr. Gilbert was a healthcare partner working mostly PE Investments. Prior to that he served 10 years at LifePoint Health who was acquired by APO shortly after his departure.

AMZ and APO have business relationships in other endeavors such as Sun Country Airlines. Amazon just announced brick and mortar pharmacy desires.

Are these just a set of coincidental business relationships or setup to massive merger, you be the judge!"
2021-06-06 23:07:29,wallstreetbets,"On the topic of a possible acquisition of Rite Aid, while I'm not sure that Albertsons would be involved in a Rite Aid buyout scenario, I believe there are several companies for whom RAD would clearly be a strategic acquisition.

**Amazon**

CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:

""***It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence***.""

Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI)

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.

Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.

**Walmart**

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability

All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.

**Walgreens**

Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021)

An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:

\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS

\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category

\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.

So, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!"

I think their warehouse workers all make $15 to start. It's not a super easy job, but it *is* unskilled labor, so I don't think you can reasonably expect $25+/hour without seniority. I know the conditions are bad, and it's not a job I'd want to do. But I think the job itself is priced correctly.

# Full Breakdown of CLOV Valuation

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of explaining how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

//

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**
   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**
   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)
      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines
      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

&#x200B;

# 

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

# 

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

https://preview.redd.it/9zj5oopi54471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a66d109aec1738dece49345df43c974a18bc04

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike.  

[woops..  well we got them all in the money lol, so now we wait for shorts to cover... \(edit\)](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* is a Short Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.
* but someone paid to see the FINTEL short squeeze score, its 93 / 100

[since short sellers are all under water now that the price is at ATH..  if they get margin called, it will take 5 days to cover, 5 days of pain, 5 days of gain.](https://preview.redd.it/yufdby0b54471.jpg?width=288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332cfdb2c0b9f4ddd09eecd4979f964b2a221d2b)

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

* **Should be between 15-22$ at current valuation.**
* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor.
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 105% institutional ownership with a super low float..
* 30$ IS EXPECTED for the CEO to ever profit... and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.
* Shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because Chamath encouraged amc / gme retail interest..
* Short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the HindenTurd report which is based on some 🌈 🐻 shit.

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #’s, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I’m sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

2021-06-07 00:19:49,wallstreetbets,"So I want to update this y’all but apparently I’ve reached a max character limit for Reddit.

Few key facts I wanted to add 

* the paid FINTEL short squeeze score for this is 93 / 100 so very likely AT SOME UNPREDICTABLE TIME.

* it will take 5 days for shorts to cover…. So once this thing gets going, it’s gone!  

* The key level apes need to retake is around 11-12$ ..  so we’re not far from something big when Russel ETF’s start buying this month

* anything under 10$ is a steal

2021-06-07 17:56:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Maybe y’all can make money on a CLOV squeeze, but fuck their business model. I’d rather bet on other things than hold CLOV. Plus, don’t want to see their execs cashing out stock I helped drive to the moon."

2021-06-07 17:56:38,wallstreetbets,What’s wrong with the business model?  Does it make too much $$?

2021-06-07 18:46:44,wallstreetbets,"This is an insurance company.  People need health insurance.  It’s not like a for profit prison lol, how do you expect free healthcare to be provided by insurers if they don’t get paid by the government..  the only profit comes from the government.."
2021-06-07 04:46:36,wallstreetbets,Was right about CLOV before same for RKT / INO / others. What are you talking about 🤡
2021-06-07 18:57:07,wallstreetbets,"How is that a question? For profit health insurance companies try to maximize profits. They have to minimize what they pay out and maximize their revenues. For every premium you pay, some goes directly to owners, and to the outrageous compensation packages of mid to high tier executives. It doesn’t merely pay for the administration of bill processing like a non profit health insurance would in Germany (as required by law). Also Medicare advantage all started as trying to make Medicare partly private  so owners could get some of that money.

I’m all for sticking it to hedges with a short squeeze, and I have to invest if I want to ever be able to retire, but I try to stay out of health care business generally. Health care shouldn’t be about maximizing owners return."
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is VIX really useful to predict near term market conditions? I am an index investor (VTI) with very limited trading knowledge and am trying to improve my short-term trading performance. I allocate 10% of my portfolio to individual stock to increase my personal rate of return. I set a stop-loss order at or around 10-15%. Other than that, I don't have defined strategies. Although I enjoy trading, my trading account lags VTI by 1.2%. I am trying to improve my performance.

How are you using VIX to improve your trading performance? Several articles said that the VIX is generally negatively correlated with the broad market indices. Is it a useful contrarian market-timing indicator?"
2021-06-07 12:41:45,wallstreetbets,"First, get rid of your stop loss.
If you’re OK riding long-term ups and downs then what makes it different with short term? You’re setting an imaginary parameter for yourself which forces you to lose 10 or 15% simply because it hits that mark. VIX it’s just a volatility index. Doesn’t *really* tell you much of anything except that there’s volatility... some people say it correlates here and there but the market is a fickle mistress.."
2021-06-06 21:03:30,wallstreetbets,"The VIX is based off of what people are expecting of volatility.

People can be wrong, and often are."
2021-06-06 22:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Vix is a lagging indicator, not some future predictor."
2021-06-06 23:54:48,wallstreetbets,"The last few weeks it's been working as a leading indicator but that's, IMO, bc of so much bearish sentiment.

But no, as others have said it's a lagging indicator."
2021-06-07 00:08:05,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-07 00:11:59,wallstreetbets,Fuck Vix. It’s a tool to scare retail.
2021-06-07 00:45:06,wallstreetbets,When Vix spikes to resistance buy SPY calls. Works 9 out of 10 times
2021-06-07 01:11:42,wallstreetbets,"I use it as an indicator for SPY trades. If it spikes I load up on calls. As it trends down to it's low, puts."
2021-06-07 01:36:30,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino.

But to answer your question, fluctuations in the VIX lagging variables - not leading - when regressed against S&P500 and other large markets. They move in tandem simultaneously. It may help to serve a purpose to help you get a sense of fear in the market, but using it as a signal to make a decision on what to do next is pretty useless."
2021-06-07 09:17:29,wallstreetbets,Nice try Carlos Mencia.
2021-06-06 20:01:48,wallstreetbets,Can't VIX be manipulated with HFT?
2021-06-06 20:52:02,wallstreetbets,You can day trade certain stocks that typically ride with the VIX.
2021-06-06 21:06:04,wallstreetbets,Sometimes yes but sometimes no so I wouldn't bet my house on it
2021-06-07 00:07:35,wallstreetbets,No. The Vix is a mathematical formula.
2021-06-07 00:38:05,wallstreetbets,"It's an index/ETF... It can be sold short, for example, to decrease its price."
2021-06-07 02:38:42,wallstreetbets,"The Vix has no underlying. It is not an etf and it can't be shorted or longed. It has options that can be traded but that is it. Only Vix derivatives can be traded, like Vix futures. Professional specialist typically short the Vix etn's uvxy, vxx, tvixf...etc which are all derivatives of a derivative. The Vix formula is based on SPX options premium."
2021-06-07 09:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Options are used to manipulate prices of other stocks, so why not VIX?"
2021-06-07 10:24:06,wallstreetbets,The Vix is not a stock. It is a mathematical formula based off the premium of SPX options. Vix options have no effect on the Vix. You would have to believe someone had trillions of dollars to manipulate  every existing strike of every SPX option for every monthly spot Vix expired. It doesn't work like that. Please go on cboe or sixfigureinvesting if you want to learn how it works.
2021-06-07 10:55:12,wallstreetbets,Just looking at the options chain for \^SPX on a handful of random dates looks like it would be relatively inexpensive for a large institution to affect the underlying with options. It seems naive to think that large ETFs can't be manipulated when there is a lot of evidence that that's exactly what big players and especially market makers do.
2021-06-07 11:25:31,wallstreetbets,The SPX is an index not an etf. It also has no underlying. it is a cash index it has no stock to purchase. Market Markets can't delta Hegde so therefore gamma squeezes pretty impossible. The price does tend to pin towards high volume strikes.  SPY MM make most of their money from maker fees and from the fact that most options expire worthless.
2021-06-07 11:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the info, this is helpful."

2021-06-06 22:14:33,wallstreetbets,"I saw at least 4 or 5 AMC posts that got deleted and a couple of them were pretty in depth DD with a handful of comments, are we including those as well in this?"

2021-06-06 23:53:58,wallstreetbets,Why is BB getting so much attention when it doesn't seem to have even half the potential of AMC?
2021-06-06 23:06:42,wallstreetbets,"SMH at BB leading the way. Apes reaching for the lowest hanging, cheapest berries. I Hope to see those gains made flow to GME, the one true banana."
2021-06-07 00:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I’ve always thought BB was a good investment as well. But the way BB is being talked about, like REALLY being talked about, the last 1-2 weeks is a bit odd. I’m all in on AMC, yes, but regardless the timing and amount of attention BB seems to be getting NOW is a little fishy 🧐"
2021-06-07 00:48:35,wallstreetbets,BB is getting botted so hard!! GME IS THE ONLY WAY!!!
2021-06-07 01:40:07,wallstreetbets,"BB is a distraction. This sub has been comprised obviously. 
Dont miss the real play. Ignore all the FUD and stay the course."
2021-06-06 20:32:23,wallstreetbets,$GME I still think this is a value play
2021-06-06 21:24:06,wallstreetbets,Why does this sub not talk about Tesla much? Don’t believe in real investments that will make people rich this decade?

2021-06-06 23:20:45,wallstreetbets,Probably after BB and CLNE run their course. Maybe 3 weeks?
2021-06-06 20:50:01,wallstreetbets,"WKHS has been here for ages. It's just been trampled by GME and AMC. It's started coming to the forefront now but it's definitely not from nowhere.

Hell, I've had it on my watchlist since at least December. And I remember one guy's DD on it got pretty popular around January.

Not to say the company is legit or not, just that it doesn't appear to be pushed any less organically than any other stock here."
2021-06-06 23:06:14,wallstreetbets,I believe you but it will wait.  I'm in just a little on $RKT but for now I'll play in the $AMC sandbox.

2021-06-06 21:07:01,wallstreetbets,Don’t know if you are joking but if it’s true you don’t belong here. That’s the harsh reality.

2021-06-06 21:11:05,wallstreetbets,Bitch u don’t know what I’m paying. I could pay 500 I could pay 5000 a month. Learn some gratitude. Might help when u go broke from a bad yolo call.

2021-06-06 21:08:34,wallstreetbets,It will be lots of fun for the options sellers with the IV crush. Hopefully most people don't have short dated options that are about to get wrecked
2021-06-06 21:08:24,wallstreetbets,not really...all my post on BB have been removed for last 5 days. I got frstrated and stopped posting.

I was just talking about hype, and AMC is in pole position when it comes to that on yt. Not saying they are experts over there at all lol."
2021-06-06 23:48:10,wallstreetbets,Probably because they don't own any GME. Seems kind of obvious...
2021-06-06 23:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, i don't have it at the moment. Dropped my bag awhile ago and went after other plays."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Let's get ready for Moo-nday! Let's review why cow farts are the smartest short and long term play on the market ahead of Moo-nday (bullet points for busy apes) :

* Recycled natural gas (RNG) is the future of green commercial long distance transportation and is years ahead of it's competitors in terms of technology and infrastructure (hydrogen/electric). RNG allows for negative emissions and is extremely cost effective.
* Clean Energy ($CLNE) is an established RNG provider with little to no competition. They own most of the infrastructure and the only reason they're not reporting profits quarter after quarter is because they're just building more, prioritizing growth over short term profits.
* $CLNE just secured massive deals with Amazon (heard of them?) and Chevron, paving the way for universal industry adoption.
* The fact that the technology is so misunderstood by Wallstreet has created a tremendous opportunity for early investors.
* PRICE : Even with some of you readers realizing the stock's potential last week, the current price (9.59$ AH) is sitting at a HUGE discount from it's intrinsic value as well as from Amazon's optional buy-in price of 13$. A large number of analysts have openly supported this by setting EOY targets ranging from 11$ (extremely conservative) to 27$ (3x).
* Why does this matter? This means your potential downside of buying at 9.59$ is AT WORST the 15% gained from it's established support at 7.5$ while your potential upside is SIGNIFICANT. As a shareholder, I personally do not see a reason to sell this stock even if the short term scenario (detailed below) plays out because there are few other growth stocks which match it's mid-term potential. Compare this with the possible downside of other meme stocks before making a decision.
* POTENTIAL SHORT TERM PLAY : So if you've read my previous DD as well as the DDs of fellow cow fart enthusiasts, the open interest on the June 18th 13c is a whopping 29,000 with significant open interest on the strikes before and after up to the 20c. As the price approaches 13$, the option sellers who have sold their calls naked are forced to buy shares, driving the price higher. In return, considering the stock has been heavily shorted by Citadel, Blackstone and the like in the past few weeks, this puts short sellers in a precarious situation, especially as we go above 11$. All this, combined with a low market cap (small purchase = big effect), leads to an explosive cocktail. The potential for a gamma and subsequent short squeeze is only the cherry on top for one the best growth stocks in green energy.

So in the end, we have a stock with :

1. Extremely limited downside, significant upside (buy low, sell high)
2. Long and short term gain potential
3. Unparalleled potential for growth
4. Little to no competition in it's field
5. Established partnerships with some of the biggest enterprises in the US
6. And for those of you like me who care for the environment, brownie points for saving the planet in an innovative and cost efficient way (getting rich while preserving nature? yes please!)

2021-06-06 23:59:14,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't bet against it for short term payoffs, but natural gas isn't the future, and any companies trying to make progress with it are like betamax trying to keep up with VHS (electric).  As solar capture and battery technology continue to improve, I'd be surprised if anybody was still even trying to produce natural gas engines in 2 or 3 years.  It's cheaper and cleaner to just use solar.  It's also going to be a lot cheaper to manufacture, considering that all of the big companies have or are about to have EVs.  

If RNG was special in literally any way at all, you'd have had VW or Ford or GM producing them like crazy, and you'd see RNG stations.  Instead, everyone is focused on electric, and there are reasons for that."

2021-06-06 20:34:12,wallstreetbets,They’ve got to stop using fossil fuels to make hydrogen first
2021-06-07 04:12:35,wallstreetbets,"Electric makes sense for consumer cars, but not for long haul - the apparatus is too heavy, charging times too long. CLNE are focusing on commercial long haul, hence the deal with Amazon.

If you mean future 10 years ahead, then you're probably right - who knows what will happen then? Hydrogen might be more feasible (it isn't now, and won't be for years). But 10 years is a long way away."
2021-06-07 07:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Clne is for trucks not for light duty, and all OEMs of trucks recommended to look at natural gas in the last year as no BEV truck will be ready in 5 years 

For light duty, a small market share for cng exists too and depends a lot on the wealth of the country 

emerging markets are heavily pushing cng for cars for example"
2021-06-07 07:41:00,wallstreetbets,"For electric to work on trucks hauling across the country, the batteries would end up being bigger than the trucks themselves"

2021-06-06 20:10:17,wallstreetbets,Def agree anything under $10 is basically as close to buying free gains as you can get
2021-06-06 23:06:27,wallstreetbets,"I thank you for this, but don't you believe this will be good for both short and long term?"
2021-06-07 06:55:22,wallstreetbets,How can RNG reduce emission I don’t really get it
2021-06-07 03:14:18,wallstreetbets,wrong
2021-06-07 08:27:27,wallstreetbets,"With over 500 miles of range for a full load and the DOT rest requirements, charging times really won't be an issue.  The electric motor and related equipment isn't heavy enough to matter.  And keep in mind, battery technology is constantly improving and at a pretty impressive rate, so a few years from now, we could absolutely have trucks going 1k miles fully loaded on a single charge - though the only people who would do that would be owner/op duo teams trying to run around the clock.

You won't see RNG or hydrogen vehicles at all in 10 years."
2021-06-07 08:30:07,wallstreetbets,">no BEV truck will be ready in 5 years 

The Tesla semi will be in production next year.  Others will be right behind it.  There's too much money on the table to not be.

Plus there's constantly-evolving battery tech and then cost to consider.  Trust me, you won't see CNG vehicles ever again after 10 years at the very latest."
2021-06-07 07:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, but Tesla narrative made people thing everything can be electrified, while evidently this is not possible"
2021-06-07 08:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Nah, that's not right at all - even if you were assuming that the drivers would somehow literally be going across the entire country without stopping for meals/sleep/charging."
2021-06-07 09:14:23,wallstreetbets,Post history
2021-06-06 20:12:37,wallstreetbets,Agreed! Don't think it's gonna stay under 10$ much longer
2021-06-07 07:23:07,wallstreetbets,"The methane would have been released in the atmosphere regardless. By recycling it and using it in commercial trucks instead of diesel, you reduce the net emissions released."
2021-06-07 03:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, could you elaborate. 95% of hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in the US. Why wouldn’t I just skip the middleman and burn oil if I wanted to burn fossil fuels? I love the idea of hydrogen, but in its current implementation. It’s not particularly green nor particularly accessible. From my perspective at least. Please educate me if I missing something."
2021-06-07 14:23:03,wallstreetbets,"> With over 500 miles of range for a full load and the DOT rest requirements, charging times really won't be an issue. 

You have no idea what you’re talking about. Batteries in long haul trucks would add a ton of weight and they can’t stop and charge a truck for 10 hours every 400 miles when they can fuel up on RNG in ten minutes and be on their way.

And you think Tesla semis are going to take over the market lmao. RNG conversion kits are simple to install on existing trucks and literally cost just hundreds of dollars."
2021-06-07 08:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Also consider that if we barely have the grid today without BEV trucks, places like india and other emerging markets will not have it in 10y

If BEV trucks take 10% market share in 2030 (quite generous) cng and lng can very likely take 15-20% of it"
2021-06-07 08:32:11,wallstreetbets,"You need people to buy it with their own money and taking the operational risks on their shoulders. No truck driver for long hauls will buy a Tesla semi. 

Maybe the reference market will be city deliveries 

But as Cummins ceo said, we are years away from ZEV transition for HD 

Biomethane is much cheaper and is receiving identical incentives to batteries"
2021-06-07 03:48:14,wallstreetbets,"You're missing a lot.
Look into grey vs blue vs green hydrogen
Green hydrogen is the future
Google 'hydrogen strategy' for whichever country you're in
Renewable nat gas is nichey
Hydrogen is the future"
2021-06-07 08:38:16,wallstreetbets,"You probably won't see many owner/ops buying electric right out the gate, but owner/ops often hang onto their trucks for over a decade due to the cost.  But the biggest cost by far is fuel - hundreds of dollars per fill-up.  Electricity costs far less.  

You're going to see the boys with the big fleets experimenting with EVs by the end of next year, then putting in big orders after that.  

You also have to consider infrastructure.  EV charging is already being implemented nationwide.  Nobody smart is going to throw the dice on trying to set up natural gas stations across the entire map.   you're also going to be a lot more likely to have supply chain issues with CNG."
2021-06-07 12:01:29,wallstreetbets,downvotes dumb shits
2021-06-07 08:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Ev charging for heavy duty trucks will be dramatically different from the one for light duty, and in some isolated areas where trucks usually drive there may not be the high tension needed to deliver electricity 

Also consider that electricity market will be different 10 years from today. Centralised utilities will likely be downsized in favor of multi power generation actors

Thus cheaper electricity will depend on a number of factors"
2021-06-07 08:44:34,wallstreetbets,"The demand for electricity is only going to grow.  There are absolutely no concerns when it comes to availability or cost.  Any truck stops worth their salt will have charging, and you'll never go too far without seeing a truck stop even today, even in rural areas.

Charging isn't going to be nearly as bad as you'd thing, especially considering the mandatory downtime rules in place by DOT."
2021-06-07 08:46:59,wallstreetbets,"In a harbour like the one of LA, with 15000 trucks operating per day, you cannot imagine a 100% BEV trucks park. It will be a crazy web of cables and power centres

BEV will play a role, but they will not monopolise the market. Cng and lng are at the moment the ignored side of the business and biomethane is a really amazing fuel

Nothing , not even electricity, is like biomethane / rng"
2021-06-07 08:57:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's going to be amazing to see some of the largest and busiest stops - but it'll be completely doable.  People probably cast the same doubts about how to get all of those guys diesel at first as well.  It won't be as difficult as you might think.

I'm not saying that CNG is bad.  Hell, if it had caught on harder maybe 10 or so years ago, it would be insanely popular for a while.  But electric is the way everything is going.  Technology is limitless.  You won't see much more improvement in the world of CNG.

The future of OTR trucking is eventually going to be at or near 100% electric.  Now, admittedly, I don't know as much about fueling ships as I should for a guy in the logistics world, but getting freighters to use literally any other type of fuel source would be ridiculously helpful - perhaps CNG will have a role to play there."
2021-06-07 09:02:20,wallstreetbets,"I got your point and I mostly agree for rich world trends 

Have a look at HPDI 2.0 with hydrogen and scania, that is a nice development for combustion engines"
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Clover Nation 🍀📈 Why I love Clover Health.

- Chamath Palihapitiya Backed.

- Shorted by the notorious Hindenburg Research 

- Short Interest is upwards of 40% ( More then AMC and GME combined)

- A growing business model that is currently expanding into various US states. 

-Chamath and Clover Health CEO can not sell shares under $30 (has to stay above $30 for 90 days before selling)

-Recently added to the Russel 3000 index

- Healthcare is on the forefront for the Biden admin. 

- and I could go on and on with more catalysts.

2021-06-06 22:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Not only is OPs figure not factual, I'm tired of everything being a ""squeeze."" It's permeated too far and being misused too much. CLOV might be a decent stock but these aren't fundamentals posted here."
2021-06-07 01:22:17,wallstreetbets,"It's much easier to squeeze a $1.5 billion market cap company and take it higher than a $15 billion company. You have it backwards. 

Look at what WSB OG Shkreli did with his short squeeze plays, they were on low market cap stocks. The guy's not a hero or anything, but my point is that low market cap stocks are actually much more vulnerable to a squeeze."
2021-06-07 01:54:17,wallstreetbets,"This is literally the only completed SPAC of his that's trading under the $10 initial offering price. SPCE is trading at 300% the initial offering, SOFI at 200%, Opendoor at 160%. How are they garbage? You're not supposed to buy into $10 worth of shares at $20, the entire point of a SPAC is for normal people to be able to get in on the IPO pricing which is $10 a share which normally you can't do with a traditional IPO because only wealthy bank clients get access to any shares at all.

If you bought into every one of his SPACs at launch you would have not only gotten the shares but the warrants as well.

Buy the SPACs early as units, don't FOMO at 2X NAV, and don't just concentrate into one single issuance and you'll get good returns."
2021-06-07 03:04:26,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it.  There was news circulating a while back that Chamath had already closed out his position on CLOV.  Top it off, most of his portfolio in spacs come from being given stock as compensation, so it literally doesn't matter what the price is when he offloads it because he makes a profit since he paid nothing for it."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MNTK I see a lot of people getting hyped over RNG, especially as it relates to CLNE. Just want to throw out that there are some great alternatives if you want to diversify some. 

Montauk recently IPO’d and is one of the largest RNG developers and Aria and Archaea, some other developers, are merging with a public entity. These developers have really strong earnings already and have really high project level internal rates of return (think 15-20%). 

Might not be a great YOLO or anything, but if you really buy into the green future, might be worth looking into. 

I would note that you need to be familiar with how RIN and LCFS legislation changes over the years, since ~97% of unit economics currently come from legislative credits.

2021-06-06 20:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Cool company, does good for the environment overall.  However with their valuation and their lack of growing revenue streams I'm not confident this is going to go up.  Looks like their system is very expensive to operate so they have slim margins.  

Now they have an absolutely tiny public float.  Something like 3% of all shares.  So very small buying or selling can make a big price swing."

Revenue has been pretty stagnant and they, hopefully used the ipo cash raise to pay off their debts as that was eating into their earnings."
2021-06-07 11:52:16,wallstreetbets,Further you have to look at their current market cap and and wether or not their growth prospective matches the price.  At these prices it does not.  This is a buy in the 7.40-7.90 range.
2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SOFI/23andME What are yalls thoughts on SOFI and 23andME. I know these are not the typical investment of choice for this sub but here me out

SOFI - This company recently merged and shot up from $15.15 to 23ish at its peak. The only reason this compny goes down are consistent short attacks. This stock has a book value of easily $26/$30. This has massive potential and if you guys wanna make some money waiting on gme this is the way. 

23andME- This company will be merging on the 10th of june and the call contracts have been going up like crazy even though the price has not yet moved from 10 dollars. I am thinking the $12.5 17 dec and $10 july calls are going to bring at least 50% in just a couple weeks.

I currently own bith ootions and long stock for each company and wanted to get a disscusion thread going so we can spread the word and hear some pros/cons from others!! 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-06-06 23:39:09,wallstreetbets, 23 and me is tempting because it seems to be able to sell the info it’s gathered and is working with one of the major drug makers to develop drugs using the data. You could buy it at 10 and sell the 10 July call and make 1.25 for 6 weeks. It drops under 10 then you are in at 8.75. Sort of tempting.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GOL - Some Brazilian airline I'm bullish on this Brazilian airline stock with a ticker of GOL.  Mainly because the flight attendants are all hot.  I imagine they are like what American flight attendants were before unions made it impossible to fire them (I'm looking at you United flight attendants).  Also, buying GOL now is like buying LUV or ALK 9 months ago.  There should be 20% to 30% upside in GOL as Brazil gradually gets their pandemic under control.  Their government flubbed the vaccine rollout but things are gradually improving."

The CEO graduated from a low-ranked university and before joining Gol was basically just a marketing guy. I can guess that people like that are very likely to be involved with bribery and corruption and thus it's a matter of time until it becomes world news and the stock price tank. The only good thing about this company is the flight attendants' asses.

2021-06-07 01:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Hi folks, if you check my post history you can see I know a thing or two about GME. 

GME itself moving from R2K to R1K is bearish. 

1) There are more assets under management indexed to the R2K vs R1K. For large caps (R1K) most index money is tied to the S&P 500, not the R1K. For an example of this, see the assets under management of IWB (R1K fund, ~30B aum) vs IWM (R2K fund, $70B aum). 
2) The total market cap of R1K is greater than R2K. Combine this with item 1) and that means that LESS money is spread across MORE market cap, i.e. less $ per equity of index buying. 
3) it's likely that the rank and relative weighting of gme will be much lower in the R1K compared to where it just was in the R2K. 

So I anticipate net selling on the 25th. Collars make sense if you're holding. 

On the flipside, if enough people think GME moving to R1K is bullish, then it might ramp in the meantime from people buying, but I'm not even sure this recent rally is retail driven at all."

Upcoming news for GME is majorly bullish, its heavily shorted, the stock has maintained attention for months, its future is looking good (Cohen's plans), and new rules are being discussed that may benefit retail traders. I personally think that's enough to help it grow even 200% from it's current value.


Then again I am a college student working at a grocery store who frequents the wsb sub."

If they have a negative outlook on a stock, then buying later has a positive expected value.

There could even be funds who don't buy in at all, internalise the risk and pay out cash money if the stock goes up but pocket the difference if the stock goes down."

And retail investors do help out Hedge Funds; specifically Citadel (Probably others; but I don't know wtf those do in comparison; I just know Citadel is the biggest high speed trading firm out there) definitely make some of their money from cherrypicking which trades to process. 

Pretty much everything I've said about citadel is fact; but I will admit them making huge bank, and them specifically choosing trades from Robinhood and other platforms is speculation, except for TDameritrade. They and Citadel advertise that they use citadel services often."

Shit *just* happened for AMC and it hasn't dropped like GME did. Having the benefit of hindsight for GME doesn't give you the ability to tell the future for AMC, and if it *did*, you'd be saying, ""It will drop massively and then jump back up in a few weeks.""

""AMC just popped and hasn't tanked but it will and GME won't and I can prove it because GME has been doing good for weeks while AMC hasn't had weeks since the pop to prove itself which means it will tank"" is quite possibly the most retarded take I've seen yet.

I guess you belong here."

2021-06-07 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Well don't say it like that. GME has an all star team of executives and a real plan to become the Amazon of gaming.

If they are betting against you, you can make them lose money on that trade. It’s like sports betting though. The bookies might lose out big on one event, but overall, over time, the bookies are almost always going to win. They have enough money to cover their bases. 
Us individuals can still win on single trades/stocks though."

History of how it came, why its used, whats it for

2021-06-07 14:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Ummm... do you mean you bought 1 call option with a strike price of $20?  If so, your call gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares at $20 each.  Calls are sold in lots of 100 shares.  So let's say at day 59 the price of BB is $100 a share.  You can fork over $2000 (100 shares x $20/share = $2000) and buy 100 shares.  Suddenly you have $100x100 shares = $10,000 worth of shares but you only paid $2000 to get them.  Nice.  Or let's say you hit day 59 and you don't have $2000 in your account.  You can sell your option for a bit less than $10,000 and let somebody else scoop up your shares.  Let's say you get to day 59 and the price is still sitting at $15/share.  You don't want to spend $20 to buy a $15 share so you let your option expire and you do nothing at all.  You lose your option - it goes to zero on day 61.  But you don't need to wait for day 60.  You can sell your option at any point along the way.  So if the price of the share is dropping dropping dropping and you want to sell your option at a loss you can do that any time before it expires.  Just make sure if you plan to exercise your option and actually buy the shares that you have the cash in your account by day 60.  **Note:  If you are reading this and learning something then that means you are absolutely NOT ready to play options.  Highly dangerous to play options if you don't know what you are doing.**"

2021-06-06 22:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes , yes and yes.

The idea is options give you leverage as well as the option to ""back out"" of a trade. 

Think of them like conditional buy orders that you dont have to act on. Its a  if / then statement . Exerciseing would be buying the shares which for me profit is BB >$20. I could also sell to close the option and not buy shares but sell the right to buy them to someone else and not put up the 21k of capital and collect the premium , up 23% as of last week.

It give you more options then just buy/sell stocks.

You are also capatilize on theta = time, and IV = how fast price moves."
2021-06-06 20:48:13,wallstreetbets,"False. Buying calls means the market maker sells the call. This forces the MM to then buy 100 shares to neutralize the short call position. To create the squeeze people need to buy calls, buying a few hundred/thousand shares won’t do shit."

Right now with the volatilty IV is like 300% which is insane right now. Meaning you need constant price movements to keep the value up.

Basically their overpriced right now due to hype / buying pressure. Its like an auction for a chance to preorder the new Nikes , price is set by the amount of froth from buyers.

Also strike price and DTE are factors to consider in your risk model.

I.e how far away from the current price it could go and in what timeframe.

I think we are going into a bullish channel on a Quartly timeframe but I am more of a technical trader.

2021-06-07 07:50:46,wallstreetbets,"Percentages are percentages. 

To go from $1 to $2 is a 100% increase. 100% for tlry is $22->$44

Provided they have the same value, catalyst etc, they'd both increase or decrease by the same percentage - not dollaramount pr share. 

(I have no clue as to the actual value of either, but unless you only have $21 to invest the argument of choosing the lower shareprice just because it is lower makes no sense)"
2021-06-07 16:09:06,wallstreetbets,I bought when it was over 5 in January and started to sweat when it started diving but did some looking into and found it to be a solid investment. Since then I have been buying every dip.

2021-06-06 23:56:34,wallstreetbets,"They are only going to delta hedge if the contract is looking to be ITM. They won’t hedge for shares if your contract isn’t likely to be worth anything.

So options that are reasonable can help a squeeze start, options that are unreasonable help the squeeze after it’s already underway"
2021-06-06 22:34:24,wallstreetbets,"I dont know why you are getting downvoted you are 100% corrrect , its called delta hedging although the MM only hedges the delta x 100 so OTM options dont require much hedgeing. As price moves up and delta increase MM have to hedge to account for higher delta.

Basically they have to put more money down the closer BB gets to $15, once BB is past $15 a 15c will have a delta of like 0.99 which is like owning the shares (which is 1.0).

TLDR; BB = <$15 then 15c <1.0 and 1 share = 1.0. If BB >$15 then 15c and share = 1.0

Ex : The delta (not shown) on the 1/20/2023 15c calls are , as I wrote this, 0.7126.

This means a MM has to buy/hedge 0.7126 x 100 x 14 (cause I habe 14 contracts) 997.64 share of BB.

This means these 1400 ""shares"" have the same value as 997.64 share of BB as of friday.

If I just used 7k to buy BB shares @ 13.37 I would only get 523.56 shares. 

With this I can use 7k to make MM buy 997.64 shares of BB for me right now under the inplication I will buy 1400 at a later date, or 400+ more shares then I could normally purchase.

The closer delta gets to 1 the 997.64 will aproach 1400 then past 20 my 1400 ""shares"" will have a higher value the what ever the price is after that.

This is market making.

Edit: 

After todays move the delta is now 0.7520 or 1052.8 which mean MM hedged my calls by buying 55.16 shares of BB (997.64 - 1052.8)."
2021-06-07 12:06:34,wallstreetbets,"> Buying calls means the market maker sells the call. This forces the MM to then buy 100 shares to neutralize the short call position. 

This isn't true. They will hedge based on the delta. Not 1:100 immediately."
2021-06-06 23:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Sorry not 24 months ,more like 17 left till they expire so not 1300 but 950.

If BB is over $15 i can sell a weekly OTM call for the next 17 months. Since I have 14 calls I can sell 14 calls once a week till 1/20/23. 14 x 4 x 17 = 952 options.

OTM weeklys are $200 rn due to high IV but normally around $100 so thats 14 x $100-200 every week or $1400-2800 per week / $5600-11200 a month.

And that is just if BB STAYS at $20. Any higher then I could be selling $400-1000 x 14 weeklies with the insane IV from the runs.

Rn its just profit from premuim but @ $20 I can get the wheels turning,

Also ROTH ira is where I hold my BB shares , this just my fuck around brokerage."

2021-06-07 09:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Should be thinking of percentages, not dollar amounts."
2021-06-07 09:10:33,wallstreetbets,"My point is: saying if sndl goes up $1 i double my money is like saying if tlry goes up $22 i double my money. Both is a 100% increase. If shit doubles, it doubles. There is no magical fairy going about tossing $1 on to shareprices at random, making a low shareprice any better than a higher one. If sndl has more room to run than tlry, then great. But saying you have limited funds is the reason you go for sndl is just plain bad math unless it is actually backed by something. In this case you even say tilray is the better company.

I might have misunderstood your statement. You might have meant that sndl is undervalued compared to tlry, and that it thus has more room to run. If so, good on you and my apologies. If you however think $1 per share is neccecarily cheaper than $22 then oh boy, oh boy..."

2021-06-07 12:08:09,wallstreetbets,"It is how it works. Buying shares moves price upward, which means higher delta, which means more buying from MM, which causes gamma squeeze.

2021-06-07 09:37:00,wallstreetbets,"There is no ""best"" bet.

Trades are taken in relation the the amount of risk you are comfortable with.

You dont like a lot of risk go for 30-45 DTE ITM/ATM strikes, so a july or august 14/15 strike.

If you are insanly risky then you could bet on a 6/11 40c or that BB while be over $40 by this come Friday.

The probable likelyhood of either of those scenarios are vastly different and as such have a payout that reflects that.

You get more money if the riskier bet hits but has a less chance, hence why they are called lotto tickets.

This subs bread and butter.

The first play is more of a ""calculated trade"" the secound is a ""bet""

Its up to you to define your risk comfort levels.

If you want to run the advanced wheel, ie sell calls against your own (spreads) then you want strikes closer to the money or with a delta of around 0.3000"

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# Positions:

* 2000 shares @ $11.20
* 50 1/20/23 $40c
* 50 1/20/23 $25c
* 10 1/20/23 $10c
* 20 6/11/21 $30 covered calls

I've had to remove a number of sources due to the Visual Mod, so if you'd like a claim sourced just let me know in the comments.

^(None of this is financial advice; it was written by an infinite number of monkeys hitting keys at random.)

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ➡️ **Hold** ➡️  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap."

2021-06-07 12:05:12,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you think Blackberry outperforms crowdstrike is hilarious.

BB purchased Cylance; which was eventually completely anihilated by crowdstrike and proven to be hot garbage.  Cylance was so shit, enterprises only purchased it because it was CHEAP and they had zero budget.  That's why ""BB"" is in any enterprises currently.  They just haven't purchased the actually good solutions yet (CrowdStrike, S1, Carbon Black, etc.)

Why is crowdstrike the best?

They collect meta data from every single computer installed on in an organization, send that data to the cloud, analyze it with the FIRST/most advanced Ai/ML algo for unusual pattern activity (ie. a user logging in on a sat. and deleting backups and encrypting stuff which is what ransomeware looks like)..AND then they have services (profesional cyber security gods) that investigate that data.

They have the second largest data imprint on Amazon Web Services...behind only Netflix.

This is with just storing meta-data....ie. logs of a person opening microsoft word, etc.

So tell me how BB/Cylance is better than CrowdStrike again?  Rofl.

BB is a nich product for security of iot type devices like cars, which is still important but what you said above is straight up lies.

People investing in BB deserve the truth and you gave them straight marketing garbage, with regards to enterpise security software. Banks will NOT go to BB if they have the money.  They will go to crowdstrike.  If they dont have the money, they will likely use other better solutions like SentinelOne, carbonblack, etc. that are leaps ahead of BB.

FInally if they are super broke they will use windows defender, which actually has decent efficacy despite being last-gen technology and has no threatgraph."

2021-06-06 23:15:10,wallstreetbets,This is 100% correct. It's been lumped in as a short squeeze play (which wasn't even possible before this week) by people who had no idea what they're investing in.
2021-06-06 23:30:50,wallstreetbets,"I would never lie to you baby.

**TL;DR: No, it's not too late. When this is a $100 stock the difference between $10 and $14 will seem negligible.**

I want to put a lot more into BB - as in I sold off a quarter of my portfolio on Friday in preparation for Monday. My play is as follows:

* \~12.50 - \~14.50 is no man's land. I'm good with just holding in that range.
* If it opens high (above 14.50), I'll wait for the inevitable post-open drop. If it's still at 14.50 by 10:30 or if it climbs back, I'll be looking at buying a massive amount of $40 2023 LEAPS. The $40 strike is the best value here. People are rushing to the highest strike available - $42. So much so that the premium on $40 is actually *lower than the premium on $42 right now.*
* If it opens under $12.50 or falls there, I'll likely be buying a combination of shares and $40 LEAPS.
* If it opens high and stays high, I'll play $30 weeklies. Just a word of advice though, you'd have to be absolutely crazy to hold these to expiration unless a short squeeze or some massive turnaround actually happens. If you can buy on Monday and sell for a big profit before Wednesday, that's preferable here.

If there's a big drop down to $10 or so, don't despair and assume the run up isn't happening. It'll mean it's just been postponed and you can get in *even cheaper*. I originally got in at $18 in January. Watched it run up to the high 20s, and drop back to $8. I didn't reee and paper hand - I very happily averaged down. The 10x run up is inevitable, you just may have to wait a couple years."

Then everybody wants to get in on the new dip, so WSB buys up big amounts again, and the scalpers buy back cheap shares to sell later. 

All that it takes to break the cycle and relive what happened to AMC last week is for high volume to continue and for WSB to diamond hands."

They are NOT considered even in the top 5 of best enterprise cybersecurity, that would be what you would expect to stop things like ransomware or pipeline hack.

2021-06-07 13:04:51,wallstreetbets,"no prob.  i like BB by the way.  i'd buy it.  But not for the enterprise security play.  

when a system has one specific purpose, like a car, to drive, it doesn't have tons of software the security solution has to ""play nice"" with.  You know what software the car will have, it wont be installing new random apps etc.  

Given we know that, a security solution is much easier as it doesnt have to whitelist/blacklist a ton of apps etc.  It can determine: only these apps are allowed to run, in this order, etc. and it's much easier to lock down.  SOemthing like cylance/BB works perfectly fine for that, and it's something that if you get it tuned and pre-installed it's a great value add.  

at enterprises, something like cylance can and has interrupted people trying to use microsoft excel, or word, or other random programs, interferred with databases, etc.

shit, i even had cylance installed on my personal computer in the past, and in the middle of a game of league of legends it randomly decided league was a ""malicious program"" and it deleted my game files WHILE I WAS PLAYING lol."

The lead they have now will certainly shrink as other automakers shift more heavily into the EV space. BB's QNX being used by a variety of automakers puts it in a better position for the future rather than being only used by Ford and Tesla who currently dominate the market. Just my opinion.Its nice to see someone questioning the numbers and putting up evidence to back it up, in my mind your evidence just makes me more bullish though."

Now, maybe Tesla will fade. And maybe QNX-based EVs will dominate in 10 years, but it’s not a forgone conclusion. Even if these legacy automakers do win back much of Tesla’s market share, by the time that happens they may have all switched off of QNX. 

Ford recently abandoned it for Android. RTOS is NOT a highly sticky technology. It is pretty easy for a maker to transition to a new technology when it wants to, or when it makes financial sense to do so. 

I suspect that Apple and Android may end up dominating this space once it matures."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Tellurian $TELL, keeping the 🪵Driftwood Dream alive, why you should care about 🌋LNG, and why this stock is a must have🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Admittedly 🚀TELL and Liquid Natural Gas 🌋is not as sexy as weed stonks and 💎meme stonks💎, but that does not mean that TELLdoes not have a lot to offer. This stock could be your ride or die, and TELL is the kind of partner that will have hot 🍗tendies on the table when you get 🏡 .

🐒Fun Fact: Did you know Liquid Natural Gas is used as Rocket Fuel? Well it is, and that is super neat!!!


 A quick re-cap on 🚀TELL
———————————-
“Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial stage will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time. 
——U/V3capitol

 🤔What is this 🪵Driftwood🪵???

Essentially it is a pipeline, some of you may have heard of the Deals that have been signed recently(I will get back to these later) the Driftwood Pipeline is the vehicle that supplies these deals. The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016, it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality. 
This summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline 🏗 construction 🚧🦺 . Q1 2022 is the projected date for FID and when the pipes might be laid😉

Driftwood has permits, the company(Betchel) to build it, and a team that has done it before. Shovel Ready is the term here

When the construction starts the floodgates will be open and this stock will 🚀🌙. Reference a stock like Cheniere(trading @ 87.35), a company Charif Souki used to work for, so you can get an idea. Speaking of Charif Souki let’s take a peak at the team.

———————————

🌟🌟**All-Star Management**🌟🌟

Tellurian has 2 of 3  pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies.

Charif Souki - Chairman - LNG Godfather and Legend, who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996. If they can do it once, they can do it again.

Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""
——————-u/V3capitol

This team can and will get it ✅

 
🐒Fun Fact # 2 : So you don’t think LNG is cool? 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, at about -260° Fahrenheit( now that is pretty cool❄️if you ask me)for shipping and storage. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state. This process makes it possible to transport natural gas to places pipelines do not reach.




The Deals📑💸

Right now TELL💥 has  2 👬of them Vitol and Guvnor, each worth 12 Billion💵 over the next 10 years. So 2.4 Billion per year in revenue with these alone. We can expect to hear a couple more deals announced in the next month. 

These deals are what have people so excited for this stock as of late, and rightly so!

I know what your 🤔 thinking, so what!?!🤷🏽‍♀️ “Without that pipeline they will not get any of that money. “

Well to the skeptics🛸🗿🔦 I would ask this: Why would these companies be signing deals without doing their due dilligence? I mean here I am doling out info, and my opinions on this company, but don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the not 1 but 2 companies that are going to dish out billions. 💵💴
 

Something I am sure many people are thinking....🥱🤔

🦕🦖Fossil Fuels are so last century! Why would I invest in LNG🌋? I should invest in 🌞solar and 🌪wind and blah blah blah.

Well you are not wrong if your talking about coal and oil⛽️.

Natural Gas is going to stay relevant though. Here are some reasons why:

*$* Developing countries can not afford solar and all the fancy smancy tech energy. They will continue to be buyers for a long time to come. Remember 🚀TELL exports🚢⚓️ LNG, “Global Basis”🌎

*$* Demand continues to increase on a “Global Basis” https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2021/06/04/the-worlds-liquefied-natural-gas-market-is-roaring-back/

*$*Carbon capture for this industryis set to play a significant role in how countries view LNG. https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/5/6/us-lng-players-tout-carbon-capture-in-bid-to-boost-green-image

*$* LNG is being used in 🛳cruise ships and 🚀🛸space ships🛰.  Most restaurants use it to cook as well, if you ate food cooked outside your house there is a strong chance it was cooked with LNG. That is just so neat!

*$* 🍸Warren Buffet🍸 bet 9.7 Billion on the long future of LNG. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/19/why-warren-buffett-is-betting-on-pipelines-evern-as-climate-fears-rise.html

*$* Google future of LNG, check out the demand for it. LNG is getting real, really fast.


Some Price 🎯 
—————
$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

🐒Fun Fact #3 : LNG from landfill gas.   LNG can also be derived from landfill gas. At a landfill near Livermore, California, landfill gas converted into LNG is being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles. The plant can produce up to 13,000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas, enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities. This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source, but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck fleet. (Source: http://EarthandIndustry.com: Article: Developing Clean Fuels from Landfill Gas, Wes Muir, 11/23/10)

So here we are. I hope you enjoyed the read. Maybe you decide to invest in some shares or makes some plays, that would be swell. Tellurian 🚀is great for both! With calendared 📆catalysts on the horizon to create quick pops in stock price, and a business model📊 that gives an excellent set up for long term holders this stock📈has something for everyone.

If nothing else I hope you enjoyed the 🐒Fun Facts

2021-06-06 23:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Lng is nice because you have mostly methane, co2, and maybe a few more impurities in the pipe. You have to strip all impurities before you liquify or else you have a safety disaster on your hands. So you captured a lot of co2 already to sell or store. 

You also emit a lot of co2 running generators,  processing tools and other shit just running the facility. This is harder to capture since it’s less concentrated and lower pressure.

You can easily capture the inlet gas co2 for storage or for sale.

There’s been ZERO permits for storing co2 for this project so automatically thinking they will is wrong. Everyone unfortunately just vents all co2 since they are permitted too."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMC and $GME Are Going To Cycle through Dips And Peaks This Year. Both stocks are a battleground in the war between retail and institutional investors.  The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake."

Figure out which one has the higher chance of a turnaround. Are they in a growing market or a shrinking market? Are they in debt? How diluted are the shares of the company. What does the team look like. Is this a good long term play if a squeeze never happens? 

And if you’re just buying on the squeeze, then figure out which is carrying the higher short interest through what’s listed, ftds, married calls/puts, deep OTM puts, etc, and compare that to the number of shares outstanding. Whichever has the higher ratio has the bigger squeeze potential. 

Finally, compare the number of shares available in the float to the amount that retail owns to make sure that your stock of choice has an actual likelihood of being squeezed. 

If one of those stocks is better on every front, that’s probably the one you want. 

Should you diversify? Not if you actually believe in what you’re doing. It merely reduces pressure on the short position and makes a squeeze less likely.

For about 12 years Freddie Mac & Fanny Mae have been under a conservatorship. This conservatorship was arguably illegally forced onto the company. Currently the Supreme Court owes a opinion in June that will either free Freddie and Fannie of the conservatorship and able to profit. Or of course it could stay a two dollar stock the way it has been for the last 12 years. If the company is free the pre-conservatorship stock price was about $80 a share back in 2007. I could only imagine what the company could be worth now. Last year both companies profited about $30 billion total. That is a lot of margin. That is a ton of profit for such a small company (total employees). All of this money has been swept into the government and has been paying for Obamacare since it started in 2008. The upside is enormous. Can you imagine investing in a two dollar stock with the upside of 80+ dollars per share? Yes the downside is about two dollars or potentially less if the Supreme Court decides to keep the net worth sweep legal. Do your homework. This could be a life changer. I’m swinging for the fences on this one. This is going to be my home run. This has been going on for about 12 years. We are in the ninth inning of the ball game.

That's just some straight up crazy person conspiracy shit.

The one interesting point is what would happen if the these organizations leave conservatorship. The treasury owns preferred stock and warrants which they received in return for massive capital infusions during the mortgage crisis. The condition is that the taxpayer money get repaid so it's not clear what value this would have for the shareholders.

2021-06-07 12:42:33,wallstreetbets,">didn’t these companies fuck the housing market?

""Companies""

They were ""companies"" in the way the DEA is a company to some extent. Or maybe more like a defense contractor that gets 100% of revenue from the federal government? Although maybe more like Sallie Mae. Except you can't escape student loan payments through bankruptcy the way you can escape mortgage payments.

There really isn't a good comparison.

They were legally required to buy up MBSs with the Federal Government guaranteeing they would remain solvent.

If you think these ""companies"" screwed the housing market then you are de facto saying the Federal Government created the incentive structure to screw the economy and then used our money to bailout their friends while simultaneously, while knowing Fannie Freddie would remain solvent per the FOIA emails, screwing shareholders to create a cash flow of billions of USD per year that the Treasury (and thus the POTUS directly without needing Congressional approval) could spend on whatever he wanted (the leading theory is this was the source of the ACA subsidies).

Asking ""why give them a shot"" is conceding that it is ok for the government to force a privately held company into government ownership and strip shareholders of rights and dividends without compensation.

Why give them a shot? Because the US government should not have the power to buy 80% of a company through a forced sale (via executive order iirc, so not even really ""legal"" in the first place) and then take 100% of dividend payments.

Can you name another company where 100% of dividends are paid to only 80% of shareholders?"

I did a little homework and the bar has been set so high with Fannie and Freddie that the average credit score for their loans is the 720s. That is insanely high. If anything this conservatorship has forced Fannie and Freddie to turn down loans with people with high 680s. To be honest with you they are getting rid of the loans for people who are largely minorities and immigrants with little credit even though the jobs are stable. Sad.

2021-06-07 12:43:05,wallstreetbets,"In 2019, the Treasury Department (Executive Branch) proposed a recapitalization plan that would release Fannie/Freddie from the conservatorship in 3-5 years.  Because that proposal would have budgetary implications, the Congressional Budget Office (Legislative Branch) provided its analysis, which can be read [here](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56511).  The report is long, but it is the most comprehensive source of objective (non-partisan) information that I have found.  

In the CBO report, receivership is mentioned as a potential option.  Amongst other references, the report states:

""FHFA could use the power it received under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to place the GSEs in receivership. That status would allow FHFA or a designated agent to restructure the GSEs by liquidating some or all of their assets or by transferring those assets to other entities, including the Treasury and existing shareholders. Receivership could give FHFA more flexibility and control over the recapitalization process, particularly over addressing the claims of holders of existing junior preferred and common shares. However, receivership could eliminate the value of the warrants that permit the Treasury to buy common stock in the GSEs in the future for a nominal price.  
One option for receivership would be for FHFA to create a new corporation (or one for each GSE) and transfer to it all of the GSEs’ assets and liabilities, such as their mortgage guarantees. The new corporation could sell common stock to raise its required amount of capital. Any remaining proceeds from that sale could be allocated to the GSEs’ shareholders on the basis of their seniority—starting with the Treasury’s senior preferred shares before paying the private holders of junior preferred shares or common shares. The Treasury would be paid the same for its warrants as the existing holders of common shares.""

Ultimately, the decision will be left to the Executive Branch (Treasury Department and FHFA), not the CBO.  However, the receivership idea has been discussed, and the folks in the Executive branch are surely aware of this option."

2021-06-07 03:15:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure there is a meaningful partisan advantage here.  

The conservatorship was initiated by President Bush (R), Treasury Secretary Paulson (R), and Fed Chair Bernanke (R).  The Trump (R) administration had 4 years to lift the conservatorship, but declined to do so.  Before the case arrived in the Supreme Court, it originated in Texas (a conservative state), and was appealed to the 5th Circuit (a conservative court).  Neither one of those conservative-leaning venues lifted the conservatorship or voided the net worth sweep.  During oral argument in the Supreme Court, Republican-appointed Justices Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett all expressed reservations about giving the shareholders their desired remedy.  

Of course, anything is possible, but the political composition of the Court probably isn't an automatic path to the 5 necessary votes to lift the conservatorship or invalidate the net worth sweep agreement.  Especially, when the Justices have an ""out.""  Namely, they can rule the same way as the 5th Circuit previously ruled by simply severing the ""for cause"" language regarding Director removal, and allowing the remaining issues to stand.  Most commentary I've read handicaps that outcome as being the most likely.  One way, or another, we should know either tomorrow or Thursday."

2021-06-07 00:45:40,wallstreetbets,People would argue Bush was a lame duck at that point. The polls were heavily leaning Obama’s way by then (September). I agree with you about the rumblings. You cannot use a conservatorship as a regulator. After 13 years put in regulations and release the conservatorship. Trump was smart. He got to avoid the topic for four years and have a very prosperous term. The president that releases them is taking an extra hit in the national debt. He knew the courts would more than likely release the conservatorship anyway. That way the national debt doesn’t take an extra hit meanwhile the Democrats get to look like double assholes for raising the national debt by even more so. It’s good politics. It’s also our opportunity to add a stock with a 30 to 40% down side and a absolutely enormous upside. Every Monday morning and Thursday morning at 10 AM Eastern time I get excited waiting for it.

2021-06-07 14:00:34,wallstreetbets,I have two reasons why I don’t believe they will end up in receivership. The first one is the reason they are in the conservatorship in the first place. They are in the process of finding out if it is unconstitutional. If it is unconstitutional that means fraud. A typical releasing plan to receivership shouldn’t apply if it’s fraud. And the second reason is money. These companies are extremely profitable and simply don’t need the help to re-capitalize. Absolutely getting the 100 billion back that the government stole would be nice and it could happen. One of the justices said and I quote “what do we do write them a check“. I guess I’m just more optimistic than you. Good luck to all in all of their endeavors.

2021-06-07 12:59:08,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I find the APA claim to be the most compelling argument, if the goal is to invalidate the net worth sweep.  However, the Justices didn't seem too focused on it during oral arguments.

As for the constitutional claim, it will not necessarily void the net worth sweep.  The claim involves language in the statute.  Specifically, the statute states that the Director can only be removed ""for cause.""  Petitioners contend that language amounts to Congress interfering with the President's authority to remove/install executive branch members at will.  According to petitioners, that is a violation of the ""separation of powers"" principle, and therefore, unconstitutional.

However, the Court can simply strike the ""for cause"" language from the statute, and sever that issue from the rest of the case.  That is exactly what happened in the 5th Circuit, where the statutory language was considered unconstitutional, but the net worth sweep was allowed to remain effective.  That is why the shareholders appealed to the Supreme Court, even though they succeeded at establishing that the ""for cause"" language was unconstitutional.

Personally, I would bet the farm that SCOTUS reaches the same outcome.  In my opinion, they will likely say, ""sure, the 'for cause' language is problematic, but so what?  Those technical semantics aren't a good enough reason to invalidate an agreement worth hundreds of billions of dollars.  Plus, if we go down that slippery slope, there are 17 million social security contracts which will suddenly be ripe for litigation, and we don't want to open pandora's box.""

1. Where can I find your quote?  The official transcript of the hearing, on the Supreme Court's website, can be viewed [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2020/19-422_4gdj.pdf).  The quote that you provided is not in the transcript.  I would like to examine the context of your alleged quote so that I can assess whether it was made literally or sarcastically.  Even if there is a favorable quote from one Justice, it is probably prudent to balance against other quotes from the hearing.  For example, Justice Gorsuch said the ""\[shareholders'\] remedial ask is a big one and hard for us to swallow.""  (transcript p.88:14-16).  Justice Sotomayor said that ""it does seem counterintuitive, perhaps illogical...why \[shareholders\] should get anything more than a declaratory judgment"" about the removability the FHFA Director.  (transcript p.79:17-22).
2. Are you sure that the shareholders are even asking for a $100 billion to be returned?  I understand that the Federal Government gave Fannie/Freddie approximately $190 billion, and that Fannie/Freddie subsequently paid the Federal Government approximately $300 billion.  At first blush, it looks like Fannie/Freddie overpaid by more than $100 billion.  However, much of the apparent over-payment was actually interest that was due to the government.  In the hearing, shareholders' counsel states that the excess amount of money is actually $29.5 billion (transcript p.70:6-16).  Sure $29.5 billion is still a lot of money, but it is also a lot less than the $100 billion you reference.  In practical terms, a difference of $80+ billion could account for an additional 4-5 years of recapitalization before Fannie/Freddie get released from the conservatorship.  That timeframe could be considered a material amount of opportunity cost in the minds of some investors.  Moreover, knowing whether that $80+ billion is even on the table is critical to gauge the potential size/speed of the stock's price action.

Thanks in advance for any help.  I am hoping to lock down my own internal numbers before deciding how much to invest.  To that end, all information is appreciated."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Explaining Days-To-Cover for Apes This is a new account: I switched from my old account so I could make anonymous comments about Megan Markles feet and not get found out by my wifes bf (hi Chad).

**What Is Days To Cover?**

2021 has brought about lots of gains and losses , new investors, and new language to the game. One of these terms is ""Days-To-Cover"".

Days to cover is related to the short ratio as a measure of short interest in a stock. DTC is calculated by taking the quantity of shares that are currently sold short and dividing that amount by the stock's average daily trading volume. For example, if hedge fund 🌈🐻s have shorted 2 million shares of $TENDIES, and the average volume is 1 million, then days to cover is 2.0.

**So Who Cares? Why Is It So Important?**

DTC can serve as a signal on how bearish or bullish traders are about a company. A high days-to-cover ratio might be a signal that company performance is shit.

It also gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, 🌈🐻s have to buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Obviously they'll try to buy back the shares for the lowest price possible. But since they have created a higher demand for shares, this will drive up the price. Since the price is higher, they need to close out even more of their positon.... which drives the price higher, and so on.

Also, a high days-to-cover ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.

TL;DR: high days-to-cover = 🌈🐻s being assholes, more likely for $TENDIES going to the moon

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Another good, clean 🚀🌙 DD... Let's review some discussion and thoughts about our wives' newest bf... Mr. $CLNE Hello again WSB,

Are you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate (read: 100% normal) week of buying high and selling low? WELL, same here. Now that I'm awake from that Friday night bender (it's Sunday?), I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things....

1. TL;DR at the bottom, but I do hope you take a second to skim it
2. Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE
3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days
4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment

If you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.

^(Disclaimers:) 

^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. - 3. 1,000 shares at <$8.25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020.  - 4. Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)

# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31

* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE
* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)
* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)
* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)
* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**

""aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO"" - I know and I know. ""AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!"" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\],** ***consider the following...***

* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.
* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.
* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)
* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*

# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...

I'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.

* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.
* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day
* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.
* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**
* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.
* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**
* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.

# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...

I'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.

* The \[now famous\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.
* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.
* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.
* **🐄💨🚀** 🌙

TL;DR

Do I think this is a one-way ticket to \[the planet\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**

Thanks and take care.

I don’t disagree that EV is the future of the passenger vehicle, especially in the next 10-15 years. After that point other techs may penetrate the passenger vehicle space. However, I don’t think anything is going to quickly change trucking where weight is so critical and reliability of the trucks as well."

2021-06-07 03:49:52,wallstreetbets,"to better understand:

* **R**enewable **N**atural **G**as is the filtered and purified version of Biogas, that comes from digesters of manure and farming operations, wastewaters and landfill, alternatively called **Biomethane**.
* **C**ompressed **N**atural **G**as is made compressing natural gas to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure. Its volumetric energy density is estimated at 42% of that Liquefied Natural Gas and 25% of diesel fuel.
* **L**iquefied **N**atural **G**as like CNG, is a fuel that can be used in place of diesel, gasoline, etc. The main difference relies on the respective applications. LNG takes up 1/600 th the volume of Natural Gas in gaseous states, as it is cooled at -162° C (-260° F). Due to its higher logistic cost, LNG is perfect for the transportation of large quantities of gas in long distances and finds its application for heavy duty mobility (trucks and ships).

On the emission front, all natural gas fuels perform better than diesel or gasoline:

* **CO2 Emissions**: CNG/LNG engines emit around 20% less CO2 than comparable diesel vehicles; obviously, if RNG or RLNG is used in the process this figure can be even lower on a net emission basis.
* **SOx Emissions**: sulfur oxides are among the most important polluters in urban areas; being sulphur absent in the CNG / LNG compound, its emitted level is negligible, being 99% less than in a diesel engine. Sulphur is a problem for low-quality fuels in the maritime sector for example, with the IMO 2020 regulation being a step to its reduction;
* **NOx Emissions**: Natural gas engines emits 80% less nitrogen oxide than diesel. NOx gases are usually produced from the reaction among nitrogen and oxygen during the combustion of fuels. They can penetrate sensitive lung tissue and damage it, worsening respiratory and heart diseases. Three way catalytic converters coated with platinum or other precious metals are required to reduce NOx emission;
* **Particulate Emissions**: Natural Gas engines emits 95% less particulate than comparable diesel engines. The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in width. Like inches, meters, and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance. There are about 25,000 microns in an inch. The widths of the larger particles in the PM2.5 size range would be about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. The smaller particles are so small that several thousand of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.

Then you have two different types of engines:

* Spark ignition engines, whose performance if powered by CNG or LNG is worse that diesel equivalents (less torque power)
* Compressed ignition engines, dual fuel engines that use 10% diesel and 90% LNG, same torque power of diesel engines but with natural gas emissions. For now these are more expensive than SI ones

Amazon bought from CumminsWestport 700-1000 spark ignition ones, but west port separately sells Compressed ignition engines (main client now is VOLVO in Europe)"

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 6  Welcome back to another episode of ""Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?""  
After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please."

2021-06-06 21:38:15,wallstreetbets,Let’s go $BB
2021-06-06 22:16:09,wallstreetbets,BB stands for big balls. Bought 98 shares @ $10.10 but I’m holding till we’re on the moon
2021-06-06 21:04:34,wallstreetbets,"I bought bb options at 0.55 weeks ago and sold at 5.50 Friday lol, definitely making moves on bb while everyone on amc till it drops more"
2021-06-06 20:17:15,wallstreetbets,I bought more of what I could on Friday (and NOK too). Will be buying more again on the next dip. Not selling.
2021-06-06 21:24:34,wallstreetbets,Within 1 month? My contracts expiring this Friday say otherwise.

2021-06-06 23:09:44,wallstreetbets," >I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

I was one.  Not because I wasn't a believer in BB, but because I knew friday would be a down day. It jumped too much thursday morning and became obvious we'd see that correction.  Plus, I felt it would finish the week sub 15 because of the 6/4 call volume. 

This wasn't a short squeeze play for me.  I took profits at 16.5, got back in at 14.5 and took more profits again when it bumped.      I'm back in for the same amount of shares. 

I was bagholding from January at around 15.  I've averaged down to 11, and after realizing gains Thursday I feel more like I got in at 8 now.  

Friday stung I can't lie, but BB isn't a short term play, or squeeze play.  I see it climbing steady, and with that steadiness we'll see down days.  Especially after huge run ups due to hype."

2021-06-06 21:00:43,wallstreetbets,Hoping for a healthy dip Monday so I can sell some Put credit spreads for huge profits like I did last week. I'm overall bullish on BB so being able to get sweet spreads at a lower price will print.
2021-06-07 00:20:26,wallstreetbets,Should I invest 99 or 100% of my portfolio in this play?
2021-06-07 04:57:25,wallstreetbets,FOMO’d 6k at $18.50. Fucking retard this one is.

2021-06-06 20:17:43,wallstreetbets,well the hedges will usually try to push it down so you can set a bid around a support zone to try to keep us above it.  usually they try to force it down more on Thursday/Friday to avoid paying out calls
2021-06-06 23:57:21,wallstreetbets,"You can put an order in right now and it will be processed as soon as the market opens, just make sure you set a limit per share in case it opens way higher then you expected to pay."
2021-06-06 22:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Judging by current previous trends, it could either be down at open or go up in open and go down by 1 pm, and then be up at after hours. It could potentially moon again this Tuesday. Just a theory."
2021-06-06 21:07:07,wallstreetbets,"My only problem with BB is I can’t go to the local store and find out the guy selling BB’s is completely unaware of the stock activity but willing to sell me a membership, used controller and some weird deal on buying more than one Mario game.

I just didn’t expect AMC to jump so quickly🤦🏼‍♀️ all I could do last week was watch it go to 72 and I couldn’t sell because I had sold calls on all of my freaking shares.

2021-06-07 14:17:32,wallstreetbets,Is Janet Yellen?
2021-06-07 08:32:41,wallstreetbets,I started looking at doing this…
2021-06-07 08:11:31,wallstreetbets,Remind me in....
2021-06-07 10:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... practically any that explains the wheel.   


But the gist of this idea is that say you wrote a CC and at expiration it's ITM. Instead of rolling out like 6 months to get back to OTM for a small credit, you'll roll up ITM 30-45 days for the preferred credit while also getting the extra strikes. So say I sold a 50 strike CC and price goes to 55. On my roll I'd go 30 days and up to 52 strike and receive a credit. Eventually, in theory, you'll meet up with your strike again but keep your shares and make premium along the way."
2021-06-06 21:18:01,wallstreetbets,Very true because at the end of the day I did make a profit just not as much as I would have had I not sold the calls. Basically I missed out on about 5K more profit🤦🏼‍♀️ but yes I’m definitely excited to see what BB does this week! I bought 500 shares Friday and I think I already have 100 or 150 in another brokerage at 9.
2021-06-07 06:02:17,wallstreetbets,I love this
2021-06-07 07:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I keep hearing about this long-term/fundamental argument. Do you actually think that's true? Looking at the 10 year chart, the stock was rarely above 14 dollars.. I don't wanna be holding these bags for a decade :("

But $20-25 in a few years? For sure."

I had originally only sold two contracts and then I figured what the heck I’ll just sell the third out of the money because it can’t go up that much more this week LOL next day 100%🤣🤣 but I’m young and I feel like it’s good for me to learn on these things now because it’s just going to help me trade smarter moving forward. Last weeks gauntlet definitely made me understand options very clearly. Thinking about it now the education that I got last week is actually priceless. Thanks for the support guys!

The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was staffed full of PhDs and even had two Nobel Prize winners, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, in its ranks.

Warren Buffett even said that “If you take the 16 of them [in LTCM], they probably have the highest average IQ of any 16 people working together in one business in the country, including Microsoft or whoever you want to name – so incredible is the amount of intellect.”

LTCM opened its doors in February 1994.

The firm eventually went bust a few years later. One dollar invested in its fund became just 30 cents by September 1998."

2021-06-07 01:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Stocks with fantastic long-term returns can be agonizing to own over the short-term.

From 1995 to 2015, the US-listed Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) topped the charts – its shares produced a total return of 105,000%, turning every $1,000 into more than $1 million.

But Monster Beverage’s stock price had also dropped by 50% or more from a peak on four separate occasions. 

From 1997 to 2018, the peak-to-trough decline for Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) in each year ranged from 12.6% to 83.0%, meaning to say that Amazon’s stock price had experienced a double-digit peak-to-trough fall every year.

Over the same period, Amazon’s stock price climbed from US$1.96 to US$1,501.97, for an astonishing gain of over 76,000%.

Lesson: Volatility in the stock market is a feature, not a bug."

2021-06-06 22:12:20,wallstreetbets,"More than 3000 hedge funds have shut down since 2015.

The typical hedge fund charges 2% of assets under management as the admin fee, and 20% of profits. If they are able to generate 20% average return before fees on their accounts (most fall far short of this goal), then they will make 2% on the admin fee and 4% on the incentive fee – a total return for them of 6% with zero risk. 

So a hedge fund manager makes 6% on your money while taking zero risk. This 6% is 30% of the profits, so the hedge fund manager takes 0% of the risk and gets 30% of the profits while the investor takes 100% of the risk and makes 70% of the profits."

Yeah yeah other stocks have higher chance of being shorted. But they also have higher chance of becoming bags. High risk high reward. 

But with TLRY you get medium risk/high reward. It’s a meme stock so it still has the potential to run 30+% and it’s medium risk because 1 year projection from top analysts is literally $19.00. So if you happen to have TLRY bags, you are gonna be holding them for a lot less than all the other meme stocks. If you don’t believe, then just look at 1 year projections for all of the meme stocks"

His name is jack. Today I couldn’t find him and the employees said jack is sick, and is on antibiotics right now. He’s in a cage right now because they have to monitor how much food he’s eating.

I’m a little teary eyed while watching this, but I really hope jack gets better soon. I just wanted to tell someone.

2021-06-06 22:39:43,wallstreetbets,"Many investors dread stock market corrections and crashes, but there's no use hoping they won't happen -- because they will. They will vary in intensity and duration, but on average, the news isn't too bad. 

The folks at Capital Group studied stock market performance from 1950 through 2019, and found that pullbacks of 10% or more (often referred to as ""correction"") happened about once a year and lasted, on average, about 112 days. That's about three and a half months. Even recoveries lasting twice as long wouldn't be so terrible, lasting roughly seven months. 

Drops of 15% or more happened about once every four years and lasted, on average, about 262 days (roughly eight and a half months), while drops of 20% or more (""crashes"") happen about every six years and last an average of 401 days, or about a year and a month. 

These are just averages, and anything can happen at any time, but know that the stock market tends to recover from most big drops fairly quickly. Remember, too, that market drops can be wonderful opportunities for long-term investors."

2021-06-07 01:24:13,wallstreetbets,"Going against the herd can actually cause physical pain.

Psychology researchers Naomi Eisenberger, Matthew Lieberman, and Kipling Williams once conducted an experiment whereby participants played a computer game while their brains were scanned.

The participants were told they were playing the game with two other people when in fact the other two were computers.

The computers were programmed to exclude the human participant after a period of three-way play.

During the periods of exclusion, the brain scans of the human participants showed activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. These are the exact areas of our brain that are activated by real physical pain.

Investor James Montier recounted the experiment in his book The Little Book of Behavioral Investing and wrote: “Doing something different from the crowd is the investment equivalent of seeking out social pain.”

Lesson: Investing is not easy, especially when there’s a need to go against the crowd. Make plans to deal with the difficulties."

2021-06-06 21:13:34,wallstreetbets,"The meme circle of life:

1. Shorts go apeshit on a shitty company.  Think it's free money.  They pat themselves on the back, tell themselves Adam Smith would be proud for helping the market realize ""fundamentals"".

2. Some severe autists and genuine whales decide to fuck the greedy dumbass shorts for overplaying their hand and rally others.  Some tendies are made but autists need the FOMOtards.  Without them they can't truly cash out.

3. FOMOtards are slowly convinced to jump on, it becomes a full-fledged ""movement"".  People tell long life stories about how they're willing to eat ramen everyday and once HF's go under, justice in the universe is restored etc.  Shorts are getting asspounded daily at this point.
4. Eventually it becomes obvious the FOMOtards don't actually have an exit plan or idea what is really happening and eventually tard-ammo runs out.  There is confusion, sadness, anger.  While naked shorting and fuckery is real, they are greatly exaggerated into full-blown conspiracy theories involving a global market crash.  The finest copium in existence is spun on social media.

5. Shorts are skeptical of their ability to predict autists and FOMOtards after having been burned.  Many of them pull out.  But some smart ones know when ammo has run out.  They quietly enter.

6.  Stock steadily trends down despite rallies and ""recovery"" bounces.  Old and new shorts think it's finally safe.  ""Shit, we were right!  The dumbasses have finally given up!""  They jump back on, basically the reverse FOMOtards but on the way down.

7. Return to step 2."

2021-06-06 22:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Here's some serious advice - if you're holding blipto and you're extremely bullish that we're breaking upwards here, pull the fuck out

&#x200B;

Leverage your money and put half of it in derivatives of mining companies. Set the length of a trade you can lose

&#x200B;

ALGO/RIOT/MARA/MSTR calls will give you way more points for being bullish while others are currently fearful. If we are indeed bearish, you're taking similar risk for greater reward. Read the room, don't bother with spot right now unless you're long term holding. My 2 cents."

Purchased 100 shares of SENS  @ AROUND 2.70$, hopefully the FDA approval brings more good growth.

Looking into BNGO and might take a longer term position. Health technologies are going to be a good long term play in my ape opinion over the next few years. Especially anything with DNA sequencing and screening. Early detection of ailments will be so important to medicine as populations explode and stress on healthcare becomes more apparent.

And to appease my ape like qualities will be keeping a close eye on the big 3 meme stocks and get my foot back in on one for the coming few weeks.

Fairly new to all this but it's a thrill and thoroughly enjoying the chaos. I'm by no means a big money player but making a few dollars here and there definitely helps with the ever growing costs of life."

Dont forget to hold, all in. I say no no no no !guh if my calls start to bleed, i hate having to remind you all when you ask is my favorite stock ticker halted.

2021-06-07 01:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: AMC’s original projectors were powered by hamsters in little running wheels connected to the gears. When projectionists needed to switch out a reel, they would take the (now tired) hamster out of the wheel, snap its neck and throw it in a trash bin, then replace it with a fresh hamster. At the end of the day, they would bring the bin of used hamsters out back behind the theater and throw them out to the homeless people that gathered there each day at closing hoping to get a free snack. One of those homeless people was a newly arrived German immigrant named Claus Von Schittstaïn, who so loved the taste of fresh hamster on a slice of bread that he would go on (after years of saving) to found the first HämsterShäcken in 1942. The restaurant was a fast hit, and soon there were Hamster Shacks (after a name change in 1947) all over the continental U.S. Today, you can find Hamster Shacks in Tokyo and Moscow—just part of a global empire of restaurants serving millions of customers every day."

2021-06-06 23:40:09,wallstreetbets,Merger arbitrage short hedging involves shorting AMD and going long in Xilinx (in equal amounts). The problem with that theory is AMD's short interest is up to 85M shares short. Xilinx only has like 2M in trading volume per day. There is no way that there is a corresponding long position in Xilinx. AMD primed for mega squeeze 40%....

2021-06-06 22:03:44,wallstreetbets,It is highly shorted.  That seems to be a popular thing around here.

2021-06-06 20:14:46,wallstreetbets,I have this exact one done but for some reason the meme post wont pop up on this sub.
2021-06-07 10:54:24,wallstreetbets,"The original thesis for the $CLNE gamma squeeze was basically if it can get to $13 (which is achievable because of how low its volume is), then it can shoot up to $30~ as insiders would have to buy over 2.8 million shares.

WSB was worried the $CLNE play was starting to resemble price manipulation and collusion.

Unfortunately for them, the $CLNE squeeze is inevitable

They're trying to hide the fact that there are so many contracts at $13. And there is no other way for MMs/institutions to hedge those positions without buying up more shares. 

It's simple. $CLNE hits $13, $CLNE moons

2021-06-07 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,"https://fintel.io/ss/us/clne

Talking about the Volume here not the SI. If you scroll doen a bit more it's listed. On June 3rd 26 and June 4th 32%. Likely covered already but still interesting."

It's not manipulation if I like the stock.

2021-06-07 13:28:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm not super expert but know enough to make a bit of profit off of call (price goes up) options on occasion.  


Options means the money you 'invest' is not actually buying the stock, it's buying a contract that expires eventually.  This contract locks in the price you have the rights to buy the stock at.  No matter how much the actual stock price changes, you could hypothetically enact the option and get the stock at the contract price.  


Now almost no one retail actually buys the actual stock they have the contract for.  Instead the contract's value changes based on likely hood the stock price it has locked in is a good deal.  Part of this value is what they call ""theta"" and it stands for 'time left until the contract expires'.  


This is one of the major parts of the ""hard to fully grasp"" moving pieces behind options pricing."
2021-06-07 13:29:32,wallstreetbets,Dunno about where to look exactly but you'd want to look into theta decay and implied volatility for this example.
2021-06-07 14:25:19,wallstreetbets,"You have to remember with a call that the options value is based on the public perception that the stock will go up, preferably past your strike price. It's not based on the stocks current value as much as it is on the trend of that stocks value.

Looking at AMC for example, the trend of the stocks value was level or downward a month or so ago. So when people bought options with a July expiration and a strike price twice the stocks current price, the perception was that there was little chance that those options would ever be in the money. So people picked up options for next to nothing. Come to the beginning of June where the stock has shot up tenfold and that $15 call with a strike for 7/18 is already in the money and the stock is trending steeply upward. Because of this, even though the stock is trading at, say $50, I can sell my call for more than the difference (50-15=35) because even though that's all you can make off of it today, the stock could continue to rise and by July, it could have hit $300. So my option can be sold at a premium because it has the potential to be worth Tens of thousands. So I can sell my option a month and half for expiration for, say $45/share despite the immediate value of that option only being roughly $35. 

Now if it 7/17 and I'm holding an option for AMC $15c and the stock is currently at $54 and has been trending flst or down, I may only be able to get $34 for my option despite the stock being hire than in the previous example. This is because while the stock may go up, it will most likely stay flat or go down and since I only have 24 hours to work with, I'm not going to take a big risk on the chance that it goes up a bunch suddenly. 

For options, we are looking at the chance of the stock changing in the direction we want not as much what the stock actually hits. So for us, we'd rather rocket now and be ITM now with weeks or months left with an upward trend so that people think they can make money off of the options."

1/5 BB

1/5 AMC

1/5 GME

1/5 CLOV / TLRY / SNDL

1/5 WKHS / CLNE / MVIS

Diversify and cover all bases, this way you don't FOMO into other ones when you see one go up but not your ape. Personally I have over half my account in $BB as I believe in it the most but if you don't then you should do the strategy above. I have the rest spread over other squeezes"

There are 65.30M outstanding shares of GME and 536.63 M shares of AMC.  (8.21 as many shares)

2021-06-06 21:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Just a PSA: if you honestly think that the naked short positions are new, relevant, or a catalyst capable of sending AMC “to the moon” you are fundamentally misunderstanding the situation.

AMC has roughly 500M shares. The daily volume last week ranged from 300M to 700M. 

Even if there were 100M shares naked shorted, meaning shorted without the institution owning the share to short, the brokerage could easily cover this position if they had to without catapulting the price higher given the volume traded.

The fact is however, is that there certainly are not 100M naked shorts. No where close to it. And there will be 0 ramifications on those shorts when and if they decide to cover.

Edit: if you think I’m wrong tell me why."

2021-06-07 00:43:46,wallstreetbets,"The AMC war is bigger then ppl realize. It was the studios and streaming services against the theaters.

This was an actual battle for the future. Streaming vs. Theaters. Don't kid yourself. Artists vs. Suits. Amzn vs. AMC...  
  
Remember how much money the studios made during the writers guild strike? When they discovered ""Survivor"" and reality TV? This is bigger. If they can just get ppl to forget ""dinner and a movie"". How awesome seeing a great movie in a theater is. Like a mini trip to Disneyland. The pandemic almost pushed it over the edge. They almost won.  
  
AMC refused to show Universal Pictures anymore....If they didn't give more days for ppl to see new releases in theaters. Universal Pictures caved. Disney tried the same thing. New streaming...more revenue. Except it didn't exactly work out. Now Disney is coming back to theaters.  
  
The beginning of the end.

2021-06-07 04:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Serious question. When a stock trades on multiple markets, do they always reach parity? For example, people are saying that BB in Germany is up 4% but PM just opened in US and BB is only up 0.5% at the moment. Shouldn't it have opened up at 4% or whatever is equal to Germany's market?

It was going up as I type this and now just at 4%, lol, but my question stands. I guess what I'm really asking is, is this an arbitrage opportunity? Should I have jumped all over it when it was still under 4% because it's guaranteed to catch up to Germany? Or is it not a guarantee? And if not, then how could you have the same stock at different prices in different markets? How does that even work?"

2021-06-07 02:14:23,wallstreetbets,Because we started seeing bb spam posted on reddit the day AMC hit it's all time high.  People think it's a tactic to derail AMC's momentum.   tricking people to put $ into something else that has no chance to rocket.  I'm a believer in that theory.
2021-06-07 02:05:59,wallstreetbets,"im not a bot. i like the stock, simply."

2021-06-07 11:08:22,wallstreetbets,Gang.
2021-06-06 20:52:09,wallstreetbets,There is an old adage that BB holders work hard all of their lives so they can raise children who will one day hold AMC just so their future children can hold GME. And then their children can become philosophers or apes or whatever.
2021-06-06 20:19:59,wallstreetbets,"If you're poor like me, fractional shares are your friend! Gave me the tendies to bounce into AMC, which in turn grew into enough for more varied plays before the downturn. Sometimes you need to make retarded plays to make epic gains."
2021-06-06 20:18:58,wallstreetbets,THIS!!! 100%!!
2021-06-06 20:40:07,wallstreetbets,"When AMC was first brought to the table the only reason it was a good play was the second high short intrest, the stock is cheap, and covid is ending and people want to see movies.

Why would you want to go from 8 dollars to 59 when you can go from 250 to ♾️ with Gme?"
2021-06-06 20:45:16,wallstreetbets,what long position do you mean? the 754k shares?
2021-06-07 08:03:51,wallstreetbets,Fingers crossed for that!
2021-06-07 10:23:02,wallstreetbets,And BB.
2021-06-06 20:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Bought BB at $12

Bought GME at $108

Bought AMC at $15

These bags must be filled with helium or something cause they don't weigh a thing!"
2021-06-07 02:53:05,wallstreetbets,Its like literally 200 shares every 2 minutes.
2021-06-07 03:00:51,wallstreetbets,Some bots are downvoting all the posts.
2021-06-07 01:35:16,wallstreetbets,I like amc yolo away brother!
2021-06-07 01:21:32,wallstreetbets,Wait? You're asking for financial advice on what to do with 250k on wsb? More power to you!!! For what it's worth. I went all in on BB.
2021-06-07 01:27:57,wallstreetbets,I too have that much in BB
2021-06-07 01:23:16,wallstreetbets,"There are 30,000 800c expiring 6/18... put some in that."

2021-06-07 02:12:56,wallstreetbets,Your yolo is my life goal 🥲 lmao
2021-06-07 01:51:18,wallstreetbets,"To me it looks like GME is the true play and the other stocks are side effects of it. Look at the similar trends and, more importantly, the % gains. Do your own research though"
2021-06-07 01:51:26,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-07 01:42:59,wallstreetbets,"BB let's go     
AMC too risky imo"

2021-06-07 06:07:50,wallstreetbets,"That’s the life, I got in the same as you but half the shares, so I’ll have half the BB juice"
2021-06-07 06:10:16,wallstreetbets,Seems like you added a few degrees there. Guess all the heat is getting pushed in those booster rockets!
2021-06-07 00:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Calls got more expensive for GME and AMC and this is an options sub.  

They are easily distracted by cheapness"
2021-06-07 00:33:12,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, THIS!"
2021-06-06 22:20:43,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry we’ll rip in the am fellow ape. I’m right there with ya

GME is not for the working class the Tendies are too high to reach we acumilate and progress ! 

BB is my play for now ! Holding AMC after taking some sweet succulent Tendies !"
2021-06-07 00:50:08,wallstreetbets,Literally nothing but your order may not be filled bc of high volatility. Maybe make a limit order during pre market in order to make sure you actually can buy the stock
2021-06-07 00:50:54,wallstreetbets,Well if you move your hands away for your face then you would smell future millionaires.
2021-06-07 00:54:39,wallstreetbets,👆

2021-06-07 05:57:45,wallstreetbets,LOL do you live in real life?
2021-06-06 20:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Gme has way more shorted shares, and a smaller float."
2021-06-07 02:54:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-07 00:53:44,wallstreetbets,People taking profits before the weekend. Pretty typical
2021-06-07 00:52:35,wallstreetbets,"When the last meme stock frenzy happened every friday was a shit day, its when the weekly options expire so if the prices get pushed low on fridays those who wrote the weekly calls can save a ton of money by pushing the stock under strikes on fridays."

2021-06-06 21:12:57,wallstreetbets,"No that’s true. GME has far greater squeeze potential, AMC has almost 0"
2021-06-06 23:16:21,wallstreetbets,Good info
2021-06-06 22:27:08,wallstreetbets,Very much a tie between GME and BB. AMC isn’t anywhere on the same stratosphere as either of these companies in terms of a long term hold.
2021-06-07 03:49:57,wallstreetbets,chill they have no volume there

2021-06-06 21:12:21,wallstreetbets,Now do GME.
2021-06-06 21:17:10,wallstreetbets,They *could* cover it. But they’re not.
2021-06-06 21:24:10,wallstreetbets,Can you explain the reason for AMC price rising 200% in 2 weeks please?
2021-06-06 21:15:25,wallstreetbets,Please do BB
2021-06-06 21:16:10,wallstreetbets,Because it's held at $200+ for about a month. And keeps coming into news cycles.
2021-06-06 21:30:54,wallstreetbets,The name
2021-06-06 21:30:38,wallstreetbets,"It uses totally different letters, very bullish!"
2021-06-07 00:25:55,wallstreetbets,"I bought 1000$ BB last week at 16.80 down almost 100$ buying 2000$ BB tomorrow morning.

Gonna be a crazy week"
2021-06-06 20:33:04,wallstreetbets,I would buy the dips and hold. It is going to go up long term with all the cyber security and EV work they are getting. It might even go up short term with all the interest.
2021-06-06 23:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Fuuuuuck that.  No fucking way I'm selling GME now.

I do also have BB, also, but you must not be paying attention if you think anyone is ditching GME this week."
2021-06-06 23:42:03,wallstreetbets,Shiiiiit I wish… I got 1 share in at $350 then it was never the same. 🤡🤡🤡🤡
2021-06-06 23:38:45,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. BB bag holder much? You're an idiot if u think I'll sell gme at this time. DIAMOND FUCKING DEATH HANDS.

Everything else is a distraction."

2021-06-06 23:35:50,wallstreetbets,Amc is over. Execs are bailing. GMC and bb are stonks with holding power. You’re a dumb ass if you don’t see the value in these two

2021-06-07 11:08:09,wallstreetbets,should have kept my shares.. bought when was $4 a share :(((
2021-06-07 13:57:32,wallstreetbets,Nah its not all bots not even close. The stock is popular because the company actually does something useful and it's undervalued
2021-06-07 14:24:04,wallstreetbets,"That's fearmongering. There might be bots, but BB is actually a good buy"
2021-06-07 16:40:03,wallstreetbets,"u must be new  
BB always been here"
2021-06-07 00:42:11,wallstreetbets,I’m ain’t no bot lol I’m a BBrotha
2021-06-07 00:55:15,wallstreetbets,I like BB and I’m not a bot..
2021-06-07 00:54:14,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry but BB has always been a thing here. And the last thing any hedge wants is any of these things to move cause if one moves THEY ALL MOVE.
2021-06-07 00:54:59,wallstreetbets,"Not bots man, BB has a solid cybersecurity product... I am honestly not sure why it got grouped into the memestocks but I won't complain about free exposure."
2021-06-07 01:04:17,wallstreetbets,We never said that. Most of us will be happy to see bb at 50 to 60. We just want to be financially free.
2021-06-07 01:04:33,wallstreetbets,"Don’t feel bad, money is money and we all want our share. It’s up to each investor to tap out when they’re ready."
2021-06-07 01:04:29,wallstreetbets,Oh no we will only get a 100 a share
2021-06-07 01:04:10,wallstreetbets,"He's right, you know"
2021-06-06 20:04:12,wallstreetbets,Open your eyes BBaby
2021-06-06 20:28:48,wallstreetbets,BB is still affordable and will go up this year. I like GME as well but it is too expensive so I continue to hold what I have. I am hoping BB breaks out. They have so much potential with their cyber security and EV contracts. I think they will trend up through 2021 and 2022 and beyond.
2021-06-06 20:25:55,wallstreetbets,"BB, meme aside, is actually a solid company. It is the way."
2021-06-06 20:13:10,wallstreetbets,BB is a great long play.
2021-06-07 19:00:43,wallstreetbets,been holding since jan yea i noticed ha

2021-06-06 21:45:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeeeeeah, BB is still gonna squeeze with AMC. Their candles on the chart are similar. Even the 30 min candles look like BB is due to squeeze according to MACD, RSI and KDJ lines."
2021-06-06 21:41:24,wallstreetbets,You don’t need a short squeeze when everyone on the planet buys calls in it…

2021-06-06 21:15:06,wallstreetbets,GME actually does have potential. And the fundamentals of GME are far better.
2021-06-06 21:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Of course they’re not. They made an absolute killing last week shorting at $60 and covering lower if they wanted.

Every dip this sees is just as much an opportunity to move their basis higher on their shorts as it is for you/this sub to move your basis lower.

Do you seriously think that they wouldn’t play this volatility to move their basis in the exact same way you/this sub does? This is literally their profession. 

They’re making money on the up, and the down. The only people losing are those buying in at extremely elevated levels (like $60) and praying they don’t get caught with the bag."
2021-06-06 21:29:45,wallstreetbets,"The exact squeeze you think was going to happen + attention and hype. The move happened. 

In fact it happened in a very similar way to GME. This sub/those involved, have a rough coordinated buying power of approximately 35B according to both squeezes. We have not really proven our capacity to go further and the HFs are very well aware of that fact.

To launch to to $100 you’d have to get the same coordination as last Wednesday and then add 10B in capital. 

I won’t say it’s impossible, but it has nothing to do with naked shorts."
2021-06-06 21:34:40,wallstreetbets,"BB is a long. There’s more chance of a squeeze than AMC, but if you don’t play it perfectly be prepared to carry your bags for the next 3-10 years."
2021-06-06 20:35:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s literally not true lmfao. Citadel is long AMC, shorts covered and re upped at higher levels."
2021-06-06 23:39:23,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t say there was no value in BB, but we haven’t seen a squeeze, just FOMO at this point!"

2021-06-06 21:24:15,wallstreetbets,"Volume, Market Cap, and Shares outstanding.

Let’s say the 10M people on this subreddit all owned every share of AMC. All 500M. Then bid the price up to trigger margin calls, and force the shorts to cover. You’d have to drive AMC to a 70B cap to do so, with enough volume between the people on this sub. 

Then and only then, after crossing a 70B cap, every single individual would have to hold. In a coordinated effort. The moment 20% of the people who hold all the shares cave, the squeeze ends, and the 80% get absolutely annihilated.

Do you really think that the greedy retards on this sub will band together, hold, and then let 1/5 make millions while the remaining 4/5 get absolutely destroyed?

No way. 0 chance. There are far too many assumptions that have to go right, the biggest being the illusion that this sub has the capital to command control of 500M shares."

2021-06-06 21:30:20,wallstreetbets,"I think I understand, you’re saying that high volume means that people aren’t holding as it implies shares being exchanged hands more frequently and because even though short float as a percentage is close, the overall market cap of AMC is substantially higher, requiring more total money being poured into AMC to be able to trigger something like GME.

Is that correct?"
2021-06-06 21:39:39,wallstreetbets,No you’re exactly right the early money made a killing. But everyone jumping now is playing directly into “Greater Fool Theory”
2021-06-06 21:42:06,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps they got called and covered.

Or they, like I said, shorted higher say $65. And covered lower, say $45. And moved their basis at $5 to $25.

2021-06-06 20:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Of course. You sound young to the game so just this. Look. If you own shares of meme stocks on money that you, no bullshit I mean it, really won't have anxiety over watching it go down you'll be good. 

I say that because some people are over extended into these things and may not need the money right now at this second, but they're going to need it... 

Others have money it that say yeah, money is nice and obviously the more the better, but this cash is just sitting in savings, my emergency fund is good, and I have no expenses coming up fuck it let's see what happens... They do fine because they actually hold. 

The second you sell it's over. 

If you buy 1000 shares for 10 that's 10,000. Say it goes right down to 5, you panic and sell... But wait! It turns around quickly and comes right back up to 7.5 and has no plans of stopping... Well because you sold for 10 minutes you can now only get back in with 500 shares and not have that original 1000. 

So you lost 5,000. Say it goes back up to that original 10. Because you sold quick at 5, and got back in at 5 immediately, you only go back up 2,500 on 500 shares instead of 5,000 on 1000 shares.  

TL:DR - Buy, hold, do not sell until you see some nice gains. 

You've seen my post.. With my fuck it money moving forward right now I'm just buying up batches of shares of various meme stocks in equal amounts with high SI and waiting. All it takes is one to pop off and I'll be good. If they just all somehow crash (unlikely) it's fuck it money, so, fuck it."

It could, but you gotta ask, where is that $20B gonna come from? Who’s going to buy it from them at $40B so they can make a profit? And who’s gonna buy that for 80B? Where does it end?

Growth>value, but what if you found something that had both in abundance. 

Maybe I'll eat my words or maybe in 18months anyone that didn't buy now will be sad they missed out, or maybe we will hit inflation so bad that we will all be trading GME shares for loaves of bread. The future is never certain. 

My point is if you want something that will go from $23 to $500 in a week you're looking in the wrong spot. If you want a nice solid play that might go from $23 to $40-50 in two years while paying dividends with the upside of memeness then welcome to the club.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cannabis Stocks I’m excited for the community and what it’s bringing to my life. I want to contribute and hopefully begin a useful discussion.

Currently Tilray and Sundial are big “meme” stocks. There are many other cannabis companies and some making huge moves with huge profits even through COVID. I’m paying attention to management and the decisions their making with cash flow and how they’re looking to expand.

I’ve got a list of stocks I’m following in the cannabis sector and they are not Tilray or Sundial. I do not believe they have the strong foothold needed for a strong investment. I would also like to support a U.S. based company that has yet to run the distance. Canada is completely legal so the market has been established for a few years now.

If we’re looking for a boom it’s going to be here in the U.S. and I want to support our economy. 

I’d like to get some thought provoking conversation on the matter. Please don’t just regurgitate Tilray and Sundial. 

UPDATES: 

Some formidable companies I’m following: 
HEXO, AYRWF, IIPR, CGC, CURLF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CRLBF, PLNHF, OGI

The main ticker I was interested in is Planet 13, Vegas based business that’s almost like an amusement park. Picked up their profits throughout COVID and management changed up their revenue stream when in-person sales stopped. They’re opening a new facility in Anaheim, CA this summer. Looking forward to their move the most. 

[Planet 13 - Financial Results and Business Overview May 2021](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/planet-13-continues-string-record-103000568.html) 

[Forbes: Curaleaf CEO wants to become the “Frito-Lay” of cannabis.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2020/11/27/inside-curaleaf-billionaire-boris-jordans-hunger-to-become-the-frito-lay-of-cannabis/amp/) 

Based on the current discussion Curaleaf is a hot topic. Planet 13 is one in really interested in. 

HEXO, Tilray, Cresco and High Tide have also been mentioned quite a bit. Tilray  I know is being backed by retail right now. They are now close to Canopy’s (CGC) market cap by around $1billion. 
[Tilray Investment Update](https://www.investors.com/research/tilray-stock-buy-now/) 

Canopy is probably the closest competitor to Tilray now. I do however want to point out that we’re still looking at Canadian companies right now.

2021-06-06 20:43:25,wallstreetbets,"CL / CRLBF

Cresco is the play - Balls deep on 9000 shares - YOLO

They are making the right moves and just swapped over to GAAP accounting to align themselves with the US equities market (Nasdaq).

Their M&A is proper, they are clearly trying to fill the higher-end of the spectrum, rather than be a complete trash factory. C level is organized more like a tech company, in a good way - If that makes sense.

MOST OF ALL - They are an MSO that exclusively operates in the USA, so when Safe Banking happens, or Federal Legalization, they will actually get the true benefits. Not ancillary bumps like Tilray and others who predominantly operate in Canada.

And a large chunk of their original funding came from  Wall Street money… So, they will be someone’s golden child in the stock market when the laws soften."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD) **Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

https://preview.redd.it/9afneo9olo371.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981

&#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

https://preview.redd.it/t4j169dplo371.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44f4e56483385721f4b034c285d513246c51d20

&#x200B;

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

https://preview.redd.it/b89k1msqlo371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f05df9cad06d0d473366ad04eb8028470c3942

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

https://preview.redd.it/fvj0s8cslo371.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b011e630db50b7008e6f2006b9444e369f69362c

&#x200B;

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

https://preview.redd.it/zr2ys39tlo371.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d6d1654276df35b2cc1759ff4b8c812b2797db

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

https://preview.redd.it/r6qdc7kulo371.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0

&#x200B;

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans."

2021-06-06 20:07:28,wallstreetbets,"You failed to mention Clovers board of directors, and primarily Demetrios L. Kouzoukas, the previous director of the Center for Medicare. These political appointees go in with an agenda and set themselves up for lucrative positions after. There is no mistake that Demetrios decided to align with this company. The amount of pull and insider connections he established will serve him and this company well."

2021-06-06 21:51:53,wallstreetbets,"The thing is that this DD is not objective. I am a clover investor from the beginning of IPOC. Do I  know clover is not yet profitable and it will take years to get profits? Yes. Is clover like any other health care provider? Not at all. The clover Assistant is much more disruptive as they want to make us think. Read another comment I wrote on this chat and you will understand why. Andrew Toy is a former executive from Google and the Clover Assistant is far more advanced than anything similar in any other company. So, is clover health a risky investment talking about fundamentals? Yes, but they have 700 million USD to develop their disruptive business model and if they play well their cards they will be a major Medicare provider with an intrinsic value 20 bigger than the current valuation. Also don't forget the short Squeeze potential. Why is so shorted? I don't know for sure. Some people says it's a personal attack to Chamath because he supported the apes on GME Squeeze...my theory is different. Healthcare companies have been some of the most profitable businesses during last decades and now a company is trying to offer cheaper and better health care. If clover succeeded they will have to decrease their prices and it will means lower profits for them, so, healthcare companies with the help of the hedge fund that are some of their biggest investors are trying to kill clover before it becomes too big to fight against it. This last words are just my theory, not a fact like the rest of the things I said. Clov to the moon or die trying"
2021-06-06 22:58:18,wallstreetbets,"What legal problems? The non existent lawsuit firms that are against clover? I checked a few of them and their adresses where fake. 1 of them was a beauty saloon, hahaha. 
Or you are talking about the SEC investigation that was triggered by the false Hindenturd report? I am not worried about it. Almost sure it will be close soon with no consequence because everything was fake. If not, did you read what are they investigating? Mainly the not disclosure of the DOJ inquiry of data (supposedly it is routine for any Medicare provider and that's the reason they didn't disclose it on the SPAC merger). If somebody did anything wrong then they (mainly Chamath) will pay the consequences, not the company."
2021-06-06 21:40:49,wallstreetbets,CLOV to the moon bitch 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-06 23:22:11,wallstreetbets,Also more importantly the OP's analysis is mostly from a long-term point of view. People doing the short-squeeze strategy aren't going to be in CLOV for years and years. Our community here really benefits IMMENSELY by being able to push a shit ton of capital at a specific stock to squeeze out the shorts. The reality is CLOV has very strong fundamentals for a short squeeze.
2021-06-06 21:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Also said some lies. 1 example? 
You said most health care companies have AI programs. That's not true and demonstrates that you just copy paste the DD that your boss in the Hedge fund you work told you. If anyone want to check what I am going  to say it's pretty easy.
Most of the health care providers have programs that use the big data to improve the cost per customer. This just mean they know all the data they need to ask you more money or reject you as costumer if you have high risk of suffering some illness that makes them spend more than they get. It's not AI, it's not machine learning, it's just big data and they use to profit more, not to improve and personalize the customer health  care. You can check that in most of the healthcare companies the big data program are just use as data base by the doctors and the goal is be useful to the accountant of the company not to the patient. Clover Assistant goal is to learn from every customer to improve the service by giving useful information and advice to the doctor and get lower medical expenses by preventing unnecessary test and treatment, or preventing that people develop chronic illnesses that makes the company spend a lot of money every year. Of course, machine learning needs to collect data during some years to improve the outcome and now Clover Assistant is far from be perfect, but they are on the good way, a different one. I know a little bit about this because I am engineer and both of my parents are doctors (my father have been teacher at the university)."
2021-06-06 22:21:17,wallstreetbets,CLOV to the moon. 🍀🦍🚀🌕
2021-06-06 21:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Walgreens also made a partnership with clover to check the health of the patient on the pharmacy every time they want and the data will be sent to clover Assistant on real time. If the program detects some unusual data it will trigger a response and notify to the patient that he have to call his doctor or go to an hospital. None of the big data program of any company are close to this. They just store and organise data, don't process or evaluate it."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WDC Western Digital is being driven up by Chia and earnings prospects $WDC has good growth prospects due to a surge in HDD demand, and good earnings prospects.

Chia uses spare storage space on hard drives to verify transactions. This is considered to be the 'green' alternative to ASIC and GPUs. 

- Increased HDD demand:

Chia has gone up massively in recent months, driving a rush to purchase hard drives in order to mine it. As such, there have been hard drive shortages recently due to the increased demand. Much like GPU and semi-conductor stocks, we can expect good price action (and have already seen it) for hard drive manufacturer stocks. 

' ""In recent weeks the demand and pricing for high capacity [hard disk drives, or HDDs] has seen a material step higher ... and enterprise [solid state drive, or SSD] prices have also moved higher,"" analysts at Bank of America wrote in a Thursday report. The ""primary upside driver"" for that rising demand, according to BofA: chia. '

Western Digital is a market leader in the production of HDD's, producing some of the highest quality hard drives that have the best life expectancy, and a good warranty. As Chia transactions are very taxing on HDD's, buyers will be looking for the most durable hard drives. Which is why I am focusing my attention on Western Digital versus another stock such as Seagate. Western Digital is probably the best known manufacturer of hard drives, and usually a top choice for consumers. 

- Earnings:

Western Digital is also an attractive pick due to it's earnings outlook. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. The growing optimism on earnings prospects are driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price.

Earnings estimates for the next quarter and full year are increasingly being driven higher and higher. The company is likely to earn $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a change of +18.7%. Two estimates have moved higher in the past 30 days. For the full year, the company is expected to earn $3.83 per share, +25.99% over last year.  


The stock has gained more than 12% over the past four weeks. As earnings growth and the Chia frenzy are both likely to drive the stock higher -  in my opinion, it is a good buy, and I have added it to my portfolio."
2021-06-06 21:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Chia absolutely shreds hard drives. If you're invested in a company that makes them, then that's probably a good thing."

2021-06-07 00:31:37,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-06 23:43:27,wallstreetbets,"It would shred hard drives if you plot the chia on hard drives, but everyone’s doing it on SSDs because it’s faster. HDDs are flying off the shelves because that’s where the plotted chia is stored. Create on an SSD, store on an HDD. It’s literally what HDDs are for: reliable long term storage. They’re not being shredded.

Even SSDs that are plotting Chia day-in day-out will last at least a couple years, and that would generate enough chia to warrant the purchase of many, many additional HDDs.

Perhaps it’s pedantic because you meant SSDs instead of HDDs, but no, HDDs are not being shredded. Thought it warranted correction. (But the assumption is correct that many HDDs will be sold for the sole purpose of chia, stonk go up)"

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How has the Reddit effect impacted cannabis stocks? On Tuesday 9th February, a user who claimed to make over 500,000 USD in earnings from the famous cannabis stocks Tilray and Aphrra boosted told the forum’s 8.8 million members that they still had a lot more room to rise. 


His post quickly started trending and today has around 13000 upvotes and 1200 comments.


Tilray has been in the news quite a lot lately. The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r/wallstreetbets.


Since December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray’s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth’s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.


Since Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.


On the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray’s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.


Hedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray’s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). 


Nonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. 


The only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?

2021-06-07 08:51:04,wallstreetbets,"buying put = you want the underlying stock to go down

buying call = you want the underlying stock to go up

selling put  = you want the underlying stock to go up. if it doesn't, you end up having buy in the shares (it's also a good way to buy shares actually, imo)

selling call = you want the underlying stock to go down (if it doesn't, you'll end up having to fork over the shares, or the cost difference of the shares)

&#x200B;

selling a naked call can incur infinite losses at 100x the rate of shorting 1 share (lulz)

naked call = selling a call without owning any underlying shares.

covered call = selling a call while owning underlying shares.

it's kinda confusing, took me forever to undertsand, and I still don't understand that well, and generally whenever i touch options, I loose money."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

Nobody listen to this fellow. Straight head up his ass."
2021-06-06 21:29:45,wallstreetbets,"You’re a retard. It clearly stated that when UWMC went public as a spac versus the traditional IPO that was the reason it wasn’t included last quarter. A lot of people at first thought it was because of the voting shares not being calculated properly. This time around, it is because of the voting shares not being calculated properly on behalf of Russell. The fuck are you on?"
2021-06-06 21:28:24,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing this silliness.

Buyback is only in public float so yes, retiring the shares lowers the % of public float."
2021-06-06 21:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Your wife, little man. I’m on your wife."
2021-06-06 21:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but it doesn’t reduce the voting value of the public float as the shares are retired. (Removed completely from the total outstanding shares of the company). 

So, if 10% of the shares of the company are public. And 2% are bought back but then retired. The public float is not 8% of the total outstanding shares, it’s still 10% of the outstanding shares as the 2% that was bought back in my example were retired and removed completely from the total outstanding shares of the company.

Unless I’m missing something here, this is how I see it."
2021-06-06 21:38:22,wallstreetbets,You’re a retard.
2021-06-07 03:17:25,wallstreetbets,"your broker may have s.t like https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending.  I think other brokers don't give you the option

Note you can't vote shares unless you recall them like the GME peeps were doing recently"
2021-06-06 21:57:13,wallstreetbets,"No, you *are* missing something, this is exactly what you're getting wrong.

Calculate ratios with 100 shares, 10 of them in public float, and then 2 from public float are bought back and retired."
2021-06-06 23:03:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, now that would equate to 8 shares that are public and only 90 shares not public. It wouldn’t be 92 shares, the 2 shares that were bought back would be “retired” and completely removed from the out standing shares. So, now the outstanding shares are 98 total. 8 shares public and 90 shares not public. Equaling 8.88% as public float.

I don’t know why I’ve seen quite a few state it didn’t effect the float percentage, I was always questioning that. So, I can assume from the example above this confirms it."
2021-06-07 07:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Now you've got it.

>I don’t know why I’ve seen quite a few state it didn’t effect the float percentage

Think about this as you go through WSB. This is easy math, literally fractions. And yet all over this place: ""bro, it doesn't affect float, they are retired bro!"". 

Couple people state that flawed logic and then posters repeat it to the point it even got you.

This place is full of easy mistakes like this and everyone echo chambering them."
2021-06-07 07:22:37,wallstreetbets,I’m with you bro because the moment they informed of buy backs immediately I was like well the Russell is no longer possible if the buy back more to the point it reduces the float to less then 5% and it was flooded with people advising the opposite and I knew they were wrong but it had me thinking I was missing something 😂. Thanks for helping out and confirming this for me.
2021-06-07 07:36:46,wallstreetbets,"Last thing, the Russell criteria is based on voting and not strictly float. I believe the float would already have been too small.

You'd have to get the details and factor that in to know how the buyback will truly affect eligibility... I haven't because UM already indicated they believe they are currently eligible and so it won't matter for a while.. possibly longer than I'll hold this stock."

2021-06-06 20:29:23,wallstreetbets,"Real answer?

It's not talked about as much because (presumably) it isn't as exciting as other stocks anymore. But a lot of people here have formed an identity around it and won't accept that chatter has organically drifted off to other stocks, and so they're trying to push the idea that we're doing it.

Of course, if we wanted to do that then it would be a lot easier to set up automod to delete all mentions of it, or to delete this comment chain rather than give you a written out explanation."
2021-06-07 10:41:52,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with the float? 5.7 billion shares out there to trade vs < 100m for GME. You need to get 50x the number of people interested in it as were into GameStop to make a moonshot.
