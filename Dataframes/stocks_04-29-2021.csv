2021-04-29 19:10:46,stocks,Nuveen has a pretty comprehensive farmland portfolio and it is considered their sort of crown jewel of their investment offerings to institutional clients. I personally no little to nothing about farmland but that could be a good starting place to read up on their strategies and the trends they’ve observed in the sector!
2021-04-29 19:14:55,stocks,"Gladstone Land is an excellent company and one of the Gladstone Family of stocks (including GAIN, GOOD, & GLAD). They manage over 120 farms across the US in different regions so one bad storm won’t ever crush their bottom line. LAND pays a decent monthly dividend and continues to acquire more land each year. Definitely a solid REIT play that gives you exposure to farmland (which is becoming scarcer by the minute).

Disclosure: I have a position in LAND."

2021-04-29 19:26:44,stocks,Amazon is a pretty safe investment as far as individual stocks go. Unless you have a reinvestment plan that your DD shows strong growth and little risk I wouldn’t bother selling. Maybe slowly add more funds to invest in other sectors (if you have it to spare) and that may take care of the itch to sell.

2021-04-29 19:55:57,stocks,"I’m a flooring contractor that is currently doing the tile, resilient and carpet install at an Amazon distribution facility in Texas.  A very prominent tile manufacturer is spec’d for all the ceramic tile nationally on Amazon projects.  Needless to say, our PO for tile on this project was quite large.  

I asked my tile rep if I should reserve and dock hold all the tile for the project given the large quantity of material we were needing.

He advised that was not necessary because they had “millions of square feet of this tile set aside for Amazon projects.”

Three weeks ago I submitted an order for the final balance of tile I need to complete the project.

I was told there is a national shortage on the tile specifications for Amazon projects due to the massive and unprecedented influx of material orders that have outpaced the manufacturers forecasting.  Apparently Amazon has either not been forthcoming with its proposed construction schedule or Amazon has expanded its growth rate beyond previously disclosed levels.  Regardless of reason (I think both are true), Amazon is unilaterally cratering the largest tile manufacturer in the worlds insane tile production capabilities.  There are literally millions of square feet of tile being made as fast as possible to accommodate Amazons facility expansion needs.

Calls on Amazon."

2021-04-29 16:36:01,stocks,"AMZN is my largest holding and I really believe in AWS, but I've almost completely stopped buying from the actual Amazon website.

It's turned into a cesspool of cheap knockoffs, paid fake reviews or fly by night overseas companies. Most of the product photos are extremely bad photoshops of the supposed product placed in weird settings. 

Trying to find legitimate products with actual ratings that haven't been messed with is almost impossible.

It's sad because I used to buy pretty regularly from Amazon and always had good quality products.  Now it's just a gamble on if what you're buying is even remotely what's advertised.  

Hopefully they have some way of getting this stuff under control."
2021-04-29 17:56:47,stocks,"Honestly believe Amazon domination will continue, and I have known for a long time in my heart that I would put the majority of my money in Amazon if I could.  That being said, it's so hard as an early investor to even look at something as expensive per share as Amazon.  It's half my house down payment to buy 1 share. So before I manage to scrape together enough money to buy 1 share I'm tempted to spend my money on any number of less expensive stocks"

2021-04-29 16:42:57,stocks,"Honestly not splitting at $3K+ is just leaving money on the table. There's a lot of retail investors in particular who skip Amazon and similarly high-priced stocks for that reason *alone*.   

And, no, fractional aren't a ""solution"":     

 - Not supported by several large brokers and for every symbol even then.    
 - Several popular brokers only allow **market** orders (ick) not limit or stop-limit for fractional.    
 - Splits (ironically) often cause your fractional shares to be liquidated (or re-balanced, with potential market movement losses).     
 - No voting rights.   
 - Covered calls require 347K worth of stock.    

The only upside I know of for a high share price is centralizing most voting/ownership with institutionalized investors (which can be argued both ways, since their buy/sells are often mechanical, which can help or harm a company depending on what the aglo spits out). 

Disclaimer: I own non-fractional Amazon stock."

2021-04-29 19:54:53,stocks,"While the split does have reasonable chances of shooting the stock price up, it will also take the p/e ratio up. Amazon pe is already at 87!

2021-04-29 18:12:38,stocks,"Technically you should be thanking Andy Jassy, not ""papa"" (ewwww) Bezos.  

Word is Bezos has been disengaged from the strategy and execution of Amazon for many years now.  I don't blame him.  I'll retire from society if I can hit 8 figures, so I truly don't understand why any mega billionaire would waste their remaining finite earth minutes doing board meetings, media interviews, and congressional hearings.  

Anyway, the belief is that most of the strongest strategy and operational game changers of the last decade are so were driven behind the scenes by Jassy.  When he was announced as the replacement for Bezos, I decided that day it was time to re-establish a position and have subsequently done so.  This could be a multiyear story as he becomes better known and his influence on the company grows."

For instance, instead of searching “Bluetooth speaker” and sorting through all of the no-name Chinese brands, I might search “Bose Bluetooth speaker” if I decided that’s the best one

That being said, I do agree that it’s annoying how much junk is sold on there. I wish people would stop buying it because maybe then they would stop selling it"
2021-04-29 17:18:47,stocks,"My Amazon buys are Contigo mugs, under armor socks, premier protein drinks, riddell tee's, cell phone chargers, cat litter, JL wireless earphones, etc.  Basically commonly used items that are cheap.  If I'm buying a gift it's usually from another website.

They are REALLY good at common household, every day use type things.  I find that if I venture outside of that, I will go to the direct website for my specific need.  And that's okay with me"
2021-04-29 16:48:07,stocks,"I see this sentiment a lot on Reddit and I’ve never really understood it. You can see who the seller is, so if you are buying from a reputable brand you’re going to get exactly what you ordered, no? I’ve heard of small mixups but I order frequently and always get exactly what I thought I’d get. Listings can be incorrect sometimes but the Q&A section often helps resolve those questions, or looking at 1/2/3 star reviews will often uncover glaring issues

The cheap foreign knockoff stuff is usually pretty obvious, but even then tons of cheap stuff from China is surprisingly high quality. Most products we use are from foreign factories anyway - and for a lot of the cheap stuff, they actually have incredible customer service if you reach out to their email/Amazon seller profile instead of leaving a bad review. I ordered an outdoor couch cover that came with a small rip and they sent me two more brand new ones immediately"

I agree. However, I've learned to spot the crap and mostly have avoided it"
2021-04-29 17:38:44,stocks,"My experience mirrors yours.  I was an early Amazon adherent, and even was involved in businesses that were enmeshed with Amazon.  In personal life and business, was receiving multiple Amazon shipments per day, and I'm talking ages before Amazon Prime was even a thing, in the 90's and 00's.  I was on first name basis with Bezos' executive administration team.  

That all ended when they started the ""third party"" experiment.  Stuck with them for awhile, making my opinion known on the risks to the operation and brand, naively thinking they might pull back from it.  When a bit of time elapsed and they hadn't, decided to go a completely different way and we've gone from thousands of Amazon transactions to dozens.  I'm talking about a near hundredfold switch in operation.  For the first years I kind of assumed they'd get better and we'd maybe float back, but it's been many years now that we've been mostly ""Amazon-free"".  

As their philosophy drifted away from responsible and diligent to more apathetic and careless, I instead was trading the stock.  

I'd been out of it for a long while, intending to re-establish a position but waiting for a sufficient dip or catalyst.  That finally came with the Bezos replacement announcement.  Moving past his abdication-style leadership was one factor, and the replacement they chose was another.  Decided to look for sub-$3000 entry points, and the recent tech correction it dipped below $2900.  

Like you, I once wistfully hoped they'd get the counterfeit and garbage third party under control.  But seeing what a huge portion of their number it is now ($24 billion) you can see why they're slow walking any such measures."

2021-04-29 17:57:57,stocks,Uh apple went up after earnings. Dropped today
2021-04-29 16:24:42,stocks,Apple while making huge gains only barely beat the insanely high expectations they had. That's the difference.
2021-04-29 17:50:58,stocks,"Valuation is an issue for AAPL.

But the metrics were somewhat breathtaking.  A company just casually announcing a $90 billion buy back like it's some minor detail is downright muscular.

Imagine if Apple announced they were buying some moderately big billion dollar business, then they did the same the next day, and the next day, and the next, for 90 days straight."

Unless amazon plans on issuing more shares, why would amazon as a corporation give a shit whether retail investors pile into the stock or not? Price rise would be immaterial and fleeting. Could also make it impractical to buyback shares if they start raising more cash."
2021-04-29 17:47:32,stocks,"I agree.  It also must make it more difficult for them to issue equity to employees.  They have to do it in chunks of $3500 or whatever the share price is.  And since they vest over years, I imagine that makes it extra tricky."
2021-04-29 18:16:33,stocks,"Agree, and gave more reasons in an early post.  

One I didn't list is that I was trained years ago to only trade in board lot sizes, and (unfortunately) I can't do that with AMZN :-)"

2021-04-29 16:23:36,stocks,Hehe that!
2021-04-29 17:04:21,stocks,"Amazon used to be a decent site for researching and finding products, but it's not anymore. It's only useful if you already know exactly what you want - the exact brand and model. For example, back in the day, if I wanted a sleeping bag, Amazon was actually useful for researching what's available and finding one of decent quality for a good price. Now there are 10's of pages of nearly identical sleeping bags from randomly-named companies with thousands of 5-star reviews.

And even when you do know the exact brand and model of what you want, Amazon is either out of stock, the price sucks, or Prime shipping isn't available so there's no point in ordering from Amazon at all.

For a recent example, I've been looking to install a solar power system in a shed on my property. Amazon has tons of solar panels, batteries, etc, but it's all no-name crap or stuff from a company that pays Amazon a ton of money to feature their products. If you read serious reviews of solar power systems, they mention brands that you can rarely find for sale on Amazon. So I ended up ordering from a boutique site and they shipped my order just as fast as Amazon would have and I also got free shipping.

Now the only time I order anything from Amazon is if it's something with same-day shipping. Otherwise, there are usually better options for me.

Edit: That being said, since this is an investing forum: I still like AMZN stock. I hold a bunch of it, and I'm up 300% on my original investment."
2021-04-29 17:09:44,stocks,"Nah I've noticed it. Very hard to trust the products.

I often see ""amazons choice"" tag. I'd expect this to be a pretty good product when they have this tag on it. Pure shit.

It's really turned into Aliexpress with fast delivery."
2021-04-29 17:46:01,stocks,"> nderstood it. You can see who the seller is, so if you are buying from a reputable brand you’re going to get exactly what you ordered, no?

No.  And that's the issue.  Third party garbage isn't properly managed by Amazon, even though they have the clout to do so.  And much more often than you realize, third party junk finds its way into the FBA (fulfilled by Amazon) chain.

>  or looking at 1/2/3 star reviews will often uncover glaring issues

Unfortunately, no, Amazon deliberately fails here as well.  Many, many, many of the high reviews are manipulated.  Amazon could do something about it, but they don't."

2021-04-29 17:57:37,stocks,"I've come to hate Apple, but will they?  

They've sold astronomical loads of hardware over a year in which their factories and stores have all been shut down for significant periods.  

They've sold their crappy services for real money.  

They've been a cell phone company for many years, but now there's credible reason to think they might pump up laptop, tablet and computer sales.  

They somehow pulled off an incredibly rapid and successful termination of Intel.  Intel!  Apple's own designed chip somehow trounces the best of what Intel can make.  Intel's chips need mini air conditioning systems to function, while Apple/ARM replacements can sit in your pocket.  I though it would take years for the performance to catch up, and then they just... did it.  First gen.

They're also one of the only enterprises that's tuned in correctly to the world population's sentiment that nobody likes heavy covert user tracking.  They're the only company that could conceivably take a huge bite out of Facebook's massive domination of social messaging.  If iMessage were branded and run more distinctly, it would be bigger than things like Twitter, Snap, and PINS put together.

 I think I've just convinced myself to start looking at getting back into AAPL."

2021-04-29 17:21:22,stocks,"Multiple reasons.  Retail activity can be supportive to stock price.  

Secondly, the stock *must* be split if AMZN wants to become part of certain indexes, and those indexes tend to drive enormous institutional acquisition.  

Third, making the share price lower drives the volume number, and some of those markets who would drive sentiment and liquidity reward companies with lower price/higher share count volume.

Fourth, I think you're mistaken that a price rise would be ""immaterial and fleeting"".  The same prediction has famously been wrong over and over with numerous big name peers. 

 It also wouldn't ""make it impractical to buy back"". 

I'm empathetic to your sentiment here, as I too was trained that splits should have no theoretical benefits and muted impacts.  But over the decades, that theoretical has been soundly disproven by real world results."
2021-04-29 17:16:25,stocks,"Because we're discussing a move that *could* make their stock more popular, and therefore increase its market cap (or from Amazon's perspective increase income/decrease cost to borrow when it *does* issue).   

Plus if you want to dilute any one institution from having too much voting power, expanding retail investment stake is a way to do so.   

> Could also make it impractical to buyback shares if they start raising more cash.   

Even with more retail investors, the vast majority would still be institutional. More than enough for a buyback unless it was an abnormally large one (e.g. 15%+)."

But it's a terrible example because when you snap a pencil, you end up going from having one useful writing tip to potentially three useful writing tips.  That's objectively a huge benefit... for free.  But he acts like it does nothing, since that's the point he's trying to convey.

2021-04-29 14:45:43,stocks,"Ooooh pick me, pick me! So I just replied to another post that answers this question - it's actually super interesting why this happens.

The IPO process literally CAUSES IPOs to trade much higher than where they price, and there is an instant transfer of value to select institutions....

**TL;DR - Banks make IPO go brrrrr. Hedgies make money. Stock goes down.**

*If you care to learn about the \*flawed\* IPO process... keep reading...*

The first thing a company does when it wants to IPO is go to a bank to be the bookrunner on the deal (sometimes they pick a few bookrunners). Then those banks go around and gauge interest in the stock to see where they should price the shares.

Seems reasonable right? WRONG.

What happens when they go to price shares is they typically have this internal target of a subscription of AT LEAST 97%. That means that of all the institutions and hedge funds they talk to, they are hoping to price the IPO such that 97% of them say that they'd be willing to buy the stock at that price (regardless of valuation, industry anything...). Think HOW LOW you would have to price an IPO for 97% of people to want to buy it at that price (basic supply and demand suggests that is extremely low).

So what ends up happening is that the bank ends up picking their best/favorite clients to receive allocations in the actual IPO that is already priced too low... They fill a book and sell those IPO shares to hedge funds and institutions at this super low price... but then a lot of the time the stock never even trades there because when it opens for open market trading, there is all this pent up demand from oversubscriptions at this super low price.

So the company that IPOs sells their shares at $5/shr for 100mm shares and raises $500mm... but the second the market opens there is such a huge demand for shares at that low of a price that the banks have caused this super distorted supply/demand picture and the stock rips up to $10/shr, $20/shr, $30/shr... and now the company that IPO'ed through the bank only got $500mm when their stock is now worth $1bn++... all that ""wealth creation"" went straight into the hands of hedgies and other shareholders and not to the company.

Then after the buzz wears off ... the stock usually slumps a few hours/days later. Fundamental and market dynamics take over after that, but that is why you're seeing that reaction in your trading simulation - its real. Now actually GETTING IPO allocations is harder than it looks if you're not a hedge fund or have a relationship with a broker, but in practice, this strategy works a lot of the time.

It's actually the reason that companies are choosing to access public markets via a SPAC merger instead of a traditional IPO. There is more price discovery and they can negotiate the terms of the deal.

2021-04-29 14:47:03,stocks,"Don't get too excited about that. There have been a couple of good ones lately, buy IPOs can and do tank at open sometimes. The ones more likely to rocket are the ones with low volume and unusually high interest. Like EBET, for example. But overall, you're just as likely to lose big as you are to make a killing."
2021-04-29 17:32:44,stocks,"Irl, you're not a hedge fund so no"
2021-04-29 18:25:24,stocks,In reality it’s virtually impossible for individuals investors to get shares at the IPO price. You might win your class simulation but it can’t be replicated.
2021-04-29 14:35:51,stocks,It even works better if you got insider knowledge.
2021-04-29 15:40:00,stocks,"What happens if the stock is at a high but only goes higher? You miss out on any growth. What happens if it goes to the low and you buy only to realize the new low is 60% less than this. You keep buying down and now you own a bunch of crap stock. I lost $25k this way.

Time the market and gamble away. I guess you can get lucky. You can also get lucky by buying a stock you like at any point in time."
2021-04-29 16:28:25,stocks,"I like to buy low, buy more when it dips lower, buy more when it dips lower, run out of money when it dips lower, then desperately hold for weeks and weeks of running sideways deep in the negative. It's going great."
2021-04-29 14:49:10,stocks,So you're saying buy low sell high?
2021-04-29 14:56:17,stocks,"Buy high, Sell low

Margin call delight"
2021-04-29 16:26:07,stocks,Lmao. Honestly after following relatively stable stocks for a while and watching the ups and downs it feels like having insider knowledge. If you've got the cash to throw around you can easily just buy and sell over and over again for small profits. Did I just crack the code? I mean shit it seems like if you have enough money you can just load up which will drive up the price and then sell after your purchase inflates the price.
2021-04-29 16:19:19,stocks,"Fair point. It's always a gamble. I guess this mostly applies to something you believe in long term that is somewhat stable. If shits volatile it's always a roll of the dice. There is always exceptions and it all depends on the situation. If you hear news and you think something is about to start climbing jump on it. And to your point I should have added ""if you really believe in the stock and have done your DD"" and it drops then add more to average down. Did you truly believe in and research that stock and it just took a turn for the worse or were you following some hype?"
2021-04-29 15:50:11,stocks,"Totally agree 

Buy your conviction, not deals. Falling knives and all."
2021-04-29 16:57:48,stocks,Yeah I should add a disclaimer that I only recommend averaging down if you really believe in the stock and have done your DD. If something is tanking use your best judgement. Maybe hold until the price settles then average down or set a % range you're ok with it dropping and if it gets past that sell and wait for the price to settle to buy back in. It's always a gamble no matter what. I try to stick with relatively stable stuff I'm bullish long term on so price movements are not too drastic. Volatile stocks can be a great money maker but you can also get burned really easy.
2021-04-29 16:02:24,stocks,Yes m'lord
2021-04-29 16:06:00,stocks,Lmao. Yeah I'm not too keen on playing with borrowed money. I keep it small and within my budget
2021-04-29 14:20:50,stocks,"> EDIT: BTW They dropped due to some ""Severe Adverse Effects"" in clinical trials. 

I think you just answered the question for yourself. They dropped because their drugs/therapy didn't end up working as intended, and for all we know, they may never work as intended, meaning all of their perceived value just evaporated never to return again. Or it's just over blown, who knows. You'd need somebody very familiar with the gene editing space to really understand what's going on there. 

Best bet is to stay away from businesses you don't understand."

2021-04-29 14:29:25,stocks,"I’m with you. Just a cursory look since August 2020 there are headlines that include:

$200 million stock offering, 3rd Q miss, “We’re hopeful Adverum will use its cash wisely”, 4th Q miss, a hedge fund sending letters to investors outlining how the current board seems to be filled with idiots who blow through money like crazy and are trying to get shareholders to approve their proposed board members, and clinical trial data where a participant developed a condition that decreased their vision.

There’s a boatload of uncertainty that goes beyond the most recent catalyst - it’s not something I’d be interested in at this moment."
2021-04-29 14:18:00,stocks,"There's still a ~400 Million Market Cap, to me it seems like it was one person or a bunch of people at the same exact time. It all occurred at the same exact time in after-hours. It doesn't look right to me"
2021-04-29 14:48:35,stocks,"That sort of a drop is very common in this sector. The small micro cap healthcare, genomics, etc companies will see 50% + drops overnight if they don’t get fda approved or if clinical trials don’t go their way, it’s perfectly normal and rational. The company likely has no product to sell and burns cash at insane rates with absolutely no prospects of ever being profitable if their drug/therapy doesn’t work out the way they expected, which is what seems to have happened here. 

I’d say a rebound is unlikely given the news."
2021-04-29 14:59:50,stocks,"I am rather new to this sector. So it sounds like when a company like this in bio tech has a ground breaking and unrealistic trial and goes up a bunch in anticipation, have a put option ready? Lmfao"

Market cap is what matters. Berkshire has two stocks but they’re both the same company. One is Berkshire A and then Berkshire B. A is 400k+ and meant for institutional investors and wealthy individuals. B is around 200$ and for retail investors and peasants like me and you. They’re both the same thing just Berkshire A has (presumably) never had a stock split. At the end of the day they’re both for the same company and have the same market cap, which is what matters. Berkshire A despite having a 400k/share price is still worth like a quarter of what Apple is worth even though Apple trades somewhere around the low to mid 100s/share."

And one more question, since I've just learned about Berkshire b, let's say I put 500 into both a and b, what would be the difference? I know you said one is for the rich and the other for the ""poor"", but if its the same thing basically, even having a partial share in each the growth would be similar yeah?"

2021-04-29 14:17:07,stocks,"There would be essentially no difference, it's the same thing just with a different price tag. 

I'll use some made up numbers here to try to best explain it. Berkshire the company is worth 600B (market cap, which is what matters). 

Berkshire A maybe has 100 shares, meaning every share is worth 60B$ whereas Berkshire B might have 1000000 shares making each share worth 600k$ each. 

At the end of the day the total shares combined is still worth 600B$ (the market cap), the only difference is Berkshire A has less shares than Berkshire B. 

Hope that's not worded too poorly. It's hard for me to really explain things lol."

If I gave you 100$, but I told you to choose between ten 10$ bills or two 50$ bills they're still worth the same thing, there's just a different quantity of 'shares' or in this case bills."

2021-04-29 13:03:58,stocks,A lot of brokers have screening tools. Try to come up with basic criteria on what industries you are interested in and characteristics you want in a stock you own. Then use the screening tools to whittle down to a few options.
2021-04-29 13:45:14,stocks,"You can look at any ETF/index and look through their holdings, particularly the ARK etf's if you're interested in innovation and you can browse them all and look for something that fits your criteria. You can browse reddit or discord channels related to stocks to see what people are talking about and then of course do your own research. Youtube is another great place to find good stocks to invest in, but again ALWAYS do your own research.

I found out about TTCF from Meet Kevin (amazing content creator) and Financial Education (extremely basic videos imo, most of his content I find to be low quality) so both youtubers. I watched their videos on the company, I liked their key points that they pointed out and I liked the industry so I began doing my own research and from my own research I came to the conclusion that I think the company will perform very, very well in the future, so I invested. I never invested solely based off of the content from the youtube videos, but it did help me find a new interesting stock. 

Another idea is to just search up a specific industry and google to find out all of the major publicly traded companies in that space, then look into them. 

Social media really is your friend here, just make sure to ALWAYS do your own research and come to a conclusion on your own before you invest any money into anything."
2021-04-29 13:23:53,stocks,"Depends your goal for investing:

Long term value

Day trader buying dips

Meme buyer chasing dreams

I'm the first, a value trader.  I look for companys with strong financials who also appear under valued.  I do this buy sorting using fidelity (other sites cna do this) certain criteria.  Here's what I sort:

5 year revenue growth medium-high

5 year free cash flow growth

current assets > current liabilities

P/E and CF/Earnings under 30

Shares outstanding not increasing

Long term debt 

There are many other things you can and should look at, this is just a start to narrow from thousands of companies down to a few.

I also take out certain industries that I don't understand...

It's important you understand the industry and how the company makes money.

Again, this is just a start.

I have invested my life's savings.  No way in hell I am just guessing which stocks are good or bad.  When you do this much research you guarantee long term success.  I don't invest in 1 company either, more like 20.  In addition, I have a certain percentage in vanguard market ETFs."

2021-04-29 19:42:13,stocks,"As others have said, Reddit/YouTube etc are a good source for initial names/ideas.

So what to look for in a stock? Well personally my first step is to go to their investor website read the latest management presentation highlights, to get an idea of what the company is about. Then see what people online are saying, as well as news articles, market analysts etc.

One of Warren Buffett’s rules is he doesn’t invest in companies he doesn’t understand/get. So if you read up on a company and still don’t understand their business model/how they make money, I would steer clear.

Also how is the business going to develop over time? Usually that’s either because you think it is undervalued (an example might be big oil/airline company right now) or because it has huge potential growth prospects (eg big tech, Apple etc) 

So valuation/profits/future profits is one set of factors, but there’s also qualitative factors too - eg the management team, do they seem competent or do they have a history of over promising and under delivering? For example Credit Suisse is a bank I wouldn’t touch with a barge pole, simply because the existing management have been there for years and years with one failure after another."

Reits usually pay a nice dividend and while taxable it's still ankice extra (small) income so feel free to add 10-20% Reits to a diversified portfolio.




As for gold it's a store of value and a diversification more then a short term profitable investment. At worst gold increases as inflation makes fiat money worth less and in times of turmoil/uncertainty the price of gold usually skyrocket (in case of a stock crash, pandemic etc). Physical gold is better then paper gold, invest in a company holding the real deal to be able to truly profit. Since gold itself is a slow burn investment it shoud be somewhere around 5-15% of your portfolio but any more is difficult to justify."

I love it, not to mention I use the subscription for other things such as the yoga classes, mediation classes, things I can do at home in comfort. I really think it’s a great thing and I believe in the company. I bought leaps yesterday, and today, and probably will just accumulate more of the same strikes tomorrow if it trades down again. I think it’s a great addition to someone who already goes to the gym if you ask me (I chose to workout from home), but who knows. I think people who say that everyone wants to go back to the gym and get out.. I don’t agree. I don’t think anyone actually knows this for certain. Anyway, that’s my 2 cents. Love the bike/programs and the company."

Didn’t think much of it but as I’m reading all of the responses on this thread, now I’m wondering why was he in the gym in the first place if he had a Peloton at home??? I’m in the camp that thinks the restrictions being lifted will hurt their business. They will still continue to sell but I don’t see them being as strong when gyms begin to open up."
2021-04-29 12:43:21,stocks,I'm bullish. Trading at 14x forward gross profit which is good for a company with annual growth of 100%. I don't think growth will fall off a cliff after the pandemic either. Also positive with their recurring monthly revenues from their services too.

It will also be hard for the company to maintain subscriptions. Human nature is that people buy exercise equipment and don’t use it, which leads to subscriptions being turned off.  Great while in the growth phase but they have massive competition from gyms, other in home equipment companies (mirror etc) and the thousands of fitness programs that stream on YouTube, Vimeo etc.  I literally laugh my ass off every time I see one of their high level fake emotionalism commercials.

2021-04-29 15:38:17,stocks,PTON blew up during COVID because gyms closed and everyone thought that people were going to buy at home gym equipment.

No one is going to spend $2000 on a bike and turn off their $39 subscription. Even if people use it once a month, its still worth it. You really aren't understanding the business model. It isn't to sell low margin bikes. It is to sell high margin subscriptions."

The peloton combines a top of the line bike with super accurate resistance settings and integrated power output measurements. If you jump on the bike and start pedaling everything is seamless, turns on and works. There are top of the line classes that are integrated (turn your dial to X number) with live and recorded leaderboards. If I do a class I can see the score my brother had at every point in time, it's actually motivated me to work out harder. I can see how hard I worked every single time I rode the bike.

It's a fully integrated indoor bike product that's clearly at the top of the line. I literally have no criticisms and if I were redesigning the product I wouldn't change a thing.

I've described the product and why many, many people like myself view at as a high value thing. Its features I mentioned are unmatched and are desired by people who are using similar products. At this point if you don't understand or see value I'm not sure if you want to, which isn't a problem. For example someone who doesn't like understand why people work out, or who prefer to DIY instead of buying a polished all-in-one solution may never find value in Peloton."

> Peloton has been known as a high-quality cycle but even they are not immune from manufacturing defects

Idk I guess your opinion is yours and ty for giving it. It just doesn't seem like cheap quality is a common opinion with regards to the peloton stuff. https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/alh3bz/worst_thing_about_the_peloton_cycle/ ok I've seen a couple things about pedals, but for a $2000 bike, a pedal replacement is nothing.

For example, I wouldn't say a Ferrari with shit tires is ""cheap quality"", even though the tires are complete shit. I guess unless you give specifics and I can compare them to top competitors it's hard for me to value your opinion (even though I really want to if you're super knowledgeable)

2021-04-29 13:59:48,stocks,"You probably want to go deeper than that, if you want to buy specific stocks. You want to look what's their income compared to the balance of the loans on their book. If you are loaning 1T, and their net income is 1B for example, that's a very low margin, but 3B would be fine, in my view.

You want to check their reserves, you don't want them too close to the government requirements because they can easily slip below and then the income covers that instead of being used for dividends, or shares repurchases. Also, you don't want reserves too high, it's just cash doing nothing. As for reserves in the US, I wouldn't be surprised if the Fed doesn't require any these days, but I am not sure.

Banks will also report how much of the loans are in different risk categories. It's easy to report 3% of income if your loans are recent and high-risk ones, but that might cost you in the future, etc."

Personally I'm a big believer in ARK and Cathy Wood and I believe (well really it's already true) that fintech is going to be the future of banking, without a doubt, and I believe most of the legacy banks won't have anywhere near the kind of growth that other online banking and online finance apps/companies will have, so I'd rather invest into those.

Excel is my best friend. Helps with quick maths, tracking, analyse. I use 1 file for my income and expense and 1 for my investments and trades. Love them, full of conditional formatting, colors! 🤩

My sister started investing 10 bucks a week since the first year in high school, when she reaches 70 she buys some shares ETFs so that the fee isn't more than 2%. She made a very passive portfolio with only 4 etfs. Her goal? save money and let it grow more than in the bank. She has no idea of what she shall do with it, but at least started doing it.

I myself seek for growth and have a higher risk tollerance and I have target from here to 5 year and from here to 10 years. But still I don't have only tech or only banks or only energy or only value, you name it. What I do is have a 25% of portfolio in etfs, 50% stocks, 20% derivatives, 5% cash to buy an eventual dip. Trading takes time.

Just to say if you put even only 100$ in an all world etf, you are very diversified. You should anyway remember that your average rate of return is near 7%. So set your goals, than you will find a way to achive them with the means you have.

Fractionary shares are a thing. My broker doesn't allow them, else I would be buying even more companies ahahaha"

Chromatography, mass specs, incubators etc. I work with a lot of vendors and have made some investment choices based on my experiences. Agilent, Avantor and thermo are my main longterm holds in the sector. I’m a chromatography fanboy and Agilent is the gold standard (would do shimadzu if not for foreign taxes), avantor has a unique spot in the industry with vwr, and thermo is just an all encompassing monster that generates a healthy income while still investing heavily into r&d and is also expanding into clinical trial services.

Basically, for most other sectors I couldn’t begin to choose one stock over the other based on any personal experience. I’ve been looking into HVAC stocks and can’t tell you the difference between Honeywell, carrier and trane for example. My decisions would be based on fundamentals and buy/hold/sell analyses. I made a post here and it was interesting to hear people in the fields’ opinions and other suggestions.

The government is also very strict on marketing as right now you can’t have commercials for cannabis on tv.

2021-04-29 11:33:55,stocks,"Oh yeah. One of the best in the business. 

Not only do they make the best machines (its between them and Lennox) but they also make them in a way which is easier to service. 

As far as residential equipment goes. They set their compartments up in ways where maintenance is easily performed. All the necessary stuff to clean is easily in reach, condensation traps can be taken out and put back like a Lego piece. 

The major benefit here is this; when you buy a furnace. That is a 15-20 year long machine. 

Every year maintenance is recommended to clean it and keep things running smooth. Performing these maintenances increases the chances of reaching 20 years + instead of the thing crapping out at 15 years because nobody ever cleaned a water trap and it backed up through the system and started breaking other parts. 

So if everything is easy to get to, and I'm running my own HVAC company, I can send the new guys to perform maintenance on both the lennox and carrier and almost guarantee that carrier has a better chance at getting cleaned. As soon as some of this parts start getting difficult to reach, many many MANY (😡) technicians stop cleaning the essentials because they're lazy and it's safer not to risk breaking anything by being lazy. 

So carrier is built in ways where (and they asked technicians how to design their compartments) it's more likely for even the new guy to clean everything all the way through. 



Lennox does have AMAZING engineers though and I'm also impressed with their tech (Carrier has amazing engineers too. Look into modulating 90% efficiency Carrier Furnace) but all the tech I was impressed with from Lennox takes some good effort to dismantle and clean everything for proper functioning."

I still want to keep investing my money in accounts that aren’t sheltered from tax. I was thinking of starting a dividend/ETF portfolio mixed with some growth stocks to maybe start building a dividend portfolio that maybe one day in the next few decades i could live off of. I’m 19 years old so i’m still pretty young and can afford some more risky plays but i am also considering starting a dividend portfolio. My TFSA is mostly risky high growth plays (ones i cannot discuss here). My RRSP has more safe plays (such as Apple, VTI and VOO). What do you think is the best approach i should take or what do you guys recommend as i don’t have much experience in the market, just under a year. Thanks!"
2021-04-29 11:05:14,stocks,"generally,the younger you are, the more emphasize shouldbe put on growth. 

dividends are cool and all, but most high dividend stocks do not offer the same growth potential. there are outliers. but overall this seems to hold true. 

the easiest and - stastistically and historically - proven way to make sure you can retire early is

\- invest into etf´s 

large cap (like S&P 500 etf)  
small / midcap ETF  
international etf  
done. 

me personally - if 19 again- would do it this way:   
80% of my savings into this three way etf portfolio. this is something I would never touch and keep paying into.   
20% for yolo and riskier investments. stuff to play around with. 

once you have enough money and the etfs have been compounding nicely, you can then transfer to a dividend portfolio that bolster income and give you financial headroom every month without having to sell parts of your portfolio.   


 depending on your way of living, your spending habit and income, you can be financially free sooner than most people think."

Make sure you put any US dividend stocks in your RRSP, that's the only way to protect them from the 30% withholding tax.

Since you have to worry about capital gains taxes in non-registered accounts, focus your long-term holds there.  That's where you want to put stuff that you just put away and forget about.  TFSA is good for risks and potential multi-baggers that you might want to sell to use the money for lifestyle stuff because you won't get hit by the tax man."

2021-04-29 11:26:07,stocks,Thanks man appreciate it. I was thinking using the gains in my TFSA and transferring them out into more long term plays. Ive received some decent gains already. Would you also say it’s better to focus more on ETFs than single large cap companies like apple Microsoft etc.
2021-04-29 12:37:52,stocks,"like someone else said: $ARKK was awesome last year. it is rather new and has yet to show the staying power. it is - historically - normal for new hedge funds to blow up initially and then level out in the long run. so they still have to prove to many that they are no fluke. 

there are other sector specific ETF´s from vanguard.  
take a look here:   
[https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list#/etf/asset-class/month-end-returns](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list#/etf/asset-class/month-end-returns)  


but seriously with your timeframe, it doesnt really matter:   


$VOOG -> S&P 500 Growth  
$VIOG -> Small cap Growth  
and be done with it. 

you COULD look into specific sector etfs, but I wouldnt bother, as most high gain stocks will be small cap anyways, so you got that already covered. 

the only thing you would somewhat miss i international, but also, most big movers in the S&P are multinational ,. multibillion companies, so you got that covered as well.   


if you insist, throw 

$VT in there for good measure and international exposure.   


also - and thats the beauty of ETF´s - they change around to whatever happens. 

and you do not need to do a single thing."

And if at some point in the future you need a large chunk of cash (say to buy a car or a house down payment), being able to withdraw that cash without paying tax saves you a ton of money.

Also, my advice is to focus on maxing out your TFSA first and only make RRSP deposits when you have extra cash.  The advantage of the RRSP is the tax deduction, which doesn't really matter when you're young and in a low tax bracket.  And the drawbacks of the RRSP are: 1) It's tax sheltered, not tax-free, so you pay taxes on the gains when you retire; and 2) You can't touch the money until you retire.  You can use it to buy your first home but the government will force you to pay it back into your RRSP.

If you have enough cash to do both, that's just fine.  But if you're trying to decide between the two, always choose the TFSA first.  The RRSP becomes very useful when you have a high salary but will be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.  Then you get the benefit of the tax deduction while you're in a high tax bracket, but you'll pay a lower tax rate when you close the account at retirement.

2021-04-29 12:59:13,stocks,"I appreciate the in depth reply. That’s the system i’ve done over the last year, max out tfsa then move to the rrsp. For RRSP (correct me if i’m wrong) can you technically claim retirement at any age and then when you claim the retirement can you withdrawal the money all at once or is it in increments or is both possible. Thanks!"

2021-04-29 10:52:54,stocks,UFC I hope does well I'll buy in a few shares. The major concern I have is PPV fatigue or UFC fatigue in general. Its tough keeping up on who is fighting who any given week. Hell even the PPVs have been hit and miss the past year now on what ones people will pay for.
2021-04-29 12:36:05,stocks,"This is a deceptive title... the UFC is NOT IPO'ing... Endeavor is.

Endeavor was part owner of the UFC and is uing their financing to procure the remaining ownership percentage as part of the IPO... the UFC itself is NOT going public.

Endeavor also owns WME, IMG, PBR, Miss Universe and have joint ventures in European Basketball and ESPORTS.

They also acquired OTT builder Neulion and branding agency 160/90 as well as other properties in the lead up to the IPO (first time)

While the UFC is definitely the crown jewel of their portfolio and now makes up a large percentage of their revenue it's important to remember the UFC is NOT going public, Endeavor is. I do believe they still retain the right to spinoff the UFC in it's own IPO in the future, but now that they own it completely they no longer have partners who will push that (it was probably the biggest concern during their first roadshow)"
2021-04-29 13:39:30,stocks,I purchased 10 at $26
2021-04-29 11:39:44,stocks,"Yeah avoid this like the plague people.

I'm a 10 year ufc fan. Business is barely profitable. The former owners took out every penny possible when they flipped it to Endeavour.

Endeavour hasn't invested in the next generation of fighters, improved customer experience, or sought to make the sport better.

All they've done is try to extract what remaining value was left by the Fertitas. Which basically was nothing and as a result the sport has been declining over the last 5 years.

The only thing that kept the UFC profitable was Conor. Now he's exhausted his hype and doesn't bring in ppv numbers like before.

The games are the same every year round and as a result less people buy.

The merchandise is uninspiring so nobody buys it anymore (rebook deal screwed them over)

They keep upping the price of PPVs to compensate for dwindling sales, but all that does is turn more people away.

I went from watching UFC EVERY week and reading about it EVERY DAY to watching it once every few months. It's become that meaningless now to a Super-Fan.

This IPO is for bag holders, I.e. celebrity investors and Endeavour to get out and nothing more. If you want to lose some money go right ahead. Otherwise....This one is a STRONG AVOID.

I can go into more detail when I get home.

Edit

Adding more since stuck on bus.

PPVs are watered down af. Before you'd have 10 series brand names fighting. Now you get 2 brands and 8 nobodies. This results in less ppv buys."

They own this completely (it's super profitable) and they actually bought the company that built the platform for them - Neulion, which also built the OTT platforms for NBA, NFL, WWE, PBR and more.

Not to mention, numbers wise this is looking to be the best year since 2016 - when the UFC was sold to Endeavor and it's partner... so to say they need to step it up shows that you don't actually know they have been for quite some time.

So yea, you're wrong there.

&#x200B;

>Falling merchandise sales?

Again, you're wrong - their consumer products is up 166% this year. It's also only 3.2% of their revenue. They also just announced the Venum deal where fighters got a bump in pay, plus they did a mainstream deal with ZAPPOS which will put licensed merch in many more retailers.

&#x200B;

>The dwindling PPV sales?

Again, what the hell are you talking about?

* UFC 261 700k
* UFC 260 500k
* UFC 259 800k
* UFC 258 500k
* UFC 257 1.6mil

That's incredible numbers.. not that it matters as they have flat rate guarantees (plus incentives) and ESPN takes the risk on any flops

&#x200B;

>Lack of star power?

McGregor is booked and hungry to stay busy, Jones coming back, Usman is NOW a star, they have a marketable and popular Heavyweight champion who also wants to stay busy.. not to mention the killers row of up-and-coming talent.

&#x200B;

>Watered down cards?

Watered down... do you mean high volume? They're doing more events to meet ESPN quotas and make MORE MONEY regardless of viewership.. the event volume also allows a larger roster.. they'd have to cut a hundred or so fighters if they slowed down.. that wouldn't be good for business or competition. Hell they'd be doing more Contender Series cards if the regional scene could support it.. those shows are money makers and allow them to suck ALL the talent.

&#x200B;

>Huge debt pile?

I think you're confusing UFC's debt and EDR's debt. UFC is leveraged somewhat but that was to finance things like the PI and APEX which proved to be incredibly smart investments during the pandemic that literally saved their ass. EDR is a different story.

UFC did 900mil in revenue last year..... records on every front."

They've literally been killing it. 

UFC has gone from a 4.2 billion dollar company at their purchase to 7+ currently and makes up something like 80% of Endeavor's profit.

Their domestic rights value has steadily increased and their international deals have been exponential. They did HUGE ones in Russia and China recently.

This IPO isn't to save EDR from bankruptcy, it's a liquidation event for original stakeholders and a way to finance the complete purchase of the UFC.. because if they were still only part owners the other owners could force a spinoff IPO and kill EDR.. now that will never happen.

UFC is far far far from bankruptcy."
2021-04-29 15:53:29,stocks,"I mean you just argued my point.. Conor McGregor is getting PAID. Same with Ronda, Jon Jones, etc.

Billy Twoblow who has less then 10 fights, less then 10k twitter/instagram followers, and goes 0-2 in the UFC before getting cut doesn't deserve a six figure pay day like the top.

That's how the UFC operates.

The brand of the UFC is also far more powerful then any other sport. Kids grow up wanting to be a football player, basketball player etc - in MMA they grow up wanting to be a U-F-C fighter.. nothing else matters. 

UFC=MMA

They're built their entire model around keeping fighter pay at 20% and only paying out big for stars. It has made them the top while everyone else struggles.. it is absolutely sustainable. There is no other promotion that has profit like them. Not even close."

B2 Digital is an MMA company with holdings including HRMMA, Colosseum Combat, UCL, Pinnacle and Strike Hard - they are all micro-regional promotions and currently traded on OTC.

XFC was also recently revived and listed on OTC. They haven't done much since their return, they did a time-buy on NBC Sports which was a pretty shitty decision IMO.... nothing of note since.

You can also buy shares in Roy Jones Jr Promotions - which airs on UFC Fight Pass. I don't know what type of securities it is classified as - but was def a cash grab (seemed scammy, I passed hard)

After the Kimbo Slice/ Elite XC debacle - the ownership behind that show attempted to make a return to the spotlight as ProElite - which was traded OTC before they went under.

International Fight League ""IPO'd"" but they were OTC and not on a major exchange... they failed too.

ONE is reportedly contemplating a SPAC - i asked Chatri about it and he acknowledged they had approached an investment banking firm to explore the option but would not say anything else. They likely can't pass any real audits so a true IPO is probably out of the question for them.

PFL is on their way to an IPO at some point.. they'll have to do something to keep the Ponzi scheme going. They're still taking on investors left-and-right and had to raise an additional $65mil just to do this season.. all of those shareholders are going to look for a return or liquidation event some day.

I was wondering if some companies might choose to have their earnings report released before open so that the momentum of the news kicks in immediately, or if reporting after close so that it either gives time for the news to spread or gives or gives a cool off effect for people’s decisions for the next trading day.

Would one be better than the other?"
2021-04-29 10:51:08,stocks,I think it’s super situational - but companies don’t tend to change how they do it. One company usually always reports before the open and another always after the close. It’s pretty consistent across the board they won’t change from quarter to quarter

Honestly, I don't think it matters because if it did, then seeing as how markets ought to be forward-looking and everything is priced in, it shouldn't affect anything even if a company always reported good news after market close and bad news before market open."

2021-04-29 12:02:43,stocks,Looking up the wash sale rules is important as well.  You may be creating a tax liability scenario for yourself that you don't anticipate.
2021-04-29 12:50:29,stocks,"Is there any reason to sell and rebuy for you? You don't mention one. 

There can be, depending on many things including your attitude. I've sold some stocks with the aim of probably re-buying them later for various reasons.

One reason might be because they have hit your price target, and you want to take your profits and run. Or the stock isn't behaving as you had hoped/expected, and you'd rather have your money on else or even out of the market and risk-free until market conditions/company outlook has changed.  Or maybe the stock had a really good run recently and you can't see that continuing in the short term. You want to take your profits and are hoping it will drop, or at least don't want to take the risk that it will, or want to be less in the market temporarily. 

Keep in mind buy/sell fees, if you have any. People talk a lot about capital gains tax; whether that's a problem depends on you. Ignoring country-specific irregularities with holding time or tax-sheltered investment options, CGT is a % of the stocks increase compared to your buy price. You pay that % (out of the profits) whenever you sell. 

In this hypothetical, if you sell and immediately re-buy the same amount of shares to sell again at a later date, vs just holding till that date, you pay your tax in two instalments instead of one (but the same amount overall). You're effectively paying part of the money earlier, which does technically decrease your buying power of that stock at that moment - so need to toss in a bit of extra money at the time for re-buying, even though you pay the same amount of tax in the end.

Most people on here probably don't like that scenario, so will dislike re-buying because of it. Depending where you live (very country specific!), you may have a certain CGT-free profit allowance per year, or be able to offset realised losses from stocks from within a certain time-frame. If there is, depending on your other stock-selling activity (and fees), you may want to sell and possibly re-buy so that you use up this allowance. It may lead to lower total taxes in the end."

Pickup/SUV: Bronco/Bronco Sport is selling like a hot cake. F-150 is still the dominant pickup in the US, Ranger has success everywhere else where mid-size pickup is popular. Commercial trucks and vans fleet sales are still good. Also remember F  has shares in Rivian too.

Only the move backfired because there is more to business than bean counting and maximizing short term profits. 

Ford had no mitigation plans, no leadership and it caught up to them. If leadership was smart, they would have stockpiled chips instead of focusing on short term maximum profit by minimizing inventory."

On the other side though, Ford actually making money and seeing enormous is new and significant.  Don't agree that they're perceived as ""behind"" in EV.

Except that's largely untrue.  ""risk mitigation goes against maximum profits"" is disproven here today as we see profits slashed in half because risk mitigation was ignored.  

And often I find that smart long term ideas can be smart short-term too.  I'd have run that situation such that two or more suppliers provide that component.  That way I have long term protection against an exogenous event like this factory fire, but I'd have present day profits from the fact my two suppliers are doing their damndest  to compete with each other.  That way I win at least one way, and usually both.

And that's not all.  I'd be practicing advanced vendor management wherein any contracts I had with suppliers would make them should some or perhaps all the pain in the event that something happens.  That in turn would mean that *they* would be motivated to do things like have redundant factories so a fire doesn't hurt them.  And worst case, if they fail and hurt me, I at least get compensatory payment or pricing, which can be a large mitgator or even a windfall.  There'd be other levels where my best people are embedded with the supplier to make sure they're doing best practices on my behalf, and through insurance and underwriting methods.  

And that's just for my little hot dog cart and funko pop up store.  I would have assumed Ford Motor Corp knows at least one of these tactics."

Business travel isn’t going to go back to what it was for many years, maybe ever; companies are saving many millions by not having people fly around the world spending $10k on a Biz Class ticket for a meet and greet that doesn’t really add value. 
Airlines have parked hundreds of jets in the desert because they don’t have enough business to justify keeping them in the air. These cost millions per aircraft to unpark, which cannot be done overnight, meaning total passenger capacity is now materially smaller than it was before. 
Before the pandemic if you had a fleet of 100 flyable jets with 30 billion book value, and now you have 60 jets with 25 billion book value, your company isn’t worth what it was before the pandemic and your ability to generate revenue is reduced.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval Process Welcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

# Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

This is a general overview of the FDA drug approval process. I hope this has been informative to some and if so, I may try to write some more quick guides in the future regarding pharmaceuticals."
2021-04-29 09:08:27,stocks,Yep. Small cap biotechs are basically long term loto tickets.
2021-04-29 10:14:52,stocks,"As a pharmacist, nice work here. You summed up a few hours of lecture into a digestible read. 

I think one of the other comments hinted here that your numbers are a bit liberal in that it’s probably even less that make it to market and many of them are not truly new classes or mechanisms of action. Most drugs these days are combo drugs or old drug + new drug. That doesn’t mean they aren’t all good. 

Monoclonal antibodies and small molecule drugs have revolutionized the pharma world and those are the exciting drugs coming out. Their application in cancer, immune disorders, and even high cholesterol is amazing. 

My point is that we have seen some great leaps in medicine in the past decade with those medications and now mRNA vaccines but picking one company that is going to let you retire early is like finding a needle in a haystack. 

In fact, the pharma industry is constantly cannabalizing itself. Big companies buy out the small ones when they find a promising molecule, or companies shut down when they can’t find a useful compound. Pfizer shut down a HUGE research facility in Michigan years ago that they bought from a different pharma company before that. It’s a rocky business to be involved in so just be careful."
2021-04-29 09:25:54,stocks,"Here's some insight for you, although it's probably 10 years out of date now.

They said it takes a pharma company working through 10,000 potential drugs to find one new NME. An NME is a ""novel molecular entity"" or a truly  new drug and is not like ""existing drug + ibuprofen = new!"" style drugs. 

At the time my data was current, we said that it takes a company 10 years and $1,000,000,000 USD to whittle those 10k candidates into one new drug. Probably more like $1.5B now though. 

This is from Drugs: Discovery to Approval (https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Discovery-Approval-Rick-Ng/dp/1118907272/) and you can see the same things I'm saying in the introduction in Amazon's free preview. Just reading the first few pages of what a drug is and how development works is very valuable."

2021-04-29 10:34:58,stocks,Thank you for the great write up!
2021-04-29 11:09:25,stocks,"Id love to chip in and add more flavor to the topic. 
Another thing to consider is the fact that one single drug could be working for multiple indications. This could mean anything from expanding to include a larger group of patients within a disease area, to a different and completely unrelated disease. Remember that one disease is still very heterogenic, it comes with variation in terms of severity or specific disease sub groups. All of them require proper documentation of effect. The documentation requirement, how far back to scratch you need to start over, depends on how far away a new indication is from a currently approved one. So new disease area probably phase I-II, but a related one, Phase ii or even just straight to phase III. The reason is that previous phases can document for a wider indication potential. So one example of a drug with wide application is anti-TNF, which by now, probably works for anything that a corticosteroid would do. Difference in terms of side effects is nuking your own body to sugical precision missile strike. And yes anti TNFs are becoming inferior to even more precise medicines. However, sometimes better precision could mean less potential for wide application. But not always."
2021-04-29 12:02:08,stocks,"Also I think drugs must be shown to be more effective that the ones already on the market. So even if you pass phase 3 clinical trials with flying colors there is a chance that the drug will not go to phase 4 (or even that it fails to meet this requirement after phase 4).

Note also that these trials are HUGELY costly. They can run into several hundred million $ from start to finish (this is the reason why stocks usually tank if a drug fails in late stages of a trial). 

Given the high number of drugs that don't make it and the associated costs it's easy to see why some of the more specialized drugs are absurdly expensive - even though their actual manufacture isn't (or why for certain diseases there's next to no development for drugs because the sales numbers would never recoup the investment...or also why big pharam likes drugs that alleviate symptoms rather than provide cures)"

2021-04-29 15:03:13,stocks,Just gotta add that most pharmaceuticals do a lot of r&d for new indications to existing drugs which cuts the timeline significantly.
2021-04-29 16:07:12,stocks,"To add a little bit more to this great post: Most drugs fail well before NDA/BLA, but if it reaches that point then it has a high chance of being approved. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization found that 90.6% was approved. Depending on the disease area, approval ranged from a low of 82.5% to a high of 100%.

Although many say biotech, life science companies etc. are extremely binary, which is to say that stock movement is based on study results, and perhaps random, it is not necessary a random flip of the coin YOLO move. The way to hedge this apparent randomness is to do a thourough technical due dillience of the biology behind, the molecular target of the drug, the technological solution of the drug and the current competitive market. Does the drug meet an unmet medical need, does it offer a new and unique solution, and does the biology makes sense? The last one is very important, and sometimes, unfortunately, you need read scientific papers to provide the proper context. Ive seen some selling bullshit because i dont believe in the biology they claim. It doesnt neceasary keep me from placing a bet, so long as i at least think there is sufficent hype to ride on."

I started getting into the Stock market a year ago, in my Early 20s now. In the last couple months I mostly outperformed s&p500 and nasdaq. However, this obviously could change at any time. I'm wondering how I could optimally manage my Portfolio to minimize Transaktion fees, screen time and maximize Profits. I'm thinking of combining growth etfs, qqq, voo and more niche etfs such as SMH, pth, ogig etc. Also, I like the idea of 20% Training stop losses and perhaps swing trade to Max out Profits.

Does anyone have Tips for me? 
Such as good swing trading strategies of etfs (based on market Rotation, season, specific signals).. 

What is your experience when combining etfs, Stocks and swing trading those? What is a simple rule of thumb or strategy to minimize Transaktion fees? Thank you so much☺"
2021-04-29 08:58:09,stocks,"Just don't over think it. Buy stocks or etfs that you know and understand. Revaluated your holdings every ~6 months. If you determine the investments still have prospect, keep it and decide if continuing to DCA is right for you. If the investment isn't living up to your expectations and you don't have a good outlook after 6 months, then consider either retracting your DCA strategy, shedding some, or reallocating all the position into something you're more confident about. 

Trying to time the market is going to detract from your goal of minimizing screen time. 

Honestly, at the end of the day just don't over complicate it. That's where most people lose their profits or end up significantly underperforming."

Bringing the chip design in-house was a good forward-looking move that I think is likely to lead to some real advances over the next few years. iOS continues to debut new features that many people (NOT including myself, actually, but I recognize many others) find attractive, such as all the fancy gimcracks and software processing they've added to their camera software. This is a company that's still innovating. I'm not even saying they're necessarily good innovations, especially for power users like myself who are after 30 years as mac enthusiasts having to consider switching to Linux because they want a computer and not just an appliance, but, they're definitely not sitting still, and breaking eggs is good for progress."

We all know that gaming and eSports is catching up. All big companies are working on their AR/VR glasses. We already know Apple is working on their glasses to. If people does create a competitor to Oculus VR and fits it with their own GPU, its bad news for AMD/Nvidia. Tesla, Amazon and Google are already using their own hardware too.

If a company shows good financial performance and provides positive news, you should be happy. Don’t worry about the fact that the stock might be 5% down after hours, since that just usually means the positive news were already baked in. Despite the short term drop, your stock still shows that it’s fundamentally strong and will provide good value in the long run.

The stock will eventually catch up with its growth if it does lag. But you shouldn’t be shocked if the stock tanks because of the quarterly reports.

Youre right, but the issue is most people actively managing stocks have target dates. If the stock doesnt perform well in the 3 months before earnings, then the ER is good but the stock is flat or down, it feels like you wasted 3 months, while your money couldve been better off elsewhere.

Also there are stocks that have far better financials and overall conditions, that wallstreet simply refuses to acknowledge or do so in a timely fashion. No pump after a great earnings, with no lead up pump to the ER, is a huge flag that wallstreet simply doesnt want to deal with the stock or sector, especially if it occurs numerous times. 

The problem is, its not about being 'right' about the value of the company, its about being right about how wallstreet will value it."

I think more than 9 months past the start of the pandemic, purchases of Apple products for work from home use have already peaked and are declining. Strong sales revenue abroad in Europe/Pacific regions, where pandemic conditions have been around for longer than in North America, is very exciting for investors, don’t you agree? I mean, I’m not an expert investor, and I never claimed to be, but did Apple really release anything that would point to the current stock price overvaluing their company?

2021-04-29 08:18:09,stocks,My only friends who got into stocks are doing good at it. But their mentality is not go get rich. It's to create liquidity or have assets in the future when they apply for loans and shit. So maybe pivot the way you are going about it?

Some of it is just human nature...ie., our intellect is often stretched past its limited capacity to think about things.  But another part of it is our culture ... imprinted Christian values like guilt which make talking about money a taboo.  Even worse in Europe than it is in the US.  And yet another part is lack of education on the topic, which I think is related to my previous statement."

But their salary?  Forget it.  Even raising the topic is offensive.  

There's also a weird dichotomy of how people brag about how well they're doing in general.  According to Reddit, every single person is near the top of their organization and manages tons of people, and they receive the highest range of bonuses and the maximum amount of stock grants.  

But when you talk to them one on one about actual numbers, they always downplay.  I don't make that much, I never get a raise, I can't afford it, etc."

2021-04-29 10:57:46,stocks,"There’s religion and then there’s culture that springs up around it.  Catholic guilt isn’t something that’s taught in church, but it is a real thing that affects culture.  I don’t exactly know why it exists, but there definitely something about Christianity that creates a culture that is uncomfortable with wealth and inequality.  This is not meant to be a criticism of religion, just an observation that the thing that ties western culture together is not necessarily super comfortable with discussing finance openly among friends.

Makes it hard to have the stock/money conversations with people without coming off as boring or elitist.  I mean, try to talk about salary expectations with someone from Europe.  It’s a nearly impossible conversation because they are so uncomfortable with that type of thing over there.

Once you become aware of this cultural taboo it helps you overcome it.  For example, in Europe tech workers who do ask for more money or shop around a far better off than those who don’t.  I mean, engineers with the same skill set in the same city in Europe can have 3x differences in wages because of this culture. So it’s really important to navigate through the waters of “cultural humility” to maximize your personal returns.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"UPDATE: $HGEN (Humanigen) - Short term COVID play w/ great long term potential in CAR-T cancer therapy (and more!). 5x+ potential ROI **\*\*TL;DR:** Short term COVID play with great long term potential in CAR-T therapy (and more). Lenzilumab's recent P3 results cements it as the #1 current therapeutic in hospitalized COVID patients. Application submission for emergency use authorization (EUA) will come any day now (maybe today!) and cause a greater spike than when it went from $14->$29 following P3 topline data release. >5x ROI based on potential COVID sales and CAR-T implications is very possible. Great entry point currently at $18.60 (1bil market cap).

You may or may not have seen my original post on Mar. 25 (copy and pasted below) talking about Humanigen's variant agnostic COVID drug Lenzilumab, which is primed to have a significant role in hospitalized COVID patients, CAR-T (cancer therapy), and more! Since my post, there have been plenty of positive catalysts:

1. Humanigen released positive topline data in it's [phase 3 clinical trial](https://s27.q4cdn.com/938944131/files/doc_presentations/Lenzilumab-Phase-3-Results-v8-RXMD-032921-0555h.pdf) studying Lenzilumab in hospitalized COVID patients. Lenzilumab met the studies primary endpoint (ventilator free survival through day 28) with a **54% relative improvement** in VFS over and above current standard of care (remdesevir and/or steroids). Tocilizumab, a significantly inferior (but similar - works downstream of GM-CSF) immunomodulator is currently used often in hospitalized COVID patients. It only produced a **18%** relative improvement in VFS, and yet has made Roche a [boatload of money](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/novartis-inks-third-covid-19-production-pact-time-for-roche-s-arthritis-med-actemra) and continues to be produced for COVID treatment. The drug generated 2.9bil in sales, which is a 32% increase from last year, and that increase is largely due to COVID. Simply put, this study has shown that Lenzilumab is currently the **best therapeutic for hospitalized COVID patients.** Next step is to file for EUA application, which will c**ome any day now**. For reference, the last COVID therapeutic (Eli lilly's baricitinib) took just over a month from topline P3 data release to EUA submission. Also, Merck's (now discontinued) COVID therapeutic was given the stop sign by the FDA approx. 20 days after P3 data release saying that they needed more data before submission. Basically, if there was an issue w/ Lenzilumab, I expect we would've heard by now. **I expect successful application submission and eventual approval**
2. Humanigen reported positive phase 1b) results w/ Lenzilumab in it's CAR-T study [Zuma-19](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005250/en/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Data-With-Lenzilumab-in-the-ZUMA-19-CAR-T-Phase-1b-Study-in-DLBCL-and-Plans-to-Initiate-a-Potential-Registrational-Study). One big issue with CAR-T is its side effects - cytokine release syndrome and severe neurotoxicity. Lenzilumab prevents this, and the results of this study showed that. All 6 patients had an objective response rate (4 of them being complete), and no patients had severe CRS or NT at the recommended phase 2 dose. Given the promising results, $HGEN terminated their collaboration with KITE and plans to initiate a phase 2 study with **all commercially available** CD19 CAR-T therapies in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
3. Following the Zuma news, Humanigen brought on [Dr. Adrian Kilcoyne](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210421005213/en/Humanigen-Appoints-Dr.-Adrian-Kilcoyne-to-the-role-of-Chief-Medical-Officer) to be their CMO. Dr. Kilcoyne has a long history with big pharma (and was previously working for AstraZeneca), and has had extensive experience in CAR-T. Interestingly, he worked for Celgene corporation when they were acquired by Bristol-Myer Squibb. He oversaw the development of a DLBCL drug and was the US lymphoma CAR-T lead supporting the clinical development and launch preparation of Breyzani. Extremely bullish move for an expert in CAR-T to leave his cushy big pharma job and join Humanigen (his first small biotech company venture) following promising CAR-T clinical trial results imo.
4. More CAR-T news: [Recent Abstract](https://imgur.com/a/8ZiAr74) released (both CEO and CSO are authors) showing CAR-T cells w/ GM-CSF knock out ameliorates CAR-T cell early activation, reduces activation-induced cell death, and enhances antitumor activity. This is good. Another article [(published in nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-021-00255-4)) shows that GM-CSF knockout in CAR-T cells significantly improves side effects and maintains good efficacy: 0/3 patients exhibited neurotoxicity, and no CRS was observed in 2 patients (the third had grade 2 CRS). All 3 patients had complete responses. As I mentioned, Humanigen has a massive IP portfolio in GM-CSF neutralization, including GM-CSF knock out cells ([exclusive license w/ Mayo Clinic](https://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/7673719.htm)). ARK investments believes the cellular therapy TAM is [absolutely massive](https://twitter.com/TrumanFalkner/status/1382747618913046528)
5. Eversana, one of Humanigen's partners, is actively recruiting for account manager positions across the United States for commercialization of Lenzilumab. (search on Lin$%\^#%.com)
6. [Milestone payment](https://twitter.com/humanigen/status/1380556227302854660?s=20) from KPM Tech and Telcon RF Pharma (HGEN's Phillipines/Korean partner) for their successful P3 results
7. [NIH ACTIV-5 trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04583969) has added recruitment sites since release of P3 data
8. Humanigen also announced [positive phase 1 results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210409005083/en/Humanigen-Announces-Positive-Results-From-Phase-1-Study-of-Ifabotuzumab-in-Glioblastoma-Multiforme) for their solid tumor targeting drug (different drug!) Ifabotuzumab in glioblastoma. Additional studies are planned to evaluate ifabotuzumab as an antibody-drug conjugate in solid tumor patients.
9. [8.5mil shares short as of April 15](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hgen/short-interest). About 25% of the float and approx. 6 days to cover given the low volume trading. Given the illiquidity, there is a bit of a short squeeze potential.
10. The [average price target](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HGEN/research-ratings) of analysts for $HGEN is $34.29 ($21-$43)

After P3 results were released Mar. 29, HGEN shot up to $29 dollars and eventually settled around $22 dollars. HGEN then had a 5m share offering at $18.50 to increase funds for manufacturing. This dilution, along with a rough downtrend for the biotech market and the susceptibility to shorting given it's low volume, HGEN fell to around $13 dollars (admittedly, I was very wrong about the response to P3 data release in my original post). It has since rebounded and is still at a **great entry point** at $18.60 (anything sub-20 is a steal imo), close to it's recent offering. As mentioned in my original post, Humanigen has consistently stated the goal to produce 100k doses in the next year with an approximate $1bil revenue. This doesn't include stockpiling or potential ex-US partnerships. With a current market cap of about $1bil, Humanigen **can absolutely 5x their current value** based on COVID sales alone, and CAR-T implications massively increases $HGEN's ceiling as a long term hold. Humanigen is also a prime buyout target and their CEO Dr. Durrant specializes in these turnarounds. Given the market response to the P3 release, I expect the successful filing of EUA application to cause an even greater spike in the **$40ish+ range.**

[u/weentown](https://www.reddit.com/u/weentown/) also posted some great DD yesterday about $HGEN: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/n0hhzn/hgen\_humanigen\_due\_diligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/n0hhzn/hgen_humanigen_due_diligence/)

Other catalysts to watch out for: News regarding government orders of Lenzilumab, full release of P3 data in a peer-reviewed journal, ACTIV-5 updates, CAR-T updates

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally posted Mar. 25 on [r/stocks](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks): Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**\*\*What is it?\*\*:** Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**\*\*How does it work?\*\*:** GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (#variantagnostic). From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”… “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR). From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**\*\*Does it work?\*\*:** We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more:

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969): Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial**Competition**\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse:** As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well. How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6xGoogle cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx).

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market:** Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the takingOutside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+**

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST: $HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships**

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more:**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**\*\*TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.\*\***

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

On one hand the whole issue with having the cellphone market by the balls at one point and letting it slip away in such a complete and overwhelming way is hard to erase from your reputation. 
Their current business model does not rely on that anymore of course, but it is still something in the back of everyone's mind. They had other smaller blunders too. Basically everyone is adding a ""risk of bad business decisions"" discount to the stock.

On the other hand simply the stock performance in a chart. It has been going nowhere for many many years now, and it is a graveyard of investors who thought it had to go up sooner or later, only to end up giving up or having their money stuck there in limbo instead of riding the biggest bull market ever in basically any other stock or etf.

2021-04-29 06:11:03,stocks,I wouldn't worry about the short term. This stock is going places.
2021-04-29 06:54:07,stocks,"Sell....I cant see the long-term MOAT with Teledoc. Sure it has first mover advantage but it is an industry with very small barriers to entry. This will encourage other companies to try it if money is to be made. Once a big company such as Amazon, Walmart or Microsoft decide it is worth doing then it will be game over for Teledoc."
2021-04-29 07:34:23,stocks,I would hold they also have livongo health
2021-04-29 08:37:58,stocks,"It has fundamental business problems. Biggest being no major competitive advantage. Their network is not exclusive albeit once you are in an enterprise setting, its hard to shake said installation. 

The other issue is they cant turn a profit. I assume this is due to the cost of acquiring business which is probably astronomical for this business due to being in the healthcare sector.

The need to be bought out by a big company. Simple as that. Someone who is already deep into healthcare enterprise who can simply slip their service to their current clients as added value. Kind of like MSFT adding stuff to office to stay competitive. Otherwise, I think they will struggle to turn a profit.

Just my 2 cents."
2021-04-29 07:48:08,stocks,"Like I said in /investing...

I think it’s a losing business model that had transient pandemic use, that no one really wants or needs or can safely use at this point.

If it’s a simple work excuse note for an upset tummy, awesome.  On the other hand all in-person patient assessment, vital signs, blood work, etc... is skipped and bypassed.  Oops, it wasn’t gastroenteritis but actually an early appendicitis, bowel strangulation, silent heart attack, or a stage 3 pancreatic tumor...

For specialized emergent healthcare decisions, yea to an extent -somewhere remote- can buzz an interventional neurologist to help guide stroke management during an hours-long transfer to a primary center.  For a remote SF medic doing weird crap downrange, telemedicine brings awesome knowledge to the front.

Currently our system is doing 99% of consultations by phone.  Nobody is happy with that as a patient and wants in person.  I do know several people have died because bad stuff was missed, because telemedicine.  Middle aged white men tend to get stereotypical “crushing chest pain” heart attacks.  Women don’t...  some ethnicities don’t also.  So hey, here’s your sick note for an upset tummy and good luck with your silent MI.

When Apple upgrades to an iPhone “medical tricorder” platform, or Teledoc is installed as a “blood pressure, temperature and ecg machine booth” at Walmart or your nearby pharmacy,... maybe.

I’ve avoided Teledoc even more than I avoid the plague."
2021-04-29 05:53:53,stocks,still a good stock- undervalued atm.
2021-04-29 13:40:21,stocks,"Disclosure: I am long $TDOC

First I'll ask, why did you get into the stock? Has the investment thesis changed for you? Management is guiding almost 100% increase in revenue year over year ($1.09 million in 2020 vs $1,970 million to $2,020 million in 2021). The net loss that you're citing (-1.31/share) includes a stock based compensation expense of 0.57/share as the Livongo merger continues to vest. As I look through this thread I see a lot of references to Amazon taking market share and 'lack of a moat', 'anyone can do what TDOC does' etc. I addressed these concerns in the r/stocks earnings thread so I will copy/paste that here:

This is the investment thesis as I understand it - their technology (in terms of interview software) isn't their moat. Any hospital system can do what they do with zoom/skype/whatever. Their moat is actually in the sheer number of doctors on their network (55,000 physicians in over 450 subspecialties) and in their first mover advantage (over 40% of the fortune 500 are clients). Their first mover advantage gives them a large client base which entices physicians to their platform and employers are also then likely to go with the platform that provides their employees with the greatest/most diverse access to care.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention government acknowledgement here. 94% of Medicare advantage plans have said that they will offer telehealth benefits in 2021 vs 58% in 2020. TDOC currently has over 2.5 million Medicare advantage members. The pandemic lowered barriers such as CMS now allowing physicians the same rate of reimbursement for telehealth visits as they do for in person visits and CMS requirement not allowing patients to see providers without an existing relationship was removed.

Yes local hospital clinics could do this at a small scale but think about availability of staff and rural communities which currently do not have access to many of the subspecialties that TDOC can provide. 

I am most excited about their Livongo acquisition and the synergies it provides with their current service offerings for holistic care/remote monitoring. That, imo, is the driver of their next leg of profitability. AI data analytics can significantly reduce medical costs, especially with chronic disease care management. This is something businesses and healthcare companies have a large vested interest in"
2021-04-29 10:12:34,stocks,Buy
2021-04-29 08:47:26,stocks,"Yeah exactly.

Just how Amazon crushed:

Roku
Square
Spotify
Etsy
Shopify

Oh wait..."
2021-04-29 07:37:53,stocks,"Something like this doesn't get build up in a month it takes time , also big companies have other priorities , they focus on their core business, for teladoc this is   their core business they are 100% committed . Already over 50 million customers under their belt . The moat is bigger than you think it is . Don't underestimate smaller companies."
2021-04-29 08:50:58,stocks,You do realise growth companies - they don’t want to report profits really (or at least slim)?
2021-04-29 12:58:14,stocks,"I’m upvoting you because people are downvoting the truth. There is no future for this company. The service they offer has extremely limited uses and is easily replicated by any health care system out there. They had a brief advantage during the pandemic and that advantage is gone. Amazon has already taken this concept and offers their version free to all employees and their families, and I know for sure that the local health system I use created their own because I used it. Great concept, no way for teledoc to keep it for themselves."
2021-04-29 17:56:40,stocks,"You write all of this yet don't even mention the Livongo merger as a means to solving the equipment in homes concern.

EDIT: health professionals IRL misdiagnose all the time, this is a ridiculous take. 

With equipment in homes and the ability to get instant vitals, images etc and 24/7 instant access with your medical records immediately available it's absolutely bridging the gap and creating a complimentary system in which you use both IRL and telemedicine but save time and costs."
2021-04-29 07:16:30,stocks,It is not undervalued
2021-04-29 09:45:07,stocks,"Only time will tell.

I have no problem with people making money off teledoc and have no problem with the company. I wish everyone 10× off their investments. Just myself its more bear than bull."
2021-04-29 07:47:46,stocks,"I dont think Teledoc is going to go away and I think it will continue as a business. But at the moment within their space there is hardly any competition. With the low barriers to entry it is highly unlikely this will continue. All the big tech companies will have an interest in tele-health care due to the profits and you dont really need much more than a webcam and a streaming program, something Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft have, and with a big retailer such as Amazon or Walmart very easy to utilize.

I know teledoc has over 50 million subscribers but it will be very easy for doctors and patients to switch. I wish all teledoc shareholders the best but for me long-term I cant see past the bear case."

2021-04-29 09:43:40,stocks,Because it is one of the most ridiculously overvalued stocks currently on the market and the reddit crowd like hot stocks. If you buy zoom at current levels you are just giving your money away.
2021-04-29 09:57:18,stocks,"It's not like zoom is 100b because reddit bought some. 

All the zoom institutional investors buy because it's a good investment. I don't see it tho."

2nd time: It recovered back up to $27. I held thinking I wanted that $33 again I never got to sell at. It dipped back below $24.

3rd time: Oh look it is back up to $27 again! Imma hold for that $33 again. It dips down to $25.50. I am still holding but I am sure it will dip below $24 again.

Altria (MO) just released a shoddy earnings report which led me to panic sell.  I decided to hold after last week's bad news (government legislating reduced nicotine), but this was the last straw that made me reevaluate why the hell I'm in tobacco in a US-exclusive company.  At least PM makes sense as smoking is going up in the developing world, plus their revenues have been increasing (MO revenue slipped). 

Mining stocks are getting hammered today.   My other picks are underperforming or in the red. S+P 500 is currently up. This has been par for the course for the week. Why the hell am I not just in VOO or VTI?

I do have about 40% in a target retirement fund which is pretty much that (as far as I understand).  But I wanted to have a little fun with my brokerage, without doing anything too risky. 

Am I just being an idiot? Will a defensive portfolio truly be defensive or are index funds truly the best conservative play! 

Maybe I should just stay the course?  Defensive stocks did nicely so maybe some pullback was needed. Idk.

In the case of Facebook, the market didn't price in a blow out - in fact, most people weren't even talking about Facebook because they either hated the company or thought that its legal & moral troubles around the world would damage its revenue.

Not going to be able to put a post together but happy to put together some cliff notes. Ad revenue is back (google/fb earnings), this is not only their main business model but they bought an advertising studio this year and yesterday bought a bunch of Santa Monica office space.

Yesterday Bloomberg was gushing about how Apple and MSFT and Amazon (faang), the major tech companies are jumping to get back into the office, none of that telework only now for maojr tech. Roku is in line with them.

Roku had a minor dip as bears jumped over the fact that Roku spoke out about possibly losing Youtube TV soon because of Google's anti-competitive practices. It came back to finish green that day as the intelligent people are usually a step behind the people who just spam $BROKU and ""bad leadership"" (wut, roku has awesome leaderhsip). This is Roku showing us *yet again* that they are a major company. They won HBO late last year, which was pretty amazing, if YoutubeTV actually holds out I easily believe that is a greater loss to Google than Roku.

They are in an industry that is still growing itself, and the content part is their smallest operation. As analysts smarter than me have said, Roku still has namebrand opportunity but their industry is in the mid-game (as opposed to ecommerce's end game) where we can see how it sure looks to be shaking out. And Roku lets you invest big in streaming without picking between the 20 different content providers.

Search the sub, there's better DD than I can provide, I try to think more big picture and conceptually but others here have broken it down way better than me. Also love the stock's price right now compared to its February ATH, which it hit on both great earnings while raising future guidance. They have hit profit, granted that was due to pandemic, but they also were still in the stage of expansion, aka weren't really even trying to aim for profit at that stage, the pandemic just happened to get in the way (and imo covid showed us the future, even if stocks must temporarily go backwards).

They have deals with all the more budgetary smart TVs too. I just got a Samsung and its OS is trash. Unfortunately those major TVs will probably always want their own OS, but maybe eventually that's another room for Roku growth, as well as global growth.

Oh yeah we didn't even talk Superbowl streaming numbers and how much streaming is going to keep increasing. Just wait until rural American gets broadband internet throughout this year, they can't even stream yet..."

2021-04-29 07:39:37,stocks,"Kicked myself yesterday for being a total noob and paperhanding my partial SHOP share months ago during the correction without doing DD on just nutty their business model actually is and not getting it back while it was still cheap (I was a new investor in Jan and only bought it initially cause I was passed a tip from my brother and did no DD. Always do your DD folks).

Now kicking myself for not FOMOing in harder before yesterday’s close. Oh well still a bit of ways from its ATH. I’ll just look to keep carefully building a stake for it in my far more refined portfolio. I fine tuned it hard to actually fall in line with my interests and familiarity and SHOP fits in better than I ever could have imagined.

Edit: NVM the premarket was a lie. This SHOP dip is a good chance to easy my way in. Lol"

Sure we'd all love massive 10% days, and you're not gonna get that with VTI, but you get a bit more peace of mind and thats valuable in its own ways (at least for me).

Must be great for the lads in the market 10/20 years with large sums. If you had 100k in the S&P 3 years ago you'd have 160k now, average 20k per year"

Many of these people just started investing < 1 year ago and have only seen stocks moon since the march crash. Then, you add in the memes like gamestop and doge and all the new people are now expecting these returns for all stocks. It's really crazy, but I suppose people will only learn by staying in the market.

However, I'm sure some of them will get bored and just throw their money into more and more speculative junk in hopes of it mooning like the other memes. And those people will absolutely get burned and won't return to the market."
2021-04-29 14:08:51,stocks,"I think 2020 as a whole did that. People were able to buy pretty much any stock and it be up over 75% on it in a year. 

Makes it tough being someone who got into investing this year since Im not able to sit up 75% on a stock and ride out any 10% dips. Im getting in at the high and that is my own capital being lost on the 10% dips instead of house money."

2021-04-29 14:18:22,stocks,"It's just the huge opportunity cost of holding AAPL after September 2, 2020. You don't lose money, but you lost out on a lot of gains by not rotating to EVs or anything that broke out in the last 8 months.

You know I'm a big AMZN bull but even I dont think they will announce a split today.  Its a shame because even though I think their earnings are going to be stellar, I expect a dip in price because people were hoping for a split.

Keep holding though because I expect the dip to be temporary!

My guess for earnings:  EPS 11.2 and Revenue at 108.1 billion.  Price will drop 2.4% on the beat"
2021-04-29 16:11:00,stocks,Don't worry I'm sure it'll drop back down. Such is the way.
2021-04-29 16:47:36,stocks,"It ""sounds"" low but when you think about it its absolutely nuts.  We are talking about a 1.7 Trillion market cap company thats posting 40%+ increases year over year for multiple years in a row and still continues to provide double digit guidance increases.

So, in the short-term they are decreasing production and therefore revenue. And long-term they are focusing on fewer car models. No, Ford is not the choice. I suggest looking to GM if you want an American auto in your portfolio. They have planned for I think over 30 EV car models by 2025.

If it expires ITM, you have 100 shares at $99). The risk is that you buy in and the stock continues to fall. You'll still be buying in at your strike price."

2021-04-29 12:35:52,stocks,Maybe you should stop focusing on the weekly and start focusing on the yearly. Stressing over gains/losses over the span of a short few days or weeks is a losers game and isn't worth the effort.

2021-04-29 09:51:57,stocks,"Flat? They’re up another dollar-plus today, which means in the last 30 days it’s moved from $120 to $135, give or take. For a one-month gain, that’s pretty solid on a blue chip tech stock.

Edit: nm, it’s back down now, lol"
2021-04-29 09:53:02,stocks,I posted about this yesterday that it seemed similar to what happened to AMD. AMD killed it in earnings but the bump wasn't that much in AH compared to GOOG and FB. GOOG and FB went on to continue upwards the next day. AAPL's bump was small compared to FB last night. AMD ended up dumping the next day and I figured AAPL might too based on a similar trend. Sadly it appears that's what is happening. I think if there isn't a HUGE spike after earnings AH it means the stock isn't going to continue upwards the next day. It has to really be obvious that the bigger investors are excited.
2021-04-29 09:58:33,stocks,"AAPL tends to go down from earnings, it's odd. I think it's mainly the buildup that tends to be a thing and then people seem to profit take."
2021-04-29 10:02:03,stocks,"Well it's the biggest stock so I doubt it would be terribly mispriced.

Let's check the trailing 12month PE: 29.61

I think that's a fair PE ratio, it's not screaming cheap and not screaming expensive. It's basically the same as the other big tech stocks.

At least it didn't go down like MSFT. MSFT's trailing 12 month PE is 34.

FB's trailing 12 month PE is 27.

GOOGL's trailing 12 month PE is 31.

Also, no one can cry about big tech being overvalued at average 30 PE."

More than a meme stock, but not a short term investment. Also overpriced at the moment, for sure.

It has done me very well and if things keep looking up for it I will be able to pay for grad school only taking federal loans and paying the difference out of pocket.

2021-04-29 11:44:47,stocks,May I ask what you have done with it since?
2021-04-29 10:40:59,stocks,Right..there is always some bull shit number for why a stock or stocks are down

If you believe in the low end of 70% for herd immunity, that maybe gets us herd immunity after everyone willing AND undecided gets the shot. Considering we don't know how long the shot even lasts and it doesn't work 100% of time and that most numbers think Covid-19 herd immunity is more like 80%, we're not looking great. Frankly I don't need to see data to know at least 20% of people will only do what Tucker on Fox News tells them to do. These people were never anti-vax until more recently.

I would focus more on the obvious cruise ship PR disaster. Are they going to make everyone show vax papers? Just like all the people showing fake tests to gtfo out of India? Cruise ships were pretty much what brought Covid-19's attention to US.

I'm not putting, just would not trust a cruise ship."

Edit:
It makes perfect sense that governments want you to pay taxes regularly, rather than being able to postpone them indefinitely. They have their own regular expenses, on top of the higher risk of tax loopholes being exploited on the long term.

Imagine if every big investor and multibillion fund were able to postpone paying capital gains until they need to spend the money. Who would fund Biden’s new infrastructure plan, for example?"

&#x200B;

I've been pretty lucky still during these times and make 3 times my initial investment but let's be real, it's because the markets are fucking weird, and I am far to call myself a genius. I think that argument re: passive funds has been around for longer than I have existed, so no genius statement there, just a matter of fact."
2021-04-29 12:11:36,stocks,"I don't have a one size fits all. My main point was largely about how history has shown that passive funds tend to beat active funds long term. And just because I said I would choose a few of my own stocks doesn't mean that I'll outperform an ETF. It just means that I think it's a bit less risky to choose stocks within the ARKK funds that I think are fair value than going all in on ARKK itself. It's a little bit more nuanced. And even if I do choose some of those stocks, I am willing to admit that I still will most likely do worse than VTI. It's fun trying but of course there are no guarantees. It's a gamble and a calculated risk."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's cooperate as a community to give a hands on breakdown of how to do DD $DAN So, I searched for a ticket with my name and found DAN (Dana). And I thought it would be a good company to use for this exercise.

What I was thinking is, all together, we could explain and discuss how to do a step by step DD.

One of the reasons I chose this stock is that while the chart looks very good to a layperson, a quick Google search finds an article that suggests it is overvalued and potentially primed for a decline. So clearly a rounded approach to DD is necessary to make a well-informed decision on investments.

I also thought it best to do this with a little known stock so that we're not taking anything for granted, as may be the case with a well known company.

At best, we could help loads of people learn to do good DD. At worst, we could find a company worth investing in. Teach a man to fish, and all that...

Would anyone like to kick us off?"
2021-04-29 06:52:19,stocks,"I'll go for it. Good thing you got an interesting company that does something industrious rather than biotech or finance.


**Preliminary:**


First I look at the weekly chart on Yahoo Finance. I only want to look at companies **>5 years old**. Valuing IPOs is too much effort and difficulty, and just not my wheelhouse. I look for major peaks or troughs, just as a heads up to abnormal events. Might be merger or divestiture, special dividends, and whatnot. All I see so far is that this isn't a consistent growth company, good and bad times over the past 10 years, no easy meal. I check to make sure it has **decent volume/not a penny stock**/that the data will be healthy.


**Gather the Financial Statements:**


Then I look up the company on Edgar


Classic version


Search: ""10-k""


I **write down all the dates** starting from 2009 in my Excel sheet. The 2008-2009 time frame saw a lot of accounting changes, so it makes it more consistent formatting-wise to start from there. You really don't have to do 10+ years, 5 years would be fine. Especially if you're doing it by hand.


Then I start the avalanche of **opening them all up.**


Ctrl-tab (goes to next tab) through all the windows and **open the filing** (either the 10k statement, or the ex13)


**Create a folder** with the company name, and Ctrl-tab, **Ctrl-S, 2009.02.25k, Enter, Ctrl-tab**, Ctrl-S, 2010.02.25k, Enter, Ctrl-tab, Ctrl-S, 2011.02.28k, Enter


Do that 20-40 times and you've got all the 10ks and 10qs on-hand for easy reference.


You'll also want to find your own method to **save just the Consolidated Financial Statements (Balance, Income, Cash Flow)**. A good way to jump to them is **Ctrl-F ""the accompanying notes are"" or ""see notes to""**. This footer is seemingly the most unique phrase to the statements that aren't present in the rest of the sheet.


I suppose you could **save those pages of the PDF, print them out, or copy/paste them somewhere.**


So that's what I'm going to do now. I'll be back in an hour or two."

**Balance Sheet:**

**Cash Flow Statement:**

* Investing Activities
* Financing Activities


These are a ""skeleton"" because all companies (except Financials and REITs so far as I've come across) will have these. They might be under a different name, but they're there.


**With these terms,** you can do a whole lot of visualization and graphing, and get a good understanding of the basic financial position of the company.


**Beyond these terms,** there's a whole lot more in a financial statement that can answer questions you might have about the data. The nature and terms of their debt, the type of assets they hold, preferred or common shares. More and more detail.


**Outside of the financial statement,** the 10-ks and 10-qs can explain more complex scenarios or present those 'future-looking statements'. I do not read every one, but it's good to skim through the most recent. They also explain mergers/acquisitions, special dividends, splits.


There are always more opinions than people, but I'm fairly confident in saying that the above are ""basics"". I look at lots and lots of skeletons and hardly ever look beyond that. But it's the niche I feel comfortable in. Folks will argue about the validity of different ratios, and what people *should* look at.

Just copy-pasting the article below since I was curious (analyst’s view, not mine)

………….

In his sell rating on Apple shares late Thursday, arguing that the current iPhone upgrade cycle looks more like a typical redesign cycle rather than the “supercycle” some were hoping for. Hall has been bearish on Apple’s stock since April 2020.

“As a result we continue to expect iPhone replacement rates to resume their ongoing decline in 2021,” he wrote, helping drive his below-consensus forecasts for the full year and particularly the second half of the year. “In addition, our negative thesis on Apple is based on [average selling prices] remaining roughly unchanged in 2021 as consumers shift toward lower priced iPhones and this seems to be beginning to play out in supply chain orders.”

The analyst is worried that Apple is cutting production orders, while customers are beginning to prefer lower-priced iPhones compared to their more expensive counterparts. On the shorter term, however, Hall does believe that Apple will report a strong holiday quarter given “solid consumer demand.”

And while the COVID-19 pandemic has limited people’s ability to spend on things like travel and eating out, potentially leaving them with more spending money for electronics like Apple products, the analyst believes that a shift to out-of-home spending as the economy starts to reopen could be a “negative catalyst” for the Cupertino company’s shares.

“We believe the shift of consumer disposable income toward vacations, restaurants, and other outside of the home spending as re-opening occurs is likely to act as a negative catalyst for Apple’s stock just as COVID lockdowns represented a tailwind,” writes the analyst."

2021-04-29 06:54:41,stocks,"Analysts and other commentators have no special insight into what's going on. Analysts have a spreadsheet that was created for them in the 70's, and all they do is change the variables in them and report the number that it spits out. 

If you're going to an analyst to get deeper insight into a stock, you've gone to the wrong place.

Another thing to note is that commentators and headlines just report on some arbitrary metric and then they create a headline around that. 

""Insiders are buying - it's a sign!"" Yes, insider buying can sometimes be a sign, and it's actually one I use myself when I do research, but it's stupid to make that a headline because anyone who's interested in the stock has most likely already looked into insider buying. 

Another one is ""This CEO's compensation is elevated compared to earnings, an annual meeting might bring that up!"" - No, the annual meeting won't bring it up. It's just one metric a headline picked out because they can put an exclamation point after it. 

If you're motivated to buy a stock because of a headline by a commentator or, god help you, Motley Fool, then you need to take a breather. Their job isn't to sell the stock, it's to sell the headline. Same goes for analysts - their job isn't to sell the stock, it's to sell the analysis.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Hedging portfolio with this instrument: LU0832435464 is it viable, what are the hidden risks, am I missing something.  

Hi all, first post here I hope I can get some solid advice.

I am **33**, **european** investor on **DeGiro**, started investing in 2017 and built a **portfolio** of around **40k**. Position are mainly in **tech stock, S&P500 and other broad ETF**. I have a general exposure to the market and I would like to cover myself with some hedging. I do not want to use stop loss or similar strategies as I want full control over my actions.

I found this product:

Lyxor S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF - Acc

[https://www.lyxoretf.es/es/retail/products/alternatives/lyxor-sp-500-vix-futures-enhanced-roll-ucits-etf-acc/lu0832435464/eur](https://www.lyxoretf.es/es/retail/products/alternatives/lyxor-sp-500-vix-futures-enhanced-roll-ucits-etf-acc/lu0832435464/eur)

to my understanding this ETF tracks **S&P 500 VIX Futures** and it seems that it goes up when volatility is high and down when volatility is low. **It was around 50 euros back in 2012** and it steadily went down to **3/4 euros as of now in 2021**, and it spiked to 12 euros in march during the drop in the market.

**In the same period my S&P500 ETF went from around 100 to 400. So when the market did 3/4X, the VIX ETF did -90%.**

My idea(and the advice I am requesting) is: can I expect a similar pattern in a future crash/bear market? What are the risk I may not see? How does this VIX Futures trackers really works? I read some pages on the CBOE website but I really did not get what does it do and how it works, I only understand that the pattern seems to be the exact opposite of the market.

Since I have some cash aside, I wanted to invest something(maybe around 1000Euros) on this ETF. When a crash and a bear market eventually come, my portfolio could drop significantly(let's say 40%or around 15k) and these 1000 could do anything from 5x to 15x.

In this way i would not see a big loss on paper. Furthermore, I could sell the VIX ETF and increase my position in the S&P500 buying at a discount to lower the average withouth using additional cash(setting some money apart to pay taxes on the gains from the sale of VIX ETF).

I am asking for advice for 2 reasons:

1 - I do not really understand how volatility and the VIX Futures benchmark works

2 - **I follow a long term cost average strategy, I have never sold and will not sell in a long time**(I am building a portfolio for my retirement and I know I cannot time the market). If I buy just to hedge my portfolio I will not sell, only limit my loss on paper during the volatility period. However, if I sell when the VIX ETF is high I would have to somehow time the market, and this is something I am not yet comfortable with.

So I am asking for any advice or clarification on my situation, any tip is appreciated as I do not have any close person to ask advice to, only you guys from the internet.

Thanks in advance for your replies!

TLDR:

Position of 40k in broad market ETF and tech stocks. Looking to hedge my portfolio with **Lyxor S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll UCITS ETF - Acc** but not sure how it works and how it relates to the S&P500. Further doubts on whether to buy and hold or buy and time a sale when the rest of my portfolio drops 20 to 40 percent in the next crash/bear market."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Tesla targeted by the party, will Elon soon get the Jack Ma treatment? The protest action at the Shanghai auto show could have been a targeted attack against Tesla. According to media reports, the woman got into the fair by means of a NIO entry pass (and drove there with a NIO). It is questionable whether this action originated from NIO, or perhaps from a higher authority such as the party.

The official media in China has repeatedly accused Tesla of blaming customers for accidents and of not paying attention to quality control. The Chinese state media Global Times called Tesla's attitude arrogant and overbearing. Tesla then apologized and promised full cooperation with the authorities.

I doubt that the party wants to exclude Tesla from China, but it is safe to assume that they do not want to see their domestic carmakers stand no chance against the American. Perhaps they are trying to shake consumer confidence in Tesla through such targeted actions, and keep many people from buying the vehicles. 

Whatever the intention behind the Chinese state media's constant fire against Tesla, it is not good. You can't have a more dangerous enemy in China than China."
2021-04-29 04:33:51,stocks,"Tesla is a foreign company so the situation is different from that of Alibaba.

I doubt that they would do anything major against Tesla but they will likely use this to weaken their brand in China and to extract more advantages from them in terms of technology transfer (what China is most interested in). The fact that this incident is being amplified so much in China indicates that a CCP agenda is at play.

Nobody should imagine that China will allow a Western company to compete unhindered in an industry that China has the ambition to dominate at global level.

Imo this is part of a wider picture that many optimists don't see clearly yet. The competition between China and the West will continue to intensify so global markets will become increasingly fragmented and more impacted by geopolitical and security considerations. There is little that the Biden administration can do to change this, because China views itself as a competitor for the position of hegemon and they will continue to aim for it under the current leadership."

me personally have nio bias whatsoever.I personally just think that - no matter the market - national products always have advantages in terms of market acceptance, taxes etc.

chinese cars will be the mainstay in china. no matter what TSLA does, they will end up being the luxury variants like european / german cars were (think of Mercedes and BMW).

Tesla are going to need a lot of ""goodwill"" to get the government to step in and put a stop to the frivolous accusations that will come rolling in once people see what benefit they can get from these scams.

One big difference with the competition is simply their unique business model. These companies are already thriving under normal conditions, and even a bit more so during a global pandemic. But not only the sales development and the margins are impressive. The strong network effects that tie customers to the companies and into the ecosystems are also unparalleled. 

I've been getting slight second thoughts over the past few months as big tech has tended to sit on the sidelines as banks and industrial stocks have taken off. But as of last night, I'm more convinced never to part with them.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Buying stocks after they go above your average price Hello everyone, I'm new at investing so I would like to ask a question. How do all of you invest into a stock that has already went above your average price? Or do you just wait for it to drop below average price and then you load it up? There some stocks that I want to load up more, but they do not dip below my average price. Thank you for the answers"
2021-04-29 02:33:35,stocks,"I think 🤔another question to ask yourself is: “What do you reasonably expect as a target 🎯price/return in ‘XYZ’ stock and over what period of time via greater equity & value & dividends? 

For example, recently I sold 25 shares of $MRO @ $11.70 after buying in at $10.55 8 months ago, because I thought it had basically peaked and was likely to only go to $12 over the next year or so. 

Why bother tying up my capital for that much longer to at best realize another 2.5% even if I could dollar-cost avg. down? I had made 11% in 8 months. Not bad;but not great in this current market either. There’s prolly better returns for the same money 💰 than $MRO right now.

So, if you’re not a “value” or “growth” or “Growth At Any Reasonable Price (GARP)” investor, what kind of investor do you aim to be? 

Answering that philosophical and practical question may help you to answer when to buy, when to hold and when to sell whatever stock you’re holding or considering?

Hope that helps. As one investor’s style of investing may not suit another, I don’t know at this juncture what more I could advise without knowing more about your goals and philosophy?

2021-04-29 02:34:59,stocks,"My philosophy is, depends on the stock. Maybe was a good pick and it’s not going to dip below average price again. In that case I’m bullish, buying more. Not so sure about it wait for the dip or sell and maybe buy back in on dip. Buy high sell low"
2021-04-29 03:09:53,stocks,"If you are going to hold for a longer time, like blue chips or you can't be bothered to check the stock market every day, then buy more if you think the price will go further up."

I don't add to day trade positions. Ever. I'll average down swing trades, but not up. And Long term investments, I'll wait a modest amount of time for a dip, but I don't worry too much about price, and I will buy anyway if I don't see a significant dip within a certain amount of time. All of my long terms are either dividend stocks/reits or stocks and etfs that I expect massive growth in over the next 30 years, so I ain't tripping on price."
2021-04-29 03:37:02,stocks,"The whole point is that, eventually, stocks will go up. That's the hope anyway. 

Today's all time highs are tomorrow's dips. Eventually, the price will stay above your average cost and at each point you're thinking of buying/selling you should be trading based on your strategy and price target. 

If it's a diverse index tracker or a high conviction stock that you're strongly expecting to go up, just keep DCAing in and don't care about the short term fluctuation since it's going to be a miniscule blip of movement in a few years time."

The ticker was about 45$ when I started working for them in October 2019. It's almost double now at 83$ and even rallied during a time a commercial real estate company should not.  I bought an options contract that's detailed below. It expires in late September 2021. Someone, please tell me if I made a terrible decision. Please any and all advice appreciated. It was a drunk no sleep buy and I'll either make some money or lose it all right?

2021-04-29 01:26:39,stocks,"Well at least you bought a slightly itm call option, but the stock is still up 50+% last six months and needs to be at $88 by Sept just for you to break even.

I don't think it's a terrible move to follow it for the next five months perhaps consider a max loss on it...better than gambling on weeklies...do you want to lose all $800 or consider closing it out if it drops to $4.00"
2021-04-29 18:44:54,stocks,"First of all relax, your max loss is 826$. While it depends on how much that is for one person, it might be good to know you can't lose more than that and already lost it.

I personally never bothered about the Greeks. Not that it's not worth it, but the rest is enough for me.

In short when you buy an option you pay a premium that is depending on the strike price, current share price and expiration date.

The premium will always include the difference for In the money calls, so for example if you buy at a strike price of 10$ but the shares are at 12$, then the premium will be at least at 200$+extra.

The reason I explain that is for 4 scenarios:

-1 the call expires below strike price, you earn nothing and paid the premium so the loss is 826

-2 the call is in the money,  now the real deal begins.

When your call is in the money you can sell it to someone else. Well, you can do that at any point, but if it's in the money and you sell it you receive the premium they pay. If the premium is equal or more than you paid (826) then you make a profit or at least no loss. This matters prior to expiration date, so let's say up to in 2-3 months. Of course it will also matter after that, but the less time is left, the less the premium will matter and the more the difference in strike and share price plays a role. While the premium always includes the difference, the value of time decreased.

The other option is to hope it keeps rising. Since you paid a premium of 8.26 per share at a strike price of 80, the required value of the stock has to be 88.26 for you to break even, excluding premium. E.g. on the last day right before it expires. 

And this covers all 3 cases. Make yourself fully aware you already lost 826$ and now you have to consider how you continue. The next point will be if the stock price + premium left is enough for you, e.g. a stock price of 82 and a premium of 4 per share means you will receive back 86$ for each shade you bought the right to purchase for at 88.26$, so you gain back 600$. If you wait until way later and the share price is still at 82$ and the premium is only 1 per share, then you can sell it for 300 - as long as someone buys it. But if it goes up far enough it could cover the expense and even make you a profit. That's where the gamble comes in and why you should make an exit strategy right away. Make yourself aware whenever you don't accept to receive back any amount the potential loss is back at the full 826 out of this call, but when you sell the call the value you get realizes your initial loss - the gained profit, so a guaranteed loss if sold earlier. Can be still better than losing 826, also can be worse than making a profit."
2021-04-29 01:44:31,stocks,Thanks for the reply! I'm really confused by the greeks. If it goes over 88 to say 94 what is the profit per share of the 100 shares in the contract?
2021-04-29 02:20:29,stocks,"I would recommend watching a youtube video on option greeks as they take your option trading to a much higher level but here is a brief overview - You can think of delta as the number of shares that contract is worth. For ex - a 0.88 delta means that for every $1 dollar increase in the underlying share price your contract will gain 88 cents in premium. Gamma is the rate of change of delta. As your contract gets further in the money your delta will increase. Theta is how much the value of your contract decreases per day that you hold it. Theta decay really hits about 30 days before contract expiration

Edit - hard to calculate exact profit at a certain price due to effects of implied volatility and time left till expiration once that price is hit but you can use an online option profit calculator to get a rough idea"
2021-04-29 01:46:16,stocks,I would close it if it went that low for sure and I can close it anytime and just take the loss of current price minus price in the contract per share correct?
2021-04-29 09:11:45,stocks,"Check out http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com

At expiration your option would be worth $14 if the stock were at $94.  If it goes to 94 in like June it'd be worth even more since there would also be time value left."
2021-04-29 02:31:55,stocks,"Thank you!  The greeks seem far less opaque now and Investopedia ain't got shit on you, good sir."
2021-04-29 02:24:51,stocks,"Yes, as an example if it dropped to $4.00 per contract you could ""sell to close"" the contract to realize a $426 loss. I would recommend looking into vertical spreads as a way to lower your risk/reward if that is something you're interested in"
2021-04-29 09:26:25,stocks,Glad I could help! Options are a great tool to have in your toolbox as an investor. They can juice your returns and add regular income. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have about it
2021-04-29 11:20:56,stocks,Yes holy shit allready up two days after purchase at 9.00 $
2021-04-29 12:10:34,stocks,"I just took a look at the option and it looks like there's very low open interest (34 contracts). Only one contract was traded today. This is concerning because it may be difficult for you to sell the contract to someone else at the price you want. Next time try to look for options that have a tight bid-ask spread, high open interest, low implied volatility"
2021-04-29 12:29:17,stocks,That might change by September when I want to sell right ?
2021-04-29 12:29:50,stocks,If it's made profit I assume ?
2021-04-29 12:59:43,stocks,"It's possible as the date moves closer that will change, yes. Keep in mind what I mentioned about theta before though. Longest I would hold on to the contract is early to mid august"
2021-04-29 18:48:27,stocks,"Don't confuse this. If no one is willing to buy that call, then no one will pay the current premium that would set you into making a profit. It's similar to selling a share you own but no one wants to buy it - that order can stay open for weeks if not months, and you have to watch if it loses or gains value, second case of course better. But since options naturally lose value over time, which is included in the premium, it hurts more"

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Using margin for REITs? Anyone use margin for REITs? It would seem to be an easy money maker if Robinhood margin is charged at 2.5% APR. 

If I bought 100 shares of O at $69 each on margin, the margin interest would cost about $14 per month. But the monthly dividend for 100 shares pays out $23 per month, so I would still come out with a $9 monthly profit.

Would this blow up in my face?"
2021-04-28 23:27:28,stocks,Keep in mind also the tax you will owe on the dividends from the REIT- which I believe would be charged as ordinary income - so that would be eating into your $9 even more.

2021-04-29 08:22:44,stocks,"If you keep margin levels slim, then it works. There are tons of leveraged ETF's that do something very similar.

That said, if you want low margin look at Interactive Brokers. They tend to have the lowest rate but its tier based. More you have, the lower your rate.

The other issue with all this is whether or not its even worth it. If your portfolio is small, say around $100k, and your profit gap is like 1.5%, then 0.015 \* $25k = $375... per year... kind of silly when you think about it. Even if you had $1m, then you are only adding about $1k a year in income.

Granted this is extra profit but its also risky because you tie up your cash and you wont be able to capitalize on times when cash is powerful (like market dips and such)."

Amazon - 504.12M shares outstanding @ 3,458.50/share == $1.743T Market Cap

APPLE      - 16.79B shares outstanding  @ 133.58/share == $2.24T market Cap 

So while the price per share is sig. lower there are sig. MORE shares of apple out there as APPLE has issued, what, like 33 times more shares than amazon.  

if you were to divide Apple's current Market Cap (2.24T) by Amazons share count  (504.12M) APPLE would be at a price of 4,443/share."

""Have they lost their innovation edge?"" ""Has Steve Jobs run out of ideas?"" ""Can Tim Cook ever get 1/10th as brilliant and strategic as Steve?"" and on and on and on. So yea, Marketwatch reporter, Apple had blow-out, call-your-mom, oh-holy-sh\*t did you see that kinda earnings.

There was a time when a yahoo email address was the universal email address that was independent of your ISP, company, or school.  Yahoo would not fix its spam problem until GMail came along and forced them to.  That was basically the story of everything at Yahoo: Sit still with your thumb up your ass and don't lift a finger to improve anything.  It is a case study in how the founder of a company may not be the person you want running it."

2021-04-28 23:24:14,stocks,"I still have a Yahoo email account.  I use it for online orders so the etailer spam goes there.  :)

Email is a case in point.  They used to have horrible spam.  They never improved it until gmail came along and did not have spam.  It took Yahoo about a year after that to get its spam under control, and by that time all the ""cool kids"" had moved to gmail.  It was not just the spam.  Gmail used Javascript front end to make a more responsive web application.  

Yahoo groups could be viewed as a early version of Reddit.  They let that die on the vine.

The whole reason people began using Yahoo in the first place was its directory and its search.  They let that wither.

Yahoo had web hosting for small businesses.  It was horrible.  The most basic web host with an open source control panel was better than Yahoo.

The company's history is a history of missing out on opportunities when it had first mover advantage.

I have to think that once the advertising dollars started rolling in from being the default page in browsers that the company stopped caring about anything else."

2021-04-29 11:55:12,stocks,"> Verizon's own email is still integrated into Yahoo.

for fios users at least, it's integrated into aol (well, unless is a regional thing  where fios users in different parts of the country get different providers, but this seems unlikely). unfortunately, it's every bit as much trash as one would expect.

it does server side spam filter that can't be disabled, which then in turn causes anything it improperly flags to not go  into a local email client like thunderbird/outlook/etc. because it's already been pulled out of the new mail queue.

contacted them like 2 years ago about how to disable that  and just got a response saying it wasn't possible and that ""they submitted it as a feature request"". it never happened.

(additionally, while there is a whilelist  option  for the spam filter, in their brilliance they decided to forbid it from accepting wildcard chars such as \*)"

They usually start something like:

“Here’s my analysis of $WXYZ. They are deeply undervalued because of the headwinds it’s industry is experiencing. Their moat is really strong, as none of their competitors have as loyal customers as WXYZ……”

If someone wants to share in-depth DD on a company it just makes sense that they would help the reader get at least a minimal understanding of what the company does before going into detail. 

I'm not saying it's not important to do your own research, just that it shouldn't be necessary to look up basic information before you're even done reading the DD."

Obviously, it is in my interest to go through as much info as I can, and to sort through companies in my circle of competence, and do not keep reading things outside of my circle. If I’m not sure what a company does, I will say that it is not in my circle, and move on.

I assume that people who make this great pieces of DD make them because they hope that they get read, and one way to not accomplish that is to create confusion in the reader’s mind..

In my view, it is in the interest of the reader AND the writer, and as a result, in the interest of the community and subreddit, to keep a basic editorial language that ensures basic communication protocols. 

In other words, please just say “this company does X”.. is not that hard.. you already made a 14 paragraph dissertation, surely you can add 5 words"

2021-04-29 09:35:45,stocks,"It depends on how deep the information provided is. If its just ""This company makes software for automated driving"" - then i will need to google more anyway if im taking this seriously. 

If its a detailed overview of the company, their competitors, their leadership, their product offering, the general sentiment...etc... then we are getting outside the territory of a DD and it's unreasonable to expect every person who is interested in delivering a DD to also include that section for those unwilling to look it up on their own. 

The time save is realized when i say ""nah i dont care about this stock"" and proceed to not read the next 600 words of the DD. Versus reading 300 words, realizing i have no clue what im reading about, and then backtracking and ultimately having to re-read the whole thing. If i dont know or care about the stock, im not going to read the DD. 

I dont think cruising around reading every DD in hopes of finding a gem is the proper way to go about researching/finding stocks. DD's are for DD's and they are granular/specific, not ""check out this cool stock""."

Given the nature of Apple's products it is a reasonable conclusion that its revenue has been juiced by stimulus money.  That is ironic in itself; money that purportedly was to help the economy and aid struggling families instead went to huge huge companies like Apple, which don't need any help, and to buy toys, which families did not need.  What happens after the recovery?  Do these companies have their revenue/earnings decrease with the consequent hit to their stock prices?

Their reasoning was to use the money for R&D, fair, but I also see it as a a strategic move, putting buy backs on hold means when Biden hands them a big check, there is less scrutiny on the situation. I dont think Biden and his administration want to be associated with handing cash to big businesses that blatantly use it for buy backs and executive salaries, something that happened during Trump, and the Dem's were vocal about the issue.

I think INTC will grow into a boeing-like situation. Public company, sells product all over the world, but its a national asset that is crucial for national defense.

Apple Posts Record Revenue for Quarter

Demand for new 5G iPhones helps fuel a more than doubling of profit to $23.6 billion

Apple Inc. AAPL -0.60% reported record revenue Wednesday for the January-to-March quarter because of surging sales of premium iPhones and pandemic-induced buying of its other products.

&#x200B;

Demand for new, higher-priced 5G iPhones helped fuel a more than doubling of profit to $23.6 billion off $89.6 billion in revenue. On a per share basis, the company said Wednesday, Apple earned $1.40, beating analyst expectations of 99 cents.

&#x200B;

Apple didn’t provide any guidance in its release for this quarter. Chief Executive Tim Cook is expected to speak publicly with analysts this evening.

&#x200B;

Investors are looking for signs that growth will continue, even as the tech sector struggles with a microchip shortage and other uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Some shareholders are evidently jittery. Shares rose 1.3% this year through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 was up about 12%.

“There’s just so little room for error—it makes it really challenging,” said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings. “The market always looks six months ahead.”

&#x200B;

Apple and other tech giants have benefited as students and workers stuck at home turned to their products in record numbers, pushing share prices to new heights. Apple’s stock almost doubled last year. Its current valuation, as a measure of its price-to-earnings ratio, is the highest since December 2007, according to FactSet, ratcheting up expectations for the company’s results.

Google-parent Alphabet Inc. beat sales records in the latest quarter thanks to an increase in digital-ad spending, and Microsoft Corp. saw its quarterly sales increase 19%.

&#x200B;

Even as the world’s biggest tech companies continue to post record results, they remain in the crosshairs of regulators and investigators who are scrutinizing how they wield market power. Apple’s strength in the market is being questioned by smaller tech companies.

&#x200B;

Apple this week rolled out software changes to iPhones and iPads to make it harder for apps to track users across the internet, a measure touted by Mr. Cook as a consumer safeguard. Facebook Inc. and others have questioned Apple’s motives in the matter.

Apple is on the eve of going to trial in federal court to defend itself against claims by the maker of the popular videogame “Fortnite” that the iPhone company is engaged in anticompetitive behavior in its app store. Apple has denied wrongdoing. Observers are also watching for regulators in the European Union to reveal results soon of their investigations into claims of Apple’s monopoly behavior. Apple has said the complaints are baseless and defended its role in promoting businesses on its App Store.

&#x200B;

Apple stopped providing detailed guidance about coming quarters last year, as Covid-19 upended daily life around the world and initially sent markets falling amid fears of a global recession. Still, analysts and investors will be looking for any signs of how Mr. Cook is feeling about the months ahead.

Combined with the previous quarter’s results, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is on pace, according to analysts’ estimates, to finish with an annual profit topping last year’s record tally by more than 20%.

&#x200B;

Much of the growth last year was fueled in unexpected places. Apple saw record demand for Mac computers and an 11% rise in iPad tablet sales. That growth continued in the March period. On Wednesday, Apple said Mac sales rose 70% to $9.1 billion and iPads increased 79% to $7.8 billion. That beat analyst expectations for increases of 27% and 29%, respectively.

&#x200B;

The real engine of 2021 is the latest iPhone: Overall iPhone revenue rose 65% to $47.9 billion. Analysts had expected a 42% rise.

&#x200B;

Higher-end versions of the iPhone 12 appear to be boosting that figure. The average retail price in the U.S. during the past three months rose $52 to $847 from a year earlier, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC, which surveys buyers.

&#x200B;

The most expensive version, the Pro Max with a 6.7 inch display that starts at $1,099, saw its share grow to 20% of sales from 13% a year earlier, the survey found.

&#x200B;

The addition of faster 5G cellular connections to this year’s phone was expected to help Apple in China, where competitors had beaten Mr. Cook to market with more advanced phones. Greater China sales nearly doubled to $17.7 billion."

2021-04-29 15:11:10,stocks,I bought Apple at 134  in September and the thing hasn’t moved at all despite their numbers...
2021-04-28 20:29:46,stocks,Man wish I’d bought more calls. Most of my mega tech earnings calls were on Microsoft. At least I bought them a month ago so they’re still up quite a bit but damn wish I bought more on Apple or Facebook now.
2021-04-28 21:56:52,stocks,Thanks to the pandemic people are realizing how important/good it is to have decent hardware/phones/tablets around the house. That's the only reason I can think that Apple sales went up this much.

2021-04-28 23:12:22,stocks,Weird that Apple stock gave up about half of its aftermarket gains already. Google held the 5% gain all last night and through most of the day today.
2021-04-28 22:23:25,stocks,“Guh”
2021-04-28 22:28:38,stocks,Sales up 54%!! The fact that Apple valuation is not at 100x multiple speaks to just how ridiculous the market is.... all driven by memes and viral trending.

2021-04-28 20:22:06,stocks,Apple is why I look for stock in things that are easy to use and stupid friendly. I see so many people looking for the next genius idea. Meanwhile the general population is pretty dumb and likes paying ridiculous prices for anything from headphones with a special stamp to lawyers fighting their right to repair things they buy.
2021-04-29 06:30:10,stocks,And all this after the news of them supporting the slave camps in China. Heartbreaking that people only care about minorities and people when it’s in their country or ethnicity. Asian lives matter!

Also, the amount of people who are actually hurting and NEED the stimulus compared to the amount of people who are doing absolutely fine, but still receiving a stimulus is insane.  I've been able to save like no other this past year, never lost my job, yet I still get stimulus deposits in my bank account.  Not going to complain, but makes it really easy for me to say fuck it, free money, let's go buy a new Macbook!"

But looking at how anything x86 pales againt M1, M2 and the PC laptop market will have absolutely nothing in the foreseeable future that can even compete with a Macbook Air, I'm very optimistic regarding growth in that niche! Just wait until they put 1, 2, 3 or more M1 units into one product like maybe the upcoming mac pros --- if they get it right these can be computing beasts at a power efficiency unheard of in the desktop space. Just love how Intel got jack shit, AMD is taking over the remainder of x86 and Apple pulls technologically ahead. Nvidia joins in from the sidelines with pure GPU tech plays."

Until the world doesn’t need phones or is no longer getting technologically advanced, Apple will grow unless we have a reason otherwise. I remember years ago when people said Apple hit a growth ceiling when it was still around 500 billion dollars. Now it’s worth over 2.2 trillion"

2021-04-29 02:01:54,stocks,OG here as well.  Started buying 1997 AAPL when Steve came back and when I saw the first PowerMac G3 Bondi Blue with the side opening panel. I knew this is going to be an amazing company. I continue to invest modestly over the year and never sold. One mistake I made was NOT heavily invested in 2007/8 where I knew iPhone is going to be revolutionary.
2021-04-29 11:22:42,stocks,I also bought Apple in 2009. It was my first stock purchase ever. I was excited to sell a couple years later for a little over double my money. Continued to rebuy and sell over the years. Had $35k of Apple in 2014 when it was stagnant so I sold flat and now I’m reallllyyyyyy wishing I never sold that. Womp womp. TLDR: never sell Apple. Buy dips
2021-04-28 23:46:56,stocks,Im in the same boat and prefer to think in terms of cost basis. Is like 1/3 of portfolio on market value but under 10% of basis
2021-04-29 11:36:22,stocks,"Same here, bought in 2010. Learned about covered calls last year, allowed some shares to be called away because I was way overweight in AAPL.

I just switched to the 12 mini because I wanted a smaller phone and all of my friends (people in their 20s) have iPhone 12s. Not having an iPhone for young people these days is basically like being left out. You can’t FaceTime your texts show up a different color your tinder photos don’t look as good. Now you’ve got to buy a laptop earbuds watch tv and tags too. And all of those things are bought new again every 2-5 years. Apple is going to continue to explode. If you own an iPhone you probably aren’t even considering competitors products because they won’t work as well for you. This isn’t even considering their self driving cars and their credit card."

2021-04-29 14:40:36,stocks,"I don't think anyone gets broken up because in the end, it will harm the user experience if it is done. Will iPhones be better without the App Store? Will Instagram be profitable enough to survive without FB? Will Amazon be able to offer such a good experience to consumers without the profits AWS brings in? The answer to all of those questions is likely no."
2021-04-29 10:18:29,stocks,"yes, by 6% or 57m shares.  So he's still very much in APPL"
2021-04-29 11:14:03,stocks,Sounds great! Once I find my time machine I’ll get in even earlier.
2021-04-29 00:05:32,stocks,This is the way.

2021-04-29 09:03:39,stocks,Wow now I feel pretty dumb good thing it was one small put.
2021-04-29 12:30:53,stocks,$135 put worked well lmao
2021-04-28 22:33:06,stocks,Right on!
2021-04-29 14:41:51,stocks,Thank you
2021-04-29 16:07:57,stocks,and it usually means that the price will go up afterwards
2021-04-29 01:21:01,stocks,ok
2021-04-29 14:14:12,stocks,Good.
2021-04-28 22:47:49,stocks,Oh no this is as real as Nike paying .05 per shoe in China and charging you $200
2021-04-28 22:13:45,stocks,"I know a lot of artists. None use Apple for their work, with the exception of one musician (but he also uses windows).

But you are missing the point. I didn't say I dont think Apple is popular. I said I cant understand how they are popular. Their products are meh. I liked Apple when I was younger and before and not long after the original iPod came out, but in my opinion they have progressively become a ""luxury"" product that isnt really any better than the competitors."
2021-04-29 14:16:28,stocks,"Pay no mind.  As his username suggests, he’s been huffing a bit too much of his own hot air."
2021-04-28 21:43:32,stocks,Ive just never known anyone to buy Apple shit that wasnt basically tech inept to the max. Usually theyre buying for big easy buttons and the promise that Apple is better for artsy stuff while also being easier to use. Its just sad lol. Ive never known anyone to switch from Apple products to Microsoft/Android and be upset about it. Ive also never known anyone whos switched from Microsoft/Android to Apple and wasnt upset.
2021-04-28 21:57:14,stocks,maybe something like a Tesla increase
2021-04-28 23:09:53,stocks,"i was 134  and i sold most of my shares today after market.

bagholding this is not worth the opportunity cost.

there are better stocks out there to make faster money"
2021-04-28 21:37:24,stocks,Apple’s bullish on Apple.
2021-04-28 21:54:58,stocks,Isn't it priced in?
2021-04-28 21:25:31,stocks,Your part of the pie increases
2021-04-28 21:28:18,stocks,"Buying back shares concentrates earnings. Less shares = more earnings per share. Its incredibly useful if a company is undervalued. With the 5g cycle coming into play, I think this is an incredibly bullish move for aapl."
2021-04-29 01:01:07,stocks,"It increases the shareholders ownership in the company without tax implications of dividends. This also demonstrates that the management is confident on the company's value. 

This is not considered as a good strategy as the company could deploy that cash in to innovation and growth.

However, it works for Apple as they generate more money than most countries in the world.

The share price appreciation is a byproduct but not mainly driven by this strategy.

Many companies buy back their stock to balance for shares that they issue for employees."
2021-04-29 01:50:02,stocks,Drives up stock price. Existing shareholders value of the stock goes up.
2021-04-29 08:04:20,stocks,"It also increases EPS (earnings per share). Same earnings less shares. The denominator goes down, increasing the EPS."
2021-04-29 07:54:36,stocks,"$120 here, even I thought “damn that’s low for a mega company like apple” and I loaded up. Feels good man"
2021-04-28 20:14:46,stocks,"We have same top holdings, plus NIO and FB."
2021-04-29 00:18:15,stocks,Just own the s&p 500 or nasdaq then at that point lol
2021-04-28 21:24:45,stocks,GOOGL COIN AAPL ABNB need more TSLA though
2021-04-28 20:54:37,stocks,More like 🚀
2021-04-28 20:24:04,stocks,Right on! Long May it continue!

2021-04-29 02:12:10,stocks,Car making and car manufacturing is hard. I don’t think they really can do it in secret and kept the press away…
2021-04-28 21:39:22,stocks,Steve Jobs sex doll would be a major boost
2021-04-28 21:08:08,stocks,I doubt this. There's more than enough room for multiple players in the high end EV space. Also not sure how Apple would suddenly be so good at making cars that they'd beat out Tesla who have been at it for over ten years?
2021-04-28 23:34:36,stocks,"The CAGR is going to stay high enough to support multiple new players while Tesla is growing, Tesla alone can't electrify the fleet fast enough even at their growth. 

Besides, I have this little feeling that even calling it a ""car"" is presumptuous about Apples efforts, and you may have to step a level back. What's the problem? Moving people around, and go from there. Might not be in the shape of a car as we think of it."
2021-04-28 23:30:19,stocks,"Yeah, my hail mary hope is LU CID 

Kind of like how they did with Beats headphones. Buy them out and make them apple essentially.

And while it's still unlikely I just don't see who else they would buy-out. No US company is as close to launch and they fit in their higher end key market.

Most seem to think they will partner with an established old school company like Hyundai or GM but that's not their style either."
2021-04-28 23:46:39,stocks,Will be interesting to see who will be the replacement in the future.
2021-04-29 10:19:20,stocks,Ya well total revenue hasnt changed much over last 5 years. So it did hit a growth ceiling only thing that changed was its valuation
2021-04-29 11:14:47,stocks,"FYI that's a pretty dangerous number. Sure apple and Microsoft are great companies, and I don't see them messing anything up, but if they did you would essentially lose most of your portfolio. It only takes one mistake on their part."
2021-04-29 09:59:28,stocks,Because it's gonna hurt a lot if the tech sector crashes.
2021-04-29 00:32:39,stocks,"A wise man said, ""let your winners ride"""

Even though you try to be fair in judgement, everyone still kinda wishes your green bubble friends would get with the program.

It's worst when you have a group text, and that one green bubble friend ruins it for everyone.

I've also found that green bubble guys are more likely to be be flaky when it comes to dating than blue bubble guys."
2021-04-29 02:13:21,stocks,It’s not luck dude. It’s call long term investing.
2021-04-28 23:40:46,stocks,💎🙌🏻
2021-04-29 03:27:37,stocks,"Fuckin a, good job"

2021-04-29 16:19:54,stocks,"THAT’S when you should sell, not when it’s winning."
2021-04-29 04:40:01,stocks,"I had a coworker who in 2009 haaated Apple. She only hated it because she thought their laptops were too expensive and didn’t like how much the kids these days liked their products.

I’ve used Apple products since 1990 and regret not getting the stock until recently. Good on you!"
2021-04-28 23:04:31,stocks,I rather they keep investing/expanding and buying back stock than a bigger dividend
2021-04-29 00:59:13,stocks,Never sadly. I mean we can vote in change but if we're faced with two candidates who are equally easily bought then I don't know what more can be done.
2021-04-29 12:25:37,stocks,Lol lobbying will never end
2021-04-29 04:20:12,stocks,why would they do it?
2021-04-29 02:03:32,stocks,How nice of you to wish them good luck

2021-04-29 18:15:55,stocks,"This company is growing so fast that some people think it’s still $1T. This is actually hilarious, how often do you see a $1 TRILLION DOLLAR margin of error when discussing net worth?!"
2021-04-29 00:58:04,stocks,I agree. I put limit buys at 130.
2021-04-29 02:18:20,stocks,You mean courage. /s

2021-04-28 22:02:16,stocks,The funny thing is apparently Apple is also really good at buying Apple. They sit on this cash hoard and move on the stock when it’s lower.
2021-04-29 00:25:44,stocks,They just like the stock.
2021-04-28 23:42:09,stocks,More like they have nothing else to invest in
2021-04-28 23:40:19,stocks,Its not a bad stock if you think about it actually.
2021-04-29 00:20:50,stocks,"To add to this, but backs often make more since than dividends because they’re more tax efficient. Dividends are taxed twice while buy backs are only taxed once"
2021-04-28 23:51:47,stocks,"Exactly. Inverse dilution, so it adds shareholder value instead of diluting shares."
2021-04-28 22:17:29,stocks,Does this mean my share price goes up? I guess what does this mean to the average share holder in terms of stock price?
2021-04-29 02:02:59,stocks,"Very stupid question but thats only if the market still values it at the same market cap right? 

Like just because they buy back shares doesn't necessarily mean the share price goes up if somehow the market values it at a lesser market cap. I guess what I'm asking is, do buybacks guarantee the share price to go up?"
2021-04-29 05:14:27,stocks,Where is Google? That should be top
2021-04-29 06:59:48,stocks,Every one of those stocks has stomped the S&P 500

2021-04-29 02:16:29,stocks,"They can't, it's getting leaked the second they have any solid plans with a manufacturing partner."
2021-04-28 23:09:50,stocks,"I agree with your first point but I’ll say to the second part Apple could make up some ground based just on their brand loyalty. Even more so if they can manage to give Apple users exclusive perks like say your iPhone and car work together in some new ways. They also will likely partner with someone like Toyota that already pretty much has their shit together, and then they can pretty much pump as much money as they need into it."
2021-04-28 23:45:50,stocks,Telsa will build smartphones to establish their dominance...
2021-04-28 21:13:23,stocks,Not to mention the private charging network that Tesla owners enjoy. Takes a long time to build that up.
2021-04-29 04:28:26,stocks,A moving living room. Or entertainment center
2021-04-29 12:32:05,stocks,That’s not true if you look at the macro trends. Yes they have had some quarters where growth stalled or even decreased but the direction has always been going up
2021-04-29 07:19:03,stocks,Don’t water your weeds is another. Peter Lynch?
2021-04-29 12:00:40,stocks,As long as nothing has changed fundamentally for your investment thesis and still believe in the long term I completely agree. And I can't imagine Amazon and Apple losing market value while (or if) the market rises. Unless something has changed fundamentally.
2021-04-28 23:10:55,stocks,On 477% over 7 years?  Would have expected something around 1000%
2021-04-28 22:10:55,stocks,And add a lil on any dips if u can
2021-04-28 22:14:43,stocks,"I currently ave in @$50. YEARS ago I coulda bought at $24, but apple was having trouble, no iPhone yet! Then Microsoft literally had to invest(lend?) apple $ to stick around. That scared me off the stock in those days... think it was the 80’s.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE!"

2021-04-29 01:04:10,stocks,">  but with this now, and AMD yesterday/today reacted as well is concerning....

Idk how any of you stock folks do this anymore. Even when you're *right*, it doesn't even matter. At least a casino makes sense."
2021-04-29 00:10:35,stocks,"Yeah, but AAPL's historical P/E ratio before this low interest environment nonsense was sub 20 for **years**. It only recently bubbled higher. I don't think it's fair to say a P/E of 30 is at all sustainable, especially once interest rates jump higher.

If you used 20 as the P/E, then sub $100 is fair price even with these remarkable earnings."

2021-04-29 03:20:44,stocks,Yes but when people compared about a bubble it was 20 PE not 900. The anti Apple people are still anti Apple and claim it's in a bubble because it has 34 PE and 2 trillion dollar market cap. Tesla is whooole another thing.
2021-04-29 18:30:15,stocks,No calls recently except one that is going to cost me. I’ve been holding Apple for 5 years and reinvesting dividends for more shares.
2021-04-28 23:03:49,stocks,Yeah it’s used by multiple people before me so recycled and company owned so not really my choice. Apple in general as a company is trash. You like buying a new charging cable every year? Oh yeah that’s where the real profits are.

However I also like Apple because even though they pay a small dividend they are increasing it every quarter plus they are one of the few growth companies I own for share appreciation. So if your holding for capital gains or if you are holding for dividends Apple does a really good job at balancing them out and satisfying all of their shareholders."

2021-04-28 21:00:20,stocks,"So it wouldn’t impact P/e ratio but would impact EPS, correct?"
2021-04-28 20:50:13,stocks,"You have it backwards. The price component is unimpacted in a buyback except by investor sentiment. The earnings is what changes because P/E is calculated as price per share / earnings per share, so eps rises and the P/E ratio falls."
2021-04-29 08:10:47,stocks,"> There are still only two elements to the P/E ratio, price and earnings. A share buyback doesn't impact earnings. 

The P/E is *price per share* divided by *earnings per share*, so although total earnings don’t change because of a buyback, EPS does rise, because shares are taken out of circulation resulting in the same earnings spread out over fewer shares.

> Typically, since a buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares, the share price will increase. The same company, same intrinsic value, but divided into fewer, larger, portions.

This is exactly correct and basically it is measurable financially after it occurs in per-share KPIs. So for example, earnings per share, book value per share, cash flow per share, etc. will all rise. If the company’s dividend policy was based on a fixed amount of operating cash flow (like a REIT) the dividend per share would automatically rise as well."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 28, 2021 The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. 

The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. 

Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

**Highlights**

* The US trade deficit rose to a new record high in March, according to data from the Department of Commerce. The deficit increased by 4% to $90.6 billion, higher than the $88 expected by economists
* Mortgage applications fell 2.5% week-on-week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This follows a jump of 8.6% last week, which had marked the first rise in seven weeks. 
* A deep-sea mining robot on a test mission to bring up rocks rich in cobalt and nickel from the floor of the Pacific Ocean has malfunctioned and is lost.
* According to multiple reports, Nio began development on more affordable SUV to cater for the mid to low price markets and is also working on an upgraded 70-kilowatt-hour battery pack using lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which are cheaper than the ones the company uses now
* Nio said in a tweet from its official handle that its global vision is gaining steam and the company is making plans to expand to Norway as part of its plan to expand into Europe. Press Conference on May 6th at 1 am PDT

2021-04-29 12:03:40,stocks,"Did it? I thought it was expected a loss per share, instead we have earnings.

Edit: they didn't, my bad."
2021-04-29 00:30:12,stocks,"It's a good question. This is the investment thesis as I understand it - their technology (in terms of interview software) isn't their moat. Any hospital system can do what they do with zoom/skype/whatever. Their moat is actually in the sheer number of doctors on their network (55,000 physicians in over 450 subspecialties) and in their first mover advantage (over 40% of the fortune 500 are clients). Their first mover advantage gives them a large client base which entices physicians to their platform and employers are also then likely to go with the platform that provides their employees with the greatest/most diverse access to care. 

 I would be remiss if I didn't mention government acknowledgement here. 94% of Medicare advantage plans have said that they will offer telehealth benefits in 2021 vs 58% in 2020. TDOC currently has over 2.5 million Medicare advantage members. The pandemic lowered barriers such as CMS now allowing physicians the same rate of reimbursement for telehealth visits as they do for in person visits and CMS requirement not allowing patients to see providers without an existing relationship was removed. 

Yes local hospital clinics could do this but think about availability of staff and rural communities which currently do not have access to many of the subspecialties that TDOC can provide. 

I am most excited about their Livongo acquisition and the synergies it provides with their current service offerings for holistic care/remote monitoring. That, imo, is the driver of their next leg of profitability"
2021-04-28 20:20:10,stocks,"Cant understand your comment. 

Clinic platforms serve their purpose. Our system just uses zoom and it works for the interview. 

What does TDOC do in your ER and ICU? Telepsych?"
2021-04-29 06:07:43,stocks,"Our system uses tdoc for tele admissions (to wards and ICU) and psych. Our ICU is covered by tdoc at night. I've at least observed admissions and codes by the remote service and it works well, better than zoom at least, the connection is quick and you don't have to set up a meeting, as far as I know.  I see the process and progress by tdoc vs telehealth visits from other clinics in the area not affiliated with our system and tdoc just works better. Nice username."
2021-04-29 07:17:18,stocks,"Right, but you're describing quite literally the only situations where telemed is used. Only other situation I can think of is stroke neurology. 

In places where telemedicine is done in the outpatient setting, platforms like zoom or blue jeans is fine. 

Also important to point out that inpatient telemedicine right now is only being used in places where hospitals can't actually acquire doctors (e.g rural)"
2021-04-29 08:34:56,stocks,"My hospital system (800+ total beds across 3+ hospitals with main hospital in an east coast metropolitan area) uses tdoc at night for tele floor calls and admissions. We may be the exception, however. I understand your point, but I do think that the use case for tdoc provider services is that they can replace in person provider visits in the inpatient and outpatient setting for a lot of specialties. A system can contract pathologists, radiologists, clinical consultants like Endo/rheum/derm, ancillary services etc to fill gaps. We already use it for intensivists and hospitalists at night.

We're in a metro, in a nice area with wonderful amenities, we pay well as a system and have great benefits but we can't find enough doctors to keep up with demand, we can't find enough APPs, recruiting + hiring a new provider takes 6 months. Tdoc makes those problems go away, at the expense of in person visits of course.

The healthcare space is really difficult and tdoc seems to be navigating it well. Maybe a big player/managed care like CVS/HUM/UNH will step in and push tdoc out, but I thought that would have happened by now. 

Telemed is not going away. It will grow and likely grow exponentially and incorporate to home based care and home monitoring."
2021-04-29 09:09:13,stocks,We will see. Teledocs admitting patients overnight is definitely not ideal and is error ridden. You can look at a patient and replicate a physical exam. Especially a critically ill patient.

$3.30 actual EPS vs $2.61 consensus expectation (beat by 26$)

The demise of big tech has been greatly exaggerated. The consistent revenue growth across all of the Big 5 is incredible.

2021-04-29 00:12:50,stocks,Cheapest big tech stock and they are always very conservative about forward projections. I am expecting another huge beat for next quarter. Its already end of April and they will have enough to data to project. This is growing well above 30% and trading below that P/E wise. That will change after another beat or 2. I wont be surprised if they hit $400 this year.
2021-04-28 20:36:32,stocks,Of course they do. Should have bought more big tech instead of chasing ARK. PLTR kind of stocks
2021-04-28 23:59:10,stocks,"They will still be able to sell ads based on your data inside the app or generic ads based on past usage or your profile. There is huge demand for FB ads. Plus while IOS is important, its not the only market. There is android and windows(laptops etc). They will be ok. 

Long run I am even more bullish as they expand into Shopping, AR/VR and more features like Group Audio Chat, live streaming, videos etc. There are always challenges. Facebook stock dropped big after IPO because they were not that much ready for Mobile 1st world and they had focused on HTML5 apps. But they were able to pivot and move forward. I am sure they will overcome challenges of today as well. 

That said you should invest only in companies you believe in. If you dont have confidence in FB future, you should exit. This is not a bad time as its at ATH."
2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Drop in volume. I am invested in a stock (ticker MG) and since the last financial report the volume has dropped drastically. The report was better than expected, but with the loss of volume it does having me questioning why it would drop like this. It went from 150k a day down to 30k.
Does anyone have any idea on why this would happen?"
2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,When is Biden scheduled to talk about his wealth tax?

2021-04-28 21:38:45,stocks,"> The rich people who are giving to democrats are also actively advocating for this tax hike

Actual source on this? I haven’t heard many rich people who are proponents of this. I personally wouldn’t mind a tax hike on the rich, but I’m not convinced this is the best way to do it."
2021-04-29 00:00:00,stocks,"SNCA merger/ PALI I have been sitting on 35 shares of SNCA.  So they merged and are now under the symbol PALI trading at around $10/share now.  So did my SNCA shares roll into this now?

Also I had a limit set to sell all 35 shares if/when SNCA hit $2.00/share but saw that got cancelled today; was it because of this split?

Pretty confused and thanks for any help on this.  This is in my RothIRA account."
2021-04-29 11:12:12,stocks,"I'd wish investors would stop panic selling now jeez a 14% crash today.

I guess I'll have to gamble on the FDA approving their LB1148."

Maybe not a huge deal but it's money out of my pocket."
2021-04-29 12:46:31,stocks,At 20% loss now. This blows. Everyone probably selling off to buy Doge.

2021-04-29 00:57:17,stocks,"This is what RH wrote me today after the merger...
“Seneca Biopharma (SNCA) performed a
1 for 6 reverse split and changed its name to Palisades Bio (PALI). This means shareholders will receive 1 share of PALI for every six shares of SNCA they held in their account on April 28th, 2021.
Fractional shares resulting from the split will be paid as cash in 1-2 weeks”."

2021-04-29 11:52:53,stocks,I like AMD and Tesla (if you give yourself 5-7 years)
2021-04-29 12:05:46,stocks,"it depends on how hands on you're willing to be.

ultimately, regardless you're probably going to want some baseline of stable dividend stocks that will continue to pay out (things like T, MO, XOM, PEP, etc.)

if you're willing to be more hands  on and do covered calls, you might want to check out some cheaper stocks with high growth potential. stocks in the $5 - $25 range that could double or more in the next few years. you can get lots of these shares, and sell covered calls (priced to expire) against every stack of 100. this gives you cash now and gives you a solid  investment for growth. some of my favorites in this space are SFT, UMC, RKT, PLTR (and while a bit more expensive, honorable mention for EXPI). as your portfolio grows, you can also consider doing cash secured puts as well once you reach a point where it makes sense.

outside of that, you're going to want at least some of your portfolio to be some of the major big names that everyone talks about.  things like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, DIS, etc.

there's also ETF's, but someone else can give examples for those, since that's not really my thing."

2021-04-29 06:28:15,stocks,"This 100% - I think a great strategy would be to put $30k into VOO and VTI. Then as he says split the remainder across 4 stocks maybe.

OP - For the stocks, try to avoid meme/hype stocks - do your research (read through the latest management presentation highlights on the company’s investor website, see what people are saying online, market analysts etc).

Also as the post above says, I would invest in companies you can understand - Warren Buffett generally only invests in companies whose products he uses, and where he understands the business model. If you read up on it and can’t really understand the business model/how they make money, I would give it a miss regardless of what other people on reddit etc are saying about it online.

Good luck OP, welcome to the markets"

2021-04-29 00:25:59,stocks,"I agree with the gradual DCA strategy and also AMD being a potential great hold, but I'd also add to diversify a bit, and not put it all into 1 stock, but choose several to spread it around. We're sort in a very uncertain market, where we just came out of the most historical bull-run, during a still pandemic recovery era, compared to usual times where we'd have a sense of stability, markets moving gradually upwards, everyone working, and the economy blossoming. I think DCA will be much better for defensive reasons, if the markets really do end up turning the other way."

You can review which each holds and make a determination on which you have higher or lower conviction on as a fund.  

It's honestly difficult to say which is better or worse, they all perform roughly the same depending on market factors.

I personally choose VOO and have a \~6% return annually, but 2020 was an anomaly and yielded upwards of 15% (30+ if you hit the dip in March/April of last year)"

RemindMe! 3 Months"
2021-04-28 23:25:47,stocks,Also puting 40k across stocks is lame. In order to make 40k they all have to double which does not happen often. He can buy an ice cream truck put a kid in it and make 40k a year+ over and over without risking anything and still have the truck to sell it when it's all over.

2021-04-29 12:19:59,stocks,"The market pric d in 2021 gains already when it almost hit 100. Now that it's below 85 it's at a 15% discount. Should be back at 100 in or before 12 months from now. 

15% gain in a year is a good return. SPY may also give that return but only due to over valued stocks. Amd is fairly valued or undervalued right now. 

My point was to say in this environment you have to pick stocks. You can't buy the whole market. The whole market won't perform long term but there's a lot of companies that will."

2021-04-28 23:23:31,stocks,"""Not in this environment."" ""This time is different."" History repeats itself.

You're just blindly accepting expectations of AMD vs S&P as gospel based on... what, exactly? Trends? Motley Fool? Can they forecast the future in a way no one else can? I know from experience that trying to predict the future based on logically grounded physics more than 5 days out is practically a fool's errand. Is the market somehow more predictable than physics? Expectations are guesses that are **almost always wrong** in that they rarely hit the target exactly. They did so with AMD by **underestimating** them. Why are you so quick to assume the projections are going to be correct? 

And as for the high market valuations, if the market begins to slide in a panic, you can bet your bacon that tech will hurt, too. That includes AMD. And if you think increased diversification actually **increases** your risk (assuming you're not wantonly diversifying into doomed assets for some reason), then... I really don't know what to tell you other than I think you misunderstand the purpose of diversification. Your statement in regard to this assumes that AMD will in fact outperform the market but you fail to consider that **you might be wrong because you can't predict the future.** And if you're wrong, you may lose money versus a modest return from the market at large."

85-90 dollars is a fair valuation for amd today. Spy is currently over valued today. You don't have to predict the future. You just have to look at current earnings. Most companies are trading at unsustainable valuations. Some are trading at fair valuations. If you only buy those that are trading at fair valuations you'll do better long term."

>Higher demand for travel and acceleration of vaccinations in Europe  are set to result in “the biggest jump in oil demand ever, a 5.2 million  barrels per day (bpd) rise over the next six months,” Reuters [quoted](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-falls-india-crisis-us-stocks-build-dampen-confidence-fuel-demand-recovery-2021-04-28/) Goldman Sachs as saying in a note to clients.

>Goldman Sachs [continues to see](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/commodities-to-rally-135-in-the-next-six-months-goldman-sachs-202104280521)  oil rising to $80 per barrel this summer and says that “The magnitude  of the coming change in the volume of demand -- a change which supply  cannot match -- must not be understated,” as carried by FXStreet.

For those of us who built positions in oil stocks over the last few months things are looking good.  A spoiler could be what is going on in India with its Covid surge.   If that is indicative of something other than letting their guard down, like the virus variants are truly more contagious, lethal, and vaccine tolerant, then all bets are off. That will be true of all recovery stocks, though.

If oil has sustained prices for a few months of $80/b then companies like Suncor will be absolutely minting money.  I added more Suncor when it hit $20 last week.  I wish I would have bought more.

EDIT: I hold SU, RDS.B, a commodities ETF, and smaller positions in a number of other stocks that will be affected by increasing oil prices."

OPEC is cutting supply but the moment it sees more demand they will increase supply. This oil bet is a huge gamble for moderate gains. Which is why a lot of investors were selling a month ago. OPEC has said they will increase supply when they see demand, not reports that demand will increase. Which is already happening. I see oil at 65-70 by summer."

Stock picking is gambling, some are good at it, some are not, for the rest of us average is where it's at (and usually better than average returns compared to other retail investors).

I think the term, and just the overall situation in general regarding a short squeeze, will be overused and/or called out much more frequently from now on. As those that missed out are desperate for another one, or those that just think it will happen again because they just don't understand how rare of circumstances they require.

2021-04-28 21:08:10,stocks,"It’s literally what everyone chat room/message board post is about. Everything is a short squeeze, shorted solely by hedge funds, with spoofing, and any other trick in the book. Every stock is compared to Volkswagen or GME; events are cherry picked and exactly the same or completely irrelevant when something doesn’t go as initially predicted. Gamma squeezes are inevitable because a certain number of call options finish in the money and the shorts have to cover, it’s only a matter of time.

Before January I would never see “short squeezes” discussed. It’s fascinating how one event has completely changed the culture of these threads.

I could go on and on and on, but I think you get the point.

Everyone wants to get rich quickly. It’s really crazy how one unique event that was carefully planned out months in advance is now thought to be applicable to each and every “heavily shorted stock.” 

Most of the people are so passionate about their findings that it’s become pretty scary. I feel bad for their naïveté, but no one wants to wake up back to reality anymore."

As a dying stock circles the drain more and more desperate owners lend Their stocks to short sellers. The short sellers profit as the stock collapses.

Short selling is a way to effectively remove the value from a dying stock. Why is that evil? 

I don’t understand how short selling takes away buying opportunities in a way different than normal activities do.

Sometimes the shareholders fight back and a squeeze happens. All of this is natural and good.

Then after all this do you admit to being a short seller yourself?

The price can’t actually go down to $99 if you never sell it, the last transaction would always be $100. If the company tanks but nobody sells it’s going to be an over valued stock. A correction is needed.

Somebody who sees it’s over valued can’t act on that without short selling.

Dark pools in GME are a huge issue right now. I'm not sure about the exact percentage, but about 70~% or so of the orders are routed trough Dark Pools. 
 
Its only speculation, but it might be that market makers (Citadel) is routing buy orders from retail trough Dark Pools to not affect the price and defeat buying pressure. Sales however are routed trough normal exchanges. Since only sell orders would go trough normal exchanges, gamestop would slowly go down, because those dark pool buy orders won't affect the price Positively. Beware that this is of course only speculation, but based on the data we have it seems to be true.  
 
As far as I know, this practice isn't illegal, they would just misuse dark pools.. But it's all legal. If it turns out to be true, it would be a huge issue because it would show that market makers can affect the price for their own advantage.

Dark pools: Its basically an off-exchange made for Big institutions. Imagine you're a big bank and you want to buy a huge portion of a company in stocks. Buying it on the open market would disrupt the price heavily, giving you less stocks for the price you wanted to buy it and it might result in a sell off from other investors that see a huge increase in price. When using a Darkpool, institutions can buy stocks from other users of the Darkpool for a fixed price without affecting the price of the stock. 
 
Short ladders(Wash sales): Imagine we both want to push the price of a stock down. I sell you the stock for $100, you sell to me the same stock back for $99.99. I sell it again to you for $99.98, you sell it to me for $99.97 and so on. Now imagine the same with a million stocks. This practice is illegal in the US.

2021-04-29 18:46:08,stocks,"When it comes to just games, there is not much of an incentive currently honestly. GME would still have a percentage of the market share, which even if its small is still money flowing in. For example, HOW THE FUCK is Arby's still open? No one I know eats there, yet they stay afloat somehow.
This is just considering selling game copies though. Ryan Cohen (the new Chairmen for the Board) was able to make Chewy profitable because owners care about their pets, and will go out of their way to know their spending money on quality supplies. Same goes for gamers, who will for sure go out of their way to find a reputable company selling good PC parts, refurbished consoles/accessories, and merchandise. Also, I know a lot of people who go out of their way to find similar products from smaller companies for the sole reason of not wanting to support companies like Amazon. Not that they don't buy from Amazon, but because they want to support other companies they believe in. Great example of this was people supporting local restraunts at the start of the pandemic. 
I'm not saying GME is going to be the God of the video game market, but I believe their changing business will be able to grab a decent percentage of the whole gaming market (worth around $160BB annually and growing). There's enough space for them to be able to generate a good profit here with this new business model."

Not sure where you got the idea that I think the SI hasn't gone down came from lmao. It's definitely gone down but they're buying shares via dark pool as much as possible to prevent price from dramatically going up and selling publicly at opportune times to drive the price down. It's the most basic common sense strategy you can come up when you trade large volumes, sell options and have the ability to move share price with your trades. If you want the price to move you trade normally, and when you don't you trade on the dark pool. The info about the dark pool has just shone a light on how they can manipulate share prices; literally over 40% of daily market trade volume is hidden and not affecting share price (probably higher now, that 40% figure was from a decade ago)."

However, Bloomberg has reported that Biden is also expected to announce a tax hike on capital gains for the 1031 exchange on real estate.

For that period, only Marketimer and IAS have been on the list every year (""11 consecutive years"", as we like to say).

The Buyback Letter was on the list for 10 of the 11 years, dropping off in 2020-21.

Sound Advice was on the list 9 of 11 years, not making the list in 2017-18 or 2020-21. 

Investment Quality Trends was on the list 7 of 11 years, named to it for the first time (in the period since 2010) in 2013 but not making the 2020-21 list.

The Investment Reporter is the 3rd newsletter on the current 2020-21 Honor Roll (along with IAS and Marketimer) for the 3rd year in a row and the 5th time in the last 11 years.

The above 6 newsletters are the only ones that have been on the list since the 2017-18 Honor Roll."

D) Charlie munger and WB have finally opened themselves up to tech (I think they could make some good picks) 

E) WB has almost all of his net worth in Berkshire stock so he will treat your money how treats his.

F) he has said they are saving all this money to make some big moves when the time comes so I think they are under valued considering they have enough cash to make whatever moves they want"

Here's my counter point: Apple has done splits. But somehow, they are the highest valued company trading. Amazon does more than apple, but arent anywhere near the valuation. Somehow microsoft is doing great over the past 4 decades. They're centered around computer products.

They have a market cap of 2.2T. And they sell phones. Don't get me wrong, they sell the SHIT out of phones but they're still selling phones. They have gotten a ton of people to pick up a 1200 dollar annual subscription for a slightly better camera? Congrats on your marketing?

YOURE WORTH 2 TRILLION AND YOU SELL PHONES. what's left for the stock price? How does it go up in a meaningful way please tell me. 

You want to protect money? Buy T, brk.b, literally anything else in FAANG or a stable stock with high dividend. Aren't we here to make money? Apple honestly seems so fucking useless to me in that endeavor.

And yet everyone says ""it dropped to 117 and we ran over each other like moms at best buy on black Friday stampeding for the TVs""

Just so they could be up like ten fucking percent? WHAT AM I MISSING I FEEL LIKE IM TAKING CRAZY PILLS.

Make this a copy pasta I don't give a shit. Fuck apple."

But what happens if the housing prices fall (due to people moving back to cites and there being less demand) and rates go up? Aren't people who stay then stuck with massive mortgages for a house that's depreciated?"
2021-04-29 10:52:46,stocks,"Sure. Not immediately. But here's what I thought:

People move back to cities, causing more houses to be on the market than there's demand for in more rural locations.

Prices race to the bottom.

Now people who stay are stuck with high mortgages they got during the pandemic, with a house that's depreciated.

If/when rates go up, could this not be a problem?"

2021-04-29 12:30:55,stocks,"Sure. That doesn't mean that houses are suddenly worthless or debtees are going to be defaulting. Your payment is still $1200 a month whether your house is worth $200k or $240k. You'll simply have less equity vs principle owed. The bank wants their 240k + interest back in 30 years; they won't really give a shit what your house is worth unless you are a default risk or your house goes from 240k to ""nothing"", which didn't even happen during 08-10.

The problem with MBS is people were defaulting because it was more than they could afford, full stop. Lending practices aren't as predatory anymore as the incentive is gone. MBS were bundles where 10% were expected to default just by virtue of lending practices. If you collected the other 90% (or more), who cares? You still had a positive ROI on what was considered a ""safe"" investment. Well, this turned into 15% default due to decreasing lending requirements as people were making so much money and wanted more. Then 20% defaults. Then 25%. Now nobody wants the MBS and IBs are holding bags on these shit security bundles and get worried. This evolved into them not buying mortgages from banks. Banks now sitting on sub prime mortgages they can't off-load and get worried because holy shit, the guy with a $700k mortgage working construction for $30/hr cant actually afford his mortgage and we need capital now. Construction guy realizes he has less to lose by letting the house go and declaring bankruptcy vs short-selling it and eating a major loss. Thus the cards came tumbling down hard.

That is not at all what we're seeing now. This is a demand-driven hike fueled by easier to acquire loans as cost of capital is nearly 0%. Now people can buy a house for 2-3% interest fixed and pay $300k for a house since its the same monthly payment as a $260k house at a higher rate and most people only care about the monthly payment. The only argument to be made is when the forbearance period is over and people get foreclosed on, which I highly doubt will happen with house prices up as much as they are. Debtees will make a deal with the bank to either roll mortgages or sell before foreclosure so everybody gets their money. Banks NEVER want to foreclose unless they truly need capital or believe they wont ever get their money back."

Now that AMD is on top of the world, it is growing much faster than Intel. You can't use previous earnings to value the company since they are just cash now. The value of the company is the sum of future earnings. In the next few years Intel will have higher earnings than AMD, but can they continue that?

With interest rates at 2% for the 30 year, even earnings 30 years from now should influence today's prices a little bit. Will Intel or AMD be more profitable in the future?"

2021-04-28 20:50:44,stocks,"Ark has been buying Skillz over the last 3 months. It is one of their largest holdings of companies that went public via SPAC along with Opendoor & Draftkings and a few others. I was skeptical about Skillz but the short report presented a good buying opportunity and the potential in partnering with the NFL to develop a game, expanding into India and its enormous mobile gaming market, as well as company guidance not accounting for new IP in financial projections were a few things that caught my interest. I would say its an ok bet for the future of competitive mobile gaming, the development of FPS and sports games has some promise."
2021-04-29 18:14:39,stocks,"I know we don't do gold standard anymore since the 80's but a lot of currency dynamics is still the same. Consumer prices are up alot in the 5 biggest EU economies (ecb doesn't give money to people they just buy bonds and govt debt) although demand is not up. Supposedly from production interruption and supplies chain problems but most economist are calling that a guess too. In a way inflation might be the only way out for some massively indebted countries like italy, belgium or spain. I'm not buying the whole fed and ecb narrative ""don't worry we can keep inflation under 2% without raising interest rates and whilst buying billions worth of bonds every month with printed money"" but I hope I'm wrong. Nobody can really explain why inflation has been so low after a decade of printing and keeping interest rates so low but 50% of all existing currency in a year sure sounds like a stretch. Guess we'll know in a couple years."

These major charging networks also will become outdated as Level 3 direct fast charging is what people will rely on and prefer."

2021-04-28 20:07:28,stocks,"You couldn't even do the math correctly for the example you provided.

There is no way that the fees would be less than 1% due to the .4% being compounded. It adds up.

I prefer not to buy some businesses because I think they are not good companies to own part of.

I'd rather pick out what I think are the best parts at acceptable prices.

Your math is horribly off and if there's anybody laughing it'll possibly be at your bad math."

2021-04-28 22:53:17,stocks,"What's funny is the contempt you're showing when you're so wrong.

4/1000=.004 = .4%

You're possibly better off with the index investing if you can't do the math and see that it's going to be far more than a $35,000 dollar difference because of expenses compounding.

You'll possibly find yourself making an error.

It's comforting knowing that people like you might sometimes be on the other side of one of my transactions.

2021-04-29 15:22:04,stocks,"Was hoping for a higher eps but im fine with this from a long term perspective. I didnt sell anything. 1) this was the best Q earnings they’ve had in 3 years. 2) Trailing PE now close to 10-11. 3) Q2/Q3 will be unequivocally better lumber and pulp wise. Average transaction for lumber was 875 for Q1 with costs around 450. Q2 will be likely 1k or higher. Cyclicals crash long term when their best days are over. This one isnt if Q 2 and Q3 are better. 4) they paid down debt and they have extra lumber that couldnt move due to rail car issues in February, that lumber will get moved and sold and will be realized this Q. 

Reminds me of Q4-2020 when the stock dipped from 11 to 8 when they missed estimates due to a write off. Took the stock 6 ish weeks to recover. I dont have calls in may or june so Im fine with it."
2021-04-29 13:42:52,stocks,Like real unhappy haha 🥲
2021-04-29 15:25:02,stocks,"Still holding. Stock did the same thing after Q4 2020. Look at mid february. Dipped from 11 to 8. Took six weeks to recover. 

Fundamentals indicate its best days arent over, Q2/Q3 will be better and its trailing PE now is 10-12, which is very reasonable in a market where the average is over 30. 

Disappointing day for sure, sobering as to the upper potential, but im staying for more. :)"
2021-04-29 15:30:41,stocks,"I appreciate the response. Why do you think they missed my so much? Were analysts way too enthusiastic about them?

2021-04-29 15:45:45,stocks,"The rail car issue and the hedging on futures. 1) they produced 50 million bf that registered costs (-22 million) but werent delivered due to supply chain issues from the February storms shutting down railways. Since they havent been delivered they havent gotten the 47 million revenue from that. Thats a book difference of 69 million which would have put them over the EPS estimate. 

2) they lost ~30 million hedging with futures because they thought the price would go down, like all the analysts. It didnt. So they got a loss. 

But for those two one time issues, they would have beat EPS estimate easily. 

The long term value investors can see that. The short term speculators wont."
