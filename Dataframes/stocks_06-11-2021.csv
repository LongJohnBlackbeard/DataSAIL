I’ve done the same too many times also."
2021-06-11 19:49:08,stocks,Take comfort in knowing you’re not alone. Learn from it and do better next time. That’s all we can do.
2021-06-11 19:48:21,stocks,Taking a profit is useless when you directly invest the money into another stock. The only reason to sell should be when you see a better investment opportunity
2021-06-11 19:48:17,stocks,"The nearly 12% on S&P seems scary. I'm 30% cash, hoping for some correction to use it. I don't like cash but after getting rid of some overvalued stocks, I don't want to invest it now in an etf"
2021-06-11 18:56:41,stocks,"Totally intentional, they just wanted in on that stock pump lol."
2021-06-11 19:40:50,stocks,Is your mom gonna IPO. cause i gotta get me some of that.
2021-06-11 18:58:32,stocks,Why does outage pump the stock?
2021-06-11 19:04:00,stocks,Lol who knows. Fastly stock benefitted nicely though.
2021-06-11 19:07:59,stocks,People realize just how many companies they service
2021-06-11 19:08:00,stocks,I think it has to do with when they have an outage you realize just how many people rely on them. That’s the premise behind it
2021-06-11 19:37:43,stocks,a general theory is fsly reminding people how important they are by accident
2021-06-11 18:44:38,stocks,"Edit: scratch the below, I was wrong.

Actively managed ETFs would more likely be referred to as Managed Funds, of which there are different structures. The term “ETF” is used for passive products / index trackers.

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) has a good article on the tax differences between passive ETFs and [Mutual Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), a typical type of actively managed fund. You should check the type of vehicle you are invested through as that may affect the tax treatment, and similar vehicles vehicles (e.g. mutual funds) may themselves have different tax treatment for, say, dividends where either the fund or the investor will pay tax. Have a look at the fact sheet / prospectus through your broker which may provide more information."
2021-06-11 18:11:12,stocks,I was in it with Schwab and made a ton of money loaning Mimedx shares a couple years ago. Interest rate started out around 20% and the gradually went down and then shares returned about a year ago. That sucked! Was banking a couple thou every month at the beginning. Was soooo nice. What do you have to lose?
2021-06-11 18:13:41,stocks,So with eTrade for UPST they are offering a 60/40 split with an interest rate at 50%. TD is offering 50/50 split but a 75% interest rate which is even better. Anyone know where the best place to get the highest split and interest rate would be?
2021-06-11 18:14:49,stocks,We're you locked in during that time? Could you have sold whenever you wanted to? And were you able to write covered calls while they were on loan? Thanks!
2021-06-11 18:31:39,stocks,"Not locked in. You can withdraw your shares from the program at any time. But once they are on loan you cannot write covered calls. The shares on loan are put into a separate account established for that purpose, and you basically can't touch them while they are on loan."
2021-06-11 18:29:39,stocks,Charts and fundamentals look good for the space. I’m in GSK as well. I like the catalysts coming from the Elliots activism.
2021-06-11 17:31:25,stocks,"That really depends on a lot of factors, such as your risk tolerance, your time horizon, and how long you want to hold it. 
One thing I’d suggest before you go from mock investing to real investing is to understand the tax implications of both short term and long term holdings. Both so you know how it will affect your taxes, and how it will affect any social programs or student aid situations, if you’re in the US at least,"
2021-06-11 17:31:38,stocks,"I am of the opinion that fake money brokerage accounts in classes is totally useless. I did it multiple times and never learned anything 

When its real money on the line you think and act differently. I recommend you open a brokerage and buy a $100-$200 worth of shares. Not enough to actually hurt you if you lost it but enough to where you actually felt the gain and lose. When you start, the point is to learn, not actually make life changing money (that's for later)

Whether or not BMY is a good investment. I have no idea."
2021-06-11 19:56:10,stocks,"CNBC pumped them hard today, so I would avoid."
2021-06-11 18:33:06,stocks,"No one can say for sure, for every buyer there has to be a seller and vice versa. You got to do your own *Due Diligence* and make your own price target. If you blindly trust whatever people pump online you'll never be a good trader.



Ask yourself is this company in a good position financially? Will they grow over time or will they face competition?"
2021-06-11 18:38:54,stocks,"Agreed. 

I broke (won) my schools Finance Club competition back in university by doing all kinds of stupid stuff I would never do with real money. Shorted dot coms actually. (Sheesh I'm old). The next year, they banned shorting stocks in their stupid game... LOL."
2021-06-11 18:48:00,stocks,"I think that's part of the reason the games are dumb. They only last one semester which is far too short of a timeframe. In fact, it probably teaches young adults the opposite of how to properly invests. Makes them manic over daily fluctuations and to flow market trends and not fundamentals 

Good for you shorting the techs back in the day. I'm sorry it wasn't with real money. I personally know 4 trust fund boomers who lost nearly everything in the dot com bubble. It all seems so obvious in hindsight."

2021-06-11 17:28:06,stocks,These markets aren’t afraid of inflation because they aren’t afraid of the Fed actually fighting inflation.
2021-06-11 17:26:42,stocks,"Inflation itself is not that bad for stocks, it's not amazing either but not that bad. What would be bad for valuations would be increased interest rates. Thats what would make the market go significantly lower.

The Fed doesn't want to raise interest rates but it might have to if inflation goes out of hand. So far a lot of people think that the inflation we are seeing will be temporary and not force the Fed to raise rates, which might be true or maybe not.

Once the Fed will raise rates, valuations will change, prices will drop and people will start going back into bonds at some point so further put pressure on stocks. When that will happen is speculation but a lot of smart and famous investors warn of inflation, some even bet on rising interest rates."
2021-06-11 17:22:40,stocks,"Inflation is fine for the market, means access to cheap debt and raising prices. It's the raising of interest rates that cause a downturn. In theory, the Fed has to raise rates or risk a collapse of the USD value, or whatever little it has left. But the Fed has already said they'll let inflation run wild and not raise rates, so the market doesn't care."

I am long MPLX, ET, MRO, XOM..."
2021-06-11 17:42:36,stocks,The fed absolutely did not say they are letting inflation run wild. They said that they believe it is a temporary issue and that it will even out later this year. The big question is how long they will let it go before raising rates.
2021-06-11 17:27:21,stocks,"I think they will raise rates, but I also think the market has priced alot in already. Many small cap stocks are still down huge since february."
2021-06-11 17:45:44,stocks,"We all, including the Fed, know that's not true though, so we may as well speak in actual terms, and not the political white washing they spin to boost consumer confidence. To that point though, I'll rephrase to say that Yellen has advocated for inflation to run above target goals."
2021-06-11 17:37:49,stocks,"If you ask me, they have to, but the Fed has been adamant that they're going to leave it alone, going so far as to try to convince the public that rampant inflation is actually a good thing. Eventually they have to raise them, though they've claimed they'll try to push it off to 2022.

FWIW I've purchased call options on TBT in expectation of a rate bump."
2021-06-11 17:50:27,stocks,"Either way your claim seems to imply they will just let it run wild. Whereas the fed seems to simply be letting it go temporarily and monitoring it. 

Yellen isn't the Fed chair."
2021-06-11 18:37:02,stocks,Fed speaks in cryptic ways and I totally get where you are coming from. The market apperently does too.
2021-06-11 17:52:16,stocks,The fed just looks at the data they’ve got. The think the inflation we have rn (mom) is just the result of supply chain issues. We’ve been in a deflationary period for the past decade and they want to see any signs of a reversal.
2021-06-11 17:58:36,stocks,"Alright, Powell has said he'd ""monitor"" inflation above the 2% goal, but that he didn't feel the need to bring it under control. And to that point, CPI is significantly above target, and the Fed has not even begun preliminary talks to make adjustments. He's also voiced a desire to let it go unchanged through at least this year, if not part of 2022.

As I've commented though, I have money in the market betting on rising rates sooner than 2022."
2021-06-11 18:41:41,stocks,"I always go back to the point that Bernanke, after the fact, acknowledged that they knew there were issues in the housing market as early as 2005, but couldn't say or do anything because their job ultimately is to inspire consumer confidence and play along with the current administration's goals. If Powell admits that inflation is an issue and that they need to do something about it, not only does the market go into full panic, but it also requires admitting that the massive infrastructure plan and any other spending on the agenda needs to be cut. That doesn't fly over well when admin has promised all these shiny new things."
2021-06-11 18:06:16,stocks,"There is a pretty big difference between what you just described and ""let it run wild""."
2021-06-11 18:13:31,stocks,"That's a matter of perspective. I would say the 5+% it's pushing right now is rather wild, especially if they do nothing to alleviate that, which they have not even begun to discuss doing. As soon as they show a willingness to act, I'll happily change my thesis."
2021-06-11 18:48:13,stocks,"In my 35 years of investing, and finance, I have never seen the Fed raise rates while the govt was being controlled by the Democratic Party... I may have missed something during the Clinton years, as they are still ""Foggy"""
2021-06-11 18:49:31,stocks,"If they let inflation go for four years, we're in some serious trouble."
2021-06-11 18:56:19,stocks,"Agreed.. I see massive inflationary pressures now in the labor market.. 
Most places are paying unskilled labor, near ,$20 hour. The 5 million workers pre covid that did not return to the labor market, all became daytraders in an upswing"

Hmm. I know it’s a new listing but surely the above can’t be a good sign. Please correct my ignorance if I am wrong. Still new to evaluation."
2021-06-11 17:36:58,stocks,The full affect won’t be felt until the case settles. There was a hiccup in share price and now it’s going back up. Personally I’m waiting
2021-06-11 17:58:46,stocks,"Imo, this will hurt the content creators the most until they get use to the rules. THey will need to remove the offending sounds and create thier own. Kids will still play it regardless of the ""beeps"" or tunes played when they interact with stuff.

Roblox devs will absolutely have to implement some sort of  music ID program and hire more mods to police it. Not sure how much they will be willing to put forth though. I think all the courts will require is ""timely removal"" once its identified in order for Roblox to be compliant with the law. Thats the kind of agreement they will probably settle for with the music lawyers.

Something similar happened in another game I play and it all worked out fine in the end after some ugly lawyer fights. You can still find people breaking the ""rules/law"" , but as long as its removed once the problem is reported, nothing is in violation.

The real cost will be in what software they have to buy in order to keep constant vigil on all the submissions, and how many mods they have to hire to send out form letters when they get reported content. Im pretty sure the software will be the more expensive issue. Mods work for pocket change."
2021-06-11 18:05:22,stocks,"Considering they’re a platform where users upload content for their games, I don’t see how this’ll play out any differently than all the other lawsuits against other platforms.

YouTube et al. get a ton of dubious content uploaded all the time, and it gets taken down regularly via DMCA requests (request legitimacy aside). Safe harbor provisions mean platforms won’t be held responsible as long as they comply with the requests.

They might have to tighten their content id tech more, but I don’t see any obvious signs of trouble for them."
2021-06-11 17:20:00,stocks,Curious about this too. Been looking for an opening to place a put on rblx
2021-06-11 19:04:14,stocks,"Hmm, sounds good for my future shares of Universal Music Group"
2021-06-11 16:21:25,stocks,You should have accumulated more shares in the 1980's!!
2021-06-11 16:42:26,stocks,"It's icing on the cake, and with a drip you can get more shares over time."
2021-06-11 17:05:33,stocks,"You're not thinking about it correctly.

When I was buying AAPL a few years ago, their dividend yield was higher than it is now despite the fact that they've raised their dividend every year since I originally bought it. So my dividend yield is lower but my cost basis dividend yield is higher.

It's not that MSFT doesn't pay a lot of dividends, it's that their dividends/future dividends are so highly coveted that it makes the yield look low. 

Here's an example: Buffett bought KO between 1988-1994 for a total cost of $1.3B. Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B. KO only has a 3% dividend yield, but that is irrelevant because the cash on cash return doesn't care about current unrealized gains. 

So let's say you bought MSFT exactly ten years ago at $23.71, then your cost basis dividend yield would be 9.2%. 

Most importantly, you wouldn't have to sell shares to receive that payment. That's the problem with appreciation, you have to sell a productive asset (shares) in order to receive an unproductive asset (cash), and even worse, the cash value for your shares is net taxes. Dividends are also net taxes but you didn't have to sell an asset to get them."
2021-06-11 16:35:40,stocks,I think people use them as a place to hold cash to guard agaisnt loss from inflation
2021-06-11 18:36:48,stocks,All great points being made… I don’t think anyone has really mentioned that MSFT also has been growing the div about 10% each year so you can think of that as a 10% raise each year
2021-06-11 16:46:18,stocks,"This is a hilarious post... But I guess this is what the market has bred over the last decade or so with easy money.

I'm in big on MSFT. Like 19% of my portfolio. Those reinvested dividends pay off in spades. Just like COST or AAPL. Your vision is quite narrow."
2021-06-11 16:21:41,stocks,"Most savings accounts yield 0.5%. If you have $100k invested, it's a $1k dividend. Not too bad in the grand scale of things"
2021-06-11 18:29:06,stocks,"> And why do people act like it's a great thing? (3% +, I totally get it)

Why does it suddenly make sense at 3%?"
2021-06-11 16:41:27,stocks,Are we complaining about free money? Did you buy these Microsoft shares with your stimmies?
2021-06-11 17:25:39,stocks,Best way to think about this is that Microsoft is a company that generates more cash than they can profitably invest. So instead of hoarding it they are returning the money to shareholders.
2021-06-11 17:58:59,stocks,"This is why warren buffet prefers stock buybacks. Those who want out get cash for the whole shares, and those who want to stay reap the benefits of fewer shares total. I was against share buybacks until I thought that through. Better for taxes that way, too."
2021-06-11 17:00:39,stocks,"You’re complaining about a false premise. One doesn’t build a dividend portfolio based on MSFT. The small dividend is a bonus. The stock is held for growth.

Come back when you’ve allowed time and DRIP to build a $2M portfolio generating 2-3% in dividends. There are many other solid large cap companies and ETFs to hold if a div profile is your goal."
2021-06-11 16:55:38,stocks,"MSFT has plenty of room left to grow AND you get to take advantage of compound interest. If you continue to DRIP and continue to add to your position over time, you’ll look back at this post in 5 years and laugh. Think of the dividend as a little bonus for making an investment in one of the most stable companies on the market."
2021-06-11 18:29:50,stocks,"They bother with a tiny dividend because many pension/soveirgn wealth funds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc mandate that for them to sink capital into a security, it has to pay some sort of nominal dividend (and other requirements that they're required to abide by).

They do so because the cash costs are minimal to MSFT while gaining trading liquidity + price bump that comes along with it, so why not?"
2021-06-11 18:40:59,stocks,"people like dividends because they feel like they are getting paid for holding a stock. or they are retired and need the income

in some cases, the dividend is the company’s way of paying investors back (mortgage REITs, for example) instead of share price appreciation

otherwise for a company like MSFT id rather they reinvest the capital in the business, or if they really cant figure out anything to do w/ the money, then do share buybacks"
2021-06-11 16:27:31,stocks,"If the company believes there’s serious upward momentum and meaningful ROI for future projects, they’ll contribute nearly all their profit toward achieving that upside. When the stock reaches 10x the value, you’ll receive 10x the dividend - assuming the same yield."
2021-06-11 17:40:52,stocks,What is your investment goals and outlook? I can understand if you are a short term investor or trader but than I would be asking you why are you buying MSFT with a short term outlook? If your a long investor why do you care what you get right now. You should be looking at the future like accumulating more shares and reinvesting those dividends to buy more shares. Instead of complaining about MSFT not giving you enough free money you should establish a strategy and goals for a long term investment strategy.
2021-06-11 18:50:40,stocks,I love divs. 1% is low but is better than nothing. I look at it as a hedge against incompetence both theirs and my own. Just let it accumulate and buy things on dip.
2021-06-11 19:18:20,stocks,"A lot of people don't like dividends because it means the company isn't spending that money to grow. I like it because it means the company knows what it's purpose is, to pay you the investor.

A lot of things you can do with the dividend, reinvest it, put the money elsewhere and rebalance, whatever. With AMZN and GOOG the only way I can rebalance is if I sell the entire share and their shares are huge."
2021-06-11 16:26:46,stocks,Wasn't alive in the 80's unfortunately haha
2021-06-11 17:10:37,stocks,Then it’d be a 40% dividend
2021-06-11 17:25:05,stocks,"I thought this post was a joke. I am lately unwinding into bonds and other fixed income investments  because we are definitely in a mania. It is inconceivable to some

2021-06-11 16:27:33,stocks,"But then that’s high yield savings account, most accounts people have (chase, Wells Fargo, etc) only offer ~.01% *from what I have seen*"
2021-06-11 18:01:41,stocks,"That’s a high-yield savings account. And wouldn’t $1k be 1%, not 0.5%?"
2021-06-11 18:55:41,stocks,Watch MSFT crash to 1/3 of its value and op comes back to finally cheer that it’s at 3% yield
2021-06-11 17:34:04,stocks,"Instead of hoarding it or dividing it up amongst the employees, the people who are doing the real work. No one ever thinks of that for some reason."
2021-06-11 19:38:35,stocks,Stock buybacks as a form of special dividend are fine if done moderately. Unfortunately stock buybacks are often hilariously abused at the long term expense of a company (cough fuck airlines).
2021-06-11 19:09:06,stocks,Would you mind listing a few?
2021-06-11 16:28:45,stocks,"Big mistake! Hahah, to answer your question though...yes you would need a lot of Microsoft to make anything in dividends, it is generally regarded as a very stable company sitting on a mountain of cash, so some people feel safe parking their money there."

2021-06-11 16:15:22,stocks,"Unless I'm missing something CCL closed essentially even for the day?  Doesn't seem like the market overreacted.

I agree with you about the coverage and the pretty much guaranteed  presence of positive tests going forward, though."
2021-06-11 16:38:37,stocks,"To be fair the cruise stocks were already way overvalued. People pumped these to close to precovid valuations considering all the stock issues and debt they accrued. People just saw nclh below the covid graph number but dont understand how many shares got issued between here and there. 

Those were never going to stay that high, I shorted them all heavily when rcl hit 98 the other day.  They were doomed before the positive tests."
2021-06-11 17:34:10,stocks,I think reddit is the wrong place to get a feel for thow the cruise industry will recover - the demographics are almost mutually exclusive. I'm bullish over the long-run though.

2021-06-11 16:57:06,stocks,"Anecdotally, I can tell you I know plenty of folks who have vowed never to go on another cruise, not just due to Covid but all the nightmare stories before it—the diarrhea boat and the grandpa who dropped his grandchild overboard.

2021-06-11 18:33:21,stocks,My Dad invested in CCL but for me I'd pass on cruise ships. I feel that people will finally notice them as being disease havens (not just for covid but a ton of other nasty illnesses) and they will probably struggle to shake this bad reputation off even if the pandemic is over.
2021-06-11 19:12:59,stocks,"The title/premise is false.  It's not freaking out ""over 2 positive COVID tests"".  It's about the reminder and realization that diseases can spread like wildfire on cruise ships, and that is exponentially more true with the most infectious disease of our lifetime.  

It's also a realization of the devasting impact to operations that something like this can have.  Losing a cruise due to an outbreak is bad.  Having to comp thousands of guests is bad.  Having your cruise ship quarantined for weeks is bad."

2021-06-11 17:49:56,stocks,The cruise industry is a culturally bankrupt void of consumer absurdity to begin with. Gross food. Gross people. I'd rather stay at a nice hotel and entrench myself in local sights/restaurants. Cruisesare for a dying generation of clients. It's a crappy medium all around.

2021-06-11 16:11:38,stocks,I dunno they came out low and gained back to 0 to be in line with the index.  I think each time there is a positive you will see a drop but then a slow climb back waiting to see if sailings will be cancelled.
2021-06-11 18:17:06,stocks,"The stock didnt move much at all. I think the COVID scare is over. People are no longer afraid but I think that quarantining anyone who is sick should be the norm. Thats for any flu, not just COVID.

But what I dont get is why people are buying these stocks. They are insanely over valued especially after all the bad debt, dilutions and warrants that will dilute even more over time. They still have to contend with general sentiment too. Id say to wait. Dunno why everyone is rushing back in. Wait till they get back on their feet. I have a feeling that most will be 30% cheaper by end of next year."

Areas of the world are still lacking on vaccines and honesty is not always the best policy where safety is concerned.  Was the ship requiring proof of vaccination?  If so, was fraudulent documentation provided?"
2021-06-11 18:07:57,stocks,Sold my nclh for $33.80 couple days ago from $19 a share. At that price the market cap was greater than november 2019. No way im holding on anymore!

2021-06-11 18:16:35,stocks,"I know one out of the 200 at work who was vaccinated and still caught it. Thanks to the vaccine he got a mild fever for a few days and no serious symptoms, also he was a person who never used a mask or kept his distance (far from, a party person).



And either way let's not forget the ""classic' vaccines like J&J, Sputnik, Astra is less effective then mRNA one's and doesn't work a swell against mutated versions"
2021-06-11 16:53:32,stocks,"Last time I read we are still not completely sure vaccines can give immunity, so that is possible"

2021-06-11 19:36:17,stocks,"And then there's me, who bought right before news of the (rightfully) issued baby powder fine. And then the vaccine got suspended. Still kept buying as it went down, but damn the -3.3% thing on the initial buy is pretty annoying."
2021-06-11 19:09:23,stocks,The risk is pretty damn low if you are vaccinated.

2021-06-11 19:20:33,stocks,"Not saying it’s a fair valuation or good buy, just pointing out his statement that it’s rebounded nearly to pre covid levels is verifiably false"
2021-06-11 17:36:33,stocks,"Idk about everyone else, but when I got vaccinated I was told I can still get it, the vaccine just reduces the risk of life threatening symptoms. Not immunity. Lowers the risk of spreading it to other vaccinated people as well"
2021-06-11 19:17:59,stocks,"I'm very much pro-vaccine, but the false selling of it through misleading statistics is problematic.  

Their much touted 95% number - which of course sounds wonderful - is for a standard that most would misinterpret.  It was a statement that you have a 95% chance of not dying or being hospitalized, but it says nothing about being immune or avoiding the weeks of harsh symptoms or permanent effects.  

What *does* have 100% immunity is not being in proximity of any air where the virus is present.  That's why I continue to maintain social distance and masking and as many remote practices as possible despite being vaccinated."
2021-06-11 17:45:19,stocks,The disconnect here is immunity doesn't necessarily mean you can't get it or spread it.  The vaccine still confers immunity just maybe not total immunity.
2021-06-11 19:38:25,stocks,It was 95% less chance of getting infected enough to test positive.  It was 100% less chance of hospitalization and nearly that for a serious case.
2021-06-11 17:52:00,stocks,Isn't the word for that resistance?
2021-06-11 17:57:49,stocks,"Any effect a vaccine would have is due to it training your immune system hence immunity. Think about native Americans and measles,  because they had no immunity it was pretty deadly, in contrast europeans who had partial immunity, could still get it pass it and sometimes get wrecked by it but had some immunity and as a result it was a relatively mild disease.

Resistance could mean lots of things, the 100 years poster above is saying we've know vaccines have worked for a while, we just don't know of this one confers 100% immunity"
2021-06-11 18:02:19,stocks,"Thats also not immunity, thats a dormant disease like herpes, you get it once and its there for life 
, but you only notice flare-ups after the initial infection"
2021-06-11 18:45:26,stocks,"Dormant diseases and partial immunity are not mutually exclusive. Immunity is not a yes or no thing. 

Eg:chicken pox, after having it once you have it dormant in you but also have immunity to it, (sometimes not total immunity)

The vaccine is likely to reduce the chance of you catching covid and if you get covid after having the vaccine the chances you will get a bad case is very small, because you have some immunity from your immune system previously encountering and learning from the vaccine."

2021-06-11 15:28:51,stocks,"Honestly, a well diversified spread between the sectors is your best bet, and as far as “when” to get into them that’s a million dollar question. If you’re playing long long term (20+ years) I don’t think it’s going to matter as far as “when”, but it will matter how long you hold and continue to add shares.

I keep seeing “invest in index funds”, 20% sounds great on 1 million, but on 2.5k that’s literally nothing."
2021-06-11 16:45:20,stocks,"Expecting much more than 20% returns is not realistic. You can try to look for ""gems"" but with only 2.5k to invest (keeping in mind you are a beginner) it is more likely that you lose all of it. So if you do invest in high risk stocks you need to be prepared to lose all or most of your investment. If you do still want to invest this way I would recommend two things: For one, check out r/wallstreetbets. But perhaps more importantly, try to do some pretend bets based on the information you see there (and here) before you invest for real. There is a lot of trash information out there so it is important to get a feel for what the good information is which is easier said than done."

On a more serious note, if this was more like ""when do you think the next time one or more of the major averages is going to flirt with a bear market"", that'd be more interesting to me. As I have sort of thought that could happen at some point next year. My guess has been this year is a more volatile 2017 repeat to an extent and next year could be a 2018 repeat, all 4 years later.

My reasoning is based off Presidential seasonality (the second year has tended to be a dud year apparently) and based off us getting another taper tantrum stretch next year (a lot like that time, I suspect they don't just let it ride)."

2021-06-11 14:43:56,stocks,If you plan to hold you need to hold. I was told that the taxes go against your income like your wages (if you work) and it goes off that income % that may change if you make more through stocks. 50k a year in wages is like 12-15% so that’s what your taxes would go off of. However if you’re really concerned you need to talk to a CPA and not someone that uses Reddit on the stocks page lol No offense obviously I’m here is really idk
2021-06-11 14:57:08,stocks,"That’s only semi accurate. In the US, The short term gains count as income, so if it pushes you to a higher bracket anything above that cut off would be taxed at a higher level.

However, only the amount over the bracket gets taxed at the higher level. 

Look up 2021 tax brackets, and the long term capital gains tax brackets if you want to compare what it would cost you. 

Under 40k short term gains would be taxed at 12% vs 0% for long term

From 40-50k (your example income) any short term gains up to ~86k total income would be taxed at 22% vs 15% for long term gains. 

Anything 86k-164k gets taxed at 24% vs 15% for long term gains. There’s more but that’s the gist of it."
2021-06-11 14:52:37,stocks,"Yes, short term gains get taxes like income. So its about a 25% tax difference if i can offset some of the 40% short term tax rate, and pay more taxes later when it is long term at 15%. This is really more of a trading strategy than a CPA question."

So the company pays you it’s dividend based on the number of stocks you hold, and if you have DRIP turned on, the cash deposited is turned into shares of that stock.

2021-06-11 14:55:06,stocks,"Step 1 - Pick a brokerage (I always suggest your banks for easy money transfer)

Step 2 - Read into the terminology (Podcasts, YT videos, Text) - Just please stay away from ""financial gurus"" or anyone saying they will get you some stupid 100% + returns easily or be careful of people selling courses and what not. Books - Intelligent Investor or Investopedia the website has a TON of great articles surf through all of them there.

Step 3 - Maybe look into index ETFs to begin with those are considered ""Safe"" (lack of a better word in finance since nothing is technically safe). Indexes like tickers QQQ or SPY are the big ones that pay a dividend. OR if you prefer sectoral ETFs there are others like tickers VIS (industrial sector) or technology ones or gaming theres so many! Thats another thread on it's own. If your not sure on how Expense Ratios for ETFs work or would like just say so here and I'll explain. As well as take a look at the holdings tab to see what the ETFs hold in them. (under yahoo finance - Holdings tab). Let me know what you need help with.

2021-06-11 13:54:05,stocks,Burton Malkiel’s Random Walk Down Wall Street is a good intro book.  It will help you see through a lot of the really bad investing advice that you’ll find online.
2021-06-11 14:41:38,stocks,">What is the best way to get my feet wet as a beginner investor?

buy a mutual fund or ETF with broad exposure to the US or international market. IWB, VTI, SPY/VOO, etc. this gives you tiny slices of hundreds or thousands of stock across a variety of sectors. much saver and more stable. 

for single stocks, start with Peter Lynch's books and The Little Book that Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt. 

read books. ignore anything on youTube unless it's a video interview with Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Howard Marks or a real investor with a wikipedia page."
2021-06-11 14:44:24,stocks,stay away from penny stocks
2021-06-11 15:06:01,stocks,ETFs on large indexes such as the MSCI WORLD or ACWI everything else is going more towards speculation. Just don’t buy single stocks if you cannot read a balance sheet or know basic economics. Just keep going and invest steady over some time. Paying down debt as well as avoiding it should be however your first priority. So you might get a safety deposit of 3-6 monthly income if you don’t have it already.

2021-06-11 13:19:13,stocks,"If you're only putting in 100 and you are not happy with a 20 profit I think you're in the wrong casino. 20% returns are great but that's still just a percentage. You want real money you gotta put in real money. 

Put in 10k and make 2k and anyone will be happy with that. Put in 100k and get 20k back and you've made more than most in 6 months of work. But it takes money to make money. 

You want your 100 to turn into 1M in a week? Even drug dealers can't get that rate of return. 

I have a few small positions of 100 shares each and if I make a few hundred here and there I'm fine. That's more than people make in a week sometimes. I day traded a stock and got 350 profit out of 5k. Could've made 600 but nobody got perfect timing. That was 7% return in 1 day. 1 fucking day. Go to any financial institution and ask what instrument will give you 7% in 1 day. You won't even get 0.5% in a year on most stuff now. Be real. 

You want bets that are lottery tickets then buy a lottery ticket. 100 buys a lot of scratchers."
2021-06-11 13:31:45,stocks,Decide on a plan when you buy the stock to begin with.  It’s better to make money and miss out on making a little more than it is to not make any at all.  Decide what percent you want out of it and then set your sell limit.
2021-06-11 13:45:18,stocks,"Never feel bad after a win. You thought it would go up and it went up, sell and enjoy your profits and don't look back.  Also, why feel bad about small profit amounts if you are only putting small money in? If you are doing well maybe start upping your investment amounts."
2021-06-11 13:19:49,stocks,"I’m in a similar boat. For one of my more recent investments, I’ve decided that when I double my money, I will take out my initial investment and let the profit ride. That way, Atleast I’m not losing money, and if I make a little more that’s great. I can decide to cash that out whenever I want."
2021-06-11 13:23:31,stocks,"This is a big question but it the answer is “it depends on your style” and do you care about takes on your gains. In the US, realized gains are taxed differently depending on how long you held the stock.  

If you believe in your stocks long term, then never sell.  If you bought Apple in 2000 and held until now, your gains would be ridiculous.  Would it have wiser to sell along the way or hold?  A long term investor would never sell if they believe in company and it’s underlying business. 

If you don’t believe in your stocks, have little understanding of them, or are playing momentum plays then sell at whatever your comfortable with.  In your case, you could decide to take half of $20 your gain so you lock in some profits or wait to sell until tax rates are more favorable."
2021-06-11 13:24:38,stocks,"When you purchased the stock, you did so because you had to reason to believe its market cap was not at fair market value. You therefore have a valuation that is fair, and subsequently one that is over valued. You sell when your holding exceeds fair value and encroaches into overvalued."

2021-06-11 15:10:53,stocks,Just ask yourself if you find a better investment for your money. Don’t touch it if there isn’t anything. It’s quite likely that the stock is that high for a good reason. You may buy with fresh money something else instead to rebalance your portfolio. Just don’t forget the tax when you realize some gains.

I learned that a huge part of investing is emotional control and how to control it. 

That the value of a share is the intrinsic value, not the market value

I learned how to identify undervalued shares (or maybe I'm still in a 7 year phase of beginners luck)

Don't chase gains, chase company ownership

A lot about taxes 

All the metric and ratios, what they mean and how to use them

How to do forecasting (I mainly learned this from my job but the market helped)

The best areas to find information and how to ignore the bullshit artists

How the market actually functions. What determines a price and how that price changes, on a technical level. 

Too many lessons I've learned to list them all. I don't mean it disparagingly but visiting Reddit helps to put it into context. Many of the things you think are common sense are not. Even the conceptual idea of a share is not intuitive knowledge to most people."

The only argument I would make against them right now is their price. At just over 200 dollars a share, this puts them at a P/E ratio of 34.44. While they've been dominant in earnings over the pandemic, to expect them to maintain a similar level of dominance in the future as Amazon starts to compete is a harder sell. To justify their current valuation would be to justify paying a premium for earnings that will likely be undervalued by about 20% post-pandemic in the short term. Is that premium really worth it right now for entry?

Having said that, the company has been in a great position to capitalize off of the pandemic, and has done so successfully, justifying a major increase in its stock price. A big part of this price momentum started by the announcement that UPS would commit to using EV's in the future. Given the social and economical implications of being ahead of a learning curve like this, the stock went up following the news. The company will also benefit from increased online retail in the future, and is explosive in earnings right now, so they have some concrete upside"

2021-06-11 12:10:14,stocks,The person who lent out the stock does not get the dividend. The person who borrowed it pays interest (typically considerably higher than dividend to account for minor risk and higher taxes for interest) to the guy he borrows it from. Whoever he sold the stock to gets the dividend normally and doesn’t even know he has a “borrowed” share.
2021-06-11 13:00:43,stocks,"Thanks for replying. It’s tricky, I guess many retail investors don’t even know their shares have been loaned, interest is usually an annualized rate whereas a dividend can be anything and anytime. Like RKT paid a $1.10 dividend, that was 6% instantaneously.  I wonder if there were investors who thought they were getting the dividend and didn’t because their shares had been loaned out. How about with CHNG, their SI is down from I think as high as 15% to about 6%, do the short sellers have to deliver the shares, or can they just pay the per share price, what if it was a split cash / acquirer share deal? Sounds messy and I wonder how well this is all accounted for and controlled."

2021-06-11 12:35:40,stocks,"TGT: Consumer staples are among the most defensive stocks on the market, and that tends to hold true with their dividends. While Target's dividend is currently not very competitive, I believe overtime that it will become more dominant. Target provides basically the same service as Walmart, but attracts higher wage earners than Walmart, resulting in higher profit margins. Target is also ahead of the fight for 15, having already committed to raising employee wages to 15 dollars an hour across the board. This has not stopped Target from shattering it's earnings Estimates every quarter since the start of the pandemic. There's no reason not to think that Target won't grow it's dividend overtime as it matures.

PFE: Pfizer has a dividend yield of 3.83% compared to its market median of 2.26%. The company has steady revenue for a while with the demand for covid vaccines still rampant abroad, and the eventual need for booster shots will give them additional revenue. In addition, the company is situated to handle it's short and long term debts. 

IBM: Controversial company due to the fact that it recently quietly laid off its older workforce, some would argue a necessary evil in a tech company that needed to adapt. Having said that, IBM is a rare tech stock with a high dividend yield. While many would prefer tech stocks reinvest their earnings, IBM is a mature company that likely would not fully benefit from future reinvestment at this point.  IBM currently has a dividend yield of 4.36. IMO this stock is worth holding long term for the Quantum Computing potential alone, as IBM is working on Quantum Computers that while not currently applicable, have applications that can potentially increase productivity tenfold in the future, and thus would be massively profitable. This is a long shot, as other companies are working on such computers, but still significant upside nonetheless.

AFL: Safety is an important component of dividend stocks, and Life/Health Insurance is one of the safest industries out there. There will always be a demand for insurance products, and stocks like Aflac that are underpriced can make for great conservative investments as well. With a 2.35% dividend yield in a defensive industry, this stock is a safe bet to raise its dividend in the future. It also currently trades at a PE ratio of 7.22, which is very reasonable this day and age and undervalued from its earnings. The stock has been earning at a PE ratio of about 10, suggesting the stock is undervalued by 40%"

1st of all margins are going to shrink. Thats pretty much a given since they are already at customer saturation and facing headwind from competitors. I switched this year. Cant beat $10/mo for a t-mobile 3rd party seller... my phone has been more reliable than my wife on VZ... VZ wont go away but their margins will shrink. Thats pretty much a given.

I was thinking its got a decade before batteries become powerful enough that satellite phones will be viable. Satellites are easier to deploy and gives far superior coverage. Towers are more expensive than most people think. The hardware is cheap but there is constant worker upkeep plus you need a hell of a lot more of them. Satellites on the other hand, are probably seeing costs plummet rapidly in terms of hardware and launch costs. Its just a matter of time. Maybe not a decade, but 2 decades is probably a forgone conclusion.

Now thats not to say that VZ wont find some way to get into the field but as of right now, they are not a leader and the current leaders dont seem like the kind of folks who will want to share. At the very least, for VZ to enter, they will need to do some serious soul searching. A total cut of dividend would be wise in order to build cash for some buyouts. I also dont understand their rising debt... i get they need to constantly upgrade and expand but... I dont like the model. If you cant pay for things without debt, stop issuing huge double tax divs."

However, I did stumble across MGP Ingredients while looking at a list of highly-shorted names.

MGPI has a short float above 20% and a days-to-cover ratio over 20. I'm surprised by the bearish sentiment for this stock in light of its recent strength, both in terms of earnings and stock price performance. The company also acquired Luxco in April 2021, which, if my math is right, is accretive to earnings and was closed at a P/E ratio of 7.

MGP Ingredients has two divisions: distilled spirits (like bourbon, rye and gin) and food ingredients, like starches and proteins. It's a cyclical business for sure: The stock has plenty of pops and drops since it started trading in 1988. Nevertheless, it seems like the market for spirits, especially aged brown spirits, is in a secular upswing.

At any rate, this struck me as a decent trade idea that, even if it goes wrong, may have investment potential. MGPI has been around since 1941, paid a dividend for at least a decade, and the dividend per share has increased by 700% since 2015.

2021-06-11 11:47:24,stocks,"One concern I'd have with being long on this stock since it is in the alcohol industry is the rise of legal weed/cannabis in the US. The cause for concern is that cannabis use is correlated with a decrease in alcohol use (as someone who drinks and smoke pot, I can confirm this is true). Overtime I think that increase in cannabis consumption and acceptance will drive profits away from alcohol. 

Having said that, it's only one factor in the industry. A strong competitor in any industry is a valuable stock, and MGP seems to be trading at a fair valuation."

We have purchased a couple market research packages and what we are seeing (so far) is a small depression in sales for beer and wine with spirits *seemingly* unaffected in areas where legal marijuana has become a thing.

And in my opinion that is likely where the chips will fall. Beer, wine and weed can be very casual consumption (open a cold can after work vs light up a spliff) whereas cocktails are more intensive to make, and are more centered around a social experience.

Or maybe the decline in spirits consumption from marijuana is negated by the trend of younger adults gravitating more towards spirits in the first place. Who knows."

Amazon's U.S. retail business is the ""fastest growing at scale,"" the analysts wrote.

After 9 months of consolidation, amazon should be finally able to break out. AWS and advertising keep growing, and amazon shipping operation can now challenge UPS, Fedex and USPS. For e-commerce, it is still a leader that none of the any other company can match or catch up.

2021-06-11 12:58:42,stocks,This best explains their push to 15$
2021-06-11 14:04:08,stocks,"Yep. Wal-Marts and Krogers of the world will get hurt in already thin margin industry.

&#x200B;

Dont forget Amazon also being able to subsidize their retail business to barely be profitable (if at all) with their AWS business. Wal-Mart HAS to make money in retail. Amazon doesnt."
2021-06-11 14:05:10,stocks,Why are we so against automation exactly..?
2021-06-11 13:56:00,stocks,"as grim as this is I admire this level of cutthroat competition. As much as people love to bash Amazon due to their controversies with their employees, they’re saving Americans hundreds of dollars a year with the utmost convenience."
2021-06-11 18:17:47,stocks,"When the wolf is saying he wants to protect the sheep, you better know there’s a lie being told."
2021-06-11 13:42:53,stocks,As a shareholder this pleases me.
2021-06-11 11:29:22,stocks,this is a hilarious way of looking at it
2021-06-11 15:45:10,stocks,Amazon is the government. They want total control over the supply chain.
2021-06-11 13:47:17,stocks,"But some retailers will be more impacted than others. Walmart gets hurt way worse by the push for $15 than Target or Costco who are already closer to that pay scale.

The push for $15 also is unlikely to take effect immediately. So let’s say they pass legislation today that $15 is the new minimum, it is unlikely all employers across the country need to raise the minimum to $15 that same day. There will be a timetable.

Meanwhile, Amazon racks up bad press for their working conditions and increasingly bad reviews of cheap products.

I still think Amazon is a behemoth but the whole push for $15 angle I think is a bit overblown"
2021-06-11 13:51:52,stocks,"Walmart has quite of bit of automation already. I can see all their early stage tech, become late stage pretty quickly if their is a $15 minimum wage."
2021-06-11 15:31:40,stocks,Returns will destroy Amazon
2021-06-11 14:11:27,stocks,This explains amazon push for 15 and automation.
2021-06-11 15:59:27,stocks,Not to mention Amazon has been doing this long ago. They’re so far ahead of competitors from an automation/tech/supply chain advantage.
2021-06-11 16:31:28,stocks,"Amazon took a vested interest in Kiva years ago, and after a short pilot, bought the company to keep the warehouse automation tech to themselves.  It was brilliant and a game changer.  For them to continue to drive the automation advantage, they now need to to automate the ""picking"" of products from racks.  When that happens, the amazon warehouse employees will be reduced to delivery drivers and IT people watching over the automation systems."
2021-06-11 18:59:32,stocks,And the stock is currently badly undervalued.
2021-06-11 16:18:42,stocks,"So if they advocate for lower wage then the socialists will stone them to death and if they advocate for higher wage they are evil? Lol. 

I think automation has and will always be the destination for tech companies. Amazon is the one company that can actually implement automation at huge scale. It will push the other companies to try harder or suck it up and be so so."
2021-06-11 19:36:00,stocks,I’m still waiting for the Amazon factory towns with Bezo bucks.
2021-06-11 15:25:41,stocks,"I mean, Sears did back in the day. There are still homes in Chicago that were sold by Sears."

2021-06-11 15:22:47,stocks,So is Walmart undervalued?
2021-06-11 16:17:23,stocks,"Serious question, what do you love about Amazon retail? Competitors are at least on their level these days"
2021-06-11 13:34:51,stocks,"I stopped buying from Amazon years ago. The search results got shit and a lot of the stuff they send is garbage, not to mention all the phoney review scores."
2021-06-11 14:05:12,stocks,"Dude, Bezos was already a billionaire and next door neighbor with Bill Gates in 1998 when as the CEO of Amazon he made like a 50M dollar order for Microsoft products.

Get over the hatred."
2021-06-11 17:32:06,stocks,It is incredibly difficult to avoid giving Bezos more money in 2021 no matter how much you want to avoid it

2021-06-11 17:45:28,stocks,"Amazon doesn't make $60B in profit, if you mean per year.  They've made roughly $49B the past 5 years in profit.  They payed taxes every year, (8B in the past 5 years).  Federal Income tax they had to pay since 2019.  Yes they had carryover loses for some years, like every startup.  This helps them grow into big employers who can pay good wages.  It works."
2021-06-11 14:10:43,stocks,"They also allowed millions of the most vulnerable population to shop safely from home and not leave their homes during a pandemic. 

As well as enabled a shit ton of hungry entrepreneurs to create wealth with FBA accounts.

They also offer double the federal minimum wage as a minimum."

2021-06-11 14:28:21,stocks,You’d be hard pressed to prove Amazon has a monopoly on anything. Walmart got away with some very monopolistic practices and were largely untouched by the government. Amazon has arguably even less of a moat.
2021-06-11 13:54:21,stocks,Curious. Can you define monopoly please?
2021-06-11 14:12:56,stocks,"Where do you see the Monopoly? Just because AMZN is the new largest retailer doesnt make it a Monopoly, just like WMT being the largest one doesnt mean it has a monopoly."
2021-06-11 15:37:26,stocks,"I don’t know about the others, but the article says Bezos is selling yearly to fund Blue Origin. I’m all for caution, but saying he is selling all his stock is a bit alarmist."

2021-06-11 13:36:32,stocks,"I don’t even have a Walmart close to where I live (downtown Seattle). I get your point though, I’d definitely go if it was more convenient"
2021-06-11 14:23:38,stocks,"Yes many, and that is fairly normal my city since the nearest big box stores are generally far outside of the central metro area. It’s a decent trip to go to Walmart, Costco and Home Depot. The closest Walmart and the only one I’ve been to in recent years (and it’s now been a good 3 years since I’ve been inside one) is pretty bare bones and not well kept, not very desirable to go there IMO. They are without a doubt popular though, the parking lots always seem pretty full. Just my personal anecdote though, they seem more like a suburban and rural destination and it depends on your income level and tastes. I can’t think of many things I’d want to get at a Walmart these days."
2021-06-11 17:05:53,stocks,"Yes, me."
2021-06-11 14:35:53,stocks,I've never stepped foot in a Walmart and most people I know would say the same.
2021-06-11 15:26:10,stocks,Anyone who lives near a target....
2021-06-11 17:44:53,stocks,This 100% depends on where you live. I’ve been in a Walmart 3 times in the past 25 years and don’t know a single person who shops there with any regularity.
2021-06-11 13:56:10,stocks,I’ve been in Walmart two times since covid began and haven’t bought anything from them online.  I buy a literal shit ton of stuff on Amazon and have for a decade.

2021-06-11 18:20:09,stocks,"I don’t they’re not convenient to get items unless you’re making it a full trip. To just get in the damn store to get an item in the back is a journey from the massive parking lot to massive building. I can get it being the best option if you don’t have many retailers around you too.

I believe mine does do curbside now but idk seems like a hassle too if I’m already there might be easier to get what I actually want than someone messing it up."

2021-06-11 13:37:52,stocks,"Been saying this for a while. They have an edge on automated robotic warehouses while a lot of other retailers don’t, so as they convert more and more warehouses to automation they’ll lobby for higher wages to make it even harder for the retailers who just don’t have the robot R&D. Eventually they’ll hardly be paying anyone in the warehouses."
2021-06-11 15:16:26,stocks,"They know the $15 increase won't hurt them nearly as much as other retailers and that's why Amazon have already started paying $15 and lobbying to make it a legal rate.
Forcing a lower bottom line for other retailers is going to make it harder for this either retailers to compete. 
Amazon is very predatory in business morality.
Even treating their own employees without grace, makes me sick."
2021-06-11 14:00:57,stocks,"Amazon actually takes a loss on a lot of its gets goods it sells to beat put competitors, they thrive off that Prime membership & AWS."

People like to shit on Amazon but they could literally have multiple price tiers like Netflix has and make loads of extra money and who knows .. they might still do it. For now, I'm more than content with their service."

I still think Walmart is much worse than Amazon. Walmart goes beyond union busting to the point they will close down the whole store, forget $15 that Amazon's pays, Walmart literally has to help its employees apply for food stamps.

I personally dont care how rich Bezos gets. Its the anticompetive nature of Amazon that bothers me."

I’ve only known conspiracy riddled republicans to stick to their ideologies and demigods no matter how outrageous they get. Mist educated democrats are willing to change their opinions and views based on new information. For example I’m not still an Advocate of gun laws when we have assault rifles being used to wipe out hundreds of children’s in schools within seconds. New technology = new laws needed. Same principle as someone doing something sketchy in office. I am a Democrat but can honestly say a Cumo lot my support and vote. I am not stuck to any one thing just “because”. I don’t double down to protect my pride. Slightly off topic from your comment but you get my point. I don’t support anyone who is full of contradictions.... bezo’s is a shithead to his workers and exploits the hell out of them. Supporting the climate crisis does not offset that.

They are going to be Amazon's main competition in a few years if ya ask me. Walmart is already partnered with the Shopify platform, along with Google, along with Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. The biggest of the biggest companies. Also about 2million other companies running their stores through the platform.

Once all of those companies have access to the distribution network Shopify is building where even the smallest business can start competing with 2 day shipping. All along with their product being shipped in their own box, not an amazon branded one? Ya good times ahead."

The question is what will the other 90 people do. Honestly, this is where economics comes into play. At some point it will make sense to just pay people $10-20 an hour (stimmy checks) to do nothing except stimulate the economy. The high paying jobs will subsidize them. 

I don’t think that can work at all but it’s the only hope service workers have. You don’t need waiters. QR code scanned on the phone, insert card, order. Cool makes food. Buser brings food. 2 people. That’s it.

Amazon is doing today to Walmart, that Walmart did to other brick and mortars in its rise.

Yes, it was very convenient to be able to buy products much cheaper at the Walmart than the small grocer.  Walmart could plop stores just about anywhere (and did).  They did it through the economy of scale, and as soon as the other stores went under, Walmart jacked up their prices and tightened an iron fist around the necks of local politicians to ensure that they never passed  any sort of regulations that would annoy Walmart or help smaller businesses.

Amazon's going to do the exact same thing.  In fact, it's *been* doing that for a while now."

2021-06-11 17:57:02,stocks,Can someone help explain to me the allure of same day or two hour shipping? Why is this a thing people want? Because Amazon and other companies are convincing people they need it? I literally have never once needed same day shipping and anticipate never needing it.
2021-06-11 14:05:24,stocks,"My experience is if you know exactly what you want, including make and model, it can be okay.

2021-06-11 14:12:03,stocks,"I commonly receive both good quality and utter shit quality products through Amazon, but my personal experience doesn't decide the overall experience of the average customer.

There's been an increasing amount of discussion regarding people receiving lower quality products than in the past, as well as their practice of inventory consolidation and fake reviews. One reason Amazon subscribers continue to grow isn't just because they offer a superior product; Amazon has been slowly strangling smaller companies for awhile now and as they overtake larger chunks of various markets and spread further into consumer's consciousness, people most likely feel the convenience of Amazon outweighs the chances at an inferior product."
2021-06-11 16:30:13,stocks,"I buy pretty much everything from Amazon. Tools, electronics, clothes, and I have yet to have a bad experience. My debit card is saved and one swipe and it's on its way. It bothers me zero how much money somebody makes on an idea or product that works well"

2021-06-11 15:50:00,stocks,No they won’t. A monopoly is a company that has exclusive (or mostly exclusive) control over producing or selling a commodity or service. Then they leverage that exclusivity into ripping off the consumer. It’s incredibly easy to build a website that sells stuff. This makes their moat softer than Walmart’s is in retail. This also means if Amazon starts to rip off the consumer the consumer will go elsewhere online. Amazon has very low chance of actually becoming a monopoly.

2021-06-11 15:01:17,stocks,"The problem is that our society does not have the infrastructure and culture in place to encourage or support an ""adaptive"" workforce.

We already have widespread unemployment (true unemployment, not the government statistic of just who's reported it) problems caused by downturned industries.

We can't easily retrain people who lose their job to automation because:

A)  These people generally have no support system in place because we don't believe in everyone making a living wage in the first place; so, they spend 100% of their time scrambling and 0% of their time actually being able to train.

B)  Schooling and education is a privilege, not a right, in this country.  Apprenticeships, internships, and grants strongly favor teenagers who have never been in the workforce before.  Older people cannot just take out another $30,000 in loans and go back to college full time.

C)  Ageism.  Even if they go back to school and get retrained, they will be competing with much younger people entering their new industry.  They will need the same internships and training opportunities, and they will lose out every single time because big employers are not going to hire a 35-year-old ex-stockboy when they can get the 22-year-old blank slate.

and, 

D)  The ""Disloyal Employee"" Effect.  Companies no longer hire from within.  Instead of taking that 35 year old stockboy and training him to do logistics within the same company -- something he will easily get and apply -- they tell him they can't promote him because he didn't get a degree 15 years prior.  So they let him go.  They don't want to retain people because they're all scared of investing in employees that might go to another employer later -- meanwhile, employees are forced to jump ship constantly because companies don't promote from witihin or invest in reskilling."
2021-06-11 14:36:31,stocks,"That is in fact how it is. We already knew automation would somewhat take over slowly. But were talking about Amazon, one of the biggest companies that already employ over 700,000 workers. Where do those people who get laid off go? You don't think big companies like Walmart won't follow? With the help of automation, it significantly reduces the requirement of man power, therefore,  leads to increase cost advantage in workforce and soon enough, a lot of companies will follow this path leaving many without jobs. Yeah we adapt, newer markets are going to open for this but it still reduces a large portion of peoples employment. This will hurt the employment rate, more than newer markers/opportunities to grow from."
2021-06-11 14:35:33,stocks,"Yes, McDonalds workers are going to adapt to this changing market, it was simply the lack of automation that was holding them back from realising their true potential!"

2021-06-11 19:24:20,stocks,"2 or 3 day shipping? Most stuff is same day here if you order in the AM or next day if you order in the PM.

That kind of fast delivery makes it an alternative to going to a store. 90% of the time I don't need it but for the 10% it's extremely handy - like a tool I need the next day - that saves me a 1hr trip to a store and there is no online alternative.

2021-06-11 17:50:43,stocks,"For starters, the world of software engineering, so many positions open, and simply not enough people to fill the roles. Companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for a single engineer.

2021-06-11 14:48:34,stocks,">The only thing I was trying to point out (in an admittedly indirect manner) was that progression for the whole can mean regression for the individual - so it is totally understandable why some people oppose and even sabotage automation improvements.

I just feel like this opposition mindset is stagnating not only themselves as individuals, but the entire world around us. There's so much epic sh\*t we can do and will continue to do, why try to slow it all down? Progress is awesome"

Maybe you should turn your hatred towards the lobbyists in the government who benefit off letting companies like that slide by. Let me tell you, there's a TON of them (if not most)"
2021-06-11 13:20:17,stocks,"Right, but Amazon is not breaking any of these rules (laws) laid out by society. Amazon already pays much higher than the minimum wage (they pay at least $15 an hour which is what Bernie Sanders has been calling for. I don't disagree with anything you said but Amazon isn't really the enemy here. If you think laws should be different, then people need to vote accordingly. If workers are unhappy with thier job and.pay, they should learn more marketable skills. There is a HUGE need right now for employees with higher level skill sets and these jobs pay very well."

2021-06-11 19:50:31,stocks,cant upvote this enough... We literally dont produce enough engineers.. The problem though stems too from high University costs and University being a privilege in the US and not a right.

You are right that people can (and maybe even should) advance their skills and shift into higher paying jobs, but in the end even somebody who works the lowest of all lowest jobs should still have a baseline of acceptable working conditions and pay with which one actually live without it being purgatory mainfested.

You mention the peoples duty to vote according to the laws the want to be made, but isn´t it deplorable that there are so many companies out there that treat their employees as bad as the law possibly allows? What does that tell about us as a society?"
2021-06-11 14:42:59,stocks,"You got a fair point there :D

And women were propably also not entirely included, at least there where aspects that where not accessible to them. But you have to admit that at least the concept is there, it´s just that they were not really there yet regarding who all should be included."

2021-06-11 13:47:04,stocks,"The years they did not paying taxes were from using net operating loss carry forwards.  You really don’t know much of what you are talking about.

Also the last three years here is what they paid.  Directly quoted from the 10-k:

 “Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $1.2 billion, $881 million, and $1.7 billion for 2018, 2019, and 2020.”"
2021-06-11 14:53:54,stocks,"Do I wish everyone on earth lived comfortably and had a cushy job? Sure. But that isn't reality. Companies exist to make money. Some companies see a benefit either morally or to thier bottom line to give all of thier employees lots of benefits, and if they can do it successfully then great. Other companies wouldn't be able to compete, or simply don't care. That is just humanity. Not sure how to fix that problem. But I do know that in the USA, if you are able and still working a shitty job that makes you pee in bottles for shitty pay, at some point you have come to grips that the problem is yourself. You probably think I sound cold and uncaring, but what I have learned in my 30 something years is that a lot of people are just unwilling to put any effort in improving themselves or thier situation, and hope that someone else comes along and fixes it for them. I just dont have much pity for those people. I am not far right, I hate Trump so much it hurts, but I also don't think the collective needs to bail these people out. Now, if they are truly not able because of some physical or mental circumstance, that is a different issue."

Even if your numbers are correct (which they aren’t, again they didn’t pay taxes those years), it would be absolutely absurdly low. 881 million paid in taxes on 386 billion sales and 60 billion in profit over the course of several years. Hahaha. I can’t. What a mathematician and scholar you are. L M F A O."
2021-06-11 15:12:13,stocks,"Mabe it is too easy to blame the companies, in the end it is the governments that allow them to operate the way the do.

My issue with this way of thinking that people working in bad conditions are at fault themselves to be in that position is that it may very well be true on an individual level, it should be treated on a macro level. Those jobs in this shape and form should simply not exist, we as a society should let nobody who is willing to work have to work under unacceptable conditions for to small a wage. that is why i don´t like how you call it bailing out, it´t not like those people don´t do anything, they contribute to the economy.

That is the baseline in my opinion, a job should support a life worth living otherwise it has no place in our society."

And Amazon has never had $386 billion in profit in a year or for that matter three years.  Never.  You clearly don’t know what the word profit means and have even less understanding of the tax code.

Last three years Amazon had income before taxes of $11.2, $14.0 and $24.2 billion.  Feel free to check out my reference on page 39 of their 10-k.

You never gave a reason as for why treating is employees like shit is Ok as long as he bring you some sort of superficial comfort in your life.

2021-06-11 14:38:32,stocks,"Imagine having an MBA from an Ivy League school and not knowing the difference between revenue (which is the $386 billion you are referring since this was Amazon revenue in 2020) and profits.   Seriously, you should ask for a refund.  Maybe Bernie can help.

BTW, my degree is only from a state school but I did get a lot of A grades and actually listened in class.  So I can read revenue off an income statement and I can read net income and know the difference between the two."

Everyday. Have you ever looked into all the exploitative practices of Amazon or do you just blindly defend something to defend it. Just because you think you are going to get a rise out of someone. I am completely unphased bro. You are just another clueless selfish ignorant kid who doesn’t care about anything but himself and takes everything for granted. Your generation is completely screwed too from all the Stimulus, bailouts, policies, advantages, loopholes, and all these policies designed to help Wall Street, the top 1%, and companies like AmAzon. This has been going on for over 15 years straight now and I assure you it will have a nasty backlash on our entire economy and financial system. You guys will pay for it and suffer for decades for it. I made my millions and much older than you.

So let’s try again.   Please provide a reference to your assertion that Amazon made $386 billion in profit per year (“roughly”).  Give me a reference and I’ll admit I’m wrong.   Or you could continue to talk past me to other subjects.

BTW I don’t care if Bezos is going to space.  It’s a free world.  He can spend his hard earned money on whatever he wants."
2021-06-11 17:09:13,stocks,"I didn’t say 386 billion in profit, revenue! I told you plenty of times already... 60 billion in profit was the culmination of profit over 3 to 4 years of not paying taxes. You are also missing the very broad point her my friend.. there are over a hundreds of companies that made billions on profits and paid zero in taxes over many year, particularly the years Trump was in office.  It’s such a silly weak arugment to say they paid 886 million in taxes on 15 billion in taxes as if that somehow negates my point. Where are you math skills?! You are disputing hard facts and side stepping the entire point. No one but a bunch of 13 year olds on here would ever agree with your logic or think it’s okay that the average American makes 35k a year and pays around 25 to 30% in income taxes every single year yet Amazon makes 22 billion in profit and pays 2 to 4% in taxes. Again where is your math and logic?"
2021-06-11 17:45:55,stocks,"Also, nobody that makes $35,000 per year is paying 30% in taxes.   For the $25,000-50,000 range the average effective rate is 5.2%.

Again, not good to lie and make up statistics that can be easily checked.  People look past your argument when you are presenting obviously erroneous items in your comments as though they are facts."
2021-06-11 17:27:17,stocks,"Ok, I’m done with you.  It’s good you finally realized the $386 billion number you were referencing was their revenue and not their profit (also, good you edited your comments to reflect this so nobody else will make the same mistake you made).

However before I go I have to correct your latest inaccuracy.  You state Amazon pays 2-4% in taxes.  In fact from their latest 10-k their effective tax rate was 10.6%, 16.9% and 11.8% for the years ended 2018, 2019, and 2020.  I’d be happy to teach you how to calculate their effective tax rate if you like.  Not too complicated.  But best you don’t keep posting statistics that are so easily disproven because honestly it undercuts whatever argument you are trying to make.  Especially in r/stocks subreddit where everyone is familiar with SEC filings and can easily check your absurd claims about Amazon’s taxes so easily.

Perhaps that flies in r/politics but not here."
2021-06-11 18:14:15,stocks,Okay pal keep making up whatever numbers you want to suit your narrative. That may fly with a bunch of 13 year olds just getting into stocks but not with someone who is a CFA and does this professionally for the last 20 years.

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,Was Yahoo blind sided by Google back in the day or did they see it coming? There are some areas of investment that are being compared to Yahoo but it seems different because everyone is anticipating them being taken out by the new thing.  Did Yahoo have time to prepare against google or was it a big surprise to everyone?
2021-06-11 11:16:09,stocks,"Yahoo was all around incompetent.  Even if they were able to predict the success of Google, they did not have the execution to do anything about it.  And if they had bought Google then they would have frittered away its advantage.  It is a case study in why the founder of a company is often not the best person to run it after it grows past a certain point.  Yang should have been tossed overboard at the earliest possible time."
2021-06-11 11:39:59,stocks,"Yahoo was a victim of mismanagement. It had all the tools to be a dominant player but squandered its advantage on terrible acquisitions (they made Mark Cuban a billionaire, the thing they bought from him was worthless a few years later), missed opportunities (they could have bought google for next to nothing) and finally a lack of understanding of their users (remember when they drove tumblr into the ground?). Basically, look at the management of companies and the acquisitions they make or don’t make. Tells you a lot about the company’s direction."
2021-06-11 12:42:08,stocks,"In 2002, Yahoo Messenger was a step from whatever Zoom is now. But there was probably some mid-level manager there who decided not to waste money on developing it further."
2021-06-11 12:04:58,stocks,Yahoo had a great directory that you could use to find just about anything.  Even today there isn't something as good as Yahoo in 1997 or so.  The problem is Yahoo let spammers ruin their directory with garbage.  They let their biggest asset be ruined.
2021-06-11 11:36:17,stocks,I dunno. I was always an Ask Jeeves person. That or I’d pay the $.10 and just text Cha Cha.
2021-06-11 10:59:08,stocks,"Yahoo was way earlier than Google.  It wasn’t really about preparing, it was about differing design philosophies.  People just preferred google’s clean search page that loaded faster vs yahoo’s super ad-cluttered format.  Yahoo probably had a superior search engine to start as well, but it was close.

Google didn’t blow past yahoo because of technical innovation or anything like that.  It was just very mundane design choices that accelerated them.  Its a very different tech landscape today.  That sort of narrow advantage would never be able to gain traction like that.  Too much money being thrown around nowadays."
2021-06-11 11:32:06,stocks,"Wasn't a surprise I would think. They supposedly had a chance to buy it at 1 million and then at 1 billion. Seems to be incompetent management.

2021-06-11 11:41:23,stocks,">Google didn’t blow past yahoo because of technical innovation or anything like that.

What's that opinion based on?

Google blew past Yahoo specifically because their tech was A LOT better. You sound like you read this in a booklet. I was there.

It's fairly simple. People prefer a search engine that gives consistently better results. Google wasn't even running ads for themselves back then. The tech was so superior that popularity was growing like wildfire on word of mouth alone. Most people (including me) heard of Google the first time from someone they knew that would say ""you gotta check this out, it's so much better"".

Then they nailed the ad system and started making crazy money. Again, because of technical innovation. Their ad panel was better, the ad costs were better. I ran ads on these things. Anyone could get in the system and run a successful campaign with minimal effort and decent results for cost. Their ad system was good at helping advertisers craft good ads that didn't annoy users, so it was a healthy ecosystem. 

Yahoo tried to essentially copy what Google was doing but again it was never as good. By the time Google had flown past Yahoo in search users, it didn't matter if Yahoo had copied the ads technology to be identical, the users just weren't there so advertisers would prefer Google.

To answer OP, I think Yahoo thought they could catch up. They saw what Google was doing and were deceived just like this comment about how simple the whole thing looks. So Yahoo wrongly assumed if they just applied themselves they could figure out what Google was doing, match it or best it, and reclaim their position."

Search engines like Alta Vista were fast and accurate, but Google was better at sorting results."
2021-06-11 12:40:40,stocks,"It is weird.   So it is definitely not a hard rule.  Running a small startup company that is engineering focused requires a different skill set than running a large one with tens of thousands of employees.  It is weird than many of the large tech companies were founded by people who were adept at both ends.  

An interesting example is Steve Jobs, who was fired by Apple's board, and for good reason.  After his experience with NeXT he matured into a much better CEO who was able to turnaround Apple and bring it to new heights.  I don't think the young Jobs could have done that."

2021-06-11 11:50:38,stocks,"agreed with you, your quoted line is incredibly flawed. 

before google you had to wade through pages of bad results, use multiple search engines, and just plain dig to find what you were looking for. Metacrawler anyone ? 

google was the first search tool that for 99% of searches could give you what you were looking for immediately."
2021-06-11 15:31:19,stocks,"I was there as well and I don't think I'd say that google was WAY better than yahoo.  It was better.

What google had going for it was even as Yahoo was packing their results with ads, googles remained really clean.  The google adds that did get there weren't annoying flash animations and garbage.

Further, google did a good job of refining results and keeping out garbage.  Yahoo just slowly devolved as you'd often get shit like the first result for yahoo being an askjeeves search for the same terms.

It took too much time as well.  Yahoo was slow to load compared to Google who early on fetishized really fast results.

Again, not to say that Google was WAY better, just incrementally so.

And how did Yahoo address all this?  By throwing more shit onto their front page, killing useful tools, and adding more ads to search results.  In short, exactly the opposite of what made Yahoo successful in the first place.  If you visit yahoo today, you get a bad version of CNN.  You'd be forgiven if you didn't realize yahoo was originally a search engine.

I used to love yahoo, and used it over google for a while.  But man did they ever squander a lead."
2021-06-11 11:59:15,stocks,"Yep, that's exactly how I remember it too. Google was revolutionary for college student me who needed to look things up frequently. It honestly felt like magic. As a CS major, a grep-like experience was what I expected search engines to be for the foreseeable future. The power of big data and ML caught me off guard. Literally everyone I know who was using the internet switched to Google within a couple weeks.  Can't think of any tech that's caught on that quickly since."
2021-06-11 18:12:54,stocks,I agree. I was first introduced to Yahoo and Google side by side in 1997. I didn't know much about computers then but it was obvious that Google just worked better.
2021-06-11 15:38:37,stocks,This was definitely a key to google's success.  I don't believe others were really crawling like google did early on.  You'd get random bot lookups on your webpage from google almost instantly in the early internet when the only mention was the address in IRC.

I could buy the argument that founder led companies are outliers on both the successful and failure ends and that the average is somewhere in the middle."

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Crash Prediction / Investments Hey guys, 

Im fairly new to investing (about a 7 months now). Ive been seeing the stock market reach new heights, and with the inflation and the amount of cash from the general public thats been put in stocks, i cant help but be worried about a crash. I own ARKK, PLTR, Crypto, and a bit of boring stuff like Coca Cola. But yet im hearing that there might be a small correction but a . boom is right around the corner as covid is coming near an end. So Im not sure who to believe. My thoughts were to sell more crypto and riskier tech stocks and put it either into Gold, S&P,  or even holding more cash. But im not too sure as i still love the tech stocks im currently invested in. In a sense I could sell my majority and take a little profit i made and cash out and see what happens with the stock market. but then i would just have cash and with the inflation happening and more stimulus checks, im also worried my cash will just become worthless. 

I wanted to know what everyone thinks of the current market and if you had any advice for me.

Still a noob here just trying to learn. Thank you!"

2021-06-11 10:57:29,stocks,"Hello OP, I had the same concern a few weeks back.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t think it’s something to be worried about. Usually, the Fed would try their best to prevent that from happening. Historically, stock market crashes happen unexpectedly.

In terms of inflation, I’m a small bit concerned for that too, but again it’s something that is largely out of our control.

Personally, I’ve been mostly focused on increasing my cash position in my portfolio to prepare for such an event. You can never really go wrong by having a good cash position; if the market crashes you’re sorted and if one of your stocks drops it’s a great opportunity (assuming no change in fundamental value)."

2021-06-11 12:10:26,stocks,"Anyone claiming they can predict exactly when the market is going to crash ignore.

The market is going to crash at some point just due to the private debt and fraud in the system.  The stock market is an open complex system so it’s impossible to predict exactly when and what event(s).  There are some mathematical properties you can’t get away from like the debt is growing far faster than economic growth.  Interest rates can’t go much lower than they are so the debt will not be able to rollover at lower interest rates.  So the defaults will go higher and the money in the system will be destroyed.  This decrease the money supply and cause a liquidity crisis.  Add fraud to the system where the banks don’t trust each other books you have 2008 and March 2020.  The fraud is far worse than 2000 to 2008.

It will cause another financial crisis but the fed will not be able to lower interest rates.  Bonds interest rates can’t go much lower than they already are meaning the price can’t go up much.  This simply means we have no idea what will happening when there is another financial crisis because it depends on what governments do.  They could buy and the toxic assets again like Japan, US, EU, etc been doing.  So far the evidence of doing this lower GDP growth and increase wealth inequality.  Could write down the debts which could cause massive paper losses on assets.  Could go the austerity route which would cause a massive drop in GDP like what Greece experienced after 2008 and massive paper loses on assets.  Could do something no one expects them to do.

With the current inflation caused by supply shocks and second order effects caused by the stimulus is decreasing the velocity of money.  Supply chains have never been this long in human history and manufacturing for certain components limited to a single company like the hardware to make high end computer chips.  We do not know how long it will take to get this worked out.

So a system that is in this fragile of state will blow up and the fragility is increasing.  We just don’t know when the music stops."
2021-06-11 13:04:36,stocks,"1.  People have been trying to predict crashes since the beginning of time. It is almost impossible. We had a crash in March of 2020, and who would have seen it coming? You can't really predict a crash, but if it happens it's good to be able to tap into money from some source, somehow, to buy the debt.

2.  Unless we have radical hyper inflation, money is not going to become ""worthless"" . You might lose a little buying power, which sucks, but your money won't become worthless.

3.Solid due diligence is what separates long term winners from losers. If you have a rock solid company, then a crash is merely a temporary setback to long term wealth."

2021-06-11 18:45:04,stocks,This is a very simple process. Trim some of your holdings on the way up when one position starts to become too large a part of your portfolio to avoid single stock risk then just sit on the cash till we get a pullback. I’ve traded full time for 12 years and we never get less than 2 small pullbacks of 3-5% a year. Look at the longterm charts. Nothing goes straight up even the indexes and ETFs then when it pulls back you roll it into your smaller size positions to even it out. This constant rotation every 3-6 months is what they do with the ETFs you own and hedge fund adjustments at the end of a quarter.

2021-06-11 11:36:12,stocks,"A suggestion I heard was to put your cash position in an S&P500 index fund.

Although you cause yourself a massive problem if you keep it there and the market crashes.

That’s the only way to potentially protect yourself from inflation, although it’s also quite a bad solution. If you believe the crash is coming in a while (maybe a year or two) then perhaps it might not be so bad of an idea, but if you think it’s coming soon then maybe it’s not a good thing to do.

I think a crash might be on the horizon, because as the economy reopens, you’ll end up seeing the stimulus checks being stopped, and a lot of the financial assistance that corporations are receiving will no longer be happening. At that point, you get much less money entering the system, and I think the massive bull run we’ve had will ultimately become unsustainable.

I have around half my portfolio in the S&P, then some other stock plays with crypto, gold, cash and some other things for diversification.

The VIX is the stock market volatility index. It measures how much people are willing to pay for protection against dips and crashes. It trades in a range. 12 is about average.

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"What’s the idea behind buying tech stocks at high PE ratios? I just saw a comment on a post that said that AMZN is currently undervalued. I’ve had AMZN on my watchlist for a while and I’ve been trying to find a decent entry point for some time.

So, I had a look at AMZN’s valuation and I saw a P/S ratio of 4.03 and a P/E ratio of 63.7, both of which would _usually_ indicate that a stock is very overvalued.

I’m still of the opinion that AMZN might actually still be overvalued, and that we’re still going to have to wait sometime until we see some growth there.

The situation with AAPL is quite bad too; P/S is 6.49 and P/E is 28.43. GOOGL, V, MA, MSFT and pretty much any kind of large cap tech stock has ridiculously high valuation figures.

So my question is, why do people continue to think that tech stocks are a great buy with these kinds of figures? To me personally, it appears that a lot of the anticipated growth is already heavily priced in, and that growth in the stock itself will take a long time (that is until the company’s intrinsic value catches up with it’s valuation)."
2021-06-11 09:54:09,stocks,"You’re correct that a lot of that growth is priced in however as they continue to grow that PE/PS ratio will decrease. For example GOOGL has traded historically around PE of 25-30 since 2010 yet their stock has gone from 311 to today’s price of $2,400. The market continues to reward those stocks for that growth."
2021-06-11 12:14:51,stocks,Looking a P/E in a vacuum isn't really a great indicator of being overvalued most of the time.
2021-06-11 10:22:32,stocks,"When most people calculate PE ratios or look through screeners, the PE ratio is usually calculated using current price/last reported earnings (usually YE numbers). 

It’s important to note that people typically buy with the expectation that future cash flows (and profits/ earnings) will grow. That means that the calculation/ valuation of PE mentioned beforehand will only hold true if the company never grows/ remains constant. 

The main reason why growth companies might have a higher PE is that people buy into them with the expectation that future earnings will outpace the PE they bought into. 

For instance, say 20M shares outstanding at $1/ea and $1M was reported from company A’s last annual report. That means the PE you could get is 20. This year they reported $2M, shares outstanding remains at 20M and price remains constant $1. Your PE is now 10. In the real world, the price of this stock probably would have risen if there were no red flags. So if you bought the company “last year” with the PE of 20, your payback period would have essentially halved into the current earnings which probably would have been reflected in capital gains. 

This is just a really basic example and no one should just use one metric to value a company."
2021-06-11 13:23:52,stocks,"You need to account for relative growth, growth consistency, and how long you are willing to wait for returns. Lets assume for a second that prices are frozen at the time of purchase to illustrate what happens over time.

Company A: PE 15 and 5% E growth.  
Company B: PE 18 and 30% E growth.

After 1 year...

Company A: PE 14.2  
Company B: PE 13.8

See whats going on? Despite being more expensive, company B is obviously far more valuable and 18 PE was far too cheap compared to Company A since it only took 1 year to be a better deal. 

In my experience, it seems that investors have different time frames for performance. For me personally, I like to look 3 years ahead when it comes to growth companies, for them to become ""reasonably"" priced compared to peers. Anything more than 3 years and I start to hesitate because I dont know if they can maintain growth for longer. 

For Amazon specifically, they are at PE 60 (or so) but in 3 years, given 30% growth, then in 3 years we are looking at PE 27. Thats not bad and mind you they just came off a 40% earning growth year. Though I dont expect rev to grow that fast, I can definitely see earnings growing 30% for a while given cloud growth and other businesses.

But I am not all people. Some people, unwisely, seem to be willing to risk waiting 10+ years and are ok assuming crazy levels of growth are maintained the entire time. Tesla stock is an example of this as are many speculative stocks. And thats fine. People are free to have an opinion. You just need to figure out where you land on time frames then decide what PE and growth is ok with you."
2021-06-11 14:29:06,stocks,"You have to adjust P/E ratios for how quickly the earnings are growing, because P/E just focuses on valuation divided by the past years earnings rate (how many years it would take to earn the valuation of the company at current earnings rate). However, companies that grow fast will grow their earnings faster over time and thus deserve a higher P/E ratio. Tech stocks are some of the fastest growing stocks out there."
2021-06-11 09:49:16,stocks,"The idea is that tech companies are more capable of reinvesting earnings via R&D, improving supply chains, marketing, brand recognition, all things that can be done by competitive companies in any industry, but in tech, these things create a much bigger long term advantage, as tech has barriers to entry, usually in front-loaded research & development costs, that other industries don't have."

2021-06-11 10:17:28,stocks,"P/E ratio is only one metric for evaluating a company. For a lot of companies it’s not a good way to value them at all. “Earnings” (the E) are obfuscated by general accounting principles. Things like depreciation will lower earnings, but not actually lower the cash that a business is generating.

Also, growing businesses generally have less earnings because they are putting so much of their cash flow back into growth. That is the case for your Amazon example. Amazon generates a ton of cash from their business, but they turn around and use it on growth projects and artificially make the E look lower, and thus the P/E higher. If they ever decided that they’ve grown enough and pulled back the spend on R&D, etc., their earnings would skyrocket. 

I’m an Amazon shareholder and I don’t consider them over valued. I barely even look at their P/E ratio because it doesn’t really matter for a company like this. I look at revenue, cash flows, and operating margins. All continue to grow massively year after year."
2021-06-11 09:55:47,stocks,"It's all about expectations. Usually companies that are considered high-growth companies have higher P/E. People don't pay because the stock is undervalued really, they are more paying for that expectation that it'll go up in the future. 

To one person, growth looks already priced in but to another they still see more growth that the stock price isn't indicating. Another thing is (which I'm not sure how heavily it affects) that a lot of these tech companies pay their employees as they get closer to top-level management in stock-based compensation. In this case, the company is able to produce more cash but at the cost of their precious ""earnings."" 

To be honest, I wouldn't base valuations solely on P/E ratios but I'd consider it as a factor. I know value investors like the oldie Benhamin Graham used this ratio as an absolute measure but it's too narrow-minded to just use P/E. The people buying tech stocks think they're a great buy because of a ton of different metrics but they are most likely growth investors (prefer high P/E ratios and understand superior earnings growth justifies a high ratio)"

2021-06-11 15:28:46,stocks,"P/E alone tells you absolutely nothing about a company. A P/E of 10 for one company could be expensive, whilst 100 is cheap for another.

It merely tells you how the market values the business. That may give you an idea of the market’s expectations, but it doesn’t tell you what will happen.

It all depends on the context in which they are trading - a company with a market cap of $10m has an almost limitless space to grow, whilst another (like Apple) with a $2trn market cap, is so big, and has so much cash, that expanding is a seriously difficult undertaking, irrespective of how innovative it is.

2021-06-11 10:25:19,stocks,"Current PEs *are* ridiculous.

Here are (some of) the problems:

1. The Fed pumped a lot of juice into the system over the last year and change.

2. Wealthier households experienced a really high relative savings rate over the last year and change. They were already flush, so the extra cheese went into investments.

3. There isn't anything else attractive to invest in, even for risk-averse investors.

4. FOMO. People see the ridiculous gains over the last year and don't want to miss out. Even people who are 100% up in a single year keep hanging on for more.

5. Bull-market memory. We've been in such a historically long bull market that people can barely conceive of the S&P 500 finishing not only down on the year, but down *hard*.

Eventually it will break back to normal range. Always does. There are always a dozen excuses why ""this time, it's different,"" but it never is. But it seems inconceivable.

P/E is a simplistic measurement (PEG tells you more, although again not a great metric to base a valuation on). And while people in this thread are right to point out that the future P/E is lower, that is based on today's price. Meaning, it might seem fairly valued on the next 1/2/3 year's earnings *if the share price stagnated*. That's where you get the phrase 'growth is priced in'.

We're looking at a scenario where many of these stocks will have to trade flat for 2-3 years in order for earnings to catch up to valuations. Unless there's a correction of course."

2021-06-11 10:11:10,stocks,"The problem with the PE ratio is that it doesn’t account for growth. Using last year’s earning gives you an historical PE, but the market is pricing in the future. Analyst also use a future PE, using the next year’s estimated earnings.  Companies that are trading at 50 to 1000 PE ratio’s, or don’t have Earnings, are priced at distant future guesses that the company will be first to dominate a new industry. Most notably like Tesla, but they’ve already been around a long time and the competition is at its heals, in fact ahead of it in many ways.

2021-06-11 12:41:06,stocks,"I agree with a lot of the comments here in terms of anticipated  growth, reinvestment, etc. I’m a sense the tech industry mirrors a lot of earlier industries that experienced meteoric growth - after an initial fight for dominance, some winners  start to consolidate their base by buying the competition and then become difficult to depose

I think the other factor here is software and content - apple, Amazon & google are all kings of those two, to lesser and greater extent. Software and content is all profit - there’s no cost of goods sold. So in a traditional business I invest to create a new product, and then each one I build costs me $20, but I sell it for $30 - yay I made $10 profit which I use to recoup my development costs (kind of - really that’s the ROI on my dev / startup costs). Here in software I pay to develop the initial product, and then an awful lot of what I receive is profit. I still need a team to maintain the code - fix bugs, add new features, but if it’s any of the enterprise level software that Amazon and google deal with, the revenue is huge compared to that cost

So the “e” of p/e needs to be adjusted to account for the lack of COGS"

This is true, but kind of besides the point. OP would compare something like an oil giant to a major tech company via PEs and ask which is overvalued of the two, all else held equal. A company that makes entirely new markets for itself to dominate in (iPhone, followed by App store, entire Apple ecosystem, services...), grows and entrenches itself via network effects, and has higher margins is going to command a higher valuation.

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"I give up on AAPL... I'm selling at a loss. I bought 100 shares of AAPL back on Sept 2nd, 2020 for $134. It's been 9 months. The current price is $126.50.

In the past 9 months, its share price has only gone above $134 only a few times, and it couldn't hold it for more than a couple days.

At the time I was debating upon whether to put my money into SPY or VIT. Had I done so, I would have seen significant gains, upwards of 19%. Instead, I'm still in the read 9 months later.

Yes, I know it's a great company. I love their products. But I can't help but think that that doens't necessarily mean anything for the share price. 

Look at their last two earnings reports.... record breaking! and the share price fell afterward. WTF? how is that even possible?

I've decided to sell at a loss of about $900. I'm moving everything into VTI so I don't have to worry about picking the right company... or the wrong company, even when it's an amazing, rock solid company.

It just makes me think about how much bad advice is given about stocks. Nobody really knows anything. They say ""pick great companies and you got nothing to worry about."" You can pick a rock solid, amazing company and still end up in the red while everything else gains."
2021-06-11 09:35:40,stocks,"Well when they tell you to ""pick great companies"" they also usually reccomend holding for longer than 9 months too"
2021-06-11 09:35:36,stocks,Wtf is this shit ..... 9 months is nothing
2021-06-11 09:31:48,stocks,You might regret it.
2021-06-11 09:34:43,stocks,AAPL is definitely a stock you continue to buy on ANY dips. It’s the most valuable company for a reason
2021-06-11 09:37:28,stocks,It’s extremely hilarious that your investment horizon for Apple is nine months. What did you think you were buying?
2021-06-11 09:35:13,stocks,"No one says that if you pick great companies you're guaranteed to gain over 9 months. 9 months is a tiny amount of time when it comes to investing. 

Ignore your Apple stock for 10 years and you'll be happy with it.

i just checked and i bought my AAPL on Sep 11 for $110 a share. You just bought high."
2021-06-11 09:48:59,stocks,"What made you buy the stock in the first place? If you believed it was a good investment, why didn’t you add more when the price dropped during this 9 months?

2021-06-11 09:43:00,stocks,Bold strategy. Stock has gone from $50 to $126 since July 2019 but yeah let’s complain about it consolidating over the last 10 months.

Switching from big tech to index funds after a huge run up in the latter is probably not a great idea.  It’s hard to imagine VTI outperforming apple over the next 10 years.

But you do what you want.  Just don’t blame other people for giving bad advice, blame yourself for accepting bad advice and buying apple when it was clearly overvalued.  It will grow into its valuation, but that takes time."

I'm sure you can at least sell it with some profits within the next 6-8 months. Especially with the traditional events happening in September and sales increasing around Christmas/holidays as well.  Catalysts are coming.  I can get your frustration seeing it trade sideways for 9 months but it is what it is, better accept it for a stock like AAPL than let your emotions dictate what to do."
2021-06-11 09:47:50,stocks,Hodl especially now there is extreme volatility in the market across all stocks. The financial system is in a crunch. I say wait it out.... not financial advice

2021-06-11 09:56:04,stocks,"Thanks for pointing that out.

I love the company, but I sorta came to the idea that since it had trippled in price the previous year, it's run is over.  Just seems far fetched to expect it to grow much more in the next few years. 

Not to mention, every time I read the papers, and on reddit, and TV, everyone is screaming that tech is overvalued. So if tech is overvalued, then maybe it needs to come back down before it can grow ?"

2021-06-11 09:52:09,stocks,That's exactly my point. I think I missed the boat. I got in too late. I bought in at $134 after it had already tripled in price in a year.

2021-06-11 09:51:18,stocks,>Thanks for your input. Do you think AAPl could be too big though? Like a GE type of situation where everyone thought that it was the best long term investment ever only to watch it slowly bleed out over decades.

2021-06-11 18:23:27,stocks,9 months is nothing. Apple is making a fuckin CAR right now and they're waiting for all the EV hype and tech to build up and improve upon. With basically infinite R&D potential you should expect something close to the best auto experience. It will sell like crazy.

2021-06-11 09:54:29,stocks,"I don’t think I am experienced enough to answer your question, but I am certain there is somebody here who knows better than I do.

The main thing remains unchanged - APPLE is a multi trillion company with a huge and solid customer base, high quality products, great future insight and influence as well as amazing brand image. This should be the values upon which you choose the investment, not because you invested 10k $ and you expect it to become 20k $ in 9 months."

We’ll go up though, for sure. Wanna know why we’ll double in value?  Because most American cars are absolute shit (better lately) but mostly still shit.

2021-06-11 09:53:55,stocks,"Nah. GE was able to continue to be profitable by emphasizing Foreign Direct Investment, and I think a lot of blue chip companies have plenty of potential to tap into foreign markets that isn't priced in by the market. I believe we will see this over the coming decade where many blue chips will be able to keep pace with historic earnings growth by investing abroad, and Apple has already strengthened their brand overseas."

This morning a new unsolicited bid of 35$ per share was announced and under consideration. Currently trading at 28$ per share premarket as it has already shot up due to the news. Definitely worth looking into as the company is undervalued already without the deal.

Resolute Forest Products Inc. (NYSE: RFP) (TSX: RFP) today declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable on July 7 for holders of record at the close of business on June 28. The company also announced additional capital investments of $50 million in its wood products operations to support its continued growth, and it confirmed the repayment of all amounts outstanding under its revolving and term credit facilities, reducing debt by $180 million in the second quarter.

I'm curious on thoughts about this.  Will it cause a pump and dump?  Is it intentional?"
2021-06-11 10:17:24,stocks,"Probably got extra cash from incredibly high lumber prices and didn't want to invest in expansion due to the cyclical nature of the industry. Lumber price seems like it has dropped a lot from its peak but still has a little bit more to go to reach its Feb/March prices. I'd probably wait a week or 2 until closer to the 28th, just to see if lumber price does drop further. It's a nice dividend so I'd definitely still get in for it (short term wise)

Edit : it's an interesting play. only 1bil market cap, 85% institutional ownership, P/E 11, P/S 0.4, near  support around 13$, lumber price approaching March support levels. If WSB starts buying calls for this anticipating a RKT pump like in March, I can see this taking off a lot."
2021-06-11 10:14:26,stocks,"The stock is trading under $14, so that $1 dividend will be a \~7% ROI in under 1 month (assuming the value of the stock doesn't drop out). For a short term play I think that's pretty good. I am only skeptical of a pump-and-dump like $RKT did in March with its dividend because $RFP is such a low market cap that many investors won't touch it."
2021-06-11 10:03:10,stocks,"Seems pretty normal to me. They got essentially a one-time windfall from the spike in lumber prices. They're using the money to put their house in order and returning some of it to shareholders. Think of it as receiving an unexpected inheritance from a distant relative and using it to pay off your credit card debt and replace your old, beaten up car."
2021-06-11 14:07:07,stocks,"Its been on the WSB radar for a while, DFV had it in his portfolio. I recently sold out most of my position at $17. It has wild volatility based on the lumber futures. I think futures are starting to level out, so if it can maintain these levels it will boost the stock. I was worried lumber prices might drop further."
2021-06-11 15:51:25,stocks,"So just to understand this correctly:  
  
For example: buy 1000 shares on the 27th, sell 1000 shares on the 29th, get $1000 on July 7?  
  
Or am I missing something here?"
2021-06-11 16:03:33,stocks,"Not wanting to invest sounds really wise.  My company bought a new CNC machine to handle temporary demand last fall, and I don't think it has even been used yet so far this year.  Complete waste of money.  We should have just turned down the contract."
2021-06-11 10:37:33,stocks,I immediately jumped on calls for this one specifically because of how well the $RKT calls did for me right before that dividend. Going to buy shares as well. Good calm on waiting and watching a bit.
2021-06-11 18:16:33,stocks,"It looked like that to me, but their forward P/E is only 2.57, so it still looks like a good buy."
2021-06-11 14:14:50,stocks,"yes I agree it's heavily dependent on lumber prices. I believe WFG and RFP are the 2 main lumber stocks, where RFP is a bit more volatile? WSB probably knows of it, but I don't think it's one of the popular stock. Its historical volume seems pretty low so I don't think there're a lot of traders in it. I think it's a semi safe play at 13$. If it doesn't pump at all and continues to drop due to falling lumber prices, you can still get out in a few weeks with 1$ dividend to offset any loss."
2021-06-11 16:08:53,stocks,"I believe you buy on the 24th before market close, and then sell on 25th after market opens. However, this strategy probably will not work because the share prices tend to increase before the ex dividend date and probably drop on the ex dividend date. A safer strategy imo is probably buy at a reasonable support level a few weeks before the ex dividend date, and sell before ex dividend date (25th)."
2021-06-11 11:49:59,stocks,How did you play RKT last time? Looking back the stock went from $24.71 on 3/8 (when the div was announced) to $25.95 (3/10) and $25.80 (3/10) and hasn’t recovered since.
2021-06-11 19:55:25,stocks,"Holy crap, that is excellent."
2021-06-11 14:56:38,stocks,The RFP ticker is blacklisted from being posted on WSB due to the market cap not meeting that community's requirements.
2021-06-11 16:20:12,stocks,"You are right, it's ""kind of"" a pump and dump, but this time orchestrated by the company themself. People will buy to get the dividend (pump) and then immediately sell once they got it (dump). Right?"
2021-06-11 16:23:32,stocks,"By the way, you say 24th / 25th, but isn't the 28th the relevant date (""... for holders of record at the close of business on June 28... "") or am I missing something here?"
2021-06-11 11:59:49,stocks,"Anyone who bought calls before March 2nd and then sold them on March 2nd was pretty much assured profit as long as they sold before it dropped back down. For options you don't need for the option to expire in-the-money or to be holding it on expiration to make a profit, you just need to sell it for more than what you paid for it which is easy to do when there's a 70% jump in price which spikes implied volatility."
2021-06-11 12:04:42,stocks,"Yeah I don’t remember the specific numbers, but I bought calls at market open on that Monday when it was trading at around $20, and it spiked to around $40, sold the calls I bought for maybe $40 for over 1k each."
2021-06-11 15:04:59,stocks,"RFP is 1.05b market cap. But if still not allowed, I guess there's always exposure from other subreddit. Maybe next week, its share price will increase enough to meet WSB requirement. Anyways, I was mainly referring to the reddit population that likes to yolo out the money calls and artificially creating a lot of buying pressure. This thing has pretty low historical volume and high institutional ownership, so if market makers are forced to buy shares, I think its price will jump  very quick."
2021-06-11 12:19:56,stocks,The RKT special dividend was announced on 3/8. If you had calls prior to the announcement you got lucky. How to play the stock after such an announcement is what I’m wondering.
2021-06-11 12:25:51,stocks,Oh. So you got lucky with the spike because you had calls prior. That had nothing to do with the special dividend announcement because it came after the spike.
2021-06-11 15:09:19,stocks,"I think WSB has anything under 1.25b-ish market cap blacklisted.

2021-06-11 14:42:10,stocks,"Who else got their NIO ticket already? 


Even at the current price NIO is still hugely undervalued. The only reason I can think of is because it's a Chinese company and many people are skeptical or have been burned by one in the past. However, NIO continues to prove the haters wrong.

Despite the current chip shortage, NIO has still managed to increase YoY deliveries. At the same time they have managed to improve upon their already impressive margins.

Although their market reach is limited mostly to China right now, that will change in the very near future. They are slated to reach the European market in September, and my guess is that it won't be too long before it reaches the U.S. too. And when that happens, it certainly doesn't hurt that Brian Deese, the head of the National Economic Council, has previous ties to BlackRock, which has a large stake in NIO.

There are several articles available in which owners of both NIO and Tesla vehicles discuss their experiences with both. And the vast majority end with claims that after driving the NIO, they won't go back. 

NIO has been downplayed by too many for far too long. It won't be long before the stock price hits triple digits. Get your ticket before it leaves for the moon."

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"JBL DD & Analysis Another new stock in my portfolio, this time I choose to focus on a stock that is working to address the chip shortage that is affecting many major tech firms. The company in question is Jabil, and I am here to make my case for why they are a strong investment to add to your tech growth portfolio, or in my case, I think this particular stock is a great future proof hedge against chip shortages in the industry. Before talking about the company, I will talk a bit about the chip shortage, so I can comment on what Jabil is doing to work around this and how it is translating to profits. 

Today's chip shortage: GM has warned that a chip shortage could cut 2021 earnings by over 2 billion dollars, and scale back EV manufacturing significantly. To address this shortage, Joe Biden signed legislation to attempt to make the US a more independent cog in the supply chain, so it will be less affected by international shortages. 

Modern Chips & Demand: With increasing demand for electronics, graphics cards, and increasing talks for building electronic power grids and electric cards, there will be no shortage of demand for transistor-based computer chips to accommodate such a large network of electronics. Even more if you account for emerging markets that will likely turn to eco-friendly energy once they start to emerge. With the US chip industry currently accounting for 47% of semiconductor sales but only 12% in chip manufacturing, and the industry being a heavy barriers-to-entry one with entry costs frontloaded into research and development, it will be difficult for new competitors to enter the field. This will likely be the market penetration landscape of the industry for awhile. The pandemic threw gasoline on this landscape and lit a match. 

The Shortage: Covid-19 causes a lot of disruption worldwide, and is partly to blame for this shortage. With the work from home orders, plenty of companies had to enable software and hardware to allow their employees to work remotely. Recreational stay at home activates also prompted spending on gaming, which also perpetuated the need for semiconductors. In addition, many servers were upgraded to accommodate this excess of digital space needed. The amount of semiconductors needed to do this, and continue to do this in the future has permanently increased demand threshold without simultaneously adding new suppliers. Even though the pandemic ending might free up the supply short term, long term, the world will need plenty of semiconductors to continue its transition to electric. Global semiconductor sales rose from 412.3 Billion in 2019 to 439 Billion in 2020. Another reason for the shortage is the increasing complexity of cars, additional safety features and increasing standards will also drive up semiconductor prices for years to come. During the start of the covid lockdown, car companies anticipated lower future demand, and cancelled production of millions of vehicles, further backing up the stressed supply chain. Since issues in supply chains are not easy to fix, analysts expect this shortage to continue well into 2021

Jabil: Jabil is a semiconductor manufacturer that is working to supply the major tech firms during this chip shortage. Operating 90 plants in 23 different countries, they have a large supply chain more immutable to disruption thanks to it's flexible and strategically located plants across the world. The key advantage of Jabil's supply chain is its ability to re-route supply from alternative sources in time of need, as demonstrated when they were serving the Japanese market in 2011 after natural disasters.  [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2011/03/23/despite-japan-vulnerability-jabil-circuit-looking-at-breakthrough-year-of-growth/](https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2011/03/23/despite-japan-vulnerability-jabil-circuit-looking-at-breakthrough-year-of-growth/)

Jabil also is recognized for its strong corporate culture, which promotes the concept of lean manufacturing, the idea of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. This kind of focus is a very forward thinking and futuristic one, and will pay dividends as Jabil is able to adapt overtime to regulations that will cripple other companies. Over the years, it's strategic acquisitions have helped to develop it's unique supply chain, and gain manufacturing expertise in multiple countries.

Pros: 

Situated to Capitalize off of Chip Shortage: With the supply chain advantages Jabil has, they are in a strong position to capitalize off of current market conditions. With new graphics cards starting at over 1200 dollars, and increasing demand for semiconductors, Jabil will have a strong demand for their products/services for a long time. 

Future-Proof: With the future demand for semiconductors, I feel this stock is very effective as a future-proof portfolio stock. This company will be situated to deal with chip shortages in an increasingly computerized world. 

Undervalued: Jabil has been earning at a PE ratio of 38.46 over the past 5 years, but trading currently at a PE ratio of 23.89. Given how it is currently priced relative to earnings, this suggests this stock is undervalued by about 60% of it's value. 

Strong Financial Situation: With 1.4B in liquidity, they have roughly a quarter of their market cap in cash. Jabil also has no issues with long term debt.

Cons:

Off of Highs: The stock was recently at all-time highs and may correct itself in the near future

Low dividend yield: The stock currently only has a dividend yield of .55%, which is low even for it's industry. I am not too concerned about this, as companies tend to improve as dividend stocks as they decline as growth stocks, but it is worth noting."
2021-06-11 07:00:09,stocks,"How long realistically do you think the chip shortage will last? Or do you think due to the limitations on mining, manufacturing, supply due to more demand, etc, it will go on sort of indefinitely?"
2021-06-11 07:01:50,stocks,"I think the chip shortage will end this year, but come back at some point in the future as developing countries continue the switch to electric grids. 

Hence why I think most of the value in this stock is as a future-proof defensive play, but I feel there is also some growth/value potetnial"

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about stocks 
I just watched a video that really helped me to understand how options work. I’ll leave the link below.

With that being said, I want to try to make my first option play. The stock I am looking at is $WISH.

Right now wish is at $10.90, I believe it will go up to $12.50 by July 16. 
I purchased one call of WISH at a limit price of $1.85 a share, which cost me $185.

Looking at the Greeks I can see that every dollar WISH goes up past $12.50 will earn me $50 (0.5096 Delta)

My question is, what happens if WISH jumps to $15, $16, $20, etc before my option expires on July 16? 

And if the break even price is $14.35, does that mean that the stock has to hit $14.35 in order to make my initial $185 back? And then if it goes past $14.35 then I can start making the $50 profit per dollar? 

If that’s how it works, then why don’t people just buy the stock in bulk and sell it when it goes up?"

2021-06-11 06:34:22,stocks,"No ..

Based on my limited experience.   My stock was at about 10.00, purchased 17 calls at 12.50 strike price.  Stock is a little over 11 now, and I've made an unrealized profit of 41.5% on my calls.

VGAC is the stock mine are in. Merger vote happened yesterday, merger on the 16th.

The numbers you are looking at, come into play if you plan on exercising.  Only a very small percent of people who purchase options actually exercise them.  If you plan on exercising them, the cost of the shares would be the strike price, plus the premium you paid for the option (and the fees).  The reality is that selling the option would make more money for you than exercising the option.  Which is the reason very few people ever exercise options."
2021-06-11 06:40:32,stocks,"You seem to understand.  Why not buy in bulk? Cost and risk.  All you have at risk is your $185.  If you bought 1000 shares you would have $10,900 at risk."
2021-06-11 09:41:37,stocks,What's the video you watched?
2021-06-11 06:32:47,stocks,"Yes that’s how it works, but there’s no guarantee it will go up, you’re wanting a 50% gain in less then a week, no offence, but wish is a pump and dump by wsb so I’m doubtful you’ll even hit your break even price. The reason people play with options is because the loss risk is mitigated."
2021-06-11 06:38:01,stocks,"The break even is that it has to hit that price by the date.  Or your in negative territory. 
Being a month out is risky. Because if it trades sideways for the first few days you'll start loosing value quickly. I find 3 months out better.

Google options calculator. There are good ones that show the gains and decay."
2021-06-11 06:43:26,stocks,"Thank you for your help. 

I bought one call of WISH to play with because I am new with options (I usually only buy stocks)

With that being said, I bought one call of WISH, which is currently at $10.90
I believe it will hit $12.50 by July 16th. 
It is telling me that to break even I have to hit at least $14.20
So does that mean that if I don’t hit $14.20 then I won’t make any money at all? And that I’ll lose the $185 I paid for the call?
And does that mean that if it hits $15.20 I only made $50 off of the call?

What happens if it hits a number like $17 or $18? Is the call useless because no one will buy it at that point? Sorry for all the questions"

Thanks for being patient with me"
2021-06-11 06:52:12,stocks,"No it is not useless at 17 or 18, but the closer you get to expiration the harder it will be to sell the option contract to someone else. If not You can exercise it(buy the shares) before expiry and then sell them in the open market for $17 or $18 to make profits."
2021-06-11 07:13:57,stocks,"Your contract represents 100 shares. You paid 185$ for this contract. If you wanted to buy 100 shares at 10$ instead you would have to commit 1000$. If the stock crashed suddenly you're at risk of losing 1000$ vs only 185$ from the contract. Furthermore, instead of buying 100 of the stock, you could buy 5 contracts and make 5 times the gain for roughly same amount of capital invested."

2021-06-11 06:39:49,stocks,"It’s okay, thanks for your reply thougj"
2021-06-11 07:01:35,stocks,"It took me several videos, Reddit post, and articles to get the answers to options. Each article doesnt explain all the different ways to play options, and things to consider. Warning: Don’t buy options that expire near the earnings reporting date. A lot of times they tend to lose value after earnings."
2021-06-11 07:03:14,stocks,"But again, you would make more money by selling the option than exercising it.

Each day the option gets closer to the expiration date theta is eating away at your extrinsic value. While the stock is otm, all of its value is extrinsic.  

The normal play for an option, is to buy it and sell it (sell to close) before the expiration date.

 The majority of my options, I purchased June 4th.  My expiration is July also. I will watch the daily stock price to decide, but I plan to sell my options today, or sometime next week. I don't plan on waiting until July to sell the options.

I may leave some money on the table by doing this, but if I believed that the stock price is going to keep going up, my play would be to sell the July calls, and buy calls further out.

And I would not say your call is useless if the stock price is 17 or $18 on your 12.50 call.  I would say exercising the option would be useless in the sense that it would not be the right thing to do.  If the stock jump to $17 today, the premium for your call would go through the roof, and it might be the time to sell it, depending on what you expected to do next week."
2021-06-11 07:34:39,stocks,"Yeah you can make plenty of money off of just one contract. If you want you calculate your profit pretty easily.

Let's say for example wish jumped to 18$ and you decided to exercise your contract (which you should almost never want to do). Your profit would be the stocks price - the strike price, times 100 as the contract is for 100 stocks, minus the price you paid for the contract. In this case you would get (18-12.5)*100 - 185 = 365$ profit. So in this case you would be left with 550$ after exercising from your original 185$.

In reality, if the price reached 18$, you would sell the contract rather than exercising because each contract has value based on how long the contract has left before expiry. If you exercise early, you end up losing this value, so it's better to sell it as you'll make more profit. 

Let me know if anything doesn't make sense."
2021-06-11 11:35:00,stocks,"If you're this new to options, I'd strongly advise you to do paper trading first for at least a few months if not a year. Option premium are fairly expensive in terms of the time frame you get. Assuming you hold until expiration for the Jul 16 11$ call and the stock is 12.5$ by then, you'd be losing roughly 20%, instead of gaining 20%. Due to the high volatility of the stock from recent weeks, the options premium have also increased which lower your room for profits. There's also the fact that in a few weeks once the hype dies out and volatility decrease, your call price will decrease significantly even if the stock price stays the same. And then your call is also decreasing by 1.5% daily or something even if the stock stays the same."
2021-06-11 06:41:32,stocks,"Yes precisely, the break even point is your cost plus base on the call, anything after that is profit. But even if it doesn’t hit that you’re only risking your premium."
2021-06-11 07:13:06,stocks,"Thank you, I don’t plan to exercise my calls, I only plan to sell them. Someone had mentioned to set a limit on the calls after they’re purchased, so that they will sell if the price drops too much, could you explain how to do that? I don’t see it on the call"
2021-06-11 06:47:51,stocks,"Right now WISH is at 10.90
I bought a call for $12.50

Someone on here told me if it goes too far up (like if it hits $17, 18, 19, etc) that I won’t be able to sell the call because no one will want to buy the call for that price. Is that true?"
2021-06-11 08:21:05,stocks,"Action: Sell to close
Order Type: Stop loss limit.  

With stop loss limit, you set a percentage you willing to lose. If you bought At $100 and you set a loss limit of 10% it will automatically sell for you if it hits $90.



I prefer Trailing stop loss. It helps you realize more gains. For instance, if you bought at $100 and the price goes up to $300 and  you have a trailing stop loss of 10%, it will sell it when the price drops to $270. With a regular stop loss it will never capture the gains on the way up. If it runs to $300 and drops all the way back down to $90. It will sell at $90 and you miss out on those momentum gains."
2021-06-11 07:24:45,stocks,"I've not done that yet, I believe you would sell to close with the stop limit. Maybe somebody will chime in they can help. I'm going to guess that it's going to be different with different brokers, I use Charles Schwab."
2021-06-11 08:25:35,stocks,"That's not true at all. If Wish jumps to $17 your $12.50 call has $4.50 of extrinsic value. If there is time before expiration then someone will buy it for at least $4.50. if you're at expiration, anyone buying it for less than $4.50 would be able to profit.

Also, it's true that the majority of options expire useless. But it's not correct that people rarely execute option. In fact if you buy an option that's in the money at expiration, the broker will automatically execute it on your behalf. It just requires a lot of capital.


Also on you buying wish because you think it will be worth more in July. Here's the breakdown.

Say you had $180. Current Wish price is $10.90. you bought a call for $1.80. 

Wish closes at $15 before option expires:

Use $180 to buy single $12.50 call.
If you held to expiration. Sell option for $2.50.

= $250 sale - $180 paid = $70 profit

Use $180 to buy 16 Wish shares at $10.90
Sell same time as option at $15 price

= $240 sale - $174.4 = $65.6 profit

Wish closes at $17
Option = $450 sale - $180 paid = $270

16 shares = $272 sale - $174.40 paid = $97.60 profit

Wish closes at $13
Option = $50 sale - $180 paid = $130 loss

16 shares = $208 sale - $174.40 cost = $33.60 profit

Wish closes at $8
Option = $0 sale - $180 cost = $180 loss

16 shares = $128 sale -$174.40 cost = $46.40 loss


So, with the option you are risking losing a Max of the price paid, $180. But your break even is at that premium paid $1.80 Plus strike price $12.50, so $14.30. so your option will only make money if it passes $14.30. every penny above $14.30 wish closes equals $1 of profit for you, since your option represents 100 shares ($0.01 x 100). BUT while your option is just breakeven at $14.30 had you bought shares instead you would have profited $54.40 ($14.30-$10.90)

What all this means is that if you thought we should be worth $14.50 before your option expires, you still would have been better off buying shares. Your option play is only the best move if you think wish could be above $16 (and this is based on the cost of your premium compared to the opportunity cost of buying shares). Or if you think wish is either going to go up or down by a lot. And you want to limit your max risk to $180."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2021-06-11 11:35:39,stocks,$NIO at $31 was an absolute steal - the recovery since the bottom has been nuts
2021-06-11 06:20:59,stocks,UK economy growing for the 3rd month in a row is a good sign. Vaccine rollout has been going well. Feels like things will be opening back up very soon.
2021-06-11 10:44:53,stocks,If nothing goes wrong today I’m gonna be green 4 weeks in a row - the first time since October. Down only 7% now overall
2021-06-11 09:05:08,stocks,Anyone here invest AND trade?
2021-06-11 11:35:43,stocks,Still waiting for the day I breakeven for ARKG :’(
2021-06-11 14:50:07,stocks,glad I bought the CRSR dip yesterday
2021-06-11 10:04:05,stocks,A year ago I thought Dave & Buster's would be the most likely company to go out of business.  The stock has quadrupled since then.
2021-06-11 10:35:20,stocks,Really positive week. Started investing three months ago and finally back in the green after being down as much as 24% at one point. Castle finally green which was one of my bigger investments. Plug Power on the up. Hopefully earnings are good.

2021-06-11 10:23:48,stocks,"I've learned my lesson.  Whether I'm selling something after a week, month, or year, it'll rocket literally minutes after I sell.

2021-06-11 10:23:46,stocks,"I am retired so I have a lot of time on my hands. I am dabbling in the stock market, but I am trying to learn from my mistakes, from others, and from research. Last night I came up with the idea of practicing the art of Due Diligence (DD) with people here. So far though, I haven’t seen evidence that anyone really spends much time helping anyone else.

If I spent time practicing DD for your portfolio, would you return the favor?"
2021-06-11 16:25:22,stocks,"One of the best weeks I've had since starting my portfolio in February and I basically did nothing. 

I'll give my holds one more week to truly guage their performance and then I'll look to consider a hyper steady DCA plan to slowly build them up while still maintaining a decent cash position. Glad to have finally strimmed down to a bunch of holds I feel overall content and relaxed with. Hopefully will ensure no more needless selling and while also giving me the clearer head I need to be willing to take advantage of deep red days."
2021-06-11 09:51:18,stocks,"How far are people thinking Ford can run? 

It’s got a vice grip on the truck sector in America and is valued at 1/2 of what most of it’s peers are valued at. Even if it gets to $25/share in 2-3 years that is a huge return."
2021-06-11 10:38:55,stocks,"oil pipes keep on piping up, while big oil just sucking big dick. Hopefully next week India’s reopening will drive prices up."

I know typically you wanna keep stuff in but I think I was tricked into buying magnachip. In addition another company is going to buy shares at $29.

Or should I just try to check the current prices often and buy them with an immediate order when i notice the price is low? I feel like if i set orders in advance, i won't get a price near the bottom of a dip, but if i don't have an order in advance, then i might miss the opportunity altogether. Is this a common conundrum traders think about? I would like to somehow meet both my criteria without having to be constantly looking at prices. Maybe it's just not possible."

2021-06-11 14:33:03,stocks,"Can someone ELI5 how RSUs are taxed? I’ve read a few articles but don’t fully understand. 

Let’s say I start a new job today and my stock vests next year on June 12, 2022. On that day let’s say I receive 100 shares. Does my company take some of those shares for taxes? For example if my federal tax rate is 20% does the company hold on to that and only give me 80 shares? What about state and city taxes that are usually taken from my paycheck, do those get taken out by the company holding on to some shares? If so, let’s say that’s another 10%, so now I have 70 shares of my own. 

SELL SAME DAY
If I sell those 70 shares on the day they vest, do I pay any taxes at all?


SELL IN FUTURE - GAINS
If I sell the shares in 6 months and the price of the stock has increased from the vesting price, am I hit with my normal income tax rate (I.e., 20% federal and 10% city)?

If I sell the shares in 2 years and the price of the shock has increased from the vesting price, am I just hit with the capital gains rate?

SELL IN FUTURE  - LOSSES
If the stick has dropped and I’ve essentially lost money, but I decide to sell — do I pay any taxes at all?

Thanks!"

2021-06-11 10:34:38,stocks,"This idea that the reason China stocks are struggling is related to a nationalistic attitude is quite laughable. 

I doubt that they’re overly shorted, just check out what the Hang Seng and a couple Chinese indexes have done for a while and compare it to the big China stocks I can think of. There’s no coincidence here, the reason BABA/BIDU/JD have all struggled for a while is simply because China’s stock market has struggled.

Now I do submit to ‘nothing ever lasts forever’ but the Shanghai Composite just does not look good if you zoom out and that combined with China tapering means that it could easily turn ugly again if you zoom out."

2021-06-11 12:38:40,stocks,"Bullish on American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).

1. Technical pattern in a consolidating bull-flag since March, which matched their previous peak way back in August 2018 pre-pandemic.
2. Going into peak sales season of summer/fall. Swim vacation summer, back to school.
3. **Aerie** has been a runaway hit for them, growing to close to a 10% share of the women's underwear and lingerie market, all this while Victoria's Secret continues to lose share at a precipitous pace, down from 32% to 21% in the last five years. Aerie has grown sales in Q1 2021 89% yoy, **online sales grew 160%** yoy, and operating margin grew to 26%, meaning that they are at an inflection point to take full advantage of operating leverage and convert incremental sales to profits.
4. I see continued momentum into Aerie, and in a best case scenario, I could see them **PASSING VICTORIA'S SECRET in market share in five years**, especially as malls continue to die, and especially if they continue to build upon synergies in their [growing ath-leisure, lounge and swimware lines.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2021/01/21/aerie-looks-to-double-sales-to-2-billion-as-shoppers-ditch-victorias-secret/?sh=2006326750a4) Aerie's OFFL/NE label, as a lower cost ath-leisure alternative to Lululemon, has been picking up a whole lot of steam among Tik Tok influencers.
5. Huge things happen to returns when you pass a respected market leader in a slow moving industry. DPZ (Dominos Pizza) returned gains to investors outpacing Amazon over the past ten years, as they slowly overtook Pizza Hut in market share for the first time. These things don't happen often, but when they do, cash in. Aerie has an outside chance to pull it off......... Assume Victoria's secret doesn't grow (as it hasn't been) and revenue is stuck around 7B/year. Aerie is at 1B in revenue, growing >50% per year. At 50% growth rates per year, they will do it in 5 years.
6. **I see the Jeans segment, though stagnant for years, to pick up in the next year for their flagship American Eagle brand, because jeans are undergoing their first supercycle change in 20 years, as skinnies head out the door and relaxed/mom styles, high waists, boyfriends, wides, flares and skater/JNCO cuts all compete for dominance of Gen Z/Alpha.** AE is smartly positioned in all of these categories. Expect their AE line to grow in line with other jeans comparables like Levi Strauss.
7. Consumer non-durable stock that will do well in a higher inflation environment
8. I bought long-dated options today at a strike price of 25. I've gone all-in on [hot girl summer](https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2021-04-22/la-guide-post-covid-vaccine-shot-girl-summer) by buying long dated options on underwear and beer (AEO and TAP)"

There is some good reason behind this.  On reddit, you're mostly talking to people who are not professional investors.  I can offer you an opinion on a stock based on my 4 months of experience, but I'm not going to have the depth of knowledge about the company, industry and risk factors to make an overly informed opinion.  I may be happy risking my money on something because I know the limitations of my knowledge.  I'm probably not going to make recommendations on what other people should do with thousands of dollars, though.

Proper DD takes a very long time to do correctly.  You need to spend time researching the company and the wider industry, the overall movement of the economy and technology and risks.  It's so much more than earnings reports and projected growth.  That sort of stuff isn't going to be learned in an hour - large firms have teams of people that do it as full time jobs, and even then they still get it wrong.

If you want to post or message a DD of yours, I'd be happy to critique it and tell you where I think you're missing things (with the context that I'm relatively new at this myself).  Or, if you give me a list of companies you'd like to see dd for then I can see if there's any that I'm confident enough to look at, but it's likely to be a long list of 'here's something I don't know about this company/industry)."

The only legitimate bear case is the debt, and he/they have already taken steps to reduce it and are continuing to do so.  Chip shortages are affecting everyone across many industries, so that's moot IMO. The F150 Lightning appears to be a masterpiece.  The ICE F-series is still the best-selling vehicle in America. The new Maverick is a brilliant product and they're marketing it to the right demographic.  The Mustang Mach-E has gotten nothing but rave reviews.  The E-Transit is coming next year (the Transit is the best-selling commercial van on Earth).

Ford is a trusted legacy brand that many Americans will turn to for their first EV, rather than sketchy Tesla (lots of bad press lately, Elon is immature) or some random startup that's been making cars for six months. Do you think there are going to be Cybertrucks pulling up to construction sites across America?  I sure as hell don't.

2021-06-11 12:43:29,stocks,I'm holding it.
2021-06-11 17:53:39,stocks,It's nowhere near ath. It was 100+ in 2008. Yeah I would hold shares. Leaps I've exited because of high iv but will buy back later
2021-06-11 14:25:58,stocks,I am not buying as it likes to dip a lot. I would sell some and buy back in later.
2021-06-11 12:54:59,stocks,"I'd argue that PYPL is probably a hold forever stock, more or less. I don't see it going away any time soon and in fact they are had an amazing quarter. Since adding crypto, it's opening the door to that new market. If you are going long term with it, just buy it on a red day and don't look at it for like year or two. 

If you are trying to swing trade it, best bet is to try to learn some TA and find the entry and exit points you want before making the trade."
2021-06-11 13:18:40,stocks,"I hope for everyone that's invested PYPL does well going forward, but I personally won't buy. I worked there out of college and can tell you it's a shit company with poor management. There's also no real innovation going on. What you have now is about all the company is going to be going forward. I'd suggest looking at the disrupters trying to take their place."
2021-06-11 13:52:19,stocks,"I worked in PayPal compliance for a couple years and I think the company turned a corner internally around 2018 or so. Revenue is strong, they continue to process major volume, and they're extremely strong working with businesses and ever expanding online ventures. They've also gotten a major monkey off their back in terms of regulatory concerns. I don't hold much stock, but medium term I think it is a big win and long term I think they have a strong grip in the industry"

2021-06-11 13:59:07,stocks,"Amazon is a good way to fund your kids college or something, put in 10 or 20k while they are young and watch it turn into 6 figures by the time they are college age"
2021-06-11 13:58:17,stocks,"You’ll never time it properly but anything close to 3000 is a pretty decent deal for Amazon. I’d expect this to go to at least 10,000 by the end of the decade"
2021-06-11 15:11:55,stocks,If you need some confirmation bias I just picked up some more AMZN shares today
2021-06-11 13:56:37,stocks,You probably wouldn't make much more if you were to time it rather than just buying in to it now. Just my thoughts though.
2021-06-11 14:48:57,stocks,Arkx is a good stable hold to have for long term. I would keep it in your portfolio as a stability/safety net and ballast stock that you can use for money in emergencies. It will make steady long term gains with low risk
2021-06-11 14:45:33,stocks,"I’ve held BKEP for a bit now. Positive company movement toward profitable lines of business by selling their crude oil business. My personal opinion is that their value will be largely dependent on the infrastructure bill. If that gets pushed to 2022, it could end up being a longer hold."
2021-06-11 19:25:47,stocks,"Think of them as effectively a paycheck that your company immediately invests in their stock for you

When you initially receive the stocks, they're taxed as income. Your company may use some of the stocks to cover taxes like they use some of your regular paycheck to cover taxes. I don't know if this is the standard, but it's easier than you having to figure out taxes yourself at least if the company does do this

You only owe further taxes on the stocks you receive for any gains you make off them above the vest price (because you already paid income taxes on the vest price when you received them), so if you sell them instantly, you don't owe any additional taxes

If you sell them later, you're taxed on the difference from the vest price just like you would be if you'd bought the stock at that price (since that's effectively what you did). So yeah, income tax if it's less than a year, capital gains tax if it's more than a year. And if the stock value has fallen, you don't owe any more taxes since it's a capital loss"
2021-06-11 15:05:29,stocks,I trade through Fidelity and they have that info also https://www.barchart.com/
2021-06-11 15:08:10,stocks,[https://finviz.com/](https://finviz.com/) is free and has good charting. I'd suggest buying a book or watching youtube to learn how to do TA.

2021-06-11 18:10:57,stocks,"Im not disagreeing with MadCritic, I dont know anything about that website.  I long ago gave up any websites calls for support and resistance.  I use the MAs, mostly the 30, 50, 100, and 200.  I have found the death cross and the golden cross are accurate 60-70% of the time, and in this game, it doesnt get any better than that."

2021-06-11 17:33:56,stocks,"A direct Put purchase is really a synthetic transaction.  If you are buying to open, you are purchasing the right but not obligation to sell a stock ( that you dont really own ) by a certain date ( the expiry ).  It's really just a mathematical equation, not an actual market action where you are really borrowing anyone's stock.  If you are selling to open a put then you must have the stock."
2021-06-11 11:20:49,stocks,Why?
2021-06-11 10:52:35,stocks,">I doubt that they’re overly shorted,

A lot of people on Reddit think shorting forces the price down. It doesn't. If a stock goes down it's because there's more pressure on the sell side than the Buy side. In my opinion Chinese stocks are not performing well because they aren't attractive investments due to the Chinese government's policies."
2021-06-11 10:37:35,stocks,I’ve also seen data indicating that China is actually having inflationary issues that significantly outweigh America right now.
2021-06-11 12:15:07,stocks,"Some smaller caps are doing fine though, qfin, Zh, futu rebounded nicely, they rebounded together with American aggressive growth stocks."
2021-06-11 14:46:18,stocks,"Assuming Nio fulfills the hyped growth many people expect and can maintain that for years on end, you’ll likely do fine holding. However, they’re overvalued as it is and you really need near best-case scenario for you to get appreciable returns. 

If you like Nio, I’d cash out now and do some more research to identify your price target. You need to be able to forecast their future growth to the best of your ability and calculate the approximate free cash flow they’ll bring in yoy in order to have a sensible target price imo.

Edit: if you want to let it ride for a bit longer, maybe set a stop-loss so if it dips back down you’ll sell around your limit."
2021-06-11 14:35:15,stocks,"Still an overvalued company but can rise by much more. Same for NET, I was down 20% for months, after 1 week around my break-even and cpi numbers this week, I sold Monday. Gained more than 10% since I sold... It's a risk. My avg is 57 so long way to go for me"
2021-06-11 14:58:01,stocks,"Look up NIO park if you want to get an idea of where this is going. NIO park alone will produce them 300k cars per year in 2021 and 1 million in 2022. They also already confirmed double production with their current manufacturing processes, this is just what’s confirmed now they always have more bullish news as time goes on. WhAt happens and gets announced in 2022 or 2023 and so on will be pleasant surprises that takes us even higher. NIO is the most bullish stock I’ve seen in a very long time and they will win in Asia 100%"
2021-06-11 14:23:51,stocks,"My average is about the same and after being down like 30%, even though it's tempting to bail, I can see it soaring high from here on out"
2021-06-11 14:16:27,stocks,"46 will look cheap on NIO by the end of the year man, this company is a monster they will be selling 300 to 400k cars next year and over 1 mil in 2023 along with the fact that other companies will be renting batteries from them and they profit from battery as a service and other NiO products. They helped write the new vehicle mandates for China so it’s obviously tailored for their success. I wouldn’t sell NiO bro not for a long time, my price target by NIO day 2023 (Jan 2023) is minimum 100, it could very well go much higher"
2021-06-11 14:17:08,stocks,"They are compounding triple digit growth, there’s very few opportunities that come in the market like NIO, it will be a 1 trillion dollar company before 2030"
2021-06-11 12:23:13,stocks,"Agreed. I know some people are sour since they like bought ARKK in Febrary and it's yet to bounce back. However, I view ARK funds as long term plays and just set it and forget. ARKW made me a ton of money and even looking at ARKK, if you pull back to back to the 5 year chart, it's had great gains."

2021-06-11 13:17:25,stocks,"Short term the market is a voting machine long term it’s a weighing machine, fundamentals will always win in the end I promise you that. That’s why NIO got hyped up to 70 a share but it came back down, now it’s actually showing that it does warrant the prices and it’s going to start going up, when it reaches 70 again at the end of the year it will actually warrant those prices. Just a good example of the voting versus weighing. It got blown up when it was being voted higher, but long term as it kept performing and it got weighed it’s going to go back up to those prices and actually deserve it"

2021-06-11 14:44:47,stocks,"Those three, I think their growth is going to be crazy. For me, especially NIO as it grows throughout Europe and then rest of the world. JD/BABA are huge and will only get bigger (big big discount right now imo)"
2021-06-11 19:19:42,stocks,"I’m super bullish on BABA.  It’s hard to believe the price is this low, which is why I bought leaps this week. The question is how long will fear of CCP keep investors away.  I can’t see it losing support at 205 but who knows. 

I also have some Chinese ETFs in my Roth portfolio."
2021-06-11 18:09:47,stocks,"NIO is my only Chinese stock. I love everything about the future outlook, other than the fact that it’s Chinese."
2021-06-11 14:40:58,stocks,"All three baby, all of those are big winners long term"
2021-06-11 14:42:30,stocks,NIO should be 600 JD should be 1000+ and baba should be 1500 by 2030 me and a lot of other experienced traders in my trading group have done extensive math to work out these long term price targets. They have a deviation of about plus or minus 8 to 10 percent of those target estimates

What are you used to? Robinhood?"
2021-06-11 18:12:37,stocks,"Likely isn't, at least not yet because this entire sector is behaving terribly.

XLI (the sector ETF that CAT is in) may be finally due to have that deeper dip that other sectors have seen in 2021 as after that nasty May 10th reversal, it hasn't behaved like it did up to then... At least the 6% that it posted in January probably...and considering the way CAT behaved this week, it will be continuing to lead said dip if that is the case (along with DE)."

2021-06-11 17:57:57,stocks,"One of the best ways I have found investing is to invest is following the Peter Lynch method and looking into things or markets that you know or like.

Now that we got that out of the way....  pick sectors that you think will do well.  Then go to a screener for that sector, I recommend Yahoo Finance, and start going through the stocks for that sector.  I found MRO at $6 a share this way and bought in at $8.  It's around $14 right now.  Not bad for 4 months.  I start with the chart, where it is, where it's been.  Then Financials, then Statistics like shorts, book value, MAs, etc.  Then back to the chart.  It's it's $10 now, but it was $40 in 2014, I find out why.  That can tell you it's potential.

2021-06-11 13:47:41,stocks,"Just my personal take, I think it's smarter to go with an ETF in that industry. I also like to play more of the peripherals in the industry, like hydroponic companies. That being said, also remember that Aurora is a Candian company and is already legal in Canada. When it does become legal in the US, there is no way to know what the laws would be like and if you are still only going to be exposed to the Candian Market. Like how will importing, tarrifs, etc will will look."
2021-06-11 19:28:50,stocks,"The industry has some major hurdles when it comes to being profitable.  If you want a safer bet over the long term go MSOS.  Cannabis market is the Wild West right now.  All  these companies lose money hand over fist.  US legalization hype is what drives these stocks and who knows if that will ever happen. Unlikely any time soon.  

Most of the cannabis industry bulls will tell you how buying these stocks right now is like buying tobacco or alcohol extremely early. Couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Banking hurdles and an inability to pass on high tax rates to consumers (because of black market) are the main reasons."

The rest I just have to hold cause I shorted at peak levels, even with a rise all I did was short the middle. I rebought tons of stuff that I sold and made a heap of profit doing that as well.

I’m not sure they will have huge short term growth with no formal E3 presentation expected. Some people speculate new call of duty trailer but the game isn’t expected until later."
2021-06-11 11:06:43,stocks,Msft is also a good bet. They own the likes of Bethesda and Bungie.
2021-06-11 11:16:13,stocks,"Personally I’d be pretty shocked if SNE doesn’t hit $200/share by 2024. Sony is capturing the hardcore single player audience in spades and has a lot of luxury mind share around younger folks. 

It seems Playstation is to Apple as Microsoft is to Android as far as perception goes regarding social status."
2021-06-11 12:38:38,stocks,I am also a fan of HERO
2021-06-11 09:24:01,stocks,Yeah it’s a lot so I think holding on might be better? The shock has worn off and doing quick research says holding on is typically the best strategy when a buyout is announced
2021-06-11 09:21:10,stocks,Yeah this is my until retirement account. Very long on whatever I put it into. Maybe I will just jump back into MSFT. It would be the only individual stock in my IRA.
2021-06-11 10:52:05,stocks,"Haha, only reason I did was it made no sense holding it in my taxed account, I basically am just moving it to tax advantage to keep accumulating shares there."
2021-06-11 09:57:12,stocks,"Agreed. If you are looking for long term plays, NET seems like a more solid buy."
2021-06-11 12:41:54,stocks,I bought between Feb and April.  My cost basis is $77.16.
2021-06-11 12:44:45,stocks,I’m going to keep holding it. It’s a good company and still undervalued. They just discussed it on CNBC and they said they were tempted to sell but they’re still holding. It’s seen a lot of growth in the past 5 years. Might be a long term hold for me
2021-06-11 17:57:44,stocks,I should’ve specified highs within the last 5 years
2021-06-11 14:29:59,stocks,Not going to sell any but I’m not buying more at these levels.
2021-06-11 13:01:22,stocks,"I'm trying to buy it and hold it. I missed the 260. Had it on a limit order, but it keeps going up while I keep missing the buy. 
Should I still buy at $270?"

2021-06-11 14:50:26,stocks,Thanks! What are your thoughts on those three robotics etfs I mentioned? I'm in all three and I just wonder if it's overkill / whether to consolidate. I'm also in ARKQ so really four altogether.
2021-06-11 19:44:12,stocks,Perfect answer!!!! Thanks!
2021-06-11 17:49:03,stocks,"That's my understanding as well, you'd get paid interest on lending out your shares."
2021-06-11 17:56:41,stocks,"What...? If you're STO a put you don't need to have the stock. You can be assigned, in which case you'd have to buy 100 shares at the strike price you sold the option at.

I think You mean a CC, so you're covered in case you're assigned and have to sell 100 shares."
2021-06-11 11:23:12,stocks,Exactly. Saying shorting a company makes said company go bankrupt is like saying betting on the Baltimore Ravens to lose the Superbowl make them lose the Superbowl.....
2021-06-11 11:09:18,stocks,I've seen that too and it makes sense. Everytime I see economic numbers from china I lower those 20%~ in my head.

2021-06-11 10:26:39,stocks,There’s a reason stocks like Tesla and square have high p/e. No one cares if the p/e is 300 this year when next year it will be sub 100 and so forth and so on. It’s their rate of growth that warrants it
2021-06-11 10:34:53,stocks,"Yes.

I think they'll do it better this time around. That said the fed can't let the market dictate policy."
2021-06-11 15:11:42,stocks,"Huh? You have some other goal other than making money? 

I damn sure want to make money EVERY SINGLE DAY

2021-06-11 16:39:27,stocks,"I won’t know how i did for the week until tomorrow morning but my highly diverse 401k made $6 week to date - since we are green today i’ll probably pick up a couple hundred overnight. Not a great week for the funds. The bonds in my 401k are probably an anchor 

I did make around 2k on Clov so that was the saving grace."

Some like wfc are high, but that's because they went all in storing cash and saw their EPs tank because of it. Once that falls off the calculation they'll be in the same boat."
2021-06-11 12:07:21,stocks,Average price target is less than $13. Probably should have done it at $9. I’ll put in for a few shares and go from there

Baba is trading at a greater than 50% long term discount and JD is trading at a 45% long term discount. Dirt cheap these kinds of opportunities are exceedingly rare. Buy them and never sell"
2021-06-11 13:44:09,stocks,"JD, baba, and NIO also were never on the suggested list for delisting, it was all weird obscure small cap Chinese companies that had supposed military ties. Baba is a fang stock that shits not going anywhere but up"
2021-06-11 13:55:10,stocks,"Baba is already making crazy money and steady high growth and will continue to perform, however JD will outperform and they are a true e commerce provider while baba is just a middleman essentially. JD has fulfillment centers and expansion is to every sector of commerce and has higher upside than baba. My price target on JD for 2022 is 150 it is severely undervalued right now with a fair value around 110 to 120, it would be in the 300s or higher if it was an American company"
2021-06-11 13:57:16,stocks,"China will have much faster economic growth than the US this decade, US economy I’m still very bullish on of course but China will have more upside since they are an emerging major market and US is more established already"

2021-06-11 18:44:19,stocks,"Just jumped over there and yep, seems to be gaining momentum. i went ahead and added a small amount of additional shares for the heck of it."
2021-06-11 11:56:55,stocks,"Exactly. I agree.

I invested in NIO and sold before the market downturn. Turns out I made the right decision since it's not that these Chinese companies are 'bad' or unprofitable. 

It's that the uncertainly of being a stock that is so closely related to a country where CEOs can go missing on the whim of a dictator is un-nerving. No thank you. Plenty of other fishes in the stock market, I'll take my chances with those instead."
2021-06-11 10:42:39,stocks,"I made a bunch of money years ago with OTM CALLs. I tried PUTs but never had much luck. Lately I have had less luck either way. I guess I need to spend more time studying the options before I jump in. Too often the premiums are already too high, so the opportunity for making money isn’t there."
2021-06-11 11:27:14,stocks,"Yeah, if you own 100 shares of a stock you can sell covered calls pretty easily.  For new investors who don't have a lot of money the trick is finding a stock that you even want to own that much of.  100 shares of Amazon is out of the question for most people.  Even 100 shares of a $50 security is still $5K."
2021-06-11 14:36:44,stocks,"For sure! 

I'm not the best with TA in the world, but from what I can tell it has strong resistance around that 18.50ish mark. I think you're in a good spot if you are looking for a swing."

""Until then, we will keep actively managing our inventory and using our recommendation engines to help customers find attractive alternatives.""

Basically supply chain issues so future guidance was lowered. Thanks for putting this on my radar. Hopefully it dips a few more times and gives a nice entry."
2021-06-11 17:28:16,stocks,Does that explain why it didn't go down before earnings? They beat expectations and forward looking growth forecasts. If I held before earnings that is exactly what I would want to see.
2021-06-11 10:16:56,stocks,Your IRA might not support stocks. Mine requires mutual funds.

2021-06-11 16:48:18,stocks,"Ummm I care about NIO it’s free money lol. Even if they only dominate China that’s still really good long term they will have zero issue selling millions of cars a year, realistically they will sell just as many cars outside of China as they will in China. 10 million cars a year will be a walk in the park for them long term.

GRWG - hydroponics play

HYFM - hydroponics play"

2021-06-11 10:00:14,stocks,Ah. I have excel sheets with pivot charts that i can select specific trades/stocks which separate it out.

Do either of these companies have an AWS-type component to them?

I've got a position in BABA right now avg cost around 224, but I'm interested in JD as well. The fundamentals look incredible, but I don't know what to trust coming from China."
2021-06-11 15:38:55,stocks,"Your price targets are mental. Assuming shares outstanding actually remain the same, you’re projecting Baba to be worth north of $4T in market cap and JD over $1.6T. 

But hey, you never know. Maybe your fantasies come true. I wish you the best of luck, but I feel bad for those getting sucked into hype alone."
2021-06-11 19:01:42,stocks,"I did the same. I had reloaded a decent amount at 31and had some shares sitting around from before. Saw the noise and grabbed some extras a little over 32.  Saved enough cash to do my usual buying if it keeps dipping, but a little hopeful theres some movement next week."
2021-06-11 11:27:09,stocks,What do you consider a high premium?
2021-06-11 11:30:22,stocks,Yes I agree it is prohibitive in that regard. Then there is the option to try a poor mans covered call (PMCC) where you use a LEAP to simulate having a 100 shares but this does get more complicated and you probably need higher options level to use it.
2021-06-11 15:49:05,stocks,Me neither.   I appreciate the feedback. :)
2021-06-11 18:17:41,stocks,"It should’ve gone down before but didn’t. The thing is not everyone invests for value or invest long term. Other people like trading and lean on technical analysis, momentum, hype, etc when putting money in stocks.

Regardless, it’s too simplistic to expect a stock to go up just because it shared good news in its latest quarter."
2021-06-11 10:52:58,stocks,My vanguard Roth allows me to hold stocks luckily. I already decided to jump back into MSFT and keep holding it.

2021-06-11 14:57:35,stocks,"Thanks. I apologize for the confusing question, I actually meant to specify botz, ROBO and thnq as the other three I held. Do you have any opinion on those?

Appreciate the info regarding the ark efts though, super helpful."

It separates finances, so you fund each account separately (and automatically). This means you can't dip into your investment allocation for a trade and vice versa.

You can clearly see your win / loss, have dedicated reports and stats for each account.

You're not distracted long term investments while trading.

2021-06-11 11:29:08,stocks,"Tough question.  When you buy and the price of what you bought drops a bunch, that was a high premium that you paid.  But how do you know before you lose?  I am still trying to work that out."

2021-06-11 15:00:28,stocks,"Long term ROBO should do well, it could potentially triple within 5 years. Short term it’s hard to say I think it could consolidate for a while before moving higher. I would recommend shares only not options"

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,Why Does Stocks Fall Dramatically at 4 AM? I understand certain apps and what not let people start trading early at 4 AM but for the last few days it just goes down so quick. I use Robinhood. Are they taking money out of my trades? Or is the stock market really going down that much right when it opens?

2021-06-11 12:11:58,stocks,"Robinhood has been proven to take positive retail buy orders, route ALL OF THEM through dark pools at a 1:1 ratio, and use this scam to negatively impact the stock’s price via short attack. They do this for many stocks, possibly all of them, especially “meme” stocks. 
 
This is HORRIBLY illegal, and a huge “fuck you” to its own customer base. What it basically means is that through market manipulation and computer fuckery, if you buy a stock thinking that will get it to go up (the most fundamental mechanic of the market), the hedge funds who own Robinhood can use that purchase *against* you, so that your positive purchase actually drives the price down. They’re essentially taking your money and using it to bet against you. It’s extremely profitable.
 
If that sounds bizarre and unrealistic, trust me, it’s the biggest scam on the fucking planet. 
 
The reason this happens is something called **payment for order flow.** Ever wonder why RH is free, when you used to have to pay $10 per trade for online brokers? Because the *real* money is by sending the hedge funds (who finance them) the real-time data of what ordinary people are purchasing. 
 
Since these hedge funds are “market makers,” they are allowed to take those retail orders and essentially store them for T+2 days before they *actually have to purchase the shares,* giving them a full two-day advantage on the public. 
 
The market is so rigged against retail investors it’s honestly insane. Just wait until you hear about naked shorting… 
 
Yeah, anyway, Fidelity is pretty much the only one who doesn’t pull that bullshit, because there’s no (well, much less) PFOF."

On the other end of the spectrum, the current housing market is caused by a surge in demand, and a lack of supply, which in turn drives up prices. That’s basic economics.

2021-06-11 19:28:51,stocks, Can you lose more % before the margin call if you use larger numbers?
2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Inflation is actually in the norm for the decade There is a lot of talk about inflation and how it is supposedly spiking and very high. The May 2021 CPI reported yesterday shows a 5% jump YoY in all categories with an apparently HUGE jump of 28.5 % YoY when looking at energy.

However it seems that most people, and the media, are forgetting that 1 year ago, May 2020 was when the whole economy was depressed due to the lockdowns.  For energy in particular, in May 2020 the oil futures unprecedently went negative! 

The apparent YoY spike is actually due to a base effect, or that the denominator of your calculation is smaller than usual.  You can take a look at the 20-year monthly CPI increase here: [https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)

For all categories, in May 2020 the CPI YoY increase was 0.1% . To smooth over the Covid crash, we can look at the CPI increase between May 2021 and May 2019. Mathematically this is the geometric average and it comes out to what you'd expect: 2.5%  . As you can see on the graph, the 2.5% YoY is actually quite average for the period of 2016-2019. This means that the current value of the CPI is roughly what we would have got had there been no covid and the usual inflation growth.

For energy, which apparently had the huge spike, the case is even stronger that this is simply a base effect, indicating the economy is returning to normal. The YoY increase on May 2020 was -18.9%. If you take the geometric average: square root( 0.811 \* 1.285) you get an average increase of ONLY 2% . I say only, because the average CPI increase over the last year has been as high as 8-9%. So 2% increase is actually close to nothing.

So what is the take away? Inflation fears are overblown and the Fed is right to say that this is a temporary effect. We are returning to normal, it just seems much more because we've been locked down for a year and prices were depressed due to the lockdown. In particular, I would load up on tech/growth stocks which took a hit due to rising inflation. The numbers simply don't point to the fears that we will enter a new era of high inflation.

Tldr; inflation is not real, buy growth stocks."
2021-06-11 04:22:20,stocks,"The real interest rate is -4.11%. Thats deep. 1980 was the last time it was that negative. 

The fed is obviously reluctant to rise into this because its going to tank treasury markets. Not to mention the issues it will cause over leveraged companies with poor interest coverage ratios, which is the whole growth stocks selling off issue. There are some good areas in that theme that could still do quite well so I wouldn't say it's a write-off."
2021-06-11 05:43:23,stocks,"The dollar is also dropping. Think it was .90 yesterday, 10% of the dollars value. So higher cost, plus devalued dollar.

Think the S&P is only going up because the dollar is going down. Similar to a 50 cent candy bar 40 years ago, is now 1.00, (neither that old, or eat candy to accurately price it) s&p isn't actually goin up in value, it's just costing more.

When fed acknowledges that it's running hot, and speeds up the interest rates sooner then expected, is when it goes into a correction. Look back at nov. 2018 last time they tried to raise rates.

I'm no economics major, just a noob tryin to make sense of it."
2021-06-11 08:02:49,stocks,"When looking at energy please remember that oil was like -$10 a barrel for a few hours in April 2020, 28% yoy isn’t as aggressive as it looks"
2021-06-11 04:24:58,stocks,"I was making the point on another thread that anyone trading bearish based on YoY inflation should not be allowed to manage real money.

Not only are the averages well within what you'd expect given the long term trends, some of the spikes, like energy as you noted, or used cars, are entirely based off once off COVID related factors.

I'm surprised inflation isn't a bit higher myself due to depressed supply and transport issues."
2021-06-11 04:57:48,stocks,"I don’t think it’s that simple. Money is being pumped into the system, but much of it hasn’t yet reached the end consumer. 

Look at commodities like fertilizer, grains, minerals, oil. For many we are seeing prices not seen in a decade and they show no signs of stopping. What happens to gas prices if oil hits 100$, or grocery prices if corn hits 8$? 

Assets also remain inflated as the Fed continues to pump in liquidity. 

It’s way too early imo to say that inflation fears are overblown, most of the indicators (with the current exception of bonds) show the opposite. And if the infrastructure bill gets passed, you can bet inflation is only going higher.

Personally I’m looking at an opposite approach. Reduce exposure to growth stocks on strength in the coming weeks, and increase exposure to cash and cyclicals."

You've created negative demand. And you've reentered the latter half 19th century boom-bust cycle on the *Bust* side.

Most of the people are fine with the levels of Inflation we are seeing right now, and right now it is fine, but when its going to rise even more, this will kill some gains. And Guys, dont close your eyes for things you dont want to see: Highest Jobs Openings of all time + Raising Wages for „low level workers“ = Wages are inflationary. Also almost all commodities are rising which will kill the Q2 Earnings because the net margins will get lower.

2021-06-11 11:35:53,stocks,"Govt. Spending != Inflation.

Seriously this is like a 4th grader mentality.

If the money spent goes to useful stuff, like infrastructure, that creates jobs, and which creates revenue, which in turn creates tax revenue, which such a bill absolutely will, it is a net benefit for the economy and does not mean inflation will rise beyond what we've seen in the past decade. Stuff like this is good spending that literally pays for itself with future tax revenue.

Inflation is complicated, and due to many factors. It isn't as simple as govt. Spending = inflation looming. Things like productivity, technology, and competition are all rampant and deflationary factors that have, and will continue to cap inflation.

Now I'm not saying that the govt. can spend willy nilly, obviously. However targeted spending on things like infrastructure will benefit everyone, and should not spark inflation/debt fear mongering."
2021-06-11 07:57:50,stocks,Stay out of cash except for necessary spending. Go all in on cyclicals
2021-06-11 10:52:00,stocks,"Are you collecting cash for entry points, because otherwise it would run counterintuitive to everything else you said.

Agreed with your take, it would take a level of extreme playing deaf to dismiss what’s going on in prices everywhere as “base effect from last year” . The government pumped unprecedented amount of money the last 12 months to counter a generational problem. Prices are going up due to huge demand as people couldn’t buy experiences  and are buying products, couple that with supply chain disruptions at massive scale and we are seeing raising prices from chicken to  lumber to metals. Commodities are seeing prices not seen over a decade and it’s unlikely to cool anytime soon with depressed capital expenditures over decades. There’s also transportation issues and labor shortages with increasing wages, I can’t digest all that and continue with the believe “but more growth stocks is the play” in this environment. They’re also about to start paying families with kids next month, that’s more and more money in circulation. Sooner than later, the Feds hand will be forced and the proper valuations will reset in some of these insanely valued stocks as investors will seek profitability over hopes and dreams."
2021-06-11 14:20:46,stocks,"It literally is though. Inflation is as high as it was in 2008 and we had a decade of low inflation after that. Even if you look at commodities like oil, you can see that they are essentially flat compared to the last 5 years, nothing Out of the ordinary."
2021-06-11 15:13:15,stocks,Yea any trader here in r/stocks has everything to lose if inflation gets worse and the fed jacks rates. So obviously there is a heavy bias here. Like do people honestly think the Fed can print trillions and trillions ( something like > 25% of all USD ever created) in the past year alone and expect no consequences? Ok. The monetary opium will wear off soon when the Feds are forced to raise rates.
2021-06-11 08:12:42,stocks,Gas prices in May were up 13 cents compared to May in 2019 and up about 9 cents compared to 2018. Saying gas prices are up significantly is true (it’s more around 37%) but misleading considering the unique circumstances in 2020.
2021-06-11 07:34:22,stocks,"Lumber and cars are both due to supply constraints (either manufacturing, or supply chain). Both of those will come down, likely not to previous levels, but they will come down. 

Lumber futures are down from $1700 in mid May to 1100 now. Not only that, but lumber sales have slowed due to the prices. New housing starts are way down because of the price. 

Cars are backlogged due to microchips. But, similarly to lumber, supply will increase, and new sales will decrease (because of the prices), which will help to start production up again. 

I can't speak for the housing market because I'm not entirely well versed in real estate. But I presume we are going to hit a correction at some point, I won't argue it though, because like I said, I'm not well versed. 

>I can't buy anything for the same price or 2.5% higher than in 2019 other than groceries.

I'm guessing this is an oversight when you commented, but you have to remember that the 2.5% estimate op made was using 2019 data, however, that's an increase over 2020. 

So prices should be 2.5% over 2019, then an additional 2.5% over 2020. So something like 5% over 2019 (I'm not a percentage wiz, so do your own math). 

I'm not saying there won't be inflation in the near future, but right now it's not as bad as people are saying it is."
2021-06-11 12:52:14,stocks,200? Try 500. It's not inflation though. Lumber Mills have been closing or transitioning to other paper products since 2008. Supply chain disruptions mixed with a huge demand from home builders has made a crazy recipe. I think when foreclosures are allowed again you're going to see it drop like a rock though.
2021-06-11 11:10:46,stocks,Simple supply and demand issue. Lumber prices are falling btw as supply is ramping up.
2021-06-11 11:52:26,stocks,Lagging supply to surge in demand. It's a lot easier to demand wood  then to recover the personnel and infrastructure for supply.
2021-06-11 11:04:16,stocks,Thats what I am asking myself too. I haven’t done much research on this but the reason may be that companies that are cutting wood all raised their prices to make up for covid losses. If you know anything I am interested to know.
2021-06-11 11:14:06,stocks,"all of that is still empirical evidence.  it's better to analyze data, humans are too full of bias.  we've been in a pandemic and national shutdown, which causes disruption in supply chains and alters consumer demand.  yes, it does look like there is going to be some negative effects until we are fully open across the country, and hopefully we are through most of the major outbreaks of the virus...but OP has a pretty sound argument that inflation is common in recent years and doesn't necessarily reflect a failing economy.  still, recovery is crucial and while there are some positive signs (reduced unemployed numbers for one), there are a number of others that point to a longer recovery time.  only time will tell."

2021-06-11 09:27:22,stocks,"This is the problem with kicking the can down the road on wage stagnation. You do it for a while, including bottlenecking legal immigration pipelines (we accept fewer immigrants per capita than many other developed nations), and something like covid-19 comes around where an unemployment extension + add-on clocking in a meager 40k/year means that the labor market is massively disrupted.

Many voters seem to want less immigration, no actions on wage increases, and then are surprised when 20+ years of inaction and obfuscation result in problems hiring for manual labor and low-wage jobs. Meanwhile we accelerate private “universities”, saddle ambitious young people trying to elevate their social stratum with obscene debt, and we’re shocked when they’re upset about it. All in an effort to preserve some ideal notion of “the free market”."
2021-06-11 14:17:17,stocks,A large portion of the inflation is being driven by used cars and airline tickets. I don't think anything about today's news will cause the fed to raise rates sooner than expected.
2021-06-11 09:56:52,stocks,Exactly.
2021-06-11 09:15:27,stocks,Because you will want to sell your current bonds and buy new ones with a higher yield. This tanks the price of current bonds.
2021-06-11 09:58:13,stocks,"Think of the relationship with bond prices and rates (inverse) When the fed wants to conduct some sort of quantative easing, asset purchasing program, they buy bonds from primary dealers in exchange for cash into the system which then is supposed to filter down into the real economy, what it actually does, is find its way into higher yielding speculative assets, like the market. When there is a large constant demand for bond buying it artificially suppresses the yield. When the fed tapers and stops this buying, the yields will float against the market rather than being suppressed, this is why the fed is being really careful with language regarding saying when they will taper, raise rates etc, they are basically panicking about what will inevitably happen, they weren't betting on an inflation surge, and hid behind the transitory narrative, which they still are, but the market is now thinking that the inflation rate will settle higher than the fed would like you to think, which is not an ideal position to be in."

2021-06-11 14:10:12,stocks,"Yes, technologies occasionally disrupt industries in a big way, you listed a few. However for every one that disrupts, there are thousands of technologies that don't go anywhere or end up serving a niche. 3D printing is one of them, it has amazing capabilities for a limited number of applications, namely prototyping and low volume complex parts, typically parts with internal fluid channels. For the vast, vast majority of manufacturing 3D printing is inferior to existing methods and always will be. These processes are the result of decades of investment and innovation of the same magnitude that drives 3D printing innovation, you just don't hear about then because they aren't ""sexy"".

Did you know that high pressure die casting produces a 30lb aluminum engine block with outstanding material properties and incredibly complex geometry in about 120 seconds part-to-part? I did a business case for fun once to compare HPDC against 3D printing for engine blocks, and the result was 3D printing technology is currently 100 times more expensive per part and 100 times slower, so achieving the same production capacity was 10,000x more expensive and would require 100's of metal printers, which in itself is an expensive logistical and maintenance problem. 3D printing is many major breakthroughs away from challenging existing high volume production methods, it won't happen in our lifetime.

3D printing itself is just a welding process on a motion platform, and welding has been around and researched for decades, it's limitations are well known and there isn't suddenly going to be major breakthroughs in welded material properties and performance because a motion platform was added."

I just had a burrito at a great family place nearby for $9, and I live in a nice area in a city. I can’t speak for everyone, but I personally don’t see these increases. Maybe that burrito was $8 last year, I don’t keep track enough to figure it out.

Some groceries have gotten more expensive, particularly meat. I think meat is just going to get more and more expensive because Americans just eat unsustainable levels of it. It’s already heavily subsidized so the actual price is hidden."

Long call: 06/11 BABA $212.50 for 1.63

Short call: 06/11 BABA $215 for .63

If BABA hits $215 tomorrow it says my profit is 74% but at expiration it'll be 150%.

1. Does that mean my profit is 74% if I close out the call spread before market close and 150% if I let everything expire?
2. What happens on Robinhood/TD Ameritrade if I enter a call spread position and BABA is $215.50 around 12:30 or at market close? Do I need sufficient capital to manually buy the 100 shares to cover the short leg and pocket the difference or will the brokerages automatically just give me the profit?

The exact details get a little confusing on expiration day so if anyone can tell me from personal experience that'd be awesome."
2021-06-11 01:53:29,stocks,"this is gonna be a bit tricky because since youre so close, you run the risk of pin risk

the time that matters is 5:30 PM EST. if baba is above 215 at market close and stays above that until 530, you're home free

if baba closes at 215 but dips to 213, your broker might force you to buy 100 shares on margin if you dont have sufficient capital and you run the risk of baba dipping like 5% next monday and undertaking a huge loss

i know from experience rh will autoclose your spread if baba stays at 213 because they dont want to deal with the hassle of pin risk

you're in an incredibly risky position right now and the only thing that'll save you is baba soaring tomorrow"

So I want to invest a large chunk of my money into a stock with a high dividend yield so it can snowball overtime and have a good passive income and I constantly hear ppl debating on either to pick a REIT or ETF and I’m not 100% sure what the difference is for what I’m planning.
2021-06-11 06:20:15,stocks,I suggest you look them up on investopedia.com

2021-06-11 00:12:17,stocks,"You’re right. You have no idea. In fact… I think YouTube will serve you well. I mean no disrespect. Ou just have no idea. I’ll give you the gist anyway…


Etf: a basket of investments… like a mutual fund. Only better for taxes. 

REIT: a trust which holds property. A basket of property if you will. 

Hell, you can have a reit etf. REET for example. An etf witch holds a bunch of Reits. Of which hold a bunch of property."
2021-06-11 00:13:32,stocks,Why not invest in a stock that’s expected to grow faster than your 2-3% dividend yield?
2021-06-11 04:18:24,stocks,REITs pay their “dividend” by distributing 90% of their taxable income to their shareholders. This provides the REIT the benefit of paying no income tax. They typically do better in rising rate environment because their profits come from mortgages. ETFs are just a fund that provides you exposure to many stocks at one price. Therefore it spreads your risk. The Dividend is paid from stocks in the fund. Don’t buy something for yield… high yields can sometimes indicate issues. My opinion
2021-06-11 08:01:25,stocks,Dude what. An ETF is a fund (which could even hold REITs or bonds or anything really). A REIT is a real estate investment trust.
2021-06-11 01:39:50,stocks,"A dividend or distribution paying asset doesn't intrinsically compound more than one that doesn't.  What matters is average annualized return.

E.g. a stock with no dividend that increases 10% per year annualized has the same return as a stock that increases 0% but pays a 10% dividend that gets reinvested in the same stock.  Starting from $100, stock 1 will be worth $110 after year 1, and $121 after year 2. Same with stock 2: you get a 10% dividend on 100, reinvest the $10, then get a 10% dividend on $110...so now you have $121.

If you need passive income without having to sell chunks of investments off every month to pay bills, that's different.

Most high-div/distr. ETFs have lower annualized returns than SPY. E.g. KBWD has the highest 10-yr annualized return for an ETF with a 5%+ ttm distribution yield.  It's only a 7.68% 10 year annualized return. SPY is 14.6%.

5-year total return, it's BIZD at 8.44% distr yield but only 11.37 5-year annualized return vs. 17.07% for SPY."
2021-06-11 00:10:29,stocks,Etf is a group of stocks based on companies. Reit is real estate based on mortgages and what not and investing in real estate as a whole

2021-06-11 04:49:59,stocks,"The market isn't an all or nothing game. And there's a lot of verity in both REITs and ETFs. Take some time to learn about equities; I like the Investtalk podcast in combination with investopedia (great place to start). There are many good YouTube videos but separating the good ones from junk can be an issue. 

If you like dividends (I do) start with something like SPHD. It's an ETF designed to pay dividends and have low volatility. Get used to your portfolio fluctuating, the hardest part of investing is managing your emotions. 

It really sucks to put 5 grand in 2 weeks later your pushing 8 but you make a wrong move and have 3 grand left at the end of the month. Situations like this will happen if your not careful."

Their have a tremendous amount of partnerships.  Do you know more about their pipeline?  I haven't rolled a spread.  I feel like the best way might be to get into another instrument.  Rolling is just buying it back at a loss and doing a separate trade.  I'm debating on what I will do but I have time.  If I were you and I could get out at 50 percent loss I would if it were like 80 percent loss I might ride it out.  Maybe get out of one of your trades.  Rolling down and out to like July would also be pretty slick too .  Any reason why your spread was so wide?  I have the $200/190 now that I think about it.
2021-06-11 03:44:10,stocks,they got a pretty solid balance sheet. if i were you i would sell the long leg for a profit and take assignment on the short. Then either sell cc's or hold the stock.

Then it rebounded today to $216, then tanked until after hours. So I'm hoping it'll go back up tomorrow, but I might move at a loss. If I can get out for <$200 per contract, I still come out okay.

2021-06-10 23:45:13,stocks,"$TDOC share price has come down to very reasonable levels for it's revenue growth rate/future market opportunity. Fair warning - you'd need to be comfortable holding this for 2 to 3 years at the minimum though. The recent sell off is unwarranted. There are a few different reasons for it but, imo, they are all shortsighted

>""Telehealth was only big during the pandemic/unsustainable""

The telehealth market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.7% to reach $191 billion by 2025. $TDOC is the industry leader in visit volume and providers on their platform. Stands to reason they will capture a large share of that opportunity.

>Only projecting 1 to 3% subscription/user growth in 2021 during last earnings call

They had a pipeline of customers they were scheduled to deploy their platforms to in 2021 and 2022 but then the pandemic hit and those businesses needed $TDOC's product immediately so they pulled forward a lot of growth and filling that pipeline back up will take some time. Also, subscriber growth and visit volume growth are just two levers through which they can grow revenue. There is also more products and payment models. They have shifted their focus to generating more revenue per member and **have gone from $0.85 per member per month to $2.25 in one year** and they expect this increase to continue.

>Big players like Amazon and Walmart have entered the market/ Lack of moat

I'm going to copy the CEO's answer when this was brought up in an interview just a few days ago because it's better than anything I could write:

>""... There are many companies out there, whether they’re Fortune 500 employers, large health plans, government agencies, who need and want the certainty and reliability of Teladoc Health and the scale that we bring. But scale isn’t just about reliability. It’s about the ability to use data at unmatched scale to deliver more value, better health outcomes, deeper insights and ultimately, lower cost of care. And we can do that using technology in a stepped fashion, right, such that we deliver the right care, the most efficient mechanism to the consumer depending on what their individual needs are. And with over 12 million virtual visits and over 2 million blood glucose readings a week as well as all of the weight measurements and the blood pressure data that we are getting. We have an unmatched treasure trove of data that we can apply data science against in order to really move the needle in a way that nobody else has the scale to do.

>... ""With respect to the competitive landscape, we weren’t surprised by any of the moves that have been made. And hopefully, that was evident by our comments last summer when we did the Livongo transaction. We believed very strongly at that point and continue to believe that the market massively accelerated through the pandemic. And it was our opportunity to seize the moment and put together the leaders into a category-defining solution as opposed to following. And so we said, look, the chessboard is going to be in motion and we can either be the aggressor or let somebody else dictate what it was going to look like. And I think we made the right decision. And again, none of these [Amazon & Walmart] have been sort of surprises. The truth is that although large and sort of headline making, the ones that you mentioned, we really never bump into and mostly, it’s because they are just in the very, very, very early days of sort of deciding even what they want to be, much less compete in the marketplace. And then you have a lot of smaller point solutions and this really gets to and you and I have discussed before, we win because of our multi-product breadth of solutions and that’s evident in our data about the sales that we booked as well as the revenue per member and things like that. And that’s a significant competitive advantage. So, we don’t actually see much in the way of single product sales anymore, because that’s not what buyers are looking for.""

To be clear - Livongo is why I'm so bullish on the company. TDOC's access to data via it's market leading position will train Livongo's tech to give it a large competitive advantage in the industry"

2021-06-11 00:57:37,stocks,"Personally, I've put some in CRSR. There's a few things for and against it:

1. High short ratio & low float potentially making it a meme target (this can be good and/or bad).
2. Fairly steady and reasonable valuation for the past few months at a low P/E.
3. Corsair earnings have shown nice growth.
4. Most of the outstanding shares are held by a private equity firm that is slowly selling those shares to the open market. I think this has kept the price down but also they seem to taking care not to depress the price too much. If you think CRSR has increased growth and profitability in its future, this would be a good time to buy."

2021-06-11 09:56:46,stocks,"$TSM still isn't cheap though with P/E over 30.  I think it's a good growth investment but when we talk about huge discounts I wouldn't include it.  If you look in the Semi Space the only thing trading close to a value level would be $INTC, of course they have a relatively cheap multiple for a reason, but if you buy the idea that Semi as a sector is in for a monster decade, it's hard to think the premier US Fab won't catch a ton of business just by dint of existing.  Full disclosure that I own $TSM, not $INTC, but in terms of discount multiples that's the way to see it."
2021-06-11 18:04:40,stocks,"I agree 100%. This chip shortage is temporary and TSM will eventually explode. ASML has been surging lately to help TSM meet their demands, but it's been trading at ATHs for the last month."

The volumes they has while it was going up was constantly almost double than the rest of the year,mached only by the ones reached when everyone was selling at COVID crash."
2021-06-11 13:48:02,stocks,"VIAC is just so weird to me, I feel like Paramount+ is just destined to fail, and with Cable dying I really don't have the guts to buy."
2021-06-11 10:05:45,stocks,"VIAC is the result of pushing CBS and Viacom together. There isn't really any guide for what it historically trades at. Its primary investor wasn't a hedge fund, its primary investor was and is Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone's daughter. Sumner owned the biggest stake in both CBS and Viacom. 

I am long the stock and have a little optimism, but not much. Its only hope is to be bought. They make a fortune off of cable TV and their streaming platform is a distant fourth behind Netflix, HBOMax and D+. Maybe even behind Peacock. Maybe Pluto will do well. VIAC is a pretty risky play because of the speed with which cable is losing subscribers."

You are holding the bag for the company."

2021-06-11 01:31:12,stocks,"Technically w/o delving into why, yes.  

Pretty much from AMZN's infancy it has consistently thrown available capital into R&D and expansion.  

On paper this drives the PE up.

But as a long term investor this is exactly the business approach I'm looking for.  I couldn't care less about dividends, PE at this point in the game.  I'm looking at the long-game."

2021-06-11 11:34:23,stocks,"Hard to find a comp universe to peg AMZN to - so I guess my question is here, overvalued relative to who's trading multiple? WMT? MSFT? Hard to capture the growth in both retail and cloud computing to make that argument."

2021-06-11 17:29:46,stocks,The fluctuation in price had nothing to do with VIAC. They actually capitalised on it and sold a bunch of shares at $85.
2021-06-11 05:50:23,stocks,I am bullish for them long term but I hear that their CEO and the chinese government don't get along
2021-06-11 09:32:21,stocks,Their earnings last year were about 6-7 billion usd. That’s a p/e around 14 trailing.
2021-06-11 08:03:23,stocks,"share price is, at the end of the day, buyers vs sellers. If the private equity firm keeps selling every-time the price tries to break above 35$, its not gonna break until they run out of shares or stop selling.

Fortunately, one of those two must happen eventually at which point CRSR will have a break out of its current range."
2021-06-11 10:24:50,stocks,"EagleTree Capital (the fund that hold most of CRSR) has been selling their CRSR shares at about $32 for the past several months. Check out their latest filing, which shows that they have been selling 5 million shares. That keeps the price at the 31 - 33 range for a while."
2021-06-11 07:00:56,stocks,They aren’t in much worse financial shape as compared to when they were trading at $20 a share. The stock price made no sense to me so I got in at $1.90 but think there is still upside at this price but it’s far from a sure thing.
2021-06-11 02:21:28,stocks,Still down 60% from pre pandemic levels
2021-06-11 05:26:51,stocks,"Actually it is, it may continue dropping until the 23rd. (Earnings) the rate they are growing while still turning a profit and increasing revenue each quarter. They have very little debt if any right now, which is unheard of. CEO owns 15% of shares so he’s got a lot to gain/lose on the out come of this company. It’s got a great future ahead of it. You day traders and swing traders can’t seem to process what a good company looks like before it becomes “hype” like high schoolers at a pep rally."
2021-06-11 04:17:39,stocks,I am not sure why you are being downvoted. But Xpev is a good EV play considering they make budget friendly EVs compared to NIO that aim to be the Apple of EVs.
2021-06-11 14:21:21,stocks,"I think Apple will stay stagnant or dip in the short-term. They have a massive cash reserve and aren't doing anything with it. They aren't innovative they just pump out new phones every year. People were excited about them 10 years ago, I don't think that's the case anymore and the stock price reflects it"
2021-06-11 18:39:51,stocks,Wow... diluting the crap out of it? 5 mil shares is diluting the crap out of it? Ha it sets them up for some huge changes. Also they are doing what they can. Have you not heard them working with the SEC about the whole situation? It's only a matter of time. This will be a huge company. Also moving to the Russell 1000 will set it up further.

2021-06-11 09:55:10,stocks,"R/stocks? Agreed. These people have learned to invest with targets of 10% gains over a year, and we’re in a new paradigm where all of those stocks are about to collapse and they’re so set on sticking to the status quo that their hubris will not allow them to admit somebody may have figured out something they didn’t, and know more about a given subject than they do. 

I don’t feel bad for people who lose everything because of hubris really, but I do feel bad for the families that will be blindsided by this, and I do feel bad for new investors coming here thinking they’re getting good advice when really they’re getting dogshit wrapped in catshit."
2021-06-11 19:22:43,stocks,"Agreed. And not because of the squeeze, although I do expect that to briefly propel it into the largest company in the world by market cap.

2021-06-11 06:06:17,stocks,"How does its future not look bright with the gov? As much as some people don’t want to believe it, private prisons are a necessary part of society. With this nonsense uncertainty already priced in with an extremely low PE, now is the time to buy in my honest opinion. It does have a lot of debt, though, but they have much more assets than liabilities, so I have no doubt they will survive."
2021-06-11 11:46:38,stocks,"THE leader in online masters from good universities like Duke. BUT, they've been public for over 5 years and can't turn a profit. I think this is because their degrees are VERY expensive and people are afraid of big EDU debt. If Biden wipes out student loans as promised, yes. If not, I'm 🐻 ish."
2021-06-11 10:22:21,stocks,Someone asked for an undervalued company and I presented one of the most undervalued companies to that person. What I do not know is why people think they have the right to inhibit a valuable information flow.

2021-06-11 11:13:17,stocks,"You’re making the common mistake of viewing it as another pandemic boosted growth stock. It had bigger boost (100%) between Q3 2017 and 2018 than it did since the pandemic, and it will continue to have more boosts in the next couple of years(if it does a split also, watch out!). It’s multi-dimensional enterprise with segments that are still undervalued  and the rare growth company that’s actually delivering the $ to justify the hype."

2021-06-11 10:28:27,stocks,"You don't need it. They are selling the stock now, hurting the ss potential NOW, not in 60 days.

I highly doubt board will do shit in the next 2 months about the squeeze. SEC has more chances to trigger it... When they finish their investgation 8 years from now.

See yourself in 60 days."
2021-06-11 13:35:09,stocks,"I'm viewing it as the most obvious beneficiary of the pandemic, and so did all the people who bid it up when the shutdowns started. It's gotten way ahead of its regular upward drivers. 2017-8 is completely irrelevant, because the transformative actions the company was taking then are not repeatable.

It'll resume growing when it resumes showing why it should grow."
2021-06-11 03:02:47,stocks,Trading at 17x ‘22 EV/EBITDA and just 7x ‘22 EV/GP whilst growing at a forecasted CAGR of around 20% in the next couple of years. Yeah I would say it’s undervalued relative to a low of companies out there
2021-06-11 07:33:52,stocks,"So they got their pound of flesh from Ma and Baba, the hope now is they get left alone. I was expecting a jump after this buts it's still trading sub 220"

You just want everything to be like AMC and GME. AMC won’t be around in 5 years, GME will only be an online store, still struggling."
2021-06-11 19:22:33,stocks,A lot of that is just the style of humor that comes with the ape community. It’s easier to focus on the satire when the content doesn’t fit your worldview - then it is to actually challenge yourself to engage in critical thinking.
2021-06-11 04:18:03,stocks,"I was actually referring to the people saying how undervalued it is, I believe $40-50b for pltr at its current position is pretty fair. They have a lot to do if they want to reach FAANG territory, but I’m hopeful."
2021-06-11 12:33:19,stocks,With what?
2021-06-11 18:44:01,stocks,How was it a bust? They literally cannot say it was over voted. If anything they proved it by saying there were 54 mil votes when there is only 55 mil float and 11 mil of that is shorted (at least that's what is reported) and can't vote. So at LEAST 11 mil naked shorts.
2021-06-11 19:04:31,stocks,"No goalposts moved. It was a buy at 300 and it’s a buy at 237 or whatever it’s current price is. 

It’s hard to take somebody who doesn’t know how an 8k and vote reporting works claiming that the vote count was a bust seriously, but I’ll do my best to explain using small words. 

When votes are tabulated, they’re normalized to the float. What’s that mean? If GameStop has somebody tabulate their votes and they receive 150/53 available votes, the 150 is normalized proportionally so that the votes match that 53 number (the float). So when GameStop receives the votes, they receive a tabulation that says “53/53” if there’s overvoting. If GameStop thinks there are any issues they hire an auditor and work with the SEC. And they don’t publish that until they have definitive answers. 

In short, we were in the dark before the 8k was filed, and we’re in the dark after too. 

Does that mean there was overvoting? Nope! Does that mean there wasn’t overvoting? Also nope! We don’t know right now. 

Being snarky aside, you want a remindme prediction since you seem to have doubts? 

I don’t know what the price will do in the next two weeks. I suspect it will trend up. If GameStop announces a dividend, it will squeeze and the price will skyrocket. But assuming that it doesn’t squeeze in the immediate future, I think it will trade up, down, or sideways. But I expect to see some violently upward price action on the 24, 25, and 26th of this month if it hasn’t squeezed before then, ending considerably higher than our current closing price of 233. I imagine somewhere between the 310 and 480 range. 

Go ahead and remind me that.

Prisons just should be a government thing because the government is incentivised to rehabilitate prisoners back into society. It shouldn't be a for profit business.

Look at the bottom chart in particular.

The forces  (mostly sales of improved cloud services) that drove the yoy bump  in revenues in 2017-8 have moved on (and clearly had in 2019). Different forces drove the 2020-1 bump.

They need to somehow keep that growth rate up.

How are they going to do it? Cloud is old tech now. International expansion has some opportunities, but are they as big as locking half the world in their houses with their TVs and computers and credit cards, and offering same-day shipping on a bag of chips?

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"CNQ DD & Analysis Doing a DD on another new position in my portfolio, since I got a fire new gaming keyboard, and would like to test it out by writing about stocks lol. Today's stock I'd like to focus on is CNQ, Canadian Natural Resources LTD. As an investor who's been heavily vested in several solar stocks, I was trying to stay away from natural gas, due to the inevitable clash with my other energy stocks, but honestly, it will probably be awhile before natural gas and solar stocks can't co-exist. However, I could not pass up the upside of this particular stock. 

&#x200B;

Pros:

International Diversification: Diversification in of itself is not a good reason to buy a stock, but given the other valuable selling points of this stock, I think it's worth starting with a more minor bonus, that this stock gives you foreign investment in the Canadian Natural Resources sector, which can be a nice bonus when a lot of the great companies to invest in are US companies

Strong Dividend: CNQ currently has a dividend yield of 4.19%, making it well above average in the energy sector, nearly twice as high as the market mean of 2.25%. 

Undervalued: CNQ is currently trading at a PE ratio of 19.70, despite earning an average PE ratio of 85.64 over the last 5 years, suggesting the stock could be undervalued by as much as 300% it's current price. 

Defensive Play: With the current high oil prices, CNQ will double as both a bullish short term bet as well as a defensive market hedge against inflation, or a short term correction. The industry CNQ is in is unlikely to correct anytime soon, and it's high dividend yield makes it a very defensive stock. 

Long Term Debt to Equity: CNQ also raises no issues when it comes to long-term debt to equity. While one could argue that CNQ is a tad underleveraged, this comes with the caveat of it having no issues with long term debt

Cons:

Currently trading off of long term highs: The stock was recently at all time highs and likely will correct in the short term. 

Long Term Competition with Solar: In the long term, this stock could be at odds with other explosive solar stocks that will be competing for market share while enjoying government subsidies. Short to medium term, I do not think this will be much of a problem. 

Overall: CNQ is great right now both as a defensive asset play in the energy sector as well as an undervalued dividend stock with great upside potential."

However... most of your analysis was off. The P/E is worthless because they barely broke even a couple times so their average is greatly inflated. Plus they're divesting from international/offshore exposure.

It seems Suncor is the other company one could argue will be the last man standing. Why do you prefer CNQ to Suncor?"
2021-06-11 08:39:35,stocks,"No problem. 
 
As for the exposure, a couple of their major projects have reached end of life. Since oil has been so low for so long, they've decided not to find new major projects to replace them since they can't justify the cost. They're very serious about playing it safe and getting the lowest cost for the best return. Our ceo and President literally showed up to the shovel (RH400- worth about $11m) dealer and said if he doesn't get it for 50% off he and our company are walking away and not coming back. He got it.
 
As to the intrinsic value of the company... that's hard, just because it depends so much on oil and gas prices. But if commodity prices stay roughly where they are, I can see them doing really well. They're by far the biggest player in the oil sands now and their largest mine is paid for (other than maintenance and the lease, it's pure cash flow for the next 30 ish years). I won't give a target price (the market and our government are fical bitches) but I will say that I see their cash flow only going up, especially as they buy up companies in our area (Painted Pony was an amazing play last year).
 
They also **increased** their dividend last year, and by a lot too. This is when their biggest competitor, suncor, (whom everyone thought to be the more stable and safe play) slashed their dividend by half and laid off a lot of their work force. CNQ didn't lay anyone off (though their pay for engineers is pretty bad and that kind of matters to me lol)."
2021-06-11 10:05:16,stocks,"We can produce a barrel of oil at half the cost they can. We're also improving that cost faster than they are. That's all that matters in the end. If SU needs $35 to break even and CNQ only need $19, CNQ will win every time."
2021-06-11 10:06:57,stocks,In the post he said that that Suncor slashed their dividend and laid off half their workforce. The fact that CNQ didn't do those things along is a strong answer
2021-06-11 09:40:42,stocks,"That all sounds really good, playing it safe with international disinvestment makes sense given Canada's natural resources, and the dividend yield is very attractive. How did you come to work for this company if you don't mind my asking?"
2021-06-11 10:14:13,stocks,"Suncor is conservative and cut the dividend, not because they had to, but as a preventative measure during covid. Instead of immediately reinstating it, they are aggressively paying off debt and buying back a substantial block of shares. They are returning value to shareholders via other means than dividends, and have indicated an intention to reinstate the higher dividend once this near term plan has been executed. 

This isn’t to say I prefer one over the other. I just wanted to add some balance to the comment about the Suncor dividend. Also, Suncor could absorb CNQ at some point if they wish to be the last man standing, since they are the much larger company. Again, it’s not as though I think this will happen or that I have a dog in the fight, only that CNQ’s outlasting all competition is not as obvious as has been made to seem."

I feel these actions by Suncor are a sign that they are on the decline, and who knows if they can fix their dividend in the future or not?"
2021-06-11 09:50:23,stocks,Awesome! Do engineering insights translate to investing by any chance?
2021-06-11 10:20:06,stocks,"Over a long enough horizon, they’re both in decline, let’s not kid ourselves. But fair point. If you only care about the dividend and not total shareholder value, as some retirees might, then yeah, this is a crucial point since Suncor may or may not reinstate their dividend as planned and CNQ has theirs intact. But if you’re only concerned with overall shareholder value then dividends or share buybacks or debt repayments all do the same thing."

2021-06-10 20:43:48,stocks,"There is an ex-date (you must own the shares by this date) and a pay date (when the dividend will be paid).  The dividend will be ""X"" dollars per share, so just multiply that by however many shares you have.

You can sell the stocks right away, or even before the pay date, as long as you owned it before the ex-date, you get the dividend.  The amount of time between the ex-date and pay date can vary a lot, but as long as you held it on or before the ex-date, you get paid."
2021-06-11 08:29:43,stocks,">Do I have to have stocks in for a minimum amount of time? 

you need to own the stock *before* the ex-dividend date, to get the next dividend payment. they only pay out one dividend, per share, per period. so the dividend goes to whoever holds the stock the longest (IIRC) or whoever has it on the day before the ex-dividend day. 

>Are the rules all the same for dividend payouts among all companies or do they differ? 

the rules are all the same, in some ways. for example, the dividend usually comes out of the share price. occasinoallly there's a special distribution, from cash savings the company has. but more often if the stock is $10 and they pay a 50 cent dividend, you end up with 50 cents cash and a stock worth $9.50. in time, the share price often recovers but dividend paying stocks are less likely to see big spikes in share price. dividend paying companies are more likely to be larger and more stable, so their share price tends to be a bit more predictable than an exciting new company that triples in a year. 

other ways, dividends are different. they can be paid monthly, quarterly, 2 or 4 times a year. even once a year. the dividend amount can change, but companies often prefer to not cut the dividend."

They're still not without risk as they're a couple years behind in technology and have culture problems. However keep in mind that they continue to be the revenue leader and they're vertically integrated, which gives them complete access to the value chain unlike every other player except Samsung.

Edit: I wouldn't necessarily recommend Intel for a 'play' (meaning trade). I consider them a long term hold for their decent and growing dividend and I don't necessarily need to see a lot of capital appreciation to be happy with the outcome. My broker doesn't require a lot of capital to hold the stock since it's so stable, so I consider it an efficient stock to stabilize my portfolio.

SoftBank isn’t exactly a conglomerate like Google or Berkshire where they can account for their subsidiaries revenue and profit as their own because they own entire or majority shares of the subsidiaries. 

You should look at other metrics when looking at soft bank. Like price versus equity, ROI or maybe even ROA. Also to remember that they will have to pay capital gains tax when selling stocks."

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"$CHWY Earnings key takeaways The biggest category everybody already looks at is Sales.  Even coming out of the Pandemic Chewy's Sales increased 31.7%.  Solid for any company.  They are forecasting $8.9-9 billion for the year.  

On top of the increase in sales, Chewy also, once again, added to their Gross Margin Percentage.  Adding to your Gross Margin Percentage is the equivalent of adding sales.  Q1 2020 they were at 23.4% and Q1 2021 they are at 27.6% respectively.  FY 2020 totaled out to 25.5%.  This 2.1% increase over what they did last year will result in an additional $189 million going to their bottom line based on their forecasted $9 billion in 2021 Sales.  

Also, one of the most overlooked categories I usually see when people are looking at financials statements are the cash flows from Operations.  Chewy's Net cash provided by operating activities was $98.3 million and their free cash flow was $59.4 million.   At the end of the day, cash is always king and Chewy has been rolling it in extremely well.  

My takeaways (opinion).  Chewy is in a prime position to continue the growth that has propelled them to where they are and should continue to see increased earnings going forward.  The current valuation of the company I believe is still too low and the current market cap is less than their annual revenue.  If you compare Chewy to someone like Amazon.  Amazon has annual revenue of $386 billion (FY'20) and a market cap of $1.7 Trillion.  This comes to 4.4X Annual Revenue.  Chewy is also commanding a higher profit margin than Amazon who comes in just shy of 25%.    


TL/DR:  Chewy keeps kicking Ass - is extremely undervalued.

I am comfortable with my exposure to those asset classes. For this discussion, I'm only interested in how to allocate inside the equities portion of my portfolio.

I understand we want exposure to Large, mid, and small cap stocks. I know a lot of index funds use market capitalization to determine how much a given stock will represent in their portfolio. I get the math... but, it doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't look at things like P/E ratio, price-to-book, growth, dividend yield. Is there any indexing strategies that orientated around those types of metrics?

I also know you want exposure to domestic and foreign stocks. But, how do they determine the percentage? To me, it makes sense to balance according to the size of their economies (or something similar). For instance, the US should be a bigger portion of your portfolio than Spain or Switzerland regardless of where you live. Does that feel right? More interestingly, though, is the impact of monetary policies. For instance, I feel we are going to see some currencies gain value vs others (and vice versa) as a result of the past few years. Is there any way to quantify something like that as it relates to my portfolio?

Finally, the part I find most complex: sector allocation! I don't even think the pros have this figured out yet. Either they focus on just one sector OR they include all the sectors! What strategies do you use to ensure your portfolio is sufficiently diversified in each sector. Or are you comfortable ignoring sectors you aren't familiar with?"

Now, whether I'm smart enough to beat the market, that's another discussion lol.

That being said, I am asking an impossible question! But, it is a fun discussion to have. Other people's insights can help you understand what you are trying to do. For instance, you made me realize that my investing style doesn't really care about the size of the company. I'm looking value because I understand value. I don't understand growth. So, weighting it toward larger, more established companies is going to make more sense. I'll just need to make a conscious effort to identify more small/mid cap stocks.

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"E3 is coming, watch out for the following game/tech picks. Here's a list of all the upcoming conferences coming, which will probably be held online;

https://www.e3countdown.com/


I would personally watch for 

SONY : Still the biggest leader in the game industry. While the chip shortage might affect the sales of their PS5, most of their profits in the game industry comes from games and online services. Potential big announcements and trailers;
God of War 2, more info on Horizon, Ratchet, potential remakes and such.

MICROSOFT: Same as sony, a big contender in the industry, not so much with the console itself but the services and wide range of features offered to gamers.

NINTENDO: THis one has been on a silent rise but the announcement of a potential new Zelda, Metroid or IP might spike it up a bit.

GAME COMPANY:

UBISOFT: UBSFY (OTC) might also be in interesting play even for the short term. I just saw an ad on YouTube promoting their upcoming conference, Ubi Forward.


EA: After their usual debacles and predatory management, their stock always takes a hit, but one Battlefront game announcement is enough to rake in some big upward movement in their ticker.

Other and mores:

Actvision; ATVI, same as EA. Do not forget they merged with Blizzard.

AMD: They're heavily involved with game publishers and they sometimes make brief appearances during the PC Conference. Keep your eyes open.

Square Enix, Capcom, SEGA; Being JPY stocks, you can mostly trade them as OTC stocks but they might still be interesting swing plays.

UPDATE: SONY will not be hosting a conference this year."

>The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20.

 So my question is, if I buy shares on the friday before record date, do I have to hold until the Jul 19th, or am I in the clear b/c the shares are being distributed as a ""dividend"".  


My instincts tell me that it should probably read share holders as of the split date will receive 3:1 because otherwise a new shareholder after the 21st of Jun basically committed to losing 75% of the value.   


My experience with ""dividends"" if you hold on the record date the next day you can sell and still receive the dividend...  


The wording just seems off... or I could be crazy... 

I guess is a ""stock"" dividend materially different than a ""cash dividend""?

Unfortunately value investors (while still big money) aren't most of the money on Wall Street, that would be the ""sheep money"" that chases whatever trade is in vogue right now. Sheep money is heavily underweight China (i.e not adding to any positions or even selling positions), they are overweight US and European cyclicals and also underweight emerging markets. Sheep money will rotate out of cyclicals around the 4Q once the best earnings reports are baked in for Q1 next year and then sell the living shit out of them. If inflation seems anchored below 2% they will just pile back into US megacaps. If Chinese GDP roars again and anti-monopoly scrutiny turns out to be over (pretty sure that is case already) they will pile into Chinese megacaps too.

Sheep money doesn't invest based on fundamentals, they are purely sentiment and momentum based which is why they don't outperform the market. Because they are always jumping between positions it's basically just a game of musical chairs, they need to be into the trade first and out of the trade first to make money vs their benchmark.

None of this happens in the US. US ceos don't vanish for 3 month after criticizing the US government.

Another thing is that most of the Chinese stocks that you buy don't give you any ownership, just entitle you to a portion of the profits. Go Google what VIEs are.

One question I haven’t been able to find and answer or explanation for is Inflow and Outflow.

For example on the AMC stock according to the Webull app the Inflow is consistently greater than the outflow but the price of the stock still drops at times.

Inflow vs outflow surely can’t be the only factor I’m that determines a stock price but the basics tell me when there’s more people buying (inflow) the price goes up and more people selling (outflow) price goes down. So if there’s more people buying all the time wouldn’t the price move up a lot more?

Whenever I ask this I get one word answers like “manipulation” “dark pools” “hedgies”. I’d like better explanations though or at least more detailed. Seems too simple an answer to be strictly manipulation.

The baseline is 50%, make 1000 trades based on technical data and then let's see how it turns out. I guarantee you it will be 50% for most people, though the account value will be way lower than when it started at.

You have insane mathematicians with entire companies dedicated to algorithm and AI investment that acts upon signals and pattern, there it works. But most of their trades last less than an hour, often even just seconds - while using data back to the point where it'd accessible and far beyond what you would assume to be important.

2021-06-10 20:39:51,stocks,"Inflow/Outflow makes no sense cause Buy == Sell.

It does show though WeBull users (retail) aren't truly ""buy and hold"" as the buy/sell almost everyday is almost even (days like today in which majority sold despite all the claims otherwise) \[+ other public exchange order flows\]. So don't trust whatever people say. The order flow distribution tells the truth of people's actions outside what they claim on the Internet.

It also does reveal how hypocritical many people are in webull. There's so much posts about 'buy' 'hold the line' etc. with meme pics and all but at end of day, it seems half of those people are selling to lock in gains/day trade.

Money is the actual data that talks. Not posts.

Also, note that people who use webull don't have much money. Otherwise, they would use more credible brokerages that don't do PFOF, etc. so the flow data you see on retail are the closest to 'everyday people' investors/traders. So are people actually 'holding the line' or is it just the very few while everyone else is quickly getting out while claiming others to 'hold and buy more'? You decide with the data.

&#x200B;

Also, price is by last paid + volume. 10000 trades could have happened at $100 and 5 sec later if 200 trades happened at $90, then the market price is $90.

The latest price (with some volume) is THE market price. It doesn't matter how many shares were bought or whatever, at the current moment when 200 trades happened, the price is now $90 regardless of the past market price.

This kind of extreme shows up especially pre/after market in which 1 share trade can move the price by say 60+ cents on some of these 'meme stocks'."

2021-06-11 08:22:29,stocks,Do it.
2021-06-11 04:43:14,stocks,It's not advice. It's the truth. I know no one wants to lose money. But it's inevitable dude. The whole point of investing and the meme stock movement. Was people losing money. I never said I know everything. I simply told someone that asked if it's normal to lose money. That yes it's possible BASED ON HOW YOU INVEST. Get out of y'all feelings. Investing always ALWAYS has a chance of losing you money. That's why you use money you can afford to lose. That's why day trading has restrictions on almost all brokerage apps and platforms. Imagine being mad at someone for telling someone. It's possible when they asked that exact question and you gave them a simple answer.
2021-06-11 04:46:18,stocks,"And my ""advice isn't up to par"". Dude the main way you'll lose money is chasing a wave. A hype. Again no one said nothing about ""meme stocks"". I said do your due dillegence. What's that essential rule of trading? ""Don't invest in companies you don't understand"". Good God."
2021-06-11 04:59:59,stocks,The only person here feeling their feelings is you.  This really isn't a big deal.  The reason I say it's sub par is because you are brand new to the stock market and your advice is just bad because you described the entire stock market as a pump and dump.
2021-06-10 23:57:50,stocks,See all those downvotes? Some reason people hate it that im making money lol. Those are a guarantee if you mention the dirty meme stocks. Even tho gme is not a meme.
2021-06-11 05:19:44,stocks,"Yeah says the guy making false equivalenceses. If you gone call somebody wrong/especially call them out. You don't ask dumb questions. You correct them. I didn't call the market a pump and dump. 

How I made the market sound. That's person to person decisions. The fundamental uses of the stock market are defined by brokerage apps as such. ""Income(1st, 2nd, or 3rd/this is the utilization akin to day trading),  Long Term investing(5+ years), Short Term (-2 years), Retirement, and Build Wealth"". 

Nothing I said has been emotional. You giving vague responses to work around. Last time I checked dude. If you call someone out again. Correct them. I can be new to the market. Incurred no loses(I haven't) and flipped a free stock 9x over. While spending next to nothing. The first time I used my own money was to buy AMC. 

Small investors, are almost unanimously told. ""Only invest what you can afford to lose"". They're told that for a reason. OP asked is it normal. I'm pretty sure I gave a fair response. But you and 4 other people apparently believe I misguided OP. 

So where is your advice to OP then? I mean I've sustained no loses yet. Even while day trading. 8 dollars to 300 dollars, is no small feat. Someone more experienced than me could have potentially made 1k. But as you put it I'm new to the stock market. And I still made 9x what I initially had."

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Microsoft is developing new hardware to bring its ‘Netflix for games’ service to TVs Microsoft is developing dedicated streaming hardware that people will be able to hook up to their TVs to use its Netflix\-like cloud gaming service.

The company is betting the future of video games will be a subscription-based model where people pay a certain amount of money each month to get access to a plethora of titles.

Its Xbox Game Pass service does exactly that, offering access to a library of games developed both in-house and by third-party studios.

That’s mostly digital downloads, but last year streaming was added with Microsoft publicly releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming. The feature is sort of like a “Netflix for games,” allowing gamers to play games that are hosted on remote servers and then streamed to users over the internet.

A number of other companies have launched similar game-streaming services, including Google with Stadia and Amazon with Luna.

Now, Microsoft is aiming to push its cloud gaming product to other platforms. It started rolling out Xbox Cloud Gaming to some users via a web browser on iPhones, iPads and PCs in April (Microsoft couldn’t launch a proper mobile app for cloud gaming on Apple devices due to a dispute over App Store policies). And on Thursday, the company announced it wants to expand the service to TVs as well.

One way it plans to do that is by partnering with manufacturers to add cloud gaming to smart TVs. But Microsoft is also developing streaming devices which users can plug into their TV or computer monitor to stream games from the cloud. The company didn’t elaborate on what those devices could look like, though it’s reminiscent of Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast dongles, both of which now support cloud gaming.

In addition, Microsoft says it is working with mobile carriers like Telstra in Australia to offer new Xbox subscription models. It’s also expanding cloud gaming to four new countries — Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan —  later this year, and aims to publicly launch the browser-based version of the software to all members of its $15-a-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in the coming weeks.

Microsoft said it plans to add cloud gaming to its new Xbox Series X console, which launched last November to compete with Sony’s PlayStation 5. In the next few weeks, the company will also upgrade the servers that power its cloud gaming service from its old Xbox One hardware to the Xbox Series X.

Microsoft competes aggressively with Sony when it comes to gaming. But it’s taking a different strategy to its Japanese counterpart. While Sony is known for blockbuster exclusives that can only be played on a PlayStation console, Microsoft is focusing on embedding its Xbox services onto multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.

Microsoft has been stepping up its investments in gaming, buying the iconic studio Bethesda for $7.5 billion in its biggest video game-related acquisition yet.

The company is holding a joint event with Bethesda on Sunday as part of the E3 gaming conference to show off new games, with fans speculating they will reveal some details about a hotly-anticipated sci-fi game called Starfield.

2021-06-11 00:11:15,stocks,Sony is at risk of once again being left behind when it comes to internet services to back up their consumer electronics.

Nvidia’s GeForce Now does exactly this already—you play a game that’s being streamed from a server somewhere. It works pretty wellI and it’s how I can play with my Mac-user friends. It uses a Freemium model, no additional hardware needed.

So, what is MSFTs leg up here? Larger audience and following than Nvidia’s? Integration with windows OS to your TV via this new box, but not an Xbox? 

Why can’t we just get streaming hardware in the Xbox? Or is this meant for mouse and keyboard?

Today, there is at least a niche case with certain genres being played on tablets, but the vast majority of gamers look at this idea and say “no thanks, I like owning my games and not having a ton of lag”."
2021-06-11 06:00:11,stocks,"Just love how much competition there is with cloud gaming.   We already have Google with Stadia, NVidia with GeforceNow, Amazon with Luna and then some small players.   Like Shadow.

So clearly nothing really new or innovative coming from Microsoft.   But it is more competition and that is a really, really good thing.

With too many thing today we have way too little competition.  Mobile is a perfect example.  With over 7 billion people on the planet and we only have 2 mobile platforms?   Microsoft should not have given up so fast on mobile as it would be so nice to have three and have them compete against one another and benefit the consumer.

I have used the different cloud game services including xCloud which is beta. Today the best functioning is Stadia by a decent margin.   Google had been artitecting their network for a while in prep of Stadia.   

BTW, We have subscribed to Stadia Pro which does not require you to buy any games.

We have received over 40 free games so far with the subscription.   Just this month Google gave us 4.

I do think Microsoft will do well with xCloud.  But they have a long way to go with xCloud.  But I would not bet on a new streaming dongle from Microsoft really moving the dial."
2021-06-11 06:13:28,stocks,"I've done research on this topic for a Case Study competition and I can confirm, if anyone is going to build a Netflix of games (where you can play any game on any device) through the power of cloud gaming, it is Microsoft. However, they still need dedicated servers which shouldn't be too hard compared to the real challenge in this industry, acquiring/licensing a decent game library. Microsoft already has a decent library and with the of acquisition of Bethesda, I'm excited.

Microsoft is far ahead of the other competitors in this industry like Google Stadia, PSNow, Nvidia GeForce Now and EA Pro+ simply because of their extensive game library. Number of popular game titles is the name of the game in this emerging industry, no pun intended and so far, only Microsoft has enough good games to entice subscription."
2021-06-10 22:06:06,stocks,Might make multiplayer less laggy actually if the servers are (hopefully) close together. Then only the video is sent back to you rather than you having to send the game data to the server and then receive it.
2021-06-11 00:30:06,stocks,"I could see actiony MMO's actually being better as cloud only. One big problem with those games is the amount of bandwidth they could be using to keep all the data synced up and all the clients side logic behind replicated on the server to prevent cheating. If the clients could be synced in the data center with the servers, you could avoid a lot of technical challenges"
2021-06-11 05:13:39,stocks,"Yea, currently the delay is the biggest concern but it will be resolved sooner or later because it’s just about speed. Multiplayer gaming on cloud brings a huge advantage though: anti cheat. Since the game data is not known anymore by users computer, they can’t use cheating softwares showing other players behind the walls or dead accurate aiming etc. Those softwares will have to start to analyze the video stream to detect other players and it is way less effective."

Google is also constantly developing new codecs like VP9, AV1 and the custom Argos VPU to process them efficiently. That'll improve stream quality.

You'll be faced with the scenario: Pay $0 for hardware and still get a top-of-the-line experience, or pay maybe $3000 for a PC and get like a 5-10% bump in fidelity.

2021-06-11 05:36:07,stocks,"Right now it maxes out at 1080p, and is limited by bandwidth and ping.  This service is not designed to replace your Xbox or gaming system - it is designed to give you the flexibility allowing you to play games at *acceptable* quality anywhere.  E.g. on a trip or at a bus stop (provided you have a good cell phone signal).  As long as the game data is saved in the cloud you can resume where you left off at home."
2021-06-10 21:10:34,stocks,"Or cloud game purchases could win out over subscription services. Movie purchases aren't an exciting thing, but they're reasonably consumer friendly since the license to the media is for as long as the service is around."

2021-06-11 02:17:08,stocks,Stadia works great. Use it everyday.
2021-06-11 09:43:26,stocks,"Also have Stadia.  The issue I think is Google reputation.  Who wants to be stuck on a platform just on have it yet abandoned by Google.

I rather buy it on Steam where I'm almost guaranteed it will be here in 10-20 years.  The other issue I can think of is multiple player.  But Microsoft unlike Google can fix this by letting them play with xBox users."
2021-06-10 21:08:59,stocks,The irony is that it does.
2021-06-11 05:32:13,stocks,Stadia does work really well.  You should give it a try.   There is free demos.
2021-06-11 14:00:40,stocks,GameStop always sold xbox games. This could be a warning shot.
2021-06-11 01:09:34,stocks,"I know right, I feel like I’m missing something here.

Like would Gamepass users cancel that service for this?"
2021-06-11 09:47:42,stocks,"Lol there sure is if every console cycle is this bad to get ahold of hardware. Imagine just needing a smart TV with an app and you can play Halo infinite or Starfield.

 Games being sold digitally so now you don't need to worry about finding them, and now hardware being negated will be very popular also once it's the only option by supply and demand.

Obviously the limiter now is internet speed."
2021-06-11 04:22:28,stocks,Steam streams games?
2021-06-11 05:29:02,stocks,"Or Stadia.  Or Luna.   Or PSN.   There is a few.  But having tried Stadia, xCloud, GFN, PSN and even tried Shadow.   Stadia today works best."
2021-06-11 00:33:57,stocks,"Sony will be just fine. Between all of the hardware they make, Sony/ATV, Sony Pictures, and PlayStation, they’re not sweating. Not sure where you got the idea that their life insurance is somehow carrying the company. It’s not. Their most profitable venture is PlayStation, followed by their electronic products/solutions. The only problem they have right now is that PSNow is run on Microsoft Azure."

2021-06-10 23:50:08,stocks,Yes but you could argue that the Stadia library is crap and XBP is one of the best values around.
2021-06-10 20:23:05,stocks,The only difference is you will have people to play with on this platform. While on stadia good luck finding a game on any MP game.
2021-06-11 05:33:10,stocks,Not true with Stadia.   We have a 200 mbps Internet connection and two of us can be playing Stadia without any issue.
2021-06-11 05:31:26,stocks,"Completely agree.  I have tried xCloud, GFN, Luna, Stadia and even Shadow.  

Today Stadia offers the best experience and GFN would be second.  The biggest issue with Shadow is that it is just too constantly and not competitive price wise."

2021-06-11 00:01:04,stocks,"It's true but maybe that really is the way forward?

2021-06-10 20:51:23,stocks,"Even if it was perfect, I object to having to pay for a subscription to play a game at all."
2021-06-10 20:53:27,stocks,"As a full time Stadia player, it's not like that at all."
2021-06-10 21:16:14,stocks,"It's a blue ocean thing. If companies waited until the internet was completely there for this sort of thing, they'd show up a decade too late and have given up the market."
2021-06-11 06:16:59,stocks,Just imagine if Microsoft buys Valve..
2021-06-11 07:17:00,stocks,"No. Information still has to be sent from the user to the server. Except now it has to pass through the streaming servers as well. 

Except now your not just sending input data back and forth from clients to servers, 

But your sending input data plus streaming data from client to the streaming servers, then input data from the streaming servers to the game servers. 

It's a bad idea all around."

2021-06-11 05:18:28,stocks,"I didn't even think about the anti cheat applications. That's awesome!

Perhaps we will see big competitions use cloud based gaming on a LAN a once this becomes truly viable?"
2021-06-11 05:31:38,stocks,"Nah, AFAIK anti-cheat is not needed all that much for console clients.  All that you can do with a console is introduce latency, which is a thing, but much less of a factor than auto-aiming and various other hacks on PC clients.  Consoles are completely isolated (unless they are hacked, which is hella difficult), so you can't use cheating software on them that interferes with the game.

You already have most of these advantages if you play either a console-only game or a game that doesn't support crossplay."
2021-06-11 06:20:19,stocks,Google Stadia uses AI to predict player moves to improve it and calls it Negative Latency. It sucks anyways and would prolly feel weird as a player. I guess the only way is Fibernet with unlimited GB.

The benefit of cloud gaming over PC gaming is not being tied to the PC and (ideally) not having to worry about device support. Not having to screw with stuff like Steam Link or Parsec is a big win."
2021-06-11 05:47:26,stocks,"You are not the target market for this service - not unless you want to also be able to play the game at a bus stop or while on a trip.  There is barely any modding available on Xbox games, and people play there anyway."
2021-06-11 01:02:30,stocks,Being able to play AAA games without a high-end pc will be huge. The only major downside I see is needing an internet connection. Let's be honest most of us already use a digital library on steam so all your talk about owning games is moot.
2021-06-11 05:43:43,stocks,"Depends on the game.  Many don't require low latency - e.g. RPGs, turn-based games, etc.  Also, a ton of people are not even aware that their TVs are introducing huge latency in default mode, so they don't enable game mode.  They just get used to it."
2021-06-11 13:46:09,stocks,Is that confirmed or are you trolling?
2021-06-10 23:23:22,stocks,Maybe you missed the part where Google has been doing it (badly) for a while now...there's a reason Stadia doesn't get much mainstream reference (hint: the reason is input lag. It will never go away and it will annoy every user until they unsubscribe)
2021-06-10 20:19:49,stocks,Xcloud as it currently is sucks. The resolution is bad and pretty laggy. Stadia is well amazing for single player games. If you are getting it for MP don't. I don't like cloud based gaming because I love to mod my games. I played ESO on stadia but God damn is that game shit without map mods for example and build mods. Just awful experience.
2021-06-11 06:12:20,stocks,I’m glad you found something you like.
2021-06-11 10:39:51,stocks,"Google can fix their rep in this regard by actually jumping in and supporting it wholeheartedly instead of acting like a squirrel with ADHD. They started down the path then got bored like they usually do. 

Also probably realized that greedy ISPs were not going to play ball with data caps and figured it was too much hassle."
2021-06-11 06:11:42,stocks,I could.
2021-06-11 01:08:04,stocks,"So it’s a mouse and keyboard input, streamed to your tv?

Or is there a controller?"
2021-06-10 20:21:57,stocks,"From my recollection, after having spent many years playing on it back when it was the same concept this is mimicking. Obviously we didn’t have high speed internet back then, so there were limitations but the original concept remains."
2021-06-11 07:14:49,stocks,"Nah, when Netflix started they delivered games as well, maybe just UK?"
2021-06-10 20:16:43,stocks,Game streaming is actually a lot less data intensive than video streaming iirc
2021-06-10 20:00:32,stocks,"Maybe? I think there's a lot of overlapping variables here. Those who want the best gaming experiences will probably stay with local hardware because lag is always going to be a thing so long photons and electrons in fiber and copper travel under the speed of light. So the PC gamers buying those high end GPUs? Probably going to continue doing that instead of a compressed stream with more lag. 

As for everyone else that wasn't buying high end hardware? Perhaps it brings more people into the fold because of the lower upfront cost? 

We'll have to see how it goes. But also, with the ARM buyout, I can't not see Nvidia ending up a juggernaut either way."
2021-06-10 23:22:17,stocks,"NVDA doesn't just produce hardware, they are big on AI & software too."
2021-06-11 05:02:37,stocks,Depends on who you are. I think it'll suit a casual gamer as they can play big hits and have a rolling supply of games. But more serious players and those that do other things like modding or multiplayer as well will not bite.
2021-06-11 04:15:32,stocks,you are the legit first person to ever use stadia and not complain. are you australian? i heard ping tends to be about as bad as stadias is
2021-06-11 06:40:51,stocks,They'd be far ahead of anyone else and the only limiter would be the feasibility of the industry itself i.e can enough ppl get strong enough Internet
2021-06-11 14:19:02,stocks,"Your implying the game servers and streaming servers would be two different things.  Even if not setup to be on the same physical machine, things like these both go to major cloud providers would have ability to leverage multiple 10/40/25/100G cross-connectivity.

It's very likely that going forward, many multiplayer games that allow for streaming will be optimized for it to be a great experience."
2021-06-11 15:17:41,stocks,Nielsens law. It's just a matter of time. I'm pretty sure that in more or less years every user device will just be some kind of display/ui. Computation will be centralized 100%.
2021-06-11 04:18:00,stocks,"Why would your video be sent to the servers?
You will receive the video stream from the servers.

You will still have to send your input data which the server will process and.
If we had infinitely fast connections but with a fixed latency I'd say this solution will provide about the same results as the current one."
2021-06-10 22:40:35,stocks,"Big fan of fallout 3,NV, and 4. Is it a good similar style game?"

2021-06-11 06:58:11,stocks,"That’s *completely* different from what Microsoft’s streaming service does though (And Stadia, and PS Now, and previously OnLive). If anything Sega Channel was more akin to Steam, PS Store, Xbox Games Store, completely different."

2021-06-11 02:36:40,stocks,"That’s not the point.  Microsoft wants to be the Roku OS of tv.  They want you using their interface, not Amazon’s. They don’t want to just be an app on someone else’s device.  They want you using their store.

It needs to just work.  An article with instructions is too much for most people."
2021-06-11 10:31:44,stocks,"No matter how good the hardware is; it's still limited by physics. And adding more servers is a double edged sword.

Already, playing remotely doubles the amount of travel information and input has to go to give the player a ""live"" experience. Adding more regional servers can reduce this time, never to the same degree as local hosts connected to a server, but still closer. But that then brings the issue of ever more regionalized player groups. And if you allow more people to play together from across groups, you now also need those local servers giving and receiving from whatever median they communicate through.


Good latency in games is already a troubling enough logistics and physics issue; without companies trying to throw more wrenches into the equation with ""cloud gaming"""
2021-06-11 15:29:04,stocks,"this is true. nielsens law vs. moores law

2021-06-11 07:49:35,stocks,"Well you just have shitty internet, then. I live in Hungary, and the input lag is basically unnoticeable for anything that isn't a fast paced shooter. No pixelation either, except when my internet speed drops momentarily, but it recovers amazingly fast."
2021-06-11 11:27:18,stocks,Yes but i was saying if MS or Netflix or whomever wants to pay more then the bills that were being blocked by ISPs could go through now. The reason ISPs are pretty much immune to any punishment or legislation is just bc they pay the right congress people and the FCC is basically useless
2021-06-11 11:33:01,stocks,Slow internet sucks hopefully it's  coming soon.  Everything is streamed now and for HD/UHD you need meaty bandwidth.
2021-06-10 21:36:54,stocks,I do on GFN and it's pretty good. I suck at it anyway so it doesn't make a difference in the end for me.
2021-06-11 15:35:10,stocks,It’s confirmed
2021-06-11 02:16:12,stocks,I'm a stadia user since the beginning. There's zero input lag issues. Visit the subreddit. People love the service. Just because a few journalists had some issues with the service doesn't mean everyone rdoes.
2021-06-11 06:27:35,stocks,"I think this really begins on many factors. xCloud works well for me, but not Stadia. I guess it’s a good thing we have so many options."
2021-06-11 04:48:50,stocks,For real? I’ll have to check that out then. That may be new since I last played my Xbox.
2021-06-11 04:47:34,stocks,I’m assuming an xbox controller would be connected to that device. With the current remote play feature the xbox controller connects directly to your phone via Bluetooth.
2021-06-10 21:11:32,stocks,"Stadia is free, you just buy games on it. There's an optional Pro subscription that adds 4k, surround sound and some free games every month."
2021-06-11 02:16:15,stocks,Please explain. What's the payment model?
2021-06-10 20:25:38,stocks,"I could see that.  I was very surprised to see how much low barrier cell phone gaming penetratef into completely new demographics that never touched this stuff before (grandma playing candy crush).

Could be the cloud gaming crowd draws on the same folks due to a low barrier.  And that would expand hardware demand..  But if the goal is to replace the home systems that do exist thay wouldnt be great for them.

Exciting future either way."
2021-06-11 10:37:52,stocks,"Maybe.  
  
If they don't provide a way to get ""permanent"" access to a game people really like, then I think I think they're going to burn a lot of users to the point they aren't interested."

2021-06-11 01:45:12,stocks,"Its really not.

It's the same aesthetic but not even close to the open ended nature of Fallout, Obsidian or Bethesda era. Its hyped up only because so many people got salty about Fallout 76."
2021-06-10 22:23:32,stocks,I thought 4 was awesome IMO
2021-06-10 23:06:13,stocks,Why do people shit on fallout 4 like this?  Ok it’s not as well written as 3 or NV and they kinda shat the bed on the dialogue but how does that make it a terrible game
2021-06-10 23:45:04,stocks,"Lol, I bet you've never played 4 or especially 76. All you know of 76 is the press it got for it's bad launch. It deserved the initial press but it's a really good game now that is still being updated. As for 4, why is 1, 2 or 3 a better game? I think 99% of gamers were prefer 4 to any of them."
2021-06-11 15:30:27,stocks,"May 4, 2019? You realize we are in 2021 now? And Bethesda has released a variety of free DLC to address a lot of the problems experienced upon launch. I don’t try and defend the game on release, but they have made a good amount of changes that make the game fun to play. You could always try it for yourself instead of relying on a two year old video to form your opinion!"

2021-06-11 05:20:42,stocks,"I think that's a pretty long-term plan, and the article is misinterpreting the statements.  Unless there are sources?  I know they are working on dedicated *server* hardware for game streaming, but client-side is different.

I agree that to replace something like a Roku or Fire TV stick it just needs to work.  MS doesn't have a very good track record there, across all sorts of devices.  Xbox is OK for the most part, but even there you may run into issues.

I am not sure that it makes that much business sense for MS to go into competition with Roku and FireTV stick.  If it's on a stick-like device it will have to run Android, and use the Android app store (it's in the contract for Android stuff I think).  Those things don't have very large profit margins.  Right now it also doesn't make sense to push out a stick specifically for gaming because MS still has not shipped the game service broadly - I think all versions of it are still in open beta at best, so shipping yet another product at the same time would be a pretty difficult thing."
2021-06-11 10:41:05,stocks,"Yep, exactly. We can just about deal with it in a bandwidth level for those users with superfast Internet, but with higher and higher resolutions, it's always going to be difficult. Latency makes it completely unrealistic though. Unless the networking infrastructure somehow overtakes the progression of hardware, cloud gaming will always be behind. Sure it's possible to have cloud servers all over the place, with superfast Internet from every home, but that's completely unrealistic anytime soon. And without that, latency will always be the biggest problem. Cloud simply cannot physically catch up to dedicated hardware in the gaming sector at the moment."
2021-06-11 15:33:07,stocks,"I think you're right, the balance will change at some point. 

Graphical fidelity will reach a point where progression can afford to slow a bit, no point going beyond what the eye can interpret. 

Networking tech will continue to progress past this point, we'll always need faster and lower latency networks. 

That shift won't be for a looooooong time though.

When it does finally happen, infrastructure will probably have changed beyond all current recognition anyway. Cloud gaming might even be an archaic term. Who knows. 

(edit: wording)"
2021-06-11 15:14:56,stocks,"> Well you just have shitty internet, then. I live in Hungary,

You can stop there, idiot.

Might be a shocker but most of the world does not have high speed internet. And When Microsoft is looking at metrics regarding user retention in certain countries, you can bet Hungary is probably in the lower half of the priority list."
2021-06-10 20:14:09,stocks,Facts. Gaming needs a fucking seniors league lol.
2021-06-10 21:01:47,stocks,"Yeah. Just to reiterate for the peanut gallery, input lag on Stadia is actually quite acceptable."
2021-06-10 21:31:07,stocks,"Cloud gaming just seems like a bad concept right now, with the time it takes to interact with 2 servers now, instead of directly with a game server. Ping on both ends needs to improve or you end up with massive input lag. This isn't really some new idea by msft either, they have cloud gaming that's not doing amazing, this just adds hardware to it. If it's anything like the Xbox model, the hardware doesn't make the money either."

2021-06-11 13:59:35,stocks,"> The literal top point of the article.

Yes, I saw the top point - I also saw that there is no source or where that info came from.  Without a source, I find it questionable for the reasons I've outlined.

> Why wouldn’t they use the Xbox Windows OS?

Because Windows is quite heavy - it requires a lot of resources that are difficult to provide on a tiny platform like a stick.  It's possible, but it will be sluggish, there will be problems launching many applications, and it will drive up the price of the add-on device.  Many apps won't work well or at all due to these resource limitations.  It's basically the same reason that MS has not succeeded with Windows Phone.  Bringing up a whole OS based on Windows on such a platform would be a *huge* undertaking for questionable and limited advantage.

> The profit margin is a game streaming service.

Yes, and MS still has not proven that the system works well enough through desktop and various mobile devices to be profitable.  There are also far more mobile devices out in the world than TVs, so it makes sense to go after them first and to get the system working well before investing an enormous pile of money to get yet another platform going from the ground up."

2021-06-11 05:40:28,stocks,"Nah, upload requirements are minimal - think about it, all you need to send into the cloud is controller input and maybe some diagnostics data that signals about the quality of your connection.  I don't know what problems you were seeing with the services you've tried, but I doubt they were due to the upload speed.  More likely the data center running the game was too far away, and therefore you didn't have a big enough pipe down, and a large ping increasing latency."

2021-06-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Rite Aid $RAD - Undervalued All,

I think a greatly undervalued stock is Rite Aid. Since the sale to Walgreens fell through (Walgreens decided to only purchase half of Rite Aid stores), the stock has taken a beating. 

Since then, Rite Aid has brought in a new CEO and changed up their management team. They've implemented a new strategy to modernize the store layout, focus on growing their PBM, acquired Bartell (Seattle's largest pharmacy) and creating a better experience for customers. 

Rite Aid is the 3rd largest pharmacy chain in the US (behind Walgreens and CVS). In FY21 they've done $24B+ in Revenue. The issue is that they have not turned a profit. There's 2 outcomes: Rite Aid's turnaround plan implemented by the new management team is successful and Rite Aid becomes profitable resulting in significant rise in share price or Rite Aid gets acquired. I believe all signs point to Rite Aid eventually getting acquired.

Good value play here."
2021-06-11 12:05:53,stocks,Walking into one of the newly renovated rite aids a few months ago prompted me to look into the stock. It’s giving me dunkin rebrand vibes.
2021-06-10 21:21:53,stocks,"The amazing thing about Rite Aid is that the company revenue climbed by more than 9% last year to $24 Billion, but the total market cap of the company based on today’s RAD stock is only slightly above $1 Billion.  That’s insane! 😦

RAD is worth at least $40 per share.  Hell, at that price the market cap would still be only worth slightly more than $2 Billion."
2021-06-10 20:48:03,stocks,Bartell was great and I hate Rite aid. Sad day when they announced that acquisition.

2021-06-11 08:42:47,stocks,Why are you looking at revenue and not profit or free cash flow?
2021-06-11 03:06:59,stocks,"Corrections here. It wasn't the DOJ, it was the FTC. Except the FTC never officially said no, Rite Aid and Walgreens voluntarily pulled the acquisition and proposed the roughly 1.2 purchase before the FTC had to decide due to certificated compliance. The FTC even released a memo saying such, which is rare. I believe the called off Mercer was due to John Standley illegally negotiating with Albertsons behind the scenes so he could have the $20M a year CEO job when Cerberus tried to backdoor IPO a second time to dump Albertsons. This was voted down, eventually Standley quit and went to WBA 1 year and 1 day after leaving rite aid, which was 1 day after his non compete expired. 

On mobile will source tomorrow. I know more about this situation than I wish I did."
2021-06-11 03:10:10,stocks,They have 24B in revenue. The problem is operating for a profit.

It looks like a value play that is actually a value trap.  However low borrowing costs are helping a lot of bad companies stay alive
2021-06-11 08:57:05,stocks,"The growing revenue is a precursor to Rite Aid achieving overall financial success.  Last year Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow and will do so again this year.  Also, this year, RAD will cross over into positive net earnings.

Look, if you wait until Rite Aid has already demonstrated strong financial success, this company is going to have a market cap of $5+ Billion and you are going to have to pay $80 - $100 per share to own this stock.  The investment business is all about getting the alpha before the other guy.  If you go back a year or two, you could have grabbed a position for as low as $6 - $8 per share.  Now the financials have stabilized and you have to pay $20 - $25 per share to get in.  Tomorrow that’s going to be $40, $60, $80, or $100 per share."
2021-06-11 12:31:26,stocks,Yes it can be.  Good thing we can come back in two years and see who is right.  Low borrowing cost are distorting asset prices but would love to see the turnaround for rite aid

2021-06-11 10:05:47,stocks,"For one thing I don't see business travel changing or the behavior of road warriors like me changing. All Uber did was introduce a much better solution to point-to-point over taxis. It did not negate the need for a car at times.

Also consider most road warriors (100k miles a year+) have programs. Gas, insurance, and all that is not of issue. Not even a consideration. Almost all companies that have contracts with Hertz have these inclusive. They all have programs that put us into cars instantly without counters, without long waits to process the car, or any of that less frequent travelers deal with.

The general rule is - if spending the night, rent, otherwise taxi/uber unless taking off from another airport. This isn't changing.

Hertz was hurting pre Covid and going to go bankrupts regardless. 

The difference now is that Covid was a huge advantage for them to remain a company. It hit a reset button while their competitors were unable to grow share, this is an impossibly unique situation. They're on equal footing with Avis and Enterprise now.

Under new management is another huge reset button that they had a very unique once in a century ability to take advantage of while their competitors suffered, again not growing share because there was no share to grow.

Add in the fact that those competitors also had to sell their cars to remain solvent puts everyone in the same exact situation of having low inventory with very limited supply to replace it with. Another very unique situation Hertz was put in due to Covid. 

I've personally not seen something like this before. A major player in an industry fading out and at the last moment their two competitors freeze all operations, enabling them to get their shit together."

Red days happen all the time, and one day isn't a trend. However today was undoubtedly a green day. Every major index is in the green except for .SML. For some indexes, like .NDX, it was a blockbuster day. You can just go through the list: NASADAQ is up, DJIA is up, S&P is up.

It's days like this in January when the market was green and I was losing some gains that I finally reallocated my entire portfolio, and it's been the best thing for me by a mile getting out of some inflated tech and meme-adjacent type stocks."

I also have high hopes for CCL, but I might be a bit early on that one.

They would be forced to chase.

Shows that they're not perfect, but what is true is almost none of them are bearish now. You'd think it'd be a great contrarian trade to go against them (fwiw: I'm not bearish though), but the thing is...big players move the market. While they're bullish, you're not going to get anything more than shallow dips.

I'm not in the hyperinflation camp but that doesn't mean I'm not a bit baffled about the TNX move. But it's very possible there's more because the treasury short is an overcrowded trade."

Look at option prices on MEME stocks and then look at some on Ford or Apple or PG and you will see how different the prices are relative to the strike. This is due to implied volatility.

Once the driver of volatility becomes known the volatility collapses. This is IV crush and it is a pisser. You can hit your strike or even exceed the strike and  still lose because you got IV crushed."

2021-06-10 21:02:59,stocks,so essentially sell Options when the IV is high and buy them when the IV is low because you can get a much higher premium when the IV is high with less chance of it being exercised???
2021-06-10 22:30:07,stocks,"In theory that is how you would want to do it, yes, but that is dependent on you knowing when iv will leap. earnings are a good place for something like that to occur (unless it has a big runup that already spikes IV), but it's hard to buy something with low iv and expect it to move up.

I'd say from my experience when buying options at low IV you don't want to focus on the IV beyond whether its at an acceptably low level for you with the expectation of a spike, but with low IV picks shoot for specific price targets of the stock with the assumption that IV will *not* spike and if it does and gets you to your price target faster then all the better for you (never beat yourself up over it running far beyond your price point though, nothing wrong with taking the gains you got).

And as far as selling at high IV, just remember that the IV is high for a reason. especially with meme stocks the IV bloat just makes options pricing all screwy. Something worth <$.1 in premium suddenly spikes to 2 while still being out of the money, but if its shooting in a direction that you're angling against you might just end up taking that loss later as IV spikes higher and the gap between out of the money and in the money closes. That's why meme stocks are so volatile-ly dangerous for a retail trader because we usually lack algorithmic fallbacks that help us mitigate our losses and maximize our gains. I'd recommend caution with regards to earning any kind of money on meme stocks for that reason. If you're really interested in trying, just dip your toe in the water with a small sum for your portfolio to help you learn and understand the various intersecting mechanics of options trading, volatility, and hype/memestocks' pump and dumping."

And lots of positive catalysts to get some good ""bumps"" along the way (various state legalizations, federal legislations, mergers, companies achieving record numbers and reaching profitability, etc).

My favorite is $TCNNF (trulieve).  They are one of the only profitable cannabis companies, 50% of the market share in Florida, expanding into more states and they about to acquire Harvest Health which will make them the largest MSO (multi-state operator) by revenue.  Great company, huge potential.

There are many other MSOs, and they all have lots of potential, so luckily there's an ETF $MSOS if you wanted to bet on them all."

Depending on the stock, I set limit sells that I believe will kick in based on my hypothesis + a % more. I only sell when I need to buy something which is why I'm biased towards long term investments. 

I don't do day trading as I was terrible at it. I stick to my strength of going long.

I don't leverage stop losses bc I wouldn't buy a stock I believe would lose value. If it loses value, I may react emotionally but am reminded as to the logic that informed the initial purchase. Markets swing quite a bit now, so unless I need that money asap I don't realize the gain or loss.

This may seem yolo but I do a lot of research on companies and the industry. It's also to minimize bullshit and ensure I only invest amounts that are safe. My system may not work for other use cases but it's worked for me so far."
