As for price target I think it‚Äôs around 10 tbh. I read inclusion to index is only around 2-3% it‚Äôs the earnings beat that should raise the price a fair amount. I personally plan to sell if it gets to 10-11. It‚Äôs a solid stock to own but there are more exciting riskier options out there. My portfolio ain‚Äôt ready for this one yet this is one you would marry in tryna have some fun with Tesla sluts"

I've also diversified into other areas a bit -- an EV charging company and a certain Bill Ackman spac. Those haven't done great ironically.

2021-04-28 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,"The stock split rumor will be moot. It would be neat, but real investors won‚Äôt care if after a huge earnings beat, they don‚Äôt announce a stock split. Some related earnings in the sector (even though AMZN is literally in every sector) are a good omen for AMZN earnings: in particular UPS, and SHOP should be hints that AMZN will also be huge. 

Don‚Äôt forget about the second round of stimulus checks. AMZN probably ate a lot of that.

There is no ‚Äúchip shortage‚Äù for a company like Amazon.

There‚Äôs been good news all around about vaccinations and reopening. Biden will be optimistic tonight.

Everything is leading up to a monster AMZN climax for this earnings season.

Even the voodoo TA on the AMZN chart shows it will take any excuse for a breakout. My bet is, even though expectations are already high, just a plain old ‚Äúbeat‚Äù will be good enough for a pop."
2021-04-28 19:21:15,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve seen this happen before. And everytime I try to go with the trend card earnings, I get my anus scorched on calls.

2021-04-28 19:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I think the split will be dismissed. AMZN will probably show strong earnings, but I suspect cloud revenue growth will be less than anticipated. Watching other cloud firms announce strong growth, even IBM showing a profit tells me the competition has made that space more difficult for them.

Edit: Not trying to necessarily bring a politics into to this, but I also think there is a 50/50 chance the market doesn't like what biden had to say tonight."
2021-04-28 18:45:55,wallstreetbets,Earnings does not necessarily affect share price.  Check previous earnings & results

2021-04-28 19:35:47,wallstreetbets,"There's no change in value. If AMZN does a 10:1 split, the strike price of your calls is divided by 10. So for example, say AMZN share price is currently at $3500 and you're holding call options with 3600 strike. The share price after the split would be $350 and your calls would have a strike of 360."

2021-04-28 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,"After their earnings? Then I would definately say that would help probability.  So taking all factors into consideration, is the probabikity higher that AMZN breaks resistance, or stays in  price channel?  I myself am unsure & have not looked at all factors."

Look at Tesla...

it's going to crater because it's a shit company that can't even make ends meet with a captive audience lol. they can blame reopening if they want to, but doordash is a fundamentally garbage company even if covid 2 electric boogaloo shows up."
2021-04-28 18:16:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree with the bull and bear case. Bull case is that people are fuckin lazy and will still use doordash.

Problem is my food arrives cold more often than not, and upcharges passed on to consumer are so high it practically makes it a luxury product.

2021-04-28 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget that they have competition too. I switched to grubhub exclusively within the past 2 months because they now have many more options for my area and their app and service has continued to improve. So my lazy ass is still lazy, but its not making DoorDash a dime."
2021-04-28 18:38:50,wallstreetbets,I have another bear case. Customer orders on Doordash. Customer DOES NOT leave tip. Customer gets cold food 1 hour after expected delivery time. Customer is unhappy. Customer tries ordering again with 0 tip. Customer gets food cold again. Customer satisfaction at -100 value. Customer vows to never use Doordash again. Doordash will lose revenue because non tippers stop using Doordash(do non tippers make the majority of Gig company income?). Doordash eventually shuts down.
2021-04-28 18:24:40,wallstreetbets,"The bull only makes sense if there's more restaurants open to cater to the lazy. The people using doordash now + current restaurants - vaxxed restaurant eaters = doordash's future.

Part of covid hysteria is literally to destroy businesses. I doubt there's going to be a rush to open closed restaurants to the extent to offset what doordash is losing."

2021-04-28 18:29:54,wallstreetbets,Who cares when it comes to investing? In business/capitalism ethics always takes a back seat. Not trading these companies isn‚Äôt going to make them stop being shitty. You‚Äôre making money off them not giving them money.

2021-04-28 19:57:53,wallstreetbets,Being lazy has consequences... Like cold food.  Are you really expecting pity.
2021-04-28 19:14:01,wallstreetbets,"But above you said they don‚Äôt typically tip. So DoorDash can be cut from the equation so the restaurant makes more per order, and then restaurant charges a minimum delivery fee so it is controlled, rather than letting DoorDash customer choose tip. I rarely use DD, but when we do, I give the driver a tip on the app, and in cash. Mainly because I do t know how bad the company is screwing their drivers"
2021-04-28 18:43:29,wallstreetbets,"It also will depend on your area. A number of restaurants around me have or are going to drop Dash and some or all others. Some are replacing it with their own transit van or two, some just employing the catering vehicles they had, to deliver themselves. There is a reason why ubereats is rolling out the program where the driver accepts the order and actually orders your food, goes and picks it up and pays on their card, then delivers to you, as more restaurants drop the services. Restaurants are tired of the fees and multiple tablets too which also started souring people to go in person thinking it was the restaurant jacking the pricing/fees. We‚Äôve also had two services roll out that are seemingly just local to the area but operate in the same fashion as the other food deliveries and are capturing a lot of restaurants that disappear from the others."

2021-04-28 18:28:55,wallstreetbets,"There are many risks to Tesla beyond the loss of Elon Musk.  There is a reason Toyota sold it‚Äôs stake in Tesla over two years ago and is investing heavily into hydrogen fuels and denser lithium ion batteries.  Tesla will do well in developed countries that have the wealth to build infrastructure for EVs but in some places and some applications even within the US; EVs don‚Äôt make sense.  Take semi trucks for example.  They are limited to 40-tons gross weight.  Diesel fuel has about 46 MJ/kg as compared to 1.2 MJ/kg for current lithium ion batteries.  Said another way, a battery would have to be 38x heavier than a tank of diesel to provide the same energy.  Batteries may see a 2-3x improvement in energy density but 38x is not realistic and it will open the door for other sources of energy when weight and range are critical.

The same can be applied to developing countries where charging infrastructure doesn‚Äôt exist.  It will be far easier to adopt an energy density fuels in the near term than batteries.

Electrification is only a small part of the solution to our transportation sector‚Äôs addiction to fossil fuels.  Markets seem to be pricing EVs as if they are THE solution on a global scale.  This is the risk."

Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology . 

CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats‚Äô control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .

2021-04-28 17:44:03,wallstreetbets,most people don‚Äôt want vaccine bc they don‚Äôt care about the virus in general. i don‚Äôt think they are looking for alternatives
2021-04-28 17:44:52,wallstreetbets,An oral vax in pill form is huge when compared to the nightmare -20C of the Moderna vax. An oral pill is easier to transport to areas of the world where infrastructure is weaker and people still need protection. This is like a win as a stock and for people in general - I am in!
2021-04-28 19:50:26,wallstreetbets,"The company will be holding a webinar on May 3. 

The webinar will be a place to discuss emerging technologies for treating the virus. 

It will also provide a platform for Vaxart to report its own data regarding its  Phase I Covid trials."

2021-04-28 19:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Only reason why it‚Äôs scary, is because our corrupt govt. clearly has an agenda. It‚Äôs not about giving people alternatives or else everyone would have just taken HCQ which is more effective then the vaccine. They are pushing what they want, anything else isn‚Äôt going to get the green light."
2021-04-28 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,"I don't know,  I had covid and didn't take any medicine"
2021-04-28 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,I know about 10 people that got covid and they are all fine. Sniffles and tired. Gone in a week.

2021-04-28 17:45:23,wallstreetbets,"That is a bearish case against Vaxart, and bullish in favor of Humanigen, which would be in position to administer lenzilumab to the unvaccinated.  To borrow a phrase, there are no Covid-deniers in the hospital."

2021-04-28 18:00:07,wallstreetbets,Me af.
2021-04-28 19:31:18,wallstreetbets,I lost faith in Atossa when they proposed to issue 375 million additional shares at their annual meeting.that‚Äôs mega dilution. I sold my entire position at $2.10 the next day. Their history is quite pnd if you look at the charts. But it was def hard to sell even still with those drugs allegedly in the pipeline.
2021-04-28 17:47:02,wallstreetbets,see note at the end of tl;dr - these are newly minted members of the $1B club and as such they're getting filtered out.
2021-04-28 18:05:25,wallstreetbets,Merck's pill appears to be useful only on [pre-hospitalization](https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/15/merck-to-continue-tests-of-covid-pill-but-stop-trial-in-hospitalized-patients/) cases.  Lenzilumab is intended for more severe cases.

2021-04-28 17:46:46,wallstreetbets,possible. good luck anyway
2021-04-28 19:25:59,wallstreetbets,"You are onto something here. Those that want to be vaccinated in the US are mostly already vaccinated.

Covid doesn't care about your political views or whether you had it. Then you have the immuno compromised, vaccine efficacy issues, and lack of vaccines in other countries. In any case, everyone will take a treatment if available. And whoever comes up with the Nyquil for covid will make billions."
2021-04-28 18:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Can you elaborate on that? At first glance, it would seem if you don't care about the virus, getting a vaccine is just an inconvenience to you. But at some point we won't need to schedule it far in advance, would you still decline it then? Same as OP, idgaf what you do, I just want to make money."
2021-04-28 19:05:50,wallstreetbets,Already had the virus and was fine. I don't think I'd get it until a year from now minimum. I also am tired of talking about the virus and vaccines so Idc about it anymore.

2021-04-28 17:42:56,wallstreetbets,My thinking is even if it just goes back to low the 9.5s will go up a lot anyway and I plan to close Monday. If I'm wrong about something though this will definitely be getting closed at like a 90% loss
2021-04-28 19:01:42,wallstreetbets,"That's a pretty good question, I imagine this is illegal but in theory they could have an institution short shares for them at elevated levels until the lockup ends, but there are already a lot of people short and most outstanding shares probably aren't borrowable. I'm sure short sellers will use this as an opportunity to cover anyway but historically during lock-up expirations similar to this there are large drops."
2021-04-28 19:27:20,wallstreetbets,Uh because the company and founder are total frauds and do none of the things that they (boldly) claim
2021-04-28 17:45:38,wallstreetbets,Worked first time I did it but I was even more retarded then I am now and bought spreads which didn't print very much xd

Even better, Paramount+ is launched in March. So they prob acquired 12% of the 3-month total growth of the industry in just one month. Take a look at what GS says that VIAC is the most undervalued stonk.

2021-04-28 17:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Well, you‚Äôre up over 50,000. 

Have you thought about profit taking?

You need to remember the CRA too. My home city is Toronto (living in London, ON now). The CRA has a capital gain tax. You will probably ~~lose 30-50% to taxes.~~ be taxed according to your tax bracket at a rate of some percentage.

With DD that weak, you gambled. You didn‚Äôt invest.

Edit:  my oversimplification of capital gains tax got someone irate, I when I say lose 30-50% I mean having 50% of your profits counted to income and paying a tax upon that.
> Capital Gains Tax Rate In Canada, 50% of the value of any capital gains are taxable. Should you sell the investments at a higher price than you paid (realized capital gain) ‚Äî you'll need to add 50% of the capital gain to your income. This means the amount of additional tax you actually pay will vary depending on how much you're making and what other sources of income you have. https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/capital-gains-tax-canada?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2MuJ-PWh8AIVAeazCh2BtgPjEAAYASAAEgJNH_D_BwE"

2021-04-28 17:09:02,wallstreetbets,"yes. nobody really knows why stocks go up or down. they just make up a reason and publish it. it might be right, it might be wrong, but it doesn't matter. their job is to write news articles every day and that's what they do."
2021-04-28 17:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes - and there is a name for it!

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe narrative fallacy‚Äù"
2021-04-28 17:17:17,wallstreetbets,I was a retail broker 1989-1999. Every reason was AFTER the stock move. Don‚Äôt listen to ‚ÄúReSEaRcH‚Äù from them. It‚Äôs all crap. üí©. Now you autistic retards just get it faster than your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.
2021-04-28 18:18:14,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre selling clicks. Just read an ‚Äúarticle‚Äù recently about why some stocks were up. A few short paragraphs and an ad later I was left there asking ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the explanation?‚Äù
2021-04-28 18:26:55,wallstreetbets,"Before market open, they list a bunch of words down one side of the board. As the day progresses, they put major moving stocks and interesting stocks on the left. Then they randomly select what stocks go with with words, and that‚Äôs how they describe what happened"
2021-04-28 19:14:21,wallstreetbets,"> It seems to me they make shit up to try to connect why the price is moving when it actually has zero to do with it. Shouldn‚Äôt they be noticing something happening and making a calculated guess where the price is going?

Here's the problem: Public information is already priced into the stock. If there's an earnings report tomorrow, and publicly available information already points to it being strong, then people who are buying and selling the stock are already going to be setting a price that reflects those expectations. By the time you read the article on their website, the movement has already happened.

Absent insider knowledge, the only way they can make accurate guesses as to the future price of the stock is by having better knowledge insight than anybody else- but anyone who has that kind of advantage is going to be in the game, buying and selling, not writing articles. It's not that they aren't experts, so to say, it's just that they are competing against other experts.

This leaves them in the position of being, at best, able to explain why something happened after the fact. If the earnings report was unexpectedly low, then the stock price will drop before they can tell you that it's about to drop. They just can't win that race.

Of course, lots of times, they do just make things up. As a rule of thumb, the Dow Jones goes up and down 1% with no news at all- it's just the standard amount of noise in the system. Anybody telling you that a 200 point drop tomorrow is because of X reason is full of shit. If Biden literally shits himself on the podium and the Dow drops 10% in the next hour, then it's fair to call that as the reason. But, for all intents and purposes, the market's reaction to his tax talk was non-identifiable. It was inseparable from the noise, likely because it represents no new information in the first place."

2021-04-28 18:34:37,wallstreetbets,Just my own personal conspiracy but I think a lot of these sites like to bag on whatever WSB is talking about because probably keeps their viewers from reading WSB which is offering a similar service. Likely why pay money to read from the fool when you can get equally degenerate picks for free on WSB
2021-04-28 17:57:07,wallstreetbets,"""After"" doesn't mean ""because of"". Technically they are right, it went down AFTER the crash, one event happened after another. If a reader reads it as a causation... well, they are not alone."

2021-04-28 18:02:18,wallstreetbets,"I firmly believe what's really happening is nobody actually gives a fuck about anything other than the price, and certain pieces of news move the price up or down.

Nobody cares that company did X... They just know when that happens the price drops so the hive mind causes the price to drop, and vice versa.

And everyone pretends some statistical analysis actually yields some insight and that were all not just in it to make money"
2021-04-28 18:35:12,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree. Often times I'll see a nice flag pattern setup trigger only to have a news source say it went up after the fact due to some random news they linked to the price increase. And after a good earnings report comes out and price goes down news will have to dig through it so they can find something ""bad"" about the earnings report that caused it to fall."
2021-04-28 18:36:19,wallstreetbets,Hindsight is 20/20 (unless they're insider trading)
2021-04-28 18:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes. So when a macro-economic event happens and there is a clear link back to a sector...then it is pretty obvious. For example maybe ~month ago the 10-year treasury started to spike and it spooked the market (because the 10-year treasury is the most commonly used ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù discount rate used in economic models for American companies). All of a sudden algos and funds started selling the growth stocks because of it. That is one example.

Outside of those macro scenarios? Yeah full of crap."
2021-04-28 18:41:38,wallstreetbets,"I think it‚Äôs a mixture of lazy reporting and institutional investors timing large moves to hide behind whatever news is breaking so they can use that as plausible deniability. Either way, retail deserves better."

2021-04-28 18:50:48,wallstreetbets,"It shouldn't be that tricky, especially with vehicle insurance. It is standard practice for fleet managers to install blackbox trackers in their vehicles.

If they pair that with driver training, what's another blackbox in the car to them if it gives a better insurance price and flags drivers who are a legal liability to the company on the road?

I think the market might not even know it's ready but if the service gets properly integrated in the right industries it should all work together in a way that pleases everyone except people who drive hard on public streets.

Fuuuuck. The Australian government could be lobbied to have this installed in all new cars for about 1500 pesos. There's so many ways this sort of creepy shit is going to end up a ""normal"" part of reality real soon. :/"
2021-04-28 17:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Metromile doesn't adjust rates based upon how you drive. They just charge you based upon the miles you drive (not your safety). So they charge a risky and a safe driver the same. Other insurance companies already adjust rates based upon the miles you drive per year. ROOT's approach is different, adjusting rates based upon how safely you drive while on the road. This dramatically improves their bottom line relative to an approach that charges drivers of equal skill/safety the same. But I actually hadn't seen that Metromile went public via a SPAC--thanks for the heads up! I'll edit my post with a comparison to Metromile once I finish getting all their financials (always harder to do with former SPACs) for comparison with ROOT.

Edit: according to the WSJ, MILE actually declined in sales over the past three years, so a PSG comparison doesn't work. Even ignoring growth decline, MILE has a price/sales ratio of 32.14. An equivalent price/sales ratio would give ROOT a share price of a little over $59."

Insurtech is expected to grab progressively more market share from older insurance companies as time goes on, both because they have better bottom lines and because customers want lower rates if they're safe drivers. Plenty of people (like me) don't trust Google with their data but do/would trust a company that's transparent with data use."

[https://ir.joinroot.com/node/7341/html](https://ir.joinroot.com/node/7341/html)

Note the explanation given in the footnotes:

1. The shares were sold pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan.

And

3. The shares are held by the Manges Trust dated January 27, 2016 for which the Reporting Person is a trustee.

Dan Manges didn't have any control over those sales; these shares of his were in a trust and were sold because of the trust's 10b5-1 plan. Dan Manges still owns the same 1,000 shares of class A (and more of class B, iirc) he has always owned directly (see the final line of that filing).

Edit: found his class B stock filing. He still has \~12.7 million shares of class B stock (class B has 10 to 1 voting rights over class A). See:

ROOT would flag my ex for driving her work van like a lunatic, get her to reel her neck in and/or give the fleet manager a better idea of what shitbox vehicle to stick her with.

10 years in the future ROOT might enable me to rent MY classics out via a 3rd party company, to people who genuinely respect the vehicles they borrow and just want a nice mountain drive in an 80s sports car.

If Biden‚Äôs bearish enough to make Wall Street throw a tantrum, then there‚Äôll be a sell off overnight and maybe into tomorrow. 

It‚Äôs bullish to have a declining dollar and a strong market sentiment, because then stocks only go up.

All things being equal and unchanged form today, if Chipotle was to issue an equivalent number of stock shares as Apple (and their market cap stayed at 41B) then their new stock price would be \~$2.47 per share.

That is why the stock price alone is an ignorant argument about a companies worth...Chipotle is not 10X more valuable than Apple because $1300 is 10X more than $130. In actuality, Chipotle is worth \~ 1.2% of Apple (42B vs 2.6T).

#1 rule of investing is don't gamble what you can't afford to lose.
Don't risk life savings in this way.

If you want to buy shares, do it - but you will lose EVERYTHING with this trade."

2021-04-28 19:32:22,wallstreetbets,"the goal of the 800c is **not to hit 800**, but to capture the incoming volatility in the event of a big price spike. while the reward is not as high as fds, it is a pretty relaxing way to play gme while having more leverage than shares.

the prior options history for 7/16 800c shows
- on 3/23 gme was 200 which resulted in the option being worth 21.5 (2.15k) at its highest, a low of 17.06 (1.7k) and an open of 20.
- on 3/10 gme peaked at 350 which resulted in a high price of 122.09 (12.2k), a low of 42 (4.2k) and an open of 67.93 (6.8k)

while the 800c looks super degenerate, it surprisingly holds a good amount of extrinsic value and follows the price swings of the underlying even when it is in the $150 range"

2021-04-28 18:37:37,wallstreetbets,"The $800 calls you should sell ASAP you‚Äôre just giving that money away.  You would be much better off buying more shares if you like the stock.  I don‚Äôt know you obviously but if I was there I‚Äôd beg you to sell the Calls tomorrow morning.  I‚Äôve done this for 40 years and can see what‚Äôs going to happen, the calls will lose ~1/2 their value around May 15th and then just keep losing time value until they‚Äôre trading at $1-$3 until zero at expiration.

2021-04-28 18:07:26,wallstreetbets,OP from the bottom of my heart this is a terrible idea. The IV on the 800 call is out of this world. You will lose all of that
2021-04-28 18:18:02,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you‚Äôre retarded. Congrats
2021-04-28 18:24:41,wallstreetbets,"I would get out tomorrow and take your loss of only a few hundred dollars while you still can. You'll be -75% one month from now if the price holds where it is. At that point you'll feel obligated to hold or bust, you'll hold, and you'll bust.

Just hold the shares and you won't get fucked too badly hopefully, may even make some money if you don't get greedy."
2021-04-28 19:15:09,wallstreetbets,Sell your calls asap man. Didn't you learn from the last ape who spent 1 million on those. Sell and buy shares man seriously. Do it tomorrow

2021-04-28 16:37:38,wallstreetbets,The (slightly) smarter call would have been to buy around the 600 strike. They aren‚Äôt that much more (you could have gotten about 46 options for the same total) and you would have made way more with less risk

2021-04-28 17:28:42,wallstreetbets,You are truly retarded. Welcome.
2021-04-28 17:29:47,wallstreetbets,"If you're addicted to the 800 strike, I suggest utilizing it in a different way so a winning outcome is a result. 

The following method works best if GME starts trending up towards 250 as premium becomes more attractive

1.	Keep 800 strike 
2.	Sell 780 strike 

You effectively created a bear call spread. If GME stays below 780, you keep entire credit, win and profit. Of course profit is capped, but profit is profit 

Or (a Calendar)

1.	Keep 800 strike 
2.	Sell 700 strike month prior"
2021-04-28 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,"Bro, close those calls for the love of god. Then buy like idk 10-20 ~$200 July calls. So much safer and still upside galore if GME does indeed go to $800+ or just buy the shares like everyone is saying. 99.9% chance those calls expire worthless"
2021-04-28 17:32:25,wallstreetbets,"Good luck buddy, hopefully GME keep putting out good news, and vote shows that it‚Äôs stock is still heavily shorted. üöÄüöÄüí∞üí∞"

2021-04-28 18:20:27,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre getting shit on a ton but honestly if this bounces fat one more time and you sell 1/5th you now have a free play to see if we get the squeeze and you‚Äôre a billionaire ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-04-28 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,Question: So could you just write a naked 800c 7/16 GME option and hope for some retard like OP to come along and buy it up with no risk?
2021-04-28 18:24:25,wallstreetbets,"I gotta be honest man this is a pretty risky play. This is not like DFV buying $12 calls for pennies on the dollar. Are you prepared for the possibility it goes to zero? Will you be OK if that happens? If so, great, respect the ballsy move. If no, I think you really gotta reconsider the $800 calls, especially at $500+ each. Better to just hold GME stock."

2021-04-28 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,"don't buy options before the squeeze is happening. You will lose a ton of value due to decay. Instead, just buy it when it starts jumping past $300 since the margin call is supposed to happen around the $350 mark."
2021-04-28 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,"OP is going to die poor, because even if these print, someone that‚Äôs this reckless with their money will lose it all within a week."
2021-04-28 19:12:29,wallstreetbets,Don't buy calls. Buy shares and hold. Otherwise you are no help to the cause
2021-04-28 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,This is the WSB I remember. Godspeed you fuckin mad man
2021-04-28 17:36:12,wallstreetbets,"Why not just buy shares? When it moons to 10mil/share, who cares if you have 100 mil or 1 bil?

You just need 10 mil to retire comfortably and live off interest

With shares you‚Äôre safe from HF fuckery that may delay the squeeze past your expiry, and you also contribute to the squeeze and help your fellow apes

With calls you are just trying to get richer than the other apes without contributing in shares

Not trying to shade, just stating some facts for others who are on the fence

I respect your decision regardless and am rooting for you"

2021-04-28 16:46:48,wallstreetbets,"July is a good call option in my opinion cause, come on, these hedge funds are loosing money by not covering their positions and there have already past 4 month since the squeeze supposed to happen but it didn‚Äôt, i don‚Äôt think they will have more money left to survive another 4 months. I‚Äôm expecting it to squeeze before June"

2021-04-28 16:38:57,wallstreetbets,Has it ever crossed your mind that he might know something you don‚Äôt.
2021-04-28 18:07:21,wallstreetbets,"All of you here are stupid. I see nothing wrong with his calls if he knows what he‚Äôs doing. I made a fortune doing same calls for the last 3 month. Sorry but I never touched gme shares and won‚Äôt do it because I love gambling and so far I haven‚Äôt even lost once. I bought 80 of 800 calls when gme dropped to $40 and sold at $175 then rebought same 800 calls when gme at $100 and sold all of it at $320. Now I rebought 800 calls for the third time when gme dropped to $140 and will sell soon. My point you need to know what you doing playing OTM calls. I buy either deep deep in the money or far otm calls. It‚Äôs a gamble and it can pay you a lot plus you need back up in your portfolio with solid stocks NOT gme or any of meme stocks, I gamble with meme stocks with options and it worked so far. Yes I don‚Äôt buy stocks at all and instead I buy deep in the money calls with far expiration when I‚Äôm bullish. It‚Äôs better that holding a stock in my opinion and been doing it for years. Please go do your research about it."

The $800 calls are just putting your life savings on a <1% probability event. 

Basically the investing equivalent of ‚Äúif you‚Äôre going to have sex anyhow please use a condom‚Äù."

Can someone ELI5?"
2021-04-28 19:57:13,wallstreetbets,"Yup, with options you can be right in your assumtions but wrong on the timing and lose everything. Like this guy has July options but what if the squeeze happens in August and the price never gets close to 800 before then. They‚Äôd expire worthless."

2021-04-28 18:34:19,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 800 calls just cause fuck it but this is next level retard. Hopefully u become stupid rich, if not rest in piss"
2021-04-28 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,Its just as likely to hit $0 as it is $800
2021-04-28 19:46:03,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy shares? Those options are a dumb move when the expectation of the stock is go to waaaay up anyway but you aren't putting a date on it hoping it will reach that by then.
2021-04-28 16:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Ok not a stupid question, why not just buy these calls a week before Expiration ?? Lol"
2021-04-28 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Holy shit this is the dumbest shit I have ever seen. Giving you gold even though I hate GME.

2021-04-28 17:29:54,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
2021-04-28 17:54:16,wallstreetbets,ITT:  GMED guy was the evolutionary progression from the Gibbons.  I hear he's even using tools now.
2021-04-28 18:18:13,wallstreetbets,Gme here in Aus doubled when everything started. I was tempted to buy it knowing it was the wrong stock for the quick flip.
2021-04-28 18:21:36,wallstreetbets,It's a shame OP does have his GED or maybe he wouldn't be so retarded.
2021-04-28 18:32:37,wallstreetbets,Atleast its GME and not Gourd
2021-04-28 18:33:48,wallstreetbets,Haha that was hilarious

2021-04-28 15:55:03,wallstreetbets,I just figured sucking cock by the dumpster at Wendy's was how we get our FD money here.

2021-04-28 18:12:08,wallstreetbets,Most likely a millionaire prostitute behind Arby‚Äôs
2021-04-28 18:22:18,wallstreetbets,The way you say it sounds as if this would be a 50/50 kind of bet. Which it isn‚Äôt. At all.
2021-04-28 18:22:43,wallstreetbets,Maybe he will be jerking people off with his diamond ape hands while waiting

2021-04-28 18:46:22,wallstreetbets,Millionaire prostitute behind Wendy‚Äôs. The Heidi Fleiss of apes.
2021-04-28 18:48:41,wallstreetbets,This actually isn‚Äôt a bad idea. Gme could go up like 20% tomorrow but likely won‚Äôt drop 20%. So he could double his money or at worst it won‚Äôt change much. He could lose a lot if it drops tomorrow but I doubt that‚Äôll happen.
2021-04-28 19:24:23,wallstreetbets,Definitely prostitute behind Wendy
2021-04-28 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,One way or another I'm getting my 4 for 4.
2021-04-28 19:31:25,wallstreetbets,Is there even a behind the wendy's anymore? Asking for a friend.

2021-04-28 16:42:21,wallstreetbets,Exactly this lol. Why not just do weekly FDs to save a fuck ton on the premium.
2021-04-28 18:39:58,wallstreetbets,Hopefully DFV sold him these.
2021-04-28 18:37:49,wallstreetbets,Yep that‚Äôs expensive. Price needs to actually get to 805.87 for this to break even at expiration.
2021-04-28 15:58:18,wallstreetbets,Lol that article was surprisingly helpful

2021-04-28 16:54:13,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a pretty risk free play imo, it will easily squeeze above 10k, almost none of the shorts have covered yet (if you read the DDs you‚Äôd know, GME DDs all seem to get removed here lately which is sus) and you‚Äôll be able to sell these calls for a lot of profit during the squeeze"

You're getting like 18X leverage past 800 which tbh kinda sucks for the risk your taking. I'd buy these if they were sub one dollar, so that if it ever did 900-1000, I'd 100-200X my money."

2021-04-28 19:59:20,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs an absurdly bad purchase even by this subs standard. 34k of premium on 800$ calls?
2021-04-28 18:46:21,wallstreetbets,It's been like this since February. I've recouped like half my investment selling fds. Only got exercised twice on the second peak

2021-04-28 15:58:52,wallstreetbets,"These calls do not have to be in the money to be profitable though... IV for GME is low right now. If the price spikes like it did in March and Jan, these calls will easily 5-10x"
2021-04-28 16:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, this thread has been a barrel of laughs."
2021-04-28 18:07:25,wallstreetbets,I would have bought that much GME on margin to sell the covered calls on them.
2021-04-28 18:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah what the fuck? At least light the cash on fire, you'd get more enjoyment out of it"
2021-04-28 19:59:48,wallstreetbets,You must of missed the guy who bought 10k worth of weekly puts expecting the apocalypse.
2021-04-28 19:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah on a serious note if this is in fact this guy‚Äôs entire life savings, then he isn‚Äôt a retard. He‚Äôs a fucking idiot"

2021-04-28 19:43:22,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly. They peaked at 12k each on 3/10. Any sort of run on GME will send these calls back through the roof. Hopefully op sells enough to at least cover his cost base during the next spike.
2021-04-28 15:30:46,wallstreetbets,Good. Nothing makes me happier than seeing gme calls expire worthless after being told for the past 3 months that gme calls are a bad idea and to but shares instead.

2021-04-28 17:45:14,wallstreetbets,I can't imagine there are many others wanting to buy those calls so it's not even a position he could exit easily.
2021-04-28 17:06:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah thats called theta decay...

2021-04-28 19:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Look at the price history on these calls. They hit $120 each on 3/10 when GME hit $340. If GME has any sort of run in the next month, these calls are going to pay off big. I doubt they will be worth near that much now that the expiration is 40% closer, but a spike above 200 in the next month should send these over $10. These calls are also extremely liquid, with crazy open interest. 

It's a huge risk, but I am rooting for this dude. Hopefully he doesn't see them double and diamond hand his calls back to 0."

2021-04-28 16:55:31,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, we‚Äôre all still wrapping our heads around this one"
2021-04-28 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,"no 5800 shares on july 15th if he chooses to exercise them, which I highly doubt he will and even if the price rockets he would be better off getting the premium"
2021-04-28 17:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, the *only* way he makes money is if GME is squeezed and:    
  
1. he exercises    
  
or    
  
2. sells those calls.    
   
BUT:    
  
1. to exercise, he needs 80k cash per call option (which he doesn't; he says this is his life savings)   
    

2. Some retard has to want to buy the calls from him (good fucking luck with that)     
  
Which literally won't happen."
2021-04-28 15:22:48,wallstreetbets,This also makes no money
2021-04-28 17:47:24,wallstreetbets,"> There is millions of people out there that believe GME will hit 7 digits

2021-04-28 17:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure DFV bought 11 dollar strike calls in august 2020 that expired in april 2021, Those actually had a reasonable chance to hit and they obviously did. This moron bought 800 dollar strike calls for july and paid an outrageous premium for them."
2021-04-28 17:45:51,wallstreetbets,"> There is millions of people out there that believe GME will hit 7 digits. So why the hate?

I'd like to sell these people some $1m 01/2022 calls. $10 each guys; I got a whole truckload of them."
2021-04-28 17:01:17,wallstreetbets,"DFV had a well studied thesis, and bought options at a more reasonable price and a longer term. Not an equal move."
2021-04-28 16:55:01,wallstreetbets,Do people really believe it‚Äôll hit 7 digits? I‚Äôve never seen or heard that. Please provide link if you can so I can have something to laugh at when I feel sad.
2021-04-28 17:50:17,wallstreetbets,"> There is millions of people out there that believe GME will hit 7 digits.

There is literally not even one person who believes that.  People joke and dream on here, but not even the most retarded retard actually believes that."
2021-04-28 19:39:40,wallstreetbets,"> There is millions of people out there that believe GME will hit 7 digits. 

There are not millions of people that believe that.   

There is zero chance it will hit 7 digits - even if the conditions were right for that to happen the gov't would step in long before it got there and shut it all down.   

Then you morons would be complaining how you all would have been millionaires if only the gov't had stayed out of it.    At that point you would be lucky to sell the shares back for break-even.   

So no, its not going to 7 digits (70T market cap).   Use some fucking common sense."
2021-04-28 19:13:47,wallstreetbets,Because people here who are new (last 6 months) don't know that yolo-ing life savings on calls is something to be celebrated here
2021-04-28 16:59:08,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-28 17:35:34,wallstreetbets,He bought 58 contracts (5800 stocks) for $34000 that the price on July it's going to be higher than 800. If the price isn't above that on July he lose his money. If the price is 800 he wins 5800*$800=$$4.640.000
2021-04-28 19:19:53,wallstreetbets,Lmao no it won‚Äôt

2021-04-28 18:45:37,wallstreetbets,"This idiot just put his life savings into GME, you think he knows what he‚Äôs doing?"
2021-04-28 17:41:59,wallstreetbets,In the U.S. having that amount of savings would make you richer then 80 percent of the country.
2021-04-28 17:07:58,wallstreetbets,Because even if it spikes to $350 again he can sell the options and make quite a bit of money?
2021-04-28 17:54:04,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

2021-04-28 18:15:25,wallstreetbets,5800 shares. Each contract is the option to buy 100 shares. But he wouldn‚Äôt exercise the option if the price doesn‚Äôt go above $800 plus the price of the option. It would just expire worthless.
2021-04-28 18:59:19,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a bet that gme will be above 800 before July 16. If it hits on July 16, he breaks even (more or less, minus premium, and other complicated things). The sooner gme gets to 800 before July 16, the more money he makes. If it doesn‚Äôt at all, he loses everything."
2021-04-28 18:55:49,wallstreetbets,"GME is already incredibly overvalued, so his shares are about 90% likely to lose value by July imo. All those calls are bets that it‚Äôll hit $800, which is a sub 0.001% chance,"
2021-04-28 18:57:03,wallstreetbets,"A Call is like a bet. Like a side bet on market prices. He has placed a $35k bet that gme will go up above $800 per share by July 16. If it doesn‚Äôt, he loses all of it."
2021-04-28 19:04:19,wallstreetbets,"As the price moves closer to or above the strike price ($800 in this case), the value of the options will increase - sometimes dramatically. So they can just sell it to someone else for a higher price if it moves enough in the direction they‚Äôre hoping for. I doubt this person will exercise their option to actually buy all that stock so the goal would be to pawn it off to someone who also thinks it will be more valuable in the future"
2021-04-28 19:03:47,wallstreetbets,Whenever you have 100 shares you have the option to write and sell a call contract at whatever strike price you want as long as you think someone will buy it from you. The strike price doesn‚Äôt have to be rooted in reality.
2021-04-28 19:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Check the history of this strike. It went up quite a bit during the March spike due to IV jacking up. If you believe GME is due for another spike, whether it be due to a share recall, dividend, merger, etc... these will go right back up. Of course timing is important but that‚Äôs the theory. It‚Äôs a ridiculous bet regardless but that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs betting on happening in the next month or so."

2021-04-28 17:25:45,wallstreetbets,"He bought calls, so they aren't naked and he won't get assigned. You're thinking about selling calls, which he should definitely be selling CCs on those 100+ shares. That isn't what he's doing here, he bought all those calls. No clue why he'd exercise this either unless he wants to buy insane amounts of GME at $800. If he doesn't have the $ in his account to exercise them, he can't do it anyway.

Still pretty dumb thing to do though, IMO, but he's way braver (and dumber) than me. More than likely, these will decay heavily and expire worthless, he'll bail for a loss, or if there's a giant IV spike maybe he can break even or sell for some profit. Very risky either way."
2021-04-28 18:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Wtf are you talking about? He bought calls, he didnt sell them. If he wants to exercise at expiration assuming it's over the strike he'll need to pony up some serious cash but hes obviously not going to.


With that being said it's still stupid and he'll still probably go broke. But GME is GME.  Anything can happen."
2021-04-28 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,"*Calls* are not ""assigned,"" *puts* are. You have no idea how options work.

He has purchased the option to buy 100 of the stock at $800, per contract (would cost $80,000 per contract to exercise)."

2021-04-28 17:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but why go with the $800? He won‚Äôt make a lot of money if it spikes. He would make more if he got 400 or 385 strike. 

The call itself is not the most retarded thing, it‚Äôs the strike price."
2021-04-28 19:07:51,wallstreetbets,"Oh 
I have been reading all over that it should be around $500 for so due to all the hype and then having funds now ? What‚Äôs up with that"
2021-04-28 19:08:24,wallstreetbets,So he‚Äôs betting on the squeeze which everybody is talking about since Jan to happen. Why July?
2021-04-28 19:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Ah OK thanks, that makes more sense. Is the $5.87 price the premium and is that per unit? Is this cheap and would it be alot more expensive the lower the exercise price?"

2021-04-28 17:41:15,wallstreetbets,"No. 

Its an option to purchase the shares at a price of $800. 

Eventually, if the price doesn't hit $800, they will become worthless. If it goes OVER $800, he can purchase the shares for $800 and sell them for market price. So it would need to get to $1000 (58 contracts x 100 shares per contract x (1000-800))

The OTHER way he can make money is if the price drastically shoots up he can sell the options. Today he was willing to buy these for $5.8 because its such a crazy gamble to hit 800 in 2 months. So let's say tomorrow it sky rockets to $500 a share. Still hasn't hit that $800 price, but now going from 500 to 800 in two months isn't as crazy as going from 178 to 800. So tomorrow somebody might be willing to buy them for a price of $25 each since it seems more likely to happen. 

However, even if the stock slowly rises, lets say $2 a day, in a month its gone to about $240. Normally pretty good for a stock, up about 33% in a month. But he now only has a month until the options expire. So going from $240 to $800 in 30 days seems even crazier than $180 to $800 in 60 days. So at that point he could sell the option still but instead of a price if $5.8 each maybe he could sell them for $2.5, if anybody is even willing to buy them."
2021-04-28 17:41:20,wallstreetbets,If by 200 you meant 200 over 800 so 1000 yes that‚Äôs correct
2021-04-28 17:20:00,wallstreetbets,"58x5.68x100 is cost of these option at current price 180
Depending how fast it goes to 200, the option probably worth 8-10 per share, so 58x10x100 at best."

2021-04-28 19:06:38,wallstreetbets,"For what? The company is in great shape(payed off all debts that were due in 2023, raised 500mil from selling just 3.5mil shares) and is currently undergoing a major transformation, even without a squeeze it would be a great longterm buy"
2021-04-28 16:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, He's gonna learn about theta decay, potentially IV collapse too, all while watching all the life savings exponentially evaporate until July"
2021-04-28 17:34:59,wallstreetbets,The strike price is ridiculously high for such a short time horizon. What could possibly happen in the next  two months to have GME more than quadruple its current price and more than double its previous all time highs? It‚Äôs also his life savings. You hate to see it
2021-04-28 16:51:33,wallstreetbets,Because nothing is a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù
2021-04-28 16:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Because he needs the stock price to go to $800 or close to it, and there is no way it‚Äôs going there by July"
2021-04-28 18:10:25,wallstreetbets,Somewhere hedge fund guys (cool guys) are laughing that they sold these
2021-04-28 17:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Because those $34,378.00 worth of options have a high chance of expiring worthless. He‚Äôs got a little less than 3 months for GME to soar past $800 in price or that‚Äôs just money flushed down the shitter.

For the price of those options he could have bought at least 180 more shares at today‚Äôs prices. If he thinks the stock is breaking 800 by then, just buying shares would stand to be a huge gain. If the stock only hits $799.99 or less the option is worthless. If it only cracks 800 on July 17th 2021 or later the option is worthless. OP has put himself in a situation where even if the stock doubled in price by July he loses money. 

I know WSB grew up around ridiculous YOLO OTM option plays but those were basically lottery tickets on options without a huge cost per contract. 

Even most of GMEs most ardent fans don‚Äôt want to put a date on their play - they mostly buy stock. 

I think OP‚Äôs only play here is to hope there‚Äôs a fast rise soon on the ticker and dump the option to someone else."
2021-04-28 18:28:44,wallstreetbets,"Because he's betting what he says is his life savings and more (aka, he took out a loan to buy even more) on GME going up 600% within a little more than a month. To say that's unlikely would be extremely generous. Last time it only got up to about 480 before the brokers freaked out, and by now the shorts have largely bought out of the market.

He'd probably be better off spending this money on lottery tickets."
2021-04-28 18:16:06,wallstreetbets,"OP is betting that GameStop will exceed $800 by July, or that it will become more volatile than it is now.

Obviously it isn‚Äôt hitting $800. And there is just no way it becomes more volatile than it already has. 

He would have been much much much better off going to the casino and putting it on black."
2021-04-28 19:29:55,wallstreetbets,"Because OP is gambling with his life savings...

No matter how good a stock looks like it's doing, it's stupid to put ALL your money on a single stock as the risk of losing it all is so high.  I hope for OPs sake that they're lying about this being their life savings for upvotes, because someone who does something this dumb is going to fuck themselves in the future even if this gamble makes them a millionaire."
2021-04-28 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,"Because GME to 1000 apes together strong is a meme. Not an actual price target. 

This sub is retarded ironically, but op didn‚Äôt realize it and is now actually retarded by following ironic advice."
2021-04-28 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,I knew this was a thing
2021-04-28 18:57:55,wallstreetbets,At current repo rates and short borrow rates I wouldn't doubt it. With all the new DTCC rules though i'm betting that shits all a blip to buy time while they figure out how to unwind this.
2021-04-28 19:11:30,wallstreetbets,"""You're valuing the bonds as if they were pristine, but you're charging premiums like they are crap?"""
2021-04-28 19:11:32,wallstreetbets,OP is truly retarded
2021-04-28 19:06:24,wallstreetbets,Lol I paid that premium for 165c
2021-04-28 18:47:51,wallstreetbets,"My numbers are based just on intrinsic value (which is just price difference with no extra option value due to volatility/hype and not really leverage, more like ROI), but basically the idea is that past ur break even, you're making 100 dollars on ever dollar movement up (100 shares on contract), but you divide that by the premium paid for them to get returns. Say you pay $1 in premium ($100 total) for a 10C for $ABC. It goes to $20, that 10C is now worth minimum $10 ($1K total per contract) which is the difference between the price you can pay to acquire those shares vs. current actual price (in reality it'll be more as long as there's time still left on the contract and based on general sentiment). In this case if your price target is 20, you're ROI is 10x (10 out /1 in), which vs. 2x gain on just buying the shares is 5x leverage. Now this is the fundamental idea behind options. You need to have PTs and with them look at the leverage you're getting at that level vs. the risk/actual probability of hitting that PT. 

Obviously, the process is a lot more dynamic and usually you don't follow your PT precisely and others look for target profit %, but that is the idea. You don't even need really to have PTs that are beyond your strike price to make money, which is another misconception. If GME goes to 300 and hype suddenly goes up, he could make a lot of money these could go up to like 10-20 dollars, but the issue is he would've made a lot more money if he had bought something much less OTM on lower theta. Like a 300C bought in a month in say June before any price potential explosions with like a few weeks on it, could be worth 50X if we hit 800 (going from say 10 bucks to 500), with the tradeoff being that it loses value much faster than this one as time value on the contract is lost quicker in that last month, week, day."
2021-04-28 18:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Rn IV is kinda high again, but it was superrrr low on the days whereit was stuck on 150. But again the idea is the mismatch between probability of hitting vs. premium paid, whoever sold that guy those contracts, made 600 bucks to take the risk of having to buy if the shares go up, which is a really comfy position to be in.

But yeah, I'd say options rn aren't the best for GME. You wanna wait until it dries up news wise and then jump in again. If you for whatever reason believe in the potential of a squeeze before June, it would be best to go for a 200-250C, but they will lose a lot of value over time. With shares, its unlikely you lose a lot as I don't see how this ever dips under even 150 for more than a few days if at all in the foreseeable future."
2021-04-28 18:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Selling these babies naked is almost as special as buying these 800cs lmao. 

The stock makes 0 sense. Wouldn't wanna be caught with your pants down around your ankles."
2021-04-28 18:15:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's true. I was more thinking you meant thetagang would be stoked because someone played options when this is a terrible buy.
2021-04-28 17:58:56,wallstreetbets,Spend long enough going to the casino eventually you realize you should become the casino
2021-04-28 18:17:23,wallstreetbets,That's true. If I had the stocks I'd be selling CC's every week but I hesitated when GME touched $40. My loss.
2021-04-28 19:28:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to the game. I fomoed like a dipshit and bought 400 shares at 75 but didn't sell. Then I found salvation in r/thetagang. But all high activity stocks seem to have pretty good premiums. I recently convinced my boomer uncle to sell some fd weeklies on tesla before earnings because he was going to sell anyway, and made like 1500 free money."
2021-04-28 16:45:45,wallstreetbets,With a side of paste
2021-04-28 16:21:07,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I'm becoming doubtful that he's still all the way in. If the GME squad sees this comment I'll get obliterated, but...there's a reason he called his most recent update his last one. If he sells, and announces it, the price will crash as everybody freaks out that their messiah has left the ballgame and they start to sell. He's in a position now where everything he does is market moving, and his announcing that he sold could very well be considered market manipulation. I'm no lawyer, but I wouldn't have a hard time believing that his lawyers advised him against announcing that he's selling for that very reason - CYA against accusations of market manipulation."
2021-04-28 16:18:37,wallstreetbets,I wonder where his money to double down came from....

2021-04-28 16:48:35,wallstreetbets,"No.  Options contracts are usually used as a leveraged hedge against risk.  I.e. most people who buy these OTM call contracts actually hold short positions that they are hedging.

For example, if I short GME at $200, I might also buy call options with a strike price of $400.  If GME rises to $600, I only have to pay $400 per share to cover my shorts instead of $600.  As such until my contract expires, I will never get margin called."
2021-04-28 16:52:35,wallstreetbets,Correct me if I'm wrong... but wouldn't that someone else be slightly less retarded since the option will be nearer the strike price?
2021-04-28 17:15:52,wallstreetbets,Well they were dumb enough to put their life savings on way OTM calls late in the GME game. So it's definitely possible they will stupidly diamond hand or lose 90% of their savings in the process

2021-04-28 18:09:41,wallstreetbets,"Theta decay doesn't fuckin matter here...

This is a squeeze play, so if squeeze doesn't happen, 100% loss.  If squeeze happens, massive gains."
2021-04-28 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Can you explain calls to a retard? I read a little bit but I'm just a smooth brain engineer and didn't get it.

2021-04-28 16:53:28,wallstreetbets,"Well that‚Äôs not true, it needs a lot of volatility. That way he can sell for a profit"
2021-04-28 16:52:42,wallstreetbets,He can make money without gme getting to 800 tho?
2021-04-28 16:55:40,wallstreetbets,Only if he tries to diamond hand it (maybe there is a term for üíéüôå on something guaranteed to burn up?). Hopefully he has the sense to sell if the price jumps 10%-20% again
2021-04-28 17:02:23,wallstreetbets,He needs it to either get close to 800 before July and time selling the options right or above 806 by expiration in July.
2021-04-28 17:34:53,wallstreetbets,Can he cancel his order before July? Asking for another ape...

2021-04-28 19:06:16,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Always like to learn where I can.. not looking for any predictions or anything like that but why don‚Äôt you think a squeeze would happen in the month of may? I know something would have to trigger it and we‚Äôve seen a lot of gme news but not a straight up seismic event to cause the share price to climb aggressively. Do you just not see the catalyst coming before June?
2021-04-28 18:39:08,wallstreetbets,I plan to transition to doing wheel plays once I build a foundation in my portfolio. Plus Im on Questrade / wealthsimple right now and Questrade option commissions are disgusting

2021-04-28 16:24:35,wallstreetbets,"If Gamestop themselves can sell 3.5 million shares, and publically, without dropping the price, then DFV can sell his 50k shares privately and the market won't even blink."
2021-04-28 16:55:03,wallstreetbets,"He also stopped doing updates after the jan squeeze. I dont think he stopped cus he sold, i think its because legal reasons. Like you said the updates could be seen as market manipulation and he has made a lot of people angry."

2021-04-28 17:30:35,wallstreetbets,If you listen to his 2020 podcasts and DDs you will realize that he genuinely believes in the companies success and he just loves the stock. I can bet my left nut that he hasn‚Äôt sold and won‚Äôt sell for a long time.
2021-04-28 16:22:18,wallstreetbets,He had 11mil cash from selling the first half of his april calls

2021-04-28 16:53:14,wallstreetbets,Great explanation.
2021-04-28 19:51:01,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs still not exactly right. Options are very illiquid and traded through market makers. When you buy and sell an option you‚Äôre transacting with a market maker who is simultaneously hedging their exposure by buying or shorting the underlying stock to collect the bid/ask spread without taking directional risk. Whether or not there‚Äôs someone who wants to be on the other side of the trade in order to hedge their own position only matters in that it affects what spread the market makers will quote. Even with 0 open interest the market makers will (and are in fact obligated to) quote you a price on the contract.
2021-04-28 18:06:37,wallstreetbets,Only 90%? Someone is optimistic today.

2021-04-28 19:44:43,wallstreetbets,couldnt he have just bought stock doe?
2021-04-28 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,Maybe a little but delta is going to be so small that far OTM it won't be much. If he was hoping for a spike to make quick money he would have been better off buying shares I think.
2021-04-28 17:39:54,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm up ¬£18k In realised gains

2021-04-28 18:17:19,wallstreetbets,"> Smooth brain here, so it sounds like OP purchased the calls betting the squeeze (of some sort) will happen before the calls expire worthless?

Exactly.  If the shares don't hit $800 before the options expire, he's fucked.  If they blow past $800, he's golden."
2021-04-28 18:03:20,wallstreetbets,"For $22k, they can buy \~125 shares. If the price goes to $1000/share, they'll have made a little over $100k. With these options, a $1000 share price nets over $1M."
2021-04-28 18:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Because if GME squeezes to 2,000, each options contract is worth at least 120,000 dollars.  And they have 58.  So that's 6.9 million dollars at a very conservative squeeze price.

If it squeezes to 5,000 each contract is worth 420k.  So that's 24 million.  

If GME actually makes it to 100,000, they make over half a billion dollars, because 58 contracts is basically controlling 5800 shares once they're deeply in the money.

To actually answer your question, options are used to increase leverage at the cost of increasing risk.  Of COURSE buying and holding is safer, that's why everyone tells you to do it.  But you can only buy 100 shares for 18k, while you can buy about 30 of these contracts for the same price, representing 3000 shares.  So you make more money this way if GME is at 986 or more at any point between now or expiry.  OP expects the price to go up via a squeeze, so they're assuming it goes well beyond that, in which case 3000 is better than 100."
2021-04-28 19:59:38,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs agree to disagree and wait and see.

2021-04-28 17:12:47,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't compare it to gambling. It's more like dousing your money in gasoline and lighting it on fire inside a brand new house and hoping that in rains enough to leak through the roof and put out the fire.
2021-04-28 17:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me sir, the internet has promised me GME will be hitting $10,000/share any day now. OP is obviously an amazingly savvy investor."
2021-04-28 17:11:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah considering he's gonna need it to climb to 4 or 500 bucks a share in a couple months for those to have any extrinsic value. I would have bought fewer contracts atm or barely otm. This is insanity.

Edit... A month, not couple. Forgot its almost May"
2021-04-28 18:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Say the stock goes to $800, wouldn‚Äôt he have still made more $ just owning stocks he bought at $180?  Retarded ape here."
2021-04-28 17:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, it has to go quite a bit over 800 to even be worth this absolute ass risk. wtf is OP actually thinking here?"
2021-04-28 17:30:33,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúQuite a gamble‚Äù is a huge understatement.

Buying OTM calls like that are dangerous because you have to be right twice: the size of the move and the timing. I would like to think he sold the $900 calls or some similar shit, but people making moves like that don‚Äôt usually make it spread to hedge their risk..."
2021-04-28 18:01:57,wallstreetbets,That's almost double the actual squeeze in January.
2021-04-28 18:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Trading was halted at 400$. So yeah, quite the gamble."
2021-04-28 19:59:27,wallstreetbets,GameStop is no way worth $170 a share. Before the hype it barely broke $10.

2021-04-28 19:03:01,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't need to get to 800, if IV goes up it'll print.  Although that premium is pretty high."
2021-04-28 17:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Lets exercise our critical thinking. If IV is 0, why are the premiums of way OTM calls $500-600??"
2021-04-28 17:13:58,wallstreetbets,"IV is not 0. IV crush often happens after an earnings call. It rises as you get close to whatever binary event you're playing, then when you get your answer, IV collapses and takes your options premium down with it."
2021-04-28 17:12:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol, no.  IV on these is about 200% right now.  IV is really high right now.  Hell 100% IV is expensive as hell.  That much IV that far OTM...OP would do better to just set their money on fire in the backyard, at least that way they'll get some warmth out of it."

2021-04-28 17:44:35,wallstreetbets,"No there are no refunds on options contracts. He bought the contract with an expiry on July 16. Canceling an order before expiration would happen 100% of the time if it is not in the money, defeating the purpose of the risk vs. return payoff"
2021-04-28 16:34:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't think the comment was saying that he himself has enough shares to move the market, but rather that he has so many people who've built him up as the GME messiah that if he sold and made that info public, a ton of his followers might follow suit which could move the market."
2021-04-28 16:52:51,wallstreetbets,"He has 200k but yea pretty much.  He holds 0.2% of the outstanding shares.  that's not a lot.  The market manipulation part isn't always about how much impact one person has directly, but also indirectly.  No matter how much he actually has, publicizing that he sold his stake would have an influence on a lot of other people."
2021-04-28 16:36:49,wallstreetbets,He has 200k now
2021-04-28 16:37:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking DFV selling publicly, not privately. Can you not imagine the shit storm if he popped in here with an update this Friday and said ""I sold it all, here's my cash balance. Peace homies."" 

Sure his 200k shares themselves won't be enough to move the market, that's barely a blip in daily volume. Making it public is what moves it."

2021-04-28 18:41:10,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt follow him. No idea how much he owns or if he is even doing options but something tells me he wouldn‚Äôt touch these... and if he would he probably won‚Äôt be rich for long.
2021-04-28 18:43:08,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve always just bought and sold options. Never had the funds to really exercise them or I probably would‚Äôve just bought the shares in the first place.
2021-04-28 17:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, if it does squeeze to infinity then I won‚Äôt catch it at $3000 and I‚Äôll be forced to sell at $10000000 a share. Diddums for me.

2021-04-28 18:15:01,wallstreetbets,Market Makers will buy instantly if you offer for less than intrinsic value. So this isn't really a concern FYI

2021-04-28 17:18:24,wallstreetbets, Incredible lol.
2021-04-28 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Actually, if it moved to 500 these calls would be worth a shit load more than he paid for them. When GME ran to 340ish on 3/10, these exact calls peaked at $120 each. As in $12,000 each. If GME has any sort of run before the end of June, this dude is making a shit load of money.

To be fair, calls don't normally behave the way GME calls do. With any other stock, this would be incredibly stupid. Volidity on GME is insane during spikes, since everyone is expecting a short squeeze.

If you don't believe me, take a look at those calls and the price history. Every time GME has run, they've gone up exponentially. The only way I see OP losing money on these is if he gets greedy and holds them through one or more spikes."
2021-04-28 17:18:41,wallstreetbets,"IV does not simply go up with the price. It only relates to how volatile the stock is. IV goes up when shit plummets too

That's why it's called implied volatility"
2021-04-28 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,Yea I was going to say the same thing. Small moves in underlying GME = large contract price swings.

2021-04-28 18:03:39,wallstreetbets,"I mean I've swung 800s a lot. Got 3/19 in Feb, bought for 50 sold for 2500. April's were a couple weeks later but got those for 800 and sold for 7000. It just needs one spike and iv increase to work out"
2021-04-28 17:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, good point. I mean if there's extrinsic value in them I think he could offload them, but if he's fallen under breaking even, they're fucked."

2021-04-28 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, lol.  IV is generally discussed as implied volatility.  IV crush is when Vega anal rapes you as IV drops.  Which Vega on these is 0.14 so everyday that GME doesn't spike 40% IV will go down and OP will deserve a special shrine to his retardation."

And I'd bet he's absolutely going to do that."
2021-04-28 18:07:20,wallstreetbets,This. I sometimes think a lot of people very new to options don‚Äôt realise this. It doesn‚Äôt have to go to 800.

2021-04-28 17:44:07,wallstreetbets,that‚Äôs not how it would work lol. i meant that on the way up you would be the guy to see 3k or 10k and sell em and then watch in agony as it spikes back up further

2021-04-28 17:23:19,wallstreetbets,"Implied volatilities absolutely do correlate with price action to some extent. If I want to sell an call or put on SPY (although puts have a hilarious skew) while it's plummeting, I'm going to demand more premium from the buyer.

IV usually goes up when things go down, but GME has the opposite correlation."
2021-04-28 18:22:10,wallstreetbets,"> Yea I was going to say the same thing. Small moves in underlying GME = large contract price swings.

Yup. GME climbing like $70 can turn a 800c into a 7-bagger, it's super wild.

One of the most amusing things to me about GME was watching the value of my puts go up as GME *climbed*. Got pretty annoyed when I got IV crushed when GME took a nosedive though."

If it shoots up and down like a madman IV goes way way up. If it moves like a fucking snail either up or down IV goes down and stays down

2021-04-28 15:54:44,wallstreetbets,But sometimes that one dumpster is filled with water and won't catch on fire.  And actually turns into a geyser of money.
2021-04-28 16:06:04,wallstreetbets,Yes ü§ò
2021-04-28 19:55:45,wallstreetbets,"And the dumpster is multiplying money as soon as you light it on fire, will the dumpster burn it all or get put out by more money piling on top, tune in next week to find out."

2021-04-28 15:54:41,wallstreetbets,"Jesus guys, stop being bag holders. The only apes there are for GME. Short interest for MVIS is like what 28%?"
2021-04-28 14:14:16,wallstreetbets,It happens every earnings. Buy the hype sell the news also‚Ä¶
2021-04-28 14:13:32,wallstreetbets,Seems kinda like they would have some good news tomorrow considering they are already sending out good news today.
2021-04-28 14:32:24,wallstreetbets,"Maybe cause they are holding a stock that has run up several hundreds of percent on a company that is speculative at absolute best?  Oh yea, and most of them couldn‚Äôt even tell you what the company does as a function of its business. Just my guess. :)"

2021-04-28 14:14:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah didn‚Äôt they push their earning out earlier by a week ?
2021-04-28 14:58:52,wallstreetbets,I can only hope. Usually they go down with earnings.
2021-04-28 14:22:46,wallstreetbets,"The news or earnings is almost always priced in before it happens. Hence buy the hype, sell the news. You need to be days, or weeks, months ahead of the market/ the crowd.

Edit: of course if earnings come in way above estimates things could shake out differently"
2021-04-28 15:01:47,wallstreetbets,Pulled it forward a week from last year/typical.
2021-04-28 14:59:34,wallstreetbets,But I think they had good news today so they probaly have better tomorrow

2021-04-28 16:22:17,wallstreetbets,I'd be happy with $6 so I can trade the red crayon for the black one.
2021-04-28 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre hoping to 3X in 2 years?
2021-04-28 18:28:07,wallstreetbets,"Same, bought in at 28% down yesterday. When a stock drops 1/3 of it's value on it's first trading day YOU BUY."

Cause the discription for MNMD on robinhood says the company is from sylmar CA not from Canada"
2021-04-28 15:50:39,wallstreetbets,What happens when company pays dividend? Any idea? I'm from a country where robinhood isn't available. Just want to understand.

2021-04-28 19:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Sure.  I saw a lot of detractors on this stock for little to no reason.  That made me suspicious.  Certain entities are known for attempting to manipulate retail enthusiasm, specifically WSB.  In this case, they are doing so mostly in a negative way.

I decided to see how many shares are being traded *total* vs how many are available to short.  The ratio is incredibly small.  This tends to indicate that the short interest in this stock is greater than it appears.  As of last Friday, preopening, the shorts were already at about 60%.  The figure I dredged up indicates that it is very, very likely higher than that now.  All of that indicates that the price of this stock is *artifically* low.  It also means, hypothetically, they will eventually have to buy back the shares, which would drive the price up.  This would be the classical short squeeze as they try to cover.  I am not advocating that a short squeeze is the play here.

What I *am* advocating is that the price is *already* artificially depressed on day two.  As this stock matures, it will rise.  I am also advocating that this lowers the supply and in markets of relative low liquidity, that means the price will also rise.  I am *also* implying that some of these posters are also spreading FUD be because they are incentivized to do so."

2021-04-28 15:39:33,wallstreetbets,We got lunch money bro ;) came out at 4.62 to be exact Lmfaoo
2021-04-28 18:57:43,wallstreetbets,It got listed on Nasdaq 2 days ago. It was available in other markets.
2021-04-28 18:58:10,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs been otc as mmdf or something for a year and just listed. I bought in months ago after reading some dd that seemed compelling. Only regret was not getting more.
2021-04-28 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,"Are you saying that like it is a bad trade, or just showing your math skills?"
2021-04-28 18:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I know many are bullish that mnmd will 3x in far less time than that. It certainly could happen, but i‚Äôm not convinced. But hear me out...


3x in 2 years is really, really, really good by traditional investing standards. 


Not only that, I feel that the odds of mnmd 3x-ing in 2 years are very good. I think the risk is relatively low too. Because I don‚Äôt see the company failing in 2 year‚Äôs time. They will (hopefully) have some good trial results and hopefully the sector becomes more mainstream. These things will increase the share price. If mnmd is gonna fail, i see it happening 3-10 years down the road due to either:


1) all phase 3 trials fail


2) unable to bring a drug to market and scale it/monetize it


I think over the next 2 years hype will build and some trials will have good news, bringing up the value. This is a great play to 3x your money with little effort (don‚Äôt trade just hold) over 2 years, if you can patiently wait 2 years. Worth the wait for the nearly guaranteed 2-3x in 2ish years. 


There are holes in this theory I‚Äôm sure. Nothing‚Äôs  guaranteed. But i like the odds a lot."
2021-04-28 15:30:48,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what everyone said about BTX and it‚Äôs 52 dollars a share
2021-04-28 15:41:30,wallstreetbets,MNMD is the ticker you want
2021-04-28 17:19:07,wallstreetbets,You get money
2021-04-28 18:50:06,wallstreetbets,You get dividend money usually every quarter. I have 100 shares of a company valued at 15 a share and it's like... 15 bucks every 3 months.
2021-04-28 19:06:27,wallstreetbets,What word was it
2021-04-28 19:34:04,wallstreetbets,So are we going to squeeze them or what's up? Why would they short MNMD when the company looks so promising? I haven't seen anyone say that their business straight up won't work.
2021-04-28 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,"This shares literally nothing in common with GME, how do you see this hitting 100?"

2021-04-28 19:30:56,wallstreetbets,I think he's asking if Robinhood pays you put of their account or how do you get the dividend if you and Robinhood don't own the stock.
2021-04-28 19:31:21,wallstreetbets,But who pays that dividend if you and Robinhoo ld do not own the stock?
2021-04-28 15:17:12,wallstreetbets,I like the stock

2021-04-28 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,Rolls Royce is an industry leader in engineering and development of turbine engines for civil aviation. They‚Äôre near an all time low in share prices mostly due to the pandemic scuttling air travel. They make 40% of their revenue on servicing contracts on the engines they sell. They‚Äôre dependent on planes getting back up and logging flight hours to create the need for service again. RR already projects to be back to earning on this sector by second half of this year 2021. They also develop a ton of other cool shit worth looking into.

2021-04-28 13:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm. Im seriously considering doing this.  I got left behind on mvis even though I considered joining before it mooned, then I missed on mindmed, I missed on clov, I missed in vaxart, I missed on muds.  Every single one of these almost pulled the trigger on but didn't.  My fear is the one I finally pull the trigger on won't work out.  Although, I can't make money if it don't spend any."
2021-04-28 15:04:01,wallstreetbets,I just want to break even ! So mad at the hype of 1/28/21-2/04/21 then dumb Gov. Newton I lost bigly .

2021-04-28 15:55:08,wallstreetbets,So this might be might first stock investing in. Are you saying buy before the 10th then dump the 14th? Or am I retarded.
2021-04-28 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao. So this is why there are idiots buying this stock today. It's the worst possible investment in the weed space. Go APHA instead.
2021-04-28 16:19:23,wallstreetbets,"I bought this in 2017 and sold in 19. Never again for me, but good luck!"
2021-04-28 16:27:53,wallstreetbets,Im holding over 200 share at $35.
2021-04-28 17:08:43,wallstreetbets,I've been holding this for a couple years after getting murdered on the reverse split and now it's not even worth selling at a loss.
2021-04-28 19:37:37,wallstreetbets,This might be my first YOLO just so I can tell ppl how I made $$$ on cannabis stock (and used it to buy cannabis ‚òòÔ∏è)

Will sell at 10.50 or so to make my money back at least."
2021-04-28 16:11:54,wallstreetbets,Well this sounds plausible but just conjecturing bcz I'm retarded what if they do another reverse split and board members run off AGAIN after selling off stock? Like is that a possibility?
2021-04-28 16:12:59,wallstreetbets,Too much words. Too dumb to comprehend.
2021-04-28 16:23:14,wallstreetbets,Anyone know the price to earnings? My calculator only goes to negative one billion.

2021-04-28 16:39:03,wallstreetbets,">I've been holding for over a year at a cost basis of $107.

For anyone who doesn't know ACB did a 1:12 reverse stock split so his cost average was ~$8.9 pre-split.  I think mine was $8.5 but I realized that loss (to offset my 2020 gains).  Thank God APHA's up, my cost average there is like $6."
2021-04-28 17:57:51,wallstreetbets,"hello sir, i'm holding at $91, post reverse split, just like you. LMAO. i'm riding this bitch back up or to $0.00, idgaf."

2021-04-28 16:20:06,wallstreetbets,"Hahah, thats probably not a bad strategy to be honest. I curse stonks, I can hold off for weeks before buying a stock then the moment I buy it, it tanks.  Same with puts, as soon as buy some the share price rockets."

Looking at the 12 strike aurora calls for the 14th and 21st, the 21st call has a bigger delta, bigger rho, and smaller theta. So assuming a big move, I think the 21st call would make more money. I could be completely wrong tho who knows I'm retarded"

2021-04-28 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,"I am not going to speak to the why it is down, but I have done a few different DDs on the semiconductor industry and the OP is correct.  AMDs stock being below $90 right now is fucking stupid.  

Their earnings release showed just how deep they getting inside the data centers that Intel used to feast on."
2021-04-28 15:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I'm going to tag my thoughts about AMD in the datacenter as a system admin/engineer in a medium size company with massive growth goals over the next 5 years.

We absolutely aren't looking at ARM chips for datacenter work, and their lack of compatibility with legacy line of business software is a drawback for even end-user work. (We're using entirely x64 traditional architecture in our fleet right now.)

As Hyperconverged network/virtualization/storage/compute infrastructure continues to grow in the datacenter world, AMD will need to compete with non-traditional companies in this sector like Cisco, but I believe the cost of Cisco Hyperconverged infrastructure limits their appeal to many SMB size companies.

Lastly, I see regular advertisements from HPE (our current vendor) showcasing the benefits of AMD processors in the datacenter, but I see little from Dell EMC and some other vendors we are working with. If AMD can secure the kind of exposure they are getting from HPE with other vendors and increase their name recognition and reputation in the Datacenter market, thats going to be a massive boost to sales.

\*Disclosure\* I own AMD stock, my personal machine has an AMD processor, and I would do unspeakable acts for a 6000 series graphics card. Do your own research, and I am not a financial advisor.

Tl;Dr: AMD make expensive machines go brrrrrrrr, I like the stock, etc.

AMD is like a coiled spring. Hedge funds try to put the pressure to fit it in a box but even a slightest mistake and it uncoils and hits them hard in their face. 

The pressure is building on Hedge Funds. They have been trying to push it hard. Sooner or later it will recoil and jump."

2021-04-28 17:57:20,wallstreetbets,"Just adding that competitors didn't choose ARM because it was the best (although a lot of good things could be said about the architecture). They chose it because they ***don't have a choice*** if they want to enter the CPU market.

x86/x64 is good and here to stay because the vast majority of software is written for x86/x64 and porting to ARM is a PITA. Competitors who are late into the CPU business cannot afford to reinvent the wheel with x86/x64 because they will necessarily lose to both AMD and Intel, and that's why they go with ARM. AMD also proved time and time again that they can squeeze insane performance out of x86/x64.

AMD on the other hand already got sufficient mastery of the x86/x64 CPU design and it works pretty well for them, why should they switch to ARM if they don't see enough demand for it?

And as an end-user, why would you even buy an ARM-based desktop or server if you're just going to run everything in x86-emulation mode and lose efficiency while also opening the door to bugs?"

Companies that aren't as highly shorted like Skyworks, meanwhile, get 5% bumps from their earnings without the downward pressure. 

Then you look at the chart for something like RKT that's just a short smorgasbord and it's *scarily* predictable. 

But like OP said, the games only go so far, and the smart HFs will be exiting their short positions now before they get burned in an explosion or sustained run up in the price."

2021-04-28 18:07:36,wallstreetbets,"I've seen a disturbing trend of people who don't understand what a market cap is, or outstanding shares, or much of anything other than ""it's this price and it was this price and I'll bet it can be this price for reasons"" lol. I think it lost their interest more than knowledgeable day-traders. Recency bias, they remember when it was a deal at $40 and $80 seems overpriced to them. 

I still expect it to break out in a big way this quarter. The P/E has dropped all the way to 40! For a company growing revenue at 50% Y2Y it's really way oversold right now."

2021-04-28 19:35:04,wallstreetbets,"TSMC produces AMD chips. Anything that negatively impacts TSMC production will in turn impact AMD's revenue. Less production from TSMC -> less chips produced for AMD -> less chips sold -> less revenue for AMD. 

Also, all signs point to AMD's revenue being heavily supply bound so any hit to production rates have a lot of impact to AMD right now since they're basically selling everything they make."

2021-04-28 15:01:56,wallstreetbets,So.... your loss as mentioned...
2021-04-28 17:47:36,wallstreetbets,Anyone who closely follows the semiconductor industry and these big players roadmaps knows that AMD becomes stronger with XLNX. No other company has the capability to merge CPU and GPU now with XLNX Accelerated Computing and FPGA tech. A new age of advanced computing is here and AMD will be the champion. This bubble will burst soon and shorts will be crushed. 50% revenue growth every year with chip shortages can't be ignored for much longer.

2021-04-28 16:12:30,wallstreetbets,"u/Jurkin_Menov summarized the technique precisely. You are in WSB and there is nothing to learn here. Randomly pick some calls or puts and hit the buy button. Bought TSLA calls after earning yesterday thinking there might be a slight pull up, bag holded the whole night and then sold this morning with 1.7K loss. Bought some AMD $84 puts today, bagholded the whole day and then sold right before close with $50 profit - commission!"
2021-04-28 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Honestly this is the hard way to do it.  Buy calls that are 90-120 DTE when 4hr and daily chart is trending near support. Set a limit sell order for what option is worth at resistance.  Don't hold for more than 14-30 days unless it's ITM.  You'll make less on every trade but it'll keep your risk & emotions in check and probability higher. Oh and only trade stocks that don't suck.  Bluechips. 

Also you make more on stocks that have low IV.  If >50% then don't long naked options, do a spread instead."
2021-04-28 17:26:21,wallstreetbets,"Just to expound upon what others have said, it might pay to pay attention to option OI in stocks with a lot of options activity.

If a price is approaching a call wall it is likely to bounce off. Unless of course it breaks through. In which case that call wall is no longer a headwind but a tail wind. Unless it reverses.

Better yet just buy calls and hope your lucky lol"

Stock prices move based on numerous random factors that CANNOT be defined or predicted by any kind of analysis known to anybody. You can probably make some educated guess about the overall market, based on current political, geopolitical, weather, climate, economy, wars, natural disasters, Government monetary policies, tax policies and some other factors. Predicting a single stock price by drawing lines on already known data points? Astrology at best!"
2021-04-28 15:07:58,wallstreetbets,"My win rate is about 75% with that exact strategy (underside VWAP bounce put scalping with *SPLUNK* on a *RED* spy day). Because i dont enter all the time - im pretty strict with my requirements, and the price action is pretty reasonable most of the time.

Doesnt mean i get 100% each time. My wins range from 20% profit to 100%. I rarely sell for under 10%

I trade hundreds of times a month so the sample size is pretty decent, it's not like ive done this 5 times"
2021-04-28 17:31:04,wallstreetbets,"A stock's price at any given time is an equilibrium point between buyers and sellers. The trend in the stock price depends on the (a) the historic stock price, i.e. are buyers willing to pay this? are sellers willing to sell at this? and (b) prediction for the future sell price.

Forget the prediction of a stock's price movement - at its most fundamental the market is about supply and demand. TA trends (e.g. head and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms) are just manifestations of the buy/sell equilibrium negotiations. TA tells you who won the past few battles and based on who won, you can get a pretty good guess as to how the war's going...

Put it another way, you're telling me buyer and seller sentiment is NOT at all influenced by the current price of the stock and what it's done in the past? Really?"
2021-04-28 17:33:04,wallstreetbets,"except it works majority of times (>50%) based on the indicators. Yes, catalysts are what drives stocks, but doesn't happen all the time. Why do you think institutions pay big money for TA/chartmasters to work at their firm? It can give you a good entry point, exit strategy, and measure momentum of stocks in the crazy world of stocks. Does it work 100% time? No, but if you're good at it you can make decent living out of it."
2021-04-28 19:36:34,wallstreetbets,"You're not understanding the context in which ""technical analysis"" is being used.

The stock's movement is random - we all know that. But, **in the short term** there are *undeniable* correlations between the movements of a stocks price, and it's current price given the current volume weighted average prices, simple moving averages, exponential moving averages (as well as fibonacci sequences and other less used structural phenomena), etc.

Every single day I see half of the stocks on the market making such clean bounces along the VWAP. There are clear pumps and consolidations every day, and extremely noticeable volume pumps at high VWAP distances. Why? **Stock price actions aren't decided by the movement of quantum particles. They're decided by people buying and selling - a majority of which, are bots following similar rulesets, so nondeterministic patterns must form.**

You can make money in the market by even knowing *something* will happen - lot's of theta plays rely on that. So, you definitely can make money off of this. It's not a piece of cake, and not always consistent, but it is something I believe people can improve in, at least emotionally."

2021-04-28 19:48:28,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what are you trying to say with all these words! Let me try to go one by one points-

**1. A stock's price at any given time is an equilibrium point between buyers and sellers.**

Anyone with little knowledge about how stock market work knows this. How is it relevant here when we are talking about predicting the future price of a stock by TA?

**2. The trend in the stock price depends on the (a) the historic stock price, i.e. are buyers willing to pay this? are sellers willing to sell at this? and (b) prediction for the future sell price.**

The trend does not only depends on these two factors! Trend depends on numerous major factors ranging from economy, management, dividends, interest rate, option open interests, option volume, company financials, revenue, current profitability, innovation, weather to as little as what DD is being posted in wsb!

**3.  Forget the prediction of a stock's price movement - at its most fundamental the market is about supply and demand. TA trends (e.g. head and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms) are just manifestations of the buy/sell equilibrium negotiations. TA tells you who won the past few battles and based on who won, you can get a pretty good guess as to how the war's going...**

Not sure what kind of TA you do? There are 4 classes of TA indicators namely 1) Cumulative 2) Index 3)Oscillator and 4) Overlay. These 4 classes contains over 60 indicators to identify the Trend, Volatility, volume/momentum and resistance/support. The whole point of the TA is to predict future stock price!

head and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms? These are bullshit at best. Do you see a head and shoulder pattern on a chart? What is the time frame? What is the frequency? If you see a head and shoulder on a daily chart with 15 minutes frequency then you will not see that pattern with 30 minutes frequency or hourly frequency or 1 minute frequency. Now if you extend the timeframe to 5 days or 10 days or a month, the chart is completely different! How do you determine the timeframe and frequency? For simplicity, just consider a monthly, a biweekly, 10 days, a weekly, 5 days, 3 days,  2 days and a daily timeframe now consider 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly frequency. How many choices do you have? Now tell me how are you going to select these two parameters to do your analysis? Because for the same stock there will be 48 completely different charts and some of them will show you head and shoulder on one combination but not in other. Some will show you a shape of monkey, some will show you a shape of Tesla logo!

**4. Put it another way, you're telling me buyer and seller sentiment is NOT at all influenced by the current price of the stock and what it's done in the past? Really?**

Do not blame me on something that I never claimed! All I said was that TA does not work. Also, it's not only that the buyers/sellers sentiment is influenced by current stock price the inverse is also true.

*TlDr: TA is astrology and Astrology is horse shit!*"
2021-04-28 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,"""TA trends (e.g. head and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms) are just manifestations of the buy/sell equilibrium negotiations.""

Disagree"
2021-04-28 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,"I have an exact strat written out in my little notebook.

It looks something like this.

Buy a weekly put - set a profit target to sell half at a certain price point I see fit (im looking for levels of importance and resitance that change daily). I sell half if i hit that profit target and continually sell half with every swing (since for this strategy, im betting on swings away from the VWAP. I cut my final half-life'd option loose once it returns back to the vwap to guarantee a winning trade.

My stop loss is constant. I usually set it around 10 to 15%. If im wrong, im wrong. I want a quick win, dont want to twiddle my thumbs with a high theta contract all day

Edit: I forgot to mention I write out an equation to make sure I have an asymmetrical upside (of course WITH assumptions of my win rate and average profit %). Sticking to your plan and being disciplined is important for that function/equation to converge truly to the value you expect in the long run. If you make short term emotional decisions against that function/equation, you create outliers and risk losing it all."
2021-04-28 15:18:09,wallstreetbets,"Its not quite a money printing machine because there are many variables to consider:

-	Splunks fundamentals and price action could change
-	this could be due to current market conditions (probably likely)
-	many other middleman factors I cant think of right now

But it works, as does a few other strategies I have layed out. The tough part is stayin disciplined. Ive slipped before and averted the set-in-stone rules, and ate shit for that. Lessons learned"

Kudos to Nate Anderson of Hindenburg Research for another in-depth report on what appears to be a highly questionable company: [Clover Health (CLOV): How the ‚ÄúKing of SPACs‚Äù Lured Retail Investors Into a Broken Business Facing an Active, Undisclosed DOJ Investigation](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/). Excerpt:

>Today, we reveal how Clover Health and its Wall Street celebrity promoter, Chamath Palihapitiya, misled investors about critical aspects of Clover‚Äôs business in the run-up to the company‚Äôs SPAC go-public transaction last month.  
Our investigation into Clover Health has spanned almost four months and has included more than a dozen interviews with former employees, competitors, and industry experts, dozens of calls to doctor‚Äôs offices, and a review of thousands of pages of government reports, insurance filings, regulatory filings, and company marketing materials.  
Critically, Clover has not disclosed that its business model and its software offering, called the Clover Assistant, are under active investigation by the Department of Justice (‚ÄúDOJ‚Äù), which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kickbacks to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a Civil Investigative Demand (similar to a subpoena) we obtained.  
This Civil Investigative Demand and the corresponding investigation present a potential existential risk for a company that derives almost all of its revenue from Medicare, a government payor. Our research indicates that the investigation has merit.  
Clover claims that its best-in-class technology fuels its sales growth. We found that much of Clover‚Äôs sales are driven by a major undisclosed related party deal and misleading marketing targeting the elderly.  
These practices should not come as a surprise, given that in 2016, Clover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (‚ÄúCMS‚Äù). The fine was issued after Clover‚Äôs repeated failure to amend misleading statements about its plan offerings. A former employee told us the fine was so small it just emboldened Clover to push the envelope further."
2021-04-28 15:13:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't care. I'm shorting your company starting today, Chamath, and you can suck my dick about it."

If you have partial shares they won't transfer, ***only*** partial shares are sold off....then a week after a final sweep is conducted to collect any spare balances.

>Fidelity doesn‚Äôt engage in¬†payment for order flow (PFOF). This is the practice where a broker accepts payment from a market maker for letting that market maker execute the order. Rather than focus on these payments, Fidelity looks for quality trade executions and ensures that your orders are achieving price improvement on almost every trade. This is a very important point of differentiation for Fidelity as many of its competitors have seen PFOF revenue grow - likely at the price of better execution for their customers.

>Fidelity does not accept payment for order flow (PFOF), which results in cost savings for customers when placing stock trades. In fact, alongside Charles Schwab, Fidelity is the only broker to show customers the price improvement received on eligible orders.

Having a company uplist like this to bring more widespread attention to the potential benefits of these substances however is a huge win and one I'll be stoked to support while speculating with some extra $.
2021-04-28 16:50:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean they are using primarily mdma and lsd not shrooms. That would be more along the lines of NUMI here in Canada that is opening clinics and will be trying it as a way to treat various mental health and addiction conditions. 

But the world moves forward through capitalism it's just the reality. So if companies like MMED weren't taking the risks and putting in the time now to push this towards a recognized business sector, then we would be picking shrooms from cow shit and taking sketchy psychedelics that come out of a lab in China the rest of our lives."

2021-04-28 16:49:25,wallstreetbets,"This. You can't really patent something that grows on the ground, can you? If anything I was holding this stock long term because if psychedelics do get legalized the medical community is likely to take the research and expertise of companies that have been devoted to this cause for longer. They could be recommending MindMed strains, or MMED recommended therapies. Either way I know the power that a trip can have in grounding you to universal truths, overcoming fears and cleansing toxic mental structures so I'm all for more research and study into how we can maybe solve our worldly mental health psychosis crisis with compounds that have been around for us all along. Our stigmatization and years of racism-fuelled anti-drug propaganda is all that's standing in the way of a planetary mental revolution."

If you take a look at the earnings picture there are clearly big winners and losers and they‚Äôre divided into a few categories.

Losers: either missed earnings or if they beat the stock already had a significant run in 2021. (MSFT)

Winners: unexpected beat (UPS, GOOG,)
Or meeting expectations but the stock did not have good performance in 2021 yet (AMD).

Apple has a good chance to beat, but also did not yet run. Those are 2 positives I see going into earnings."

I mean HOLY SHIT your first sell off was in the middle of the trading day with nothing but green lighting the way!!! You saw one little drop of 0.72 and you freaked out.. you sold shortly after when it was on the rise again.. Thats why your second sell of $13 was slightly higher than the first.  AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT BUY AND THEN SELL OFF ON THE 23rd WAS ALL ABOUT but a THREE CENT DROP scared you off like that??? SHIT IT WAS ONLE IN THE $16's for minutes in the morning?????  

AND THEN HOLY FUCK OLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST..

(Keep in mind I see you are allowed After Hours Trading)

YOU WAITED UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND, AND THEN WATCHED ALL DAY MONDAY AS MVIS WAS LIFTING OFF WITH A $12 HIKE AND THEN INSTEAD OF USING YOUR RECENT $16.9k EARNINGS TO BUY BACK IN YOU DEPOSIT $50k AND TO TOP THAT OFF YOU WAITED UNTIL AFTER HOURS ON MONDAY WITH MICROVISION AT ITS PEEK FOR THE DAY AND WHILE KNOWING THE VOLITILITY ASSOCIATED YOU PURCHASED WITH MINUTES LEFT IN A.H. .. 

 First you got scared away from a .72 decrease and had two sells with the second sell being higher than the first, then another WEIRD sell after a .03 decrease for a few minutes WHILE the stock was rising.. BUT THEN AFTER a $9 LOSS and CRAZY ASS VOLITILITY you BECOME BRAVE ALL OF THE SUDDEN and make a $50k deposit, TO COVER WHAT BTW?? YOU didnt even buy back in with half your deposit and ONLY 4k more than your recent play... MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE.. and THEN you FINISHED OFF YOUR PLAY DURING AFTER HOURS... AND TO POUR SALT INTO THE WOUNDS, YOU FUCKING SOLD ALL OF IT!!! 

YOU MADE ALL THOSE MOVES AND TOOK ALL THAT RISK WITH THAT VOLUME AND VOLITILITY ( AGAIN WITH A FUCKING 50K DEPOSIT ) ALL TO MAKE A LOUSY $3-4k ???????????????????

YOU SAID YOU ARENT A GOOD DAY TRADER, THE LONG GAME IS FOR YOU, THAT THERES TO MUCH RISK!!

2021-04-28 12:29:19,wallstreetbets,"This is the way‚Ä¶ On stocks you know and understand. 

This one falls outside that circumference for me. The other 10 I currently hold I know intimately and use their products every day and fully understand the reasons why I bought them. MVIS is the first day trading I have done since the technology boom when I was in my 20s. Probably inspired by you retards. But after one week of it I remember why I got the fuck out of daytrading. It‚Äôs just not for me. And I played professional poker for a year and they are not fucking around when they say this is a casino. It is the same vibe. It is the same highs and lows. It is not for me. I buy long-term and companies I believe in and use. The trick is to get in early. For example I know many friends who use medical marijuana and I have been inside the Curaleaf dispensary many times and seen the way they run their operation, I‚Äôve tasted their products, :) and I just feel like I have a complete handle on their business. Got in at five and it‚Äôs been my greatest moneymaker for the last couple years. That‚Äôs how I like to do it. Pouncing on MVIS eight days ago after reading a great due diligence report it was one of the riskier moves I‚Äôve made in the last 20 years and I don‚Äôt plan to do it again unless another Ape blows me away with a report like that. 

Honestly I bought it at 11 thinking other people would feel the same way I would I was planning on eventually exiting at 18. When it blew up to 13 the very next day I took the gains. Then I completely man in my strategy and chased. Then I got crushed and had to cost average down. And then one today a crossed back over my threshold for gain I just took the money off the table and walked away. I just don‚Äôt have that in me anymore. And also I don‚Äôt find it to be as powerful as strategy as the one outlined above. But if I was a young Turk again I‚Äôd probably ride MVIS."

I'm in on MVIS at 10, and it goes to 20, and then drops to 13, sure, I feel a LITTLE bad I didn't sell, but I'm still up overall so I shrug and just keep living.  But if I chase and get in at 15, it runs to 20, then down to 12, I feel like 1000xs worse because I'm now in the red, vs. the guy who got in early and is still bothered, but doesn't feel like dogshit.

Entrance price is everything for a long-term play.  So much easier to deal with the highs and lows.  If I was long on MVIS I would have held after buying in at 11, but my whole point was to see if I could predict the stock that WSB would move on, because I personally felt something powerful when reading a certain piece of DD, and I was pretty sure anyone else reading it would too.  So in a sense, I was playing the Apes, not the stock."
2021-04-28 11:52:13,wallstreetbets,Lol It reads a lot funnier than it is. It was actually the first part of my pay out of my yearly salary and it just happened to come right at that moment. But yes it certainly looks like a mad scramble to pour money into a double down. LOL
2021-04-28 13:06:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol, wtf do yo think I posted it for, to brag???  It's a fucking adventure, a story, a trip, filled with positives and negatives. 

Honestly you sound a bit clueless trying to give 20/20 hindsight stock advice.  Anybody who does that sounds like a Monday morning quarterback from the armchair to me, as if you've never been in the weeds or at the center of a stock storm in your life. Where your heart is pounding for 7 days straight, where you are glued to the ticker, where you are buying and selling and cost averaging down all on instinct, DD, and sheer balls and an idiotic smooth brain.  Where you've lost 10K and then pulled it back seemingly out of your ass. All of that. THAT is day trading.  Your talking to an old timer.  I executed more trades in my 20s in 1 year than I have done cumulatively in 2 decades since then.  Anybody with some history in the game would absolutely fucking love what I did here, it's filled with brilliance, and complete fuck ups, just like life.  And in the end I came out ahead 3K over the course of 1 week.  I'll take it.

I don't disagree with buying and holding, that's my main strategy.  But if you wanna day trade, and you look at the above and go, ""Pfffft... you shoulda just held,' then guess what, bro?

Day trading ain't for you either."

Also looks like I may have timed the peak just right today, which would be a first for this slow ape."
2021-04-28 12:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Ha that was fantastic, thanks!"
2021-04-28 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,"That's the wrong question. 

The question is, when is the next buy-in that intersects with YOUR personal goals on the trade?

If the goal is a day-trade quick hit, I wouldn't go near it at 23 right now price-wise; and I wouldn't go near it time-wise with Earnings tomorrow.

If the goal is a potential long-term ticket to the moon, I'd watch like a fucking hawk tomorrow and start buying if/when the street reacts positively.  If they like the news tomorrow, I don't see it tanking anytime soon.  Just get in early after the earnings (if they are good).   If it tanks after earnings on bad news,, then quite obviously buy in on the dip... I like it at 18. 

But again, do you know what they do?  For a long-term ticket to the moon, you better know exactly what company you're buying and why you like them.

I sold a bunch of shit recently and bought google because I'm obsessed with YouTube's STILL potential.  Today it popped 5%.  Fuckin' Google!  

There are lots of ways to get to the moon.  Some rockets take a few days, some a few months, and some many many years.  

To the moon.... isn't usually followed by, ""Right fuckin' now!""

It's a destination, not a time frame.  I'm literally the biggest buy and hold guy there is.  Why I got involved with MVIS I have no idea (well, I do, it was that amazing piece of DD I read on here), but my moves should show you how fucking nerve-wracked and jittery I was.  If that's you?  Stay the fuck out of day trading, and move on from MVIS to a company you know and use, like a Google, a Costco, even an AirBNB or Snapchat if that's you.  You'll get that ticket to the moon.  Just on a slower ship."

2021-04-28 12:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Ha!  My sentiments are so exactly similar to yours.  I think this is a fun ride to enjoy.  Worst case I will exercise the options into shares if they‚Äôre still ITM in a few months.  No way on short term calls but I bought in with $11 calls when the stock was at $19 so there is headroom to move into the shares for tax or strategic reasons.  MVIS is a fun one.  In 2000 I learned from Com21 to be scared today..  (yeah cable modems, cool! Was my downfall).  But after the crash the AAPL shares I got in exchanged post crash are worth well over $200k now.  Kids gotta think long them because getting rich is more likely with patience and knowing what customers will love forever.

If you check one of the posts I made a couple days ago where I complement the person whose report I read, in the comment section people linked to the report I was talking about and one other that are very impressive. You can find them there.

Again I know very little about this company but was completely inspired by that DD report someone wrote up about eight days ago that convinced me to make a move on it. Next thing you know the stocks on some crazy fucking rush. I took some early earnings as you can see but then missed the ride from 13 to 23. Could had 20 K only had 3K but I‚Äôm happy. From what I understand other people are saying, earnings are obviously not gonna be that impressive as this company still doesn‚Äôt make much money but the idea is that far more important than earnings tomorrow is introduction of their best in class technology and possibly potential of a buyout from Microsoft.Just wanted you to know that you are on the cusp of the earnings release as I usually fucking hate buying into stocks b4 earnings and always kick myself when I find out too late there‚Äôs an earnings report just a few days after I purchase. You could make a fortune you could get hurt or honestly market might not react at all because everything‚Äôs already baked in.

Lol I comment along the lines of your point and you post that you are confused

You paper handed everytime it went up and then bought back in. I say ouch. What is not to understand

So congrats on your $3k. Overall nice, but don't tell me you aren't kicking yourself captain paperhand"
2021-04-28 15:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, take care"
2021-04-28 13:41:04,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but definitely not an 'ouchable' offense.

Also  we quite clearly disagree with what paper-hands means.  Paper handing it has a far lesser role in day trading.  The term was meant for long-term  plays, i.e., don't get paper hands and abandoning a stock you like just because of rough waters.

That is NOT what happened here, anywhere along the way.

In fact, I'd argue you can't paper hand a day trade. Literally, the point is to sell within a short span. I was never long on MVIS.  So I think you are using the term wrongly. 

Here's a walk through of the above trades, for anyone interested: 

1) I read a DD that blows my mind, and think, ""Fuck, if I feel this way, maybe others will read, and jump on board.""  I wake up the next day and the stock is off to the races.  I jump in late but get on. 

2)  Within 24 hours, I'm up 16% on this flyer.... $1700 in 24 hours.  Now, if this was a long-term diamond hand, sure, I'm not budging.  But this play was ALWAYS about selling once I get a decent return.  That's where, with all due respect, anyone who can't recognize the value of $1700 in 24 hours honestly is a chump and a bag holder.  It's akin to 5,840% on the year.  If you don't learn how to take a $1700 gain off the table in 24 hours, you're fucking toast in this game.  You NEED these micro-trade gains to withstand rough waters in your long positions.  I stand behind this move 1000%.

3) Now, comes the problem.  I'm at a guys weekend that we look forward to all year; we are drinking and talking about the stock, and I'm watching it climb and climb. So I excuse myself to an upstairs room, filled with booze and other things, and I jump back in at 16.6.  A bit of a chase, but I'm fine with the move.  

4)  Here comes the really interesting part.  The life part.  As I""m sitting there, watching it sink from 16 down to 14, evaporating my $1700 gain, I start to feel nauseous.  WTF am I doing?  There were still 2 days left in my guys weekend, and I was upstairs hovered over a keyboard like a fucking loner loser.  It dawns on me that if I stick with this stock, I'm literally going to be a ghost, a shell of myself, all weekend, as I sweat and panic MVIS, while all my friends are playing guitars, drinking, socializing, etc.  So as soon as it climbs back up to breakeven or so, I bail.  Literally just 15 minutes later.  That's why you see that anomaly there. And I stand by this move too.  I chose 3 days with my buds over stalking the stock.  But that's something you can only learn as you live life: what price do you put on your experiences?  In this day and age, a social weekend with my best buds is invaluable, and I wasn't going to ruin it by checking out and stalking the ticker all weekend.  So I sell and enjoy the weekend.  I like the move.  I have my $1700 still. 

5)  On Monday, as it flies up to 28, I'm definitely kicking myself, and out comes my absolute worst move in the chain.  I start thinking moon rocket, and I don't want to miss it.  Sign me up.  Buy in at like 29, and watch it plummet.  I will take all shit for this trade.

6) Down to 19, I can either take my bruises and walk away down 6k or so, or I can cost average down to about 23.  This decision took a long time, and I can't get into the reasons I decided to do it, as it comes down a myriad of personal factors.  But I did and purchased another 700.

7) Yesterday it shows signs of dying, just trickling around, and all day long, I contemplate exiting the position and wiping my hands clean of MVIS.  But again, a series of signs and instinct tell me one more day.  If you owned MVIS and you weren't fucking shitting your pants about what might happen today, you are lying.  Today was EASILY the day to 'paper-hand' it in your words, and a quick scan at WSB will show you many people who were in my exact position who bailed and took the loss.  I didn't.  All day yesterday I dug deep for an iron stomach, and held, and when I woke up today, I set up my phone and strapped in for a long day of watching. 

8)  Today at many points along the way, I could have bailed, and reduced losses from 6k to 4k to 2k etc.  I didn't flinch.  I waited.  Cashed out about +$1300. 

You can wipe your ass with your paper hands."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MVIS Straddle Play Before Earnings? 
It seems like people are expecting some kind of announcement/ earnings beat from Microvision $MVIS this time around, following the [March 2021 announcement of Microsoft winning a 21.8 billion dollar contract with the Army for the HoloLens.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

It is rumored that this is a big win for MVIS, since they might make some of the components for the HoloLens, or at least may be licensing the ip.  

I have read some of the DD posts by others on this and wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced. There is no mention of the HoloLens or Microsoft explicitly on the MVIS investor relations, However I did find the following:

Quotes from MVIS recent 10k for Q4 from Dec 2020:
‚Äúwe have developed micro-display concepts and designs that could be utilized in head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) headsets and have developed a 1440i MEMS module that can support augmented reality headsets.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn 2019, our revenue was derived from the sale of components, from development contracts, and from royalty fees for LBS (laser beam scanning) technology. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for a well-known customer under a development agreement. The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low. Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020, we earned a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped, with amounts applied against the prepayment that we had previously received from the customer until the prepayment is exhausted. The value of the royalty is approximately equal to the amount of gross profit we would have earned if we continued to produce and ship the components. We believe this arrangement will help us conserve cash, and still preserves our ability to experience financial benefits should the volume of components increase in the future.‚Äù

MVIS has had very little revenue, has never reported a profit, has negative operating cash flow and negative operating income, and until recently was trading at about a couple dollars or less per share for many years. 

Current stock price is about 20 dollars, and I think it will either be a bust or a blowout very soon, but I am really not sure which. All depends on earnings report and call.

Has anyone here ever done a straddle play where you buy equal amounts calls and puts for a near term expiration in expectation of a significant stock price move in either direction?

Anyone think MVIS this is the right application for a long options straddle?

*Update 4/29/2021: I did not make any play, and instead decided to stick this one out. MVIS announced they are [making progress with their lidar tech for autonomous driving](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-completion-its-long-range-lidar-sensor) on April 28, 2021. Therefore, I figured that even if they don't show any profit on their earnings on April 29 and make no mention of a buyout by Microsoft or anything about the HoloLens, their increased share price may be buoyed by new investor sentiment on the prospects for this lidar. If the stock price doesn't move enough, obviously I would take a loss on a long straddle, and I am not sure that it necessarily will since they did at least have some good news to report and there is of course still the potential that they are involved in the Microsoft-Army contract deal. Maybe they will make some announcement regarding a buyout or something in the future, but nothing was said about it on the earnings call, so for now it seems like speculation and too dangerous for me to participate in either on the bullish or bearish end (though I would lean towards bearish right now.

I did listen to the earnings call and read the earnings report, and I am unimpressed, but you should do your own DD and obviously come up with your own conclusions. Feel free to correct me on anything!

Good luck"

2021-04-28 11:35:42,wallstreetbets,Personally I think the options are too expensive. I would not try to do a straddle. The demand for options right now is ridiculous so premiums are very high. It would take a huge move one way or another to make money and they announced lidar prototype today so I do not know how big of a move there will be. Go $mvis

2021-04-28 12:46:48,wallstreetbets,Where can I buy it ?
2021-04-28 11:27:06,wallstreetbets,"IMHO a straddle is a great play, but do not enter a long straddle when IV is through the roof.  If you enter an ATM straddle you are delta neutral, long gamma, long vega, i.e. a huge portion of your P/L is IV.  If it consolidates sometime today and IV cools off fire away, I know I will be!"
2021-04-28 11:17:48,wallstreetbets,Super level headed play vs. a lot of the roaring bullishness you‚Äôre hearing around here. Problem is I feel like premiums are priced so high. Just eyeballing it rn looks like breakeven is under 13 / over 37 on at 25 strike. But if you think it really is all or nothing I guess it‚Äôs not inconceivable that it pushes out of those.
2021-04-28 11:18:31,wallstreetbets,Up up then bidding war.  Then up up. And then buyout announced and then up up up up up
2021-04-28 12:53:10,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt expect big numbers on this call.  The Ivas devices wouldn‚Äôt have shipped yet and the lidar module was just announced complete ( a sample ).  Next quarter I‚Äôd expect better financials.  The company is fine money / cash flow wise.
2021-04-28 12:55:51,wallstreetbets,All I have to say is look at the BOD additions and who they are in the industry.  Also Seval Oz has not had a form 3/4 filed which is a SEC violation.  It may have been filed confidentially.

2021-04-28 13:23:40,wallstreetbets,I bought some 5/21 $10 puts but the price is so volatile that they barely move even when the price jumps up or down 20%.
2021-04-28 14:32:08,wallstreetbets,It's name was $GME
2021-04-28 13:11:57,wallstreetbets,"> All depends on earnings report and call.

I'm not sure this is true for long plays since the company is clearly going to be angling for buyout or boom from successful tech.

As you mention, the earnings call is almost certainly going to be substantially less optimistic than their press release this morning, but the more interesting development will be whether a major customer picks up their demo tech as a production line... That could take a while."
2021-04-28 13:38:16,wallstreetbets,Opened 16 5/21 straddle last Friday for 7.34 total premium. Have already sold the call yesterday. Going to add some shares after the ER.

2021-04-28 19:21:55,wallstreetbets,"I think they got no money yet, just big deal with MSFT.  Maybe they have another deal to announce. Could be anything by... automotive?"
2021-04-28 11:10:40,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-04-28 11:25:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I watched that when I was looking through the DD. Why does MicroVision not mention anything about the HoloLens though? You‚Äôd think they should be able to disclose partnerships as well, but no mention of Microsoft explicitly. I get it tho. They are definitely alluding to a big player in their earnings report and they most likely do make components in the HoloLens just based off the 10-K and the YouTube vid revealing it. I‚Äôm a skeptic tho, and people have pulled more elaborate scams in the past. Straddle seems like a good option vs going all in on one direction if it turns out to somehow not be true."

2021-04-28 11:40:49,wallstreetbets,"It's an NDA thing. Neither party will outright state it for some reason, but MVIS CEO did at one point comment on having seen that video and essentially... not denying that does seem to be their tech ;)

It'll come out eventually, or at least be further alluded to via tomorrow's EC? They are making money off HL2, after all..."
2021-04-28 12:54:13,wallstreetbets,SS confirmed the video is legit and that is their part.  Neither MViS nor msft will talk publicly about it.
2021-04-28 11:52:51,wallstreetbets,"When MVIS has been on a red hot run IV hits 250% pretty easily.  I don't remember what ATM IV was like yesterday afternoon when things slowed down but I want to say 210% give or take?  Even at 200% a straddle will get crushed if excitement dies down, there's no big news event, and the price slowly bleeds out.

Edit: Looking at May 21 options\*"
2021-04-28 15:29:37,wallstreetbets,So if ya have 25k np other wise you can be screwed nice
2021-04-28 13:36:26,wallstreetbets,"I have to sign NDAs in my business, and I'm at the bottom of the PR chain. Gauranteed there's an NDA in the contractor agreement."
2021-04-28 12:14:40,wallstreetbets,"It is also possible that their partnership is with a different company and involves their lidar for automotive purposes. This could still move the needle on this stock, but isn't what people are expecting.

See other quotes from their recent 10k: "" We are developing our 1st generation lidar sensor, which we call Long Range Lidar (LRL), for OEM and Tier-1 automotive suppliers to be incorporated into automotive active collision avoidance systems and autonomous driving vehicles. This product will also be targeted for sales to technology companies focused on Mobility as a Service (MaaS). MaaS customers are currently major users of automotive lidar sensors."" 

 ""We plan to focus on increasing the value of the Company by completing development of our 1st Generation LRL module to a level that it would be ready to scale in the market. We believe our technology and designs for automotive lidar can be successful in the market, and our solutions will have features and performance that exceed market needs and competitive products and will provide us several sustainable strategic advantages in the market.  """
2021-04-28 12:33:27,wallstreetbets,"They haven't sold any LRL units yet and didn't even have it developed until this year so the sales to the '2017 customer' wouldn't be for that. They also have sold handheld projectors and mobile phone projector units, and they have a consumer LiDAR division, but they've never been shy about discussing their customers/partners on those products (but aren't currently selling any). They had a $100M contract lined up with a big 'Tier 1' tech company last year for an interactive smart speaker that got cancelled when COVID hit. They were also under an NDA for that but everyone thinks it was Amazon.

I can't recall if they've ever come out and said that the current revenue is from the AR division, but the teardown confirms they have parts in the HL2 and the timelines match up and Microsoft is a 'well-known' customer. Both the MVIS CEO and the head of the Hololens project (Alex Kipman) have awkwardly danced around the subject whenever they're asked about it so it's obvious there are NDAs.

However, it doesn't mean MVIS is directly contracted with MSFT. It could be a contract with a manufacturer (STM or Micron, as they also manufacture parts for the HL2) who then contracts with MSFT. Not sure that really makes a difference? It's definitely not for automotive LiDAR, though.

I've also been considering a straddle play around this earnings call. I'm not sure what investors are expecting after this morning's announcement. I highly doubt a buyout will be announced today or tomorrow and they already dropped the PR everyone was waiting for. I could see it dropping if nothing big happens. Or going to the moon if they surprise us somehow by updating revenue guidance to include IVAS production.

EDIT: Shit's expensive, not sure a straddle is good value and not sure any sort of strangle is, either. Looking at collars on my shares, though..."
2021-04-28 13:15:53,wallstreetbets,"So the initial thought was the sample A pr would tomorrow with the EC since they moved the EC up to tomorrow AH.  This was thought Bc they announced they should be complete with the A sample in April and no news came until today.   SS is smart and knows what he‚Äôs doing. I don‚Äôt think they would announce the A sample today without anything to show tomorrow during EC. If EC wasn‚Äôt very good, why not have the A sample update in their to mitigate the damage of a bad EC.  By announcing earlier it leads me to believe they have more PR"
2021-04-28 16:37:42,wallstreetbets,"I bought a few may puts today after lidar news. Really nothing stopping the inevitable post-ER dump unless SS has some huge news.. either way I figured hedging would be a safer bet

Edit: you‚Äôre right though.. premiums have been insane."
2021-04-28 13:46:02,wallstreetbets,"I think otherwise, mainly because I become more pessimistic more I love the company to control my expectations/emotions. SS announced sample A so it gets the full attention it deserves. EC is gonna be just meh or doesn't meet the expectation, then the call would end with same ol' hints about 'the bright future but can't tell you anything atm'. I'd like to be proven wrong, but we'll see."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MindMed ($MNMD) CEO on going public: ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, people make markets.‚Äù [Interview with Mindmed CEO](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mindmed-ceo-going-public-allocate-184100037.html)

Some takeaway from the interview:

‚ÄúSo big debut on the NASDAQ today, but I'm looking at the stock and it's down 26%. So take us through what's going in your mind right now?‚Äù

JR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we're going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn't just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?

And how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we're not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.

And so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.

‚ÄúYou mentioned your investor base-- you've got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you're also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what's your take on what you're seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?‚Äù

JR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.

I think it's great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We're very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there's been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets. And it's great to have the people behind us."

2021-04-28 15:58:00,wallstreetbets,"So yeah, I tapered down REAL slow and low because I'd been on them consistently this time for 3yrs and before that it'd been a decade (minus jail stints, a rehab here or there) since I'd been off opiates. I decided last year to lower my dose and just didn't stop lowering it every couple weeks. By then end I was cutting a 4mg into 16 even pieces, .25 roughly per day. I felt worse when I went from 2mg to 1mg than I did jumping off last month. I strolled in for my 90 day appointment and my doc was so damn proud (he's also a cannabis doc an I believe genuinely wanted to see me succeed) but I know that's the minority experience. Congrats on your time, keep it going üíØü§ô"
2021-04-28 16:34:20,wallstreetbets,"I actually encountered this problem when I laid down my bike 2yrs ago. I regained consciousness as they were putting me in the ambulance, and the first thing I mentioned was that opioids were off the table. I suggested (manipulated?) they could push a mg of ativan, which helped tremendously with the adrenaline and shock of it all. Collarbone broken in two places (rebreaks of my two previous) and they said I needed hardware put in, well I didn't have insurance so I bought an immobilizing sling and took the ibuprofen 800s, and I'd say I have 95% range of motion today. It only clicks sometimes lol

You absolutely can get off subs when you feel confident and ready, and if you go down low enough and slow enough it's really not as bad as you might imagine. One foot in front of the other, even after a misstep üíØü§ô"
2021-04-28 15:59:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes, very slow and very low. I was taking .25mg a day roughly when I freefell. It's doable, it just takes the commitment. Work keeps me hella busy so that helps"

2021-04-28 17:56:22,wallstreetbets,No worries. We all start somewhere and no one knows it all. Questions are good! It was already public. It was just on the OTC exchange. Not all brokers support OTC transactions. It's kind of like the wild west...not as many regulations and it's pretty volatile. They uplisted to the NASDAQ (which is different than an IPO). I have TD Ameritrade and they support OTC transactions. Hope this answers your question.

Good shit my dude, I'm proud of you too. We can do it, it's almost easy feeling in hindsight. Why chase that high when we can chase these Tendies?"
2021-04-28 17:39:30,wallstreetbets,"That must've been a bad time. I actually stopped riding bikes for this exact reason, also I have two titanium rods running the full length of my spine and I worry if i got jacked back enough what would happen to that hardware. But I'm building an MR2 I'd like to race one day and a roll cage isn't gonna protect me from every potential wreck. You're right I can do it I just need the discipline, I kicked harder stuff but Sub has the nasty effect of not getting me high like regular opiates and seemingly just gives me a little relief from the pain I live with but it's deceptive in that way because it just becomes a habit as well and you have to live with the anxiety of knowing you'd be in a very bad way if you ever got seriously hurt. The two week half life on it is a bitch. I need to quit drinking too, a medicine that would break down the reward pathways in the brain would be amazing. I do use psilocybin a couple times a year but it's easy to fall back into old habits after a single experience."
2021-04-28 16:15:42,wallstreetbets,Awesome thanks for the info and congratulations
2021-04-28 17:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Can you say how long in between steps down you went?  I‚Äôm literally dreading going off them but I hate being on them.  Like when you initially decided to taper, to the point you jumped off, how long was the total process for you?

Congrats by the way that‚Äôs awesome."

keep it moving forward, we're stronger together üòÅ"
2021-04-28 18:55:32,wallstreetbets,"What really prompted me to get off them, other than the price, was having to keep count of them/get them refilled/carry outrageous insurance to help pay for them. I have always been in favor of psychedelics, though now rounding into 30 I find I have far less time and interest to be worth setting aside most of a day to trip. I've done lsd with my wife twice, once the first year we were off the shit (we met in detox, just another time I defied statistics lmfao) and once the 2nd year. We both agree the 1st time was more enjoyable and also more beneficial for whatever reason, and she hasn't showed interest since the 2nd time. When my anxiety gets super bad I do a baseline dose of ketamine but that's been twice in 3yrs. It was just a lot of trial and error my last couple years running, wanting to change but figuring out what worked for me. Everything just fell into place when it needed to. 

Doing a slow taper will minimize symptoms, and then it's just a matter of hanging tough."
2021-04-28 18:21:23,wallstreetbets,"I also need to add, while I don't work any steps traditionally or attend meetings, I did change a MASSIVE amount about my personal life in the last e years, and have a good deal of support and encouragement from my wife, family, and friends. I just knew it was time, and while I never want to discourage someone from coming off, I personally have felt the consequences of coming off before I was ready. I spent a decade running, and then one day I was just done. Everybody's day comes, we just gotta make it till then."
2021-04-28 18:17:43,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, looking back I think the hardest part was the worrying. Around a year ago, maybe a bit less I just started cutting my 8mgs in half, as I'd done that dose a few years before with success but had went back out pretty quickly. It was an adjustment but really nothing major physically. Emotionally I believe it can range, but I stayed busy with work and stayed occupied at home, that helped for me. After if say 2 months on 4mg, I went to 2mg. This was a bit rougher, and I'd suggest dropping by 1mg increments. This was the worst drop I went thru, I strongly recommend 1mg at a time. I felt shitty for around 2 weeks. After if felt better on 2mg for 2 weeks or so, I dropped to 1mg and it wasn't as bad as 4mg to 2mg. After 1mg I started dropping .25 every two weeks, steadily, until I was down to .25 which I hovered on for about a month, apprehensive and worried. And then I decided to drop, and it was 2 rough days physically and a lil bit emotionally, but I smoke a ton of weed and I'd say that was definitely a big part in managing symptoms.

Tldr; Drop 1mg every 2 weeks (or when you've rebounded from last drop). Try to keep yourself to a schedule, but don't get stressed about it either. Rely on/talk to the homies about it, apes strong together. You can message me if you're ever going thru it, too. I may not get it right away but I'll reply when I see it. Most importantly, you can do this üíØ"

2021-04-28 12:31:37,wallstreetbets,"BB & NOK are solid plays if you're bullish on IoT as a concept. As a pretty high-level tl;dr, one supplies the necessary physical infrastructure (where one of two main competitors is becoming persona non grata). The other provides the cybersecurity aspect, as well as operating and soon data collection software for manufactured devices, and doesn't really have a direct competitor in that respect.

IMO, NOK $5 leaps for 2023 and BB15/20 on the same timeline is the way. Plus stock."
2021-04-28 18:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. Blackberry got caught up in the GME and AMC thing, but it really is a solid company with a bright future. It's not a quick flip and your weeklies will expire worthless for the next 2 years, but it's a solid value pick for a portfolio.


Which obviously means it's completely inappropriate for anyone on WSB, but that's irrelevant."
2021-04-28 15:16:24,wallstreetbets,My first criteria for even thinking about BB as a play was a management team shake up. It was criminal how little money they were making on their products.
2021-04-28 16:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Can we leave off the gains for a bit and trade sideways? I'm selling covered weekly calls, and today has put me in squeaky-bum mode as we flirt with my 9.50s. Just... Let it rise niiiiiiccccceeeee and sloooooowwwwww :p"

2021-04-28 13:07:58,wallstreetbets,Yes agreed. Shares and long calls in BlackBerry for me. Adding more Friday as well
2021-04-28 14:23:32,wallstreetbets,"Why is a Nokia a solid play? They are competing with Dell, Cisco, Ericsson, Verizon, Samsung, Huawei; even other companies you wouldn't think about telecommunications have their own hardware as well such as Facebook and Google.

Nokia also has a massive amount of fucking shares. They need extremely large movements in order to raise the stock price. Movements like being the first to market in 6g (or whatever the fucked up name is for the next iteration) not being a mid player in a oversaturated market..

As for BB (and I say this as a recently dumped bagholder, still have my Jan 2023 15C leaps), they have done nothing to proven they know how to pivot to a SaaS company. You mention cybersecurity... every company is selling cybersecurity services for IoT. Go on the AWS market place and you can choose from hundreds of SMEs as consultants:

https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-type=*all&awsf.Filter%20Name%3A%20partner-solutions-filter-partner-categories=*all&awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-location=*all#Consulting_Partners

don't want services, what about products?

https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/security

Literally click any box and you'll see dozens of services overall.

Just because BB put up a shite product on the AWS Marketplace doesn't mean much, I can do the same thing after paying some fees as well. It's equivalent to the app store.

This is also just one ecosystem, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, etc all have equivalents.

What about direct companies? Companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, Zscaler, FireEye, Proofpoint.

BB is terrible about productization. There's a reason why talent is flocking to companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Oracle, Netflix, etc; because BB is a dead-end.

They have to do a lot, they don't need a management shakeup; they need a shakeup in their board and executive team. I don't see that happening, so unless they give their management the go-ahead to make and experience many possible sources of revenue they will continue to falter behind."
2021-04-28 15:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Understood. I‚Äôm glad Chen went ahead and brought these guys like Ericsson in to run these branches of the company especially as it relates to cyber security. Perhaps they will also take over earnings calls, marketing and general transparency with share holders, as I know many have been frustrated with Chen‚Äôs lack of communication to this point.

As for competitors in cybersecurity, that's a fact that Cylance can't match CrowdStrike and zScaler functionality(expecting merger of both), but with increasing market it doesn't mean that there will be monopoly of single company. We've used Cylance in one of the very well known financial institution in US and the product is definitely not bottom of the barrel."

2021-04-28 19:06:41,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say I made one autist, I said it's not hard to be ""partnered"" with AWS. They have thousands of partners, it's why the AWS moat is so massive compared to Azure or GCP. You can find companies that never made a series A become integrated in AWS products [1]. It benefits Amazon more so than the companies they integrate with. It's how they keep people on their platform, it becomes easy to switch services but harder to move away from AWS.

Here's the security marketplace of AWS, 1000 different products. Have at it, I'm sure you'll find several dozen ""firewall""/""anti-virus"" garbage in there to tickle your fancy:

https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search?category=0625e4fd-88dd-4dd9-9e57-4a0461f97fb4

As for cyber security solutions, what exactly do you want? Do you want to analyze events through an observability platform? There's Amazon Detective:

https://aws.amazon.com/detective/

Do you want something equivalent to vpn or antivirus software? Well yeah, you got me they don't have a similar solution; but a dozen others companies do you even named some do you serious want a list of competitors? Cybersecurity is more than making sure Dan from accounting doesn't download the next Violet Meyers bukkake video on the company dell.

I'm sorry dude, but exclusive deals aren't enough if you want them to shoot up from $6-10 per share to $30 and beyond. They need monopolistic deals. Why do you think Facebook has a retarded valuation? Because if you're a small/med business you're buying ads on their because it becomes the price of business. BB needs similar monopolistic moves. They are taking way too long to actually differentiate themselves in their markets.

We're talking about a company that failed to ride the retarded tech valuations from 2010 to present day. That is a failure of a company. Putting more executives in charge of various orgs, isn't going to remedy it. They need to clean house and really put forward a view that they know how to create products because all they've done is stagnate and put a large bet on IVY.

[1] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/running-end-to-end-cypress-tests-for-your-fullstack-ci-cd-deployment-with-amplify-console/

Also fuck off dude, what ""views"" have you made? They made a few deals, big fucking deal. Do you want me to suck off Chen? Thousands of public companies make deals all the time, they need to do MORE and prove that they can get something besides a few token companies and a country whose CS needs rivals those of a med sized Target.

They only flew because they were a meme stock and a bunch of morons that don't understand software engineering or development eats up their marketing shit bowls as fact."

Alternatively, you could invest your $18600 at around $10, and when it hits $30 your holdings would be worth $55,800. So really, this is a bad move."

Buy 100 of those. Then if they don't hit buy another 100 the next month out. You basically prepaid several months when next month those same 9/18 $25 calls might be worth $0.75 each or less.

2021-04-28 11:56:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just trying to have a rational conversation here as I also too have call options . AMC said no to 500 mil share dilution . Fine . Said they will sell 50 mil for cash flow . What‚Äôs stopping them from allowing the hedge fund to buy all of those to cover their shorts . They could either bribe the AMC board to get them directly . Or open market hedge funds have their computer servers directly next to the NYSE which allows them to transact faster and buy the shares before anyone else . I‚Äôm just asking because it seems like what happened was the perfect conspiracy to make everyone happy their was no dilution while maybe allowing the hedge funds to cover . This allows hedge funds to get off cheap and amc doesn‚Äôt lose retail interest. I wouldn‚Äôt put the amc board past a bribe and even if it‚Äôs open market offering hedge funds and buy them to cover shorts before anyone else gets a chance .

POLAR returns for their first show of the new year with a fresh new direction and outlook on their upcoming plans. The team will shift their focus onto the unique and diverse tastes of their residents to push forward their nights. Where Blixa, Tia Cousins and James Joyce will each get a crack at regularly curating their own line-ups hosting their favourite local heroes and grassroots talent alongside a star of their choice. Ensuring our events will represent a wide range of sounds and always remain different.

So to kick off this new venture, for our inaugural event, our trio of residents has each invited an artist of their choice to go toe to toe with them for our first dance back. Welcoming old friends Craigie Knowes and new guests Sofie K and Michelle Manetti to The Cause's sister venue Grow Tottenham.

2021-04-28 13:11:00,wallstreetbets,Big yikes here. Difference between yoloing and straight up burning money. Might as well throw this into a penny stock and hope to win huge.
2021-04-28 13:14:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if it reaches 100 this guys rich üòÇ
2021-04-28 16:46:31,wallstreetbets,There's a zero % chance he thought this through to even this basic level.
2021-04-28 13:15:06,wallstreetbets,Hmm i don‚Äôt think this is accurate. Your 41400 number really only accounts for intrinsic value and not extrinsic value
2021-04-28 14:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Options are more about leverage.  I do not think someone should have put their life savings into it.  But, it is good leverage.  But, I think I would agree his life savings would have been better placed just in shares.  With some money in options.

But, some people are pointing out that his battery level is at the bottom but it's color is yellow.  Which seems out of place."
2021-04-28 16:05:41,wallstreetbets,but short squeeze just like GME ü§£ü§£
2021-04-28 13:36:36,wallstreetbets,"I dont think you can accurately calculate IV. 

If AMC does get to those price points then more than likely IV will be high. So his contracts will cost more. I mean we saw IV go to 800%+ and contracts being expensive so it can happen. 

Regardless its still a questionable play."
2021-04-28 17:58:59,wallstreetbets,"If AMC takes off 3 weeks from now and against all odds reaches $26.55, he will likely be up 10x, perhaps more, as the premium for 6/21s will go through the roof.  The 9/17s maybe not as much, but would likely likely be up a good 5x."
2021-04-28 14:48:09,wallstreetbets,theres no way amc breaks 19 short of at least 2022
2021-04-28 12:24:21,wallstreetbets,Obviously not in this play for amc at 25-30 bucks.
2021-04-28 15:04:12,wallstreetbets,And it doesn't even help the stock go up and he has 0 collateral to execute
2021-04-28 17:22:04,wallstreetbets,Math is hard tho
2021-04-28 18:18:31,wallstreetbets,hahaha safe to say they didn't do any math before making the move.
2021-04-28 18:28:13,wallstreetbets,But wouldn‚Äôt he be worth millions of the squeeze happens that we‚Äôre all betting on
2021-04-28 19:04:34,wallstreetbets,"pffffff math whatever, but i bet your shoes dont have velcro straps"
2021-04-28 19:43:22,wallstreetbets,30 isn‚Äôt the goal for a squeeze...
2021-04-28 16:53:35,wallstreetbets,Not really. AMC hater. If it squeezes guy will be mucho rich.
2021-04-28 11:34:08,wallstreetbets,"OTM delta ratios are far better than ITM ratios.

This is assuming the OP is going to sell the contracts. Which a reasonable person would do. But this is WSB."
2021-04-28 11:22:01,wallstreetbets,Because this is a Casino.
2021-04-28 11:40:57,wallstreetbets,Because he bought into the ‚Äú100k!‚Äù train and didnt realize he was being manipulated
2021-04-28 13:13:42,wallstreetbets,"This might be his only option. With the same advice, he should sell the calls and then buy shares lol. Would be more reliable overall."
2021-04-28 11:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Truly hope it does for him, but there's a .14 spread between bid and ask.  Maybe he'll get lucky with people interested..."

2021-04-28 15:17:49,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino.
2021-04-28 16:28:04,wallstreetbets,Buy ITM or ATM calls that expire a year out and sell weeklies. I've been making a killing on this. Way more than I did off the shares alone.
2021-04-28 19:38:42,wallstreetbets,"OP, might want to take this guys advice. He just admitted that acquiring $1,000 to sell covered AMC calls is a pipe dream for him."

2021-04-28 17:45:29,wallstreetbets,"It needs to get to 26.55 for him to break even (if he intends to hold and exercise) Every dollar it goes above that, he makes 100 on each contract, and he has 120 of them. So if it hits $30 he‚Äôll make about 41k by my maths. If it fails to break 25 by the end of the contract he loses the entire investment."
2021-04-28 16:11:35,wallstreetbets,"If AMC hit 25$ on September 17th just before these expired, he would lose 17000$, the entire option premiums he paid.

If it hit 25$ tomorrow he would make decent amounts of money due to the time premium people pay for options.

And we all know what happened with GME...

I guess my point is logic doesn't come to play a lot of times in market values right now.  With all the attention AMC has there is a chance this could actually pay off for him.

But yeah, this is fucking stupid as hell. Don't bet money you can't afford to lose."
2021-04-28 10:34:56,wallstreetbets,They were on decline before covid struggling around 10 a share iirc.... idk how people think that suddenly they will start doing double that with everything going digital

2018: 5.5b sales with 110m profit  
2019: 5.4b sales with 148m loss

2021-04-28 16:05:22,wallstreetbets,Sept 17th $20 calls were cheap. I picked up 1 for $119 2 weeks back and at the peak of the stock price this week it had made $90. Of course it's down now but I expect it to pay off nicely.

2021-04-28 11:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Not to be harsh, but you just lit your money on fire. $25 strikes are absolutely stupid. Maybe on a multi-year time frame but I would be shocked if AMC saw $20 again this year, much less by it looks like June or September when your calls expire.

Close this position and open something more reasonable. Take it from a degenerate options gambler who made $9k last friday on $RH and have at least $10k into call spreads on earnings this week, which is high risk. What you're doing is just giving your money away to market makers."
2021-04-28 13:55:14,wallstreetbets,Guess you will be starting from zero after those expire.

If it hits $30 in August then the value would be closer to my $41400 figure."

IV dies as an option goes really deep ITM.

This would be so absurdly ITM it would be negligible in the calculation"

2021-04-28 11:26:31,wallstreetbets,this is the way.
2021-04-28 11:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what I said üòÇ.  I know this is WSB's, but people should understand options before deciding to YOLO their life savings into it."
2021-04-28 11:30:41,wallstreetbets,"I looked up the price for $25 calls out in June and just laughed. $55. Makes me want to sell those tbh. You could open cheap call spreads during earnings this week and make more with that money, as little as it is, with better odds than what OP is playing.

Retail traders complain about market makers and then hand them free money with plays like this."
2021-04-28 10:40:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah if this goes anywhere near $20 the CEO will personally come to our doors and shove those 500 million shares down our throats. As if that pledge meant anything.

2021-04-28 11:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Why? What makes you think it will squeeze? How many squeezes have you seen? You are straight up gambling on a rare event.

You paid $1.55 premium on something that is 2.5x out of the money. Do you think it will squeeze and just stay at that price?

Don't put all your money into something so flimsy as a ""squeeze""."
2021-04-28 10:48:02,wallstreetbets,And the squeeze shall come

2021-04-28 17:50:29,wallstreetbets,Apparently they're really good at making money. Or losing money. I'm trying to confirm which.
2021-04-28 12:48:08,wallstreetbets,What I want people like this guy to understand is this same reasoning had people buy GME at $350. If you are just going of hope you have no idea what it is worth. It is also hard to not sell at the first loss since you have zero conviction.
2021-04-28 10:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. There are people in here giving stupid advice and guys like this blindly follow. 

There is also big group that also think short squeezes are common."
2021-04-28 10:48:24,wallstreetbets,Then how did GME go from barely 15 bucks a share to up to 300+ a share? Ya know with everything going digital and all. Its no longer about fundamentals my friend
2021-04-28 10:51:18,wallstreetbets,"That isn't how it works though. This guy (assuming since we are dumber than women) paid $1.55 for these options. This premium this far out will not change much. People know that short squeezes don't last. Let's say it hit $20 and then comes right back down. Nobody is going to bid up the $25 option. It is already crazy priced.

Now, he needs to justify this crazy price. On top of that, he needs to justify this premium 5 months out and 2.5x gain to break even.

He put his life savings into an event that won't happen. He should have just put it on the felt at a casino. It would be exponential better odds."
2021-04-28 10:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Also, don't think that AMC won't do some creative stuff if the stock gets close to $15. More shares, big options for the executives, etc."
2021-04-28 15:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes as compared to AMC fulfilling a supply & demand need, absolutely.  You figured it out in the 3rd & 4th word of your sentence. Hence the disclaimer. The only way GME will survive long term is to exit the profit losing brick & mortar business. Maybe gaming tourneys? We'll see if that stock price is put to use. But based on that, absolutely. \[Again, just a guy on reddit not financial advise but glad to entertain you! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) \]"
2021-04-28 16:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Nice. What's going to bring people to GME stores again? When people have their consoles delivered to them and get games online? What's their big earnings plan again? I just see AMC as having a way out with what they do and GME will have to become a completely different business model as brick & mortar is dying. Not saying it can't happen. Just not seeing a plan besides ""I like the stock""."

2021-04-28 15:56:34,wallstreetbets,"But is this not a casino? I truly hope no one here really is using this site as a end all be all. Plus who says this guy is a kid? We all learn from mistakes if it dosnt pan out for him then he will too. If he is a kid then he has plenty of time to recover. Buying OTM calls is risky on any stock. Obviously if dude has 18k to toss at options he isn‚Äôt hurting. 

But you‚Äôre just reading this from a random person somewhere in the world as every other post is.

2021-04-28 13:14:44,wallstreetbets,"fr june is way too early for stock to bounce back that high (assuming we don't have a GME like event of covering shorts).

AMCs are slowly opening up nationwide but it's def not gonna be back in full swing by June.  Fall, Winter is more reasonable."
2021-04-28 15:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Your comment is retarded advice and shouldn't have that many upvotes because it is misleading.

You realize that you don't need your options to be ITM in order to make profitable trades with them, don't you? They provide you with leverage thanks to the time-value, and the more OTM they are, the more insane the leverage is. The catch is to have the green move you hoped for (not necessarily to be above the strike, because again, we don't need to be ITM) sufficiently before maturity, and before theta starts hurting you badly.

OP can for example make insane profits if $AMC moves by just 10% by mid May or June.

So yes, is it risky ? Yes, high leverage is compensated by high theta and the risk of losing everything if nothing happens until maturity. Is it stupid? Not if you know how to play it and understand the risks. But then again, OP's post was correctly flaired as YOLO."

I can't predict the future to know when that time will be and neither can anyone else. OP risked all of his money on a wish that somebody will keep buying based on a hope and a prayer.

GME is a good story but don't think that it is the norm. Just because you want something to spike doesn't mean it will. GME has also made some moves to get better. AMC has done nothing but dilute their shares and give out bonuses.

If your investment thesis is ""its no longer about fundamentals"" make sure you don't need the money you are gambling with."
2021-04-28 11:12:22,wallstreetbets,"There was as short squeeze... that is not the case here.... fair value of gme is like $5. I understand it's not about fundamentals, but the gme squeeze was a situation that doesn't just happen to every meme stock we latch onto. Amc is not gme, it may go up, it may go down, but it's not squeezed like gme and it's not hitting 300"
2021-04-28 14:02:16,wallstreetbets,"First of all GME was around $5 about 11 months ago, and it grew to +$20 before the end of the year. Secondly, if you have watched any of DFV's God Tier DD on GME you will see that the whole ""everything going digital"" is more of a myth than you are lead to believe. People ARE still buying physical games, trade-ins, hardware etc. and GME still has a large portion of the gaming market. Yes, things in the gaming world are shifting to digital but currently there is still a lot of money to be made in the physical gaming realm. Yes there was talk of a squeeze for GME months and months ago but it really didn't gain traction until December. Even DFV himself said in front of congress he believed GME was worth $50/share originally. But overtime his thesis evolved and he believes it to be a good buy even at the time (about $43/share), though he didn't say it explicitly we can deduce that he is referencing that the squeeze is still in play."
2021-04-28 11:01:37,wallstreetbets,"I don't think 11$ is crazy priced.  I also don't think it will hit 25$, but you're right on everything else."
2021-04-28 16:48:05,wallstreetbets,Ryan Cohen turned Chewy into an e-commerce giant and that‚Äôs what he plans on doing with Gamestop. They‚Äôve already started closing down the lowest profit stores and talked of making it into a gaming giant. So just saying stop spreading FUd lol
2021-04-28 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a big GME bull (I think it's a $40 stock based on fundamentals) but there is little comparison between their situations. GME has an existing revenue chain, that is slowly declining, but exists. They have no debt and $500m of cash on hand. They are saddled with 5500 stores but the leases mostly expire within 2 years so it's easy to close down most of them and transition to selling stuff online, keeping just the most profitable stores in place. 

AMC had to borrow so much money just to survive COVID they are screwed going forward even if business jumps up to 2019 levels. And given the few number of block busters in the pipline such a revenue return is unlikely until 2022 at the earliest, maybe never, depending on how streaming goes. 

The only solution for a company saddled with so much debt is to try to issue their way out which they did. From 100m shares to 500m shares. And as long as retail is dumb enough to keep buying their shares (debt) then they can muddle along. But sooner or later something will happen, retail will lose faith, and this company will be in bad shape."

This stock isn't ever seeing $25 unless inflation rises to 2000%."
2021-04-28 16:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Options buyers have the option to exercise, options sellers have the obligation to deliver. There's no exercise risk when you buy an option as OP did.

When I said close the position I meant sell what he just bought and get his money back before incurring losses. If AMC shot up to his strike price, his options would be worth a lot more and he could sell them. That's how you trade calls - buy them when the stock is low and they're cheap and hopefully flip them as the stock moves up before you run out of time.

In this case OP picked a price target that is waaaaaay too far OTM. He's betting on a short squeeze happening within the next few months. If he's right he could pull out a win. But speaking as someone who made $140k on the GME squeeze, before this sub went full retard, actual squeezes are rare. You're better off choosing a reasonable strike the stock can reach on its own, then profiting big time if the price skyrockets. I did that with GME calls. There were $40 strikes I believe last January. Cost $200 and I sold them for $25k each. Even without the squeeze they would have likely been profitable anyway."
2021-04-28 16:51:05,wallstreetbets,"I trade thousands of dollars worth of OTM butterflies and call spreads each week so yes, I know quite well how it works. Based on what FB just reported, I should be up $3k or more tomorrow based on spreads I opened yesterday. AAPL just came in too, so there's another $5k if it holds. I also made $140k on the GME squeeze.

You don't need OTM options to make money on a short squeeze. All calls will fly through the roof. If OP was smart he'd buy calls based on reasonable expected price action of AMC, then roll in cash if a squeeze occurred. Betting on one like this is plain stupid, as dumb as buying $500 SPY calls for this summer. Maybe the market moves faster than theta decay. But OP would need a freaking moonshot to make it work. He needs AMC at $15 by end of next month just to break even and it's only going to get more difficult from there to reach $25.

I'd dump this position as soon as I could."

I would think GME would fare far better setting up pro game tournament eco system rather than being yet another e-commerce system when there is Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and god knows who else to get your console from. And thats a once every what, 2-4 year expense? Especially considering most people just buy software directly now. An e-commerce system linked to games industry which notoriously has history of booms and busts, ups and downs sounds far less stable than a movie theater chain now that people are getting out of their houses now that vaccines are plentiful."
2021-04-28 17:13:11,wallstreetbets,"This is probably one of the best takes I have heard on this whole thing. Wow, 5500 stores is a lot! Also I thought it was sharply declining, not slowly along with so many malls. 

But GME exiting fast out of the brick and mortar business would make a lot of sense. I still the Pro Game Tourneys are the way for them to go. That business seems like it would boom because e-commerce retail seems so crowded, especially for something so specific. To me it feels so niche like Bathroom ware e-commerce or something.

Also, AMC is saddled with debt, do you know how much debt AMC are in? I imagine the AMC venues are far greater of an expense than the GME stores. Specifically for Covid, it seems like they would have pulled in a lot of the govt rescue money. 

It definitely will be interesting to see how it plays out over the next 10 years. I appreciate your perspective on it.

Also congrats on the GME calls!!!

I guess my confusion is that you say an option seller is obligated to deliver if those options are exercised. But if he closes his position by selling the options now doesn't that technically put him at risk for an obligation to deliver in the extreme case where someone chose to exercise them or it expired ITM on some unlikely squeeze later?"

2021-04-28 13:58:58,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm glad you asked. 

Theta is obviously the ‚Äútime decay‚Äù of an option so the rate of change of the value for an option, portfolio or swap/future derivative in relation to time with everything else remaining constant. Theta is typically presented in a by day calculation (which is why it seems so small at -0.00123) but in reality when theta is calculated it is expressed as a yearly number. Now by buying a far OTM call option like OP has, his theta is initially low because of how far out it is but as time passes and the price stays below the strike of $25 it will continue to increase in a negative manner -1, -2 and so on until the contracts are worthless in which case theta will have eaten the whole position. Now as for how this relates to BSM it is broken down into the following equation: -[(Stock Price*N‚Äô(d1)*volatility)/(2*SQRT(Time))]- (risk free rate*strike price*E^-(risk free rate*time)*N(d2). And that‚Äôs just theta for a basic call. If you don‚Äôt know what d1 and d2 are then you should read up on it and both of their relations to other Greek calculations/options calculations. 

Obviously other Greeks, mainly Delta and Gamma, as well as IV all play into the value of the options and as I mentioned earlier the IV is ridiculously high at 143% so regardless of if his theta was -0.000000001 it would take a parabolic movement to even begin to slightly profit off of such a position. 

I can help explain IV to you next if you need it. Just let me know :)

Edit: I see the math is a little cluttered but I‚Äôm on mobile so to be expected."

2021-04-28 11:51:35,wallstreetbets,CC's would have been a MUCH better decision than buying ridiculously OTM calls.
2021-04-28 11:22:14,wallstreetbets,It's just not too late for op to get most of his money back. Maybe he will find someone more bullish than him to sell them to. I dont like to see people lose money on mob hype

It was hilarious to watch people loose (or gain) big money when they had at least some idea what they were doing and were dicking around with play money, but lately watching all the people who barely even know what an option is burning their life savings on literally impossible plays due to memes on the internet is depressing, especially when they are often followed up in a month or two with posts about being depressed about loosing it all."

You can sell calls to open too (which is what market makers and theta gang does), and then you buy them to close. When you sell to open, you've sold a contract to someone, and they can exercise you, though that's extremely rare.

It's like +1 then -1 = 0.

2021-04-28 17:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Hey thank you so much! I really appreciate your explanation. That makes a lot of sense.

From reading online it wasn't distinguishing between sell to close and sell to open. I kept reading that if you sell a contract you're on the hook for those shares if you get exercised. It was really confusing because I was like... wouldn't buying options and then selling them later for premium before expiration be super dangerous in almost all cases and it'd be super easy to get margin called? How are people putting so much money in options?

Not sure why the articles didn't specify. 

So it's the original writer of a call option who has the obligation even if the contract gets bought/sold through multiple hands if I'm understanding this right.

So even if you didn't own the underlying stock you could buy multiple contracts and sell them later in the market and you don't risk having to buy/sell the underlying shares? You would only risk the premium you paid, which could go to zero like in the case of this thread.

(Don't feel obligated to keep responding... I'm just reading a lot and puzzling through while thinking out loud as this all as it's really interesting. Super super appreciate the info you've provided.)"

2021-04-28 19:46:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah. It‚Äôs his family now.
2021-04-28 19:03:05,wallstreetbets,"Step 1 is learning what a call and a put is for the buyer and seller. A lot of people don't know the basics of what options contracts are.

- A call buyer has the *option* to buy shares at the strike price.
- A call seller has the *obligation* to sell shares at the strike price.

- A put buyer has the *option* to sell shares at the strike price.
- A put seller has the *obligation* to buy shares at the strike price.

That's it. When you know that by heart you'll find options aren't complicated.

For example, I have 5 $310/$320 Facebook call spreads expiring Friday. So I have the option to buy 100 shares at $310, and the obligation to sell 100 shares at $320. The difference or spread is $10/share or $1000. So those 5 contracts should be worth $5,000 at expiration friday, or more likely tomorrow since FB is trading at $325 after hours today so I expect those contracts to basically trade at full value. I don't take options into expiration to exercise, most people don't. I sell them before expiration or close the position out.

Those are long call spreads. You can reverse that trade, and sell the $310 and buy the $320 if you were bearish. You would have the obligation to sell 100 shares @ $310 and the option to buy 100 shares @ $320. So if the stock ran to $325 as it did now, the $320 option you bought acts as a stop loss or hedge if the stock runs higher. In this case, you would lose $1000 per spread. But if FB stayed below $310, both options would expire worthless.

You can sell calls or buy puts if you're bearish, and buy calls or sell puts if you're bullish.

I'm only replying because so few care to learn and there's so little information around here anymore. But I highly recommend you open a TD Ameritrade account and download think or swim. Even if you don't fund the account you can still paper trade and learn how ToS works with the risk profile tool. You'll be miles ahead of most people here and much less likely to lose money."

2021-04-28 12:46:15,wallstreetbets,I had about $80k in stock. My cost basis was $10ish and would sell around that level. Every once in a while I would buy lower and then sell at the money
2021-04-28 12:24:22,wallstreetbets,I hope it squazzles man . Im grabbing shares instead to be safer . Please don‚Äôt think the ceo cares about you because he did a YouTube vid and mentioned Reddit . You ever see a ceo of hedge fund say a stock sucks then they buy it after It collapses . These people are high level business professionals who don‚Äôt care about anyone else .. and if he would‚Äôve approved the 500 dilution they would‚Äôve lost all retail interest so there‚Äôs a reason they didn‚Äôt do that other than covid .

2021-04-28 12:49:18,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhhh ok so you wanted to let some shares go and instead of just selling them at market, you collected the calls premium as well. Pretty smart!

2021-04-28 13:35:14,wallstreetbets,"Dude I also put a small portion of my life savings into AMC, but dude, just buy SHARES.

This is NOT GME.

The CEO plan is so transparent, he come out with a vote of 500m dilution (Which had high chance not to pass anyway), then directly went to an interview with Reddit YouTuber, so he can say to the Reddit audience he will not do it in the upcoming year - making you think he is on ""your side"", and then dilute ""just"" 50m shares straight cash to AMC which AMC DOES NOT NEED, and then keep on the 500m shares dilution vote for next year.

I read this play ever since Trey announced he gonna interview him on his channel, and I warned a lot of people.

Dude, I also believe in AMC, but not for squeeze potential, just to gain some safe cash in the upcoming year or two.

But no way I'm gonna gamble with calls with such a money-driven staff & CEO which just gives bonuses and keeping extra money ""on the side"". I do believe it will get to 20$ and even 30$ in some point, but theta will get you before it in my opinion.

Just stick to shares with this company."

2021-04-28 12:34:29,wallstreetbets,"Real talk here:  let's face it, very often stonks go DOWN after an earnings call even if the news was favorable, especially if there's been a big runup before earnings which is the case here.  Price adjusts to the reality of the news, not the optimism.  And MVIS earnings have always been negative, I don't expect that to change this afternoon.  The only way I see it jumping after earnings is if they make forward looking comments about new contracts, etc. that will help earnings in the future.  

The ""real news"" that I would think boosts the stock has already been published (link below), so the stock price already has that built in.

2021-04-28 15:52:55,wallstreetbets,They make high tech stuff. It's worth sticking something in. I always stick in what I can afford to lose with every stock especially here on wsb because u dont know how crazy these apes can get sometimes. They likes to bounce around alot and not focus on one stock. But mvis gme amc clov mndm seem to be what's talked about most. So if u stick a low amount in each one itll prolly make u something
2021-04-28 10:47:26,wallstreetbets,That's the problem right now. People think it's a meme stock. It's not. It has legit data points suggesting it's going to breakout and sustain/grow. Do some research on it.
2021-04-28 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,Its opposite day tho

When you buy a stock it's like buying a chicken.

As long as you hold chickens, they will reproduce and make more chickens. Unless these chickens are laying eggs(dividends) then these chickens are useless. 

When you sell the stock it's like chopping up the chicken and eating it's glorious tendies.

So when you buy a stock you dont get to eat tendies until u slaughter ur chicken"

2021-04-28 19:44:26,wallstreetbets,Buy GME with a huge amount of downside and very little upside or buy CLOV with very little downside and quite a bit of upside fundamentally...and the potential for a really large amount of upside if a few of these pieces align ( 40M shares short and another 32.5M exposed to May call options - many in or near the money already).  Not sure I understand that one.
2021-04-28 11:18:48,wallstreetbets,Hell no...not too late. Bought 5000 shares at $10.40 im in lets go!

2021-04-28 10:50:01,wallstreetbets,"id say this sounds par for the course in the medical industry. Insurance companies, pharma reps and anyone associated are constantly peddling business deals at the local Internal Medicine level as well. So doing this at a corp level is probably the same.....This kinda shit will get phased out  and cleaned up to appease the DOJ and CLOV will keep giving gains as time goes on."

Plus, the government will expand its market share including more tech-savvy members into Medicare programs (watch Biden's state of the union tonight).

2021-04-28 12:15:38,wallstreetbets,The short interest is 35%... squeeze lol. The misprint was saying it was over 100% because they deducted the CEO shares twice. It‚Äôs 35% when not deducting them even though they can‚Äôt trade them until it‚Äôs over $30/share for 30 days or something. Go check out r/clov

Almost 40M shares short and 32.5M accounted for under the May options open- many of these already in or near the money.

2021-04-28 10:22:24,wallstreetbets,PLTR positive news makes it go red. Hoping for a shit earnings report so we can reverse psychology this ship.

2021-04-28 11:22:57,wallstreetbets,I thought the 5/4 was just a guess based on some time table or something.

This is unusual...

Unless there‚Äôs a clear, legit reason...not a good thing."

2021-04-28 11:30:48,wallstreetbets,"your being downvoted, but looking it up myself, your not wrong. generally moving earnings back means bad news and moving earnings forwards means good news. Google it before you downvote this man."

I got 5/4 as the initial earnings date from a trusted finance guy...maybe he was just providing an estimated date.

Maybe 5/11 is legit...and all good."
2021-04-28 12:49:21,wallstreetbets,"I never saw 5/4, I didn't look too hard but I googled their earnings date a week or two ago and I'm pretty sure I remember seeing ""estimated mid may"" so maybe no one really knew?

 I see the TD ameritrade comment but in my experience they're wrong on a lot of earnings unless it's like within the month."
2021-04-28 11:48:27,wallstreetbets,Td ameritrade said the same thing. 5/4 but now 5/11.

BUY and HOLD. It will go to mid-$20s organically by mid-May anyways - CLOV is doing really well on both Insurance and Tech sides. Plus, the government will expand its market share, including more tech-savvy members into Medicare programs (watch Biden's state of the union tonight). This is where it should be by now if there were no Hindenburg research report.

WE ARE TALKING BIG $50's+ NOW if people BUY and HOLD!

2021-04-28 10:24:50,wallstreetbets,I think lots of people don't want to tie up their money for any period to transfer over. I don't think nearly as many people were pissed off by RH fuckery or apes with short-term memory.

2021-04-28 18:20:19,wallstreetbets,"I think there was a relatively small percentage of their active users meaningfully affected by the halts. Then you have the fact that every popular broker had halts. By comparison, you had a small percentage of total RH users that were very vocal in their belief that RH more severely mishandled the situation than it‚Äôs peers. That made it look like everyone was leaving when the reality is that many users just went on with their lives. 

For what it is worth, I keep $150k+ in RH because my personal assessment was that every broker followed a similar standard in responding with halts. Not here to argue just providing my perspective. And RH made my life easy and inexpensive from day 1 back in 2016 when I put in my initial $500. They remain a good choice for my personal approach to the market, so I have not left."

I check the 'what's your plan for tomorrow' thread and refresh 'new' a few times at market close and open, and if I'm seeing a trend or especially seeing people YOLOing, I go in as long as I'm getting in before it's already spiked, and I sell conservatively. 

I made 50 bucks on CLOV today. I made 80 on MVIS (kinda regret not holding on longer...) and I made 20 or so on MMED.

It's not much, but it's something I do in the first hour of volatility while I'm drinking my morning coffee before my real job.

2021-04-28 17:22:23,wallstreetbets,"You think if a stock has a move on a day that it means it's a short squeeze?

&#x200B;

Here, let me explain to you how this is going to go down:

All you Capuchins are going to pile in and drive up the price based on the fact that big money is going to let you do it for a moment.  Hell, they're even going to buy into it with you to accelerate the price.

&#x200B;

Then, when they've got enough of you in the cage, they'll run the rugpull.exe program on you (using shares th ey were buying with you to artificially drive up the price) and wipe your asses out by low-selling and drying up all the buy liquidity, which will cause all you paper handers to cut bait and all you diamond handers to become bag holders.

&#x200B;

Then the cycle will start again.

&#x200B;

Go check my comment history.  I LOVE playing your stonk as an intraday scalp.  I wait for a parabolic movement upwards, then I short the piss out of it and cover it a couple hours later for free tendies.  Works every time.

You really think you're squeezing a stock that's only sitting 50 cents above its original spaccy price?  You might be the bad kind of retarded."
2021-04-28 16:14:25,wallstreetbets,"People put stop limits on their shares and lost them pretty regularly since GME was about the most volatile stock in history. A lot of the crazy drops happened when there was almost no volume, which looked a whole lot like market manipulation by hedge funds. If you can handle the swings and believe in the stock going up, there's no need for limits. I didn't have limits the whole ride and watched my account swing several hundred thousand dollars in a few minutes.


It's either terrifying or exhilarating, depending on how insane you are. I had a good time."

But I literally know nothing and only started with the GME stuff, made a profit got out then sat money in BB that did nothing then moved it to MVIS last week and my limit sell of $29.50 somehow was exercised Monday right before close. Now it's parked in AMD while waiting for the next meme. But as someone who has been here only 3 months, the GME thing and almost bagholding has scared me away from ""squeeze"" as a strategy. I'd assume most of the GME apes who got here because of it are now too burnt for squeeze hype."

&#x200B;

It's also why I refuse to give oxygen to the equities I know actually \*ARE\* ripe for a short squeeze, just because I don't want to encourage this legitimately retarded behavior.  I prefer when everybody is in on the joke and only pretending to be special."
2021-04-28 18:36:22,wallstreetbets,"People looking for a squeeze are looking at the wrong metrics.  It's not about short % of float.  That's too remedial.

&#x200B;

When looking for a basic, run-of-the-mill squeeze, you want to look for a stock that has a lot of institutional ownership (read:  Mutual funds) that never sell, a reasonable amount of short (which can actually be less than 8%), and a market cap and strike price low enough that the stock can be pushed around.  Then after you've done all that, look for the volatility.     


But that's a lot of work, and t he retards here will likely never find the ones I see.  Which is sad, cause I'm in one of them and I can't say anything about it being a short squeezer just because I don't want to add oxygen to that smoothbrain fire."

2021-04-28 14:58:28,wallstreetbets,Every broker has a transfer fee for stocks. If you transfer form any account it will come out of your buying power or the transfer will fail. I believe TD charges closer to $100.

Hey guys,

I thought I‚Äôd post about my thoughts on MNMD. First of all, please do your own due diligence and do not fall victim to the pump, hype and euphoria. These are highly speculative investments and have significant risk associated. All that said, there have been many requests for fundamental analysis and MNMD projections so I wanted to provide my thoughts.

\*All figures in USD (market cap, sales) except for my investment holdings. I purchased MMED.NE shares. Source data available as well, but got messy with all the 10-k filings and links in the table.

# Entry Point

First and foremost, I want to address the most commonly raised question on this thread: ‚ÄúIs it too late to buy MNMD?‚Äù Any investment is subject to the risk / reward paradigm. Those that got in at $0.3 deserve every penny they earned as MNMD was by definition a penny stock and one of the most risky investments you could own. Since then, it has grown tremendously due to scientific milestones which have pointed to significant progress in the industry.

The milestones MNMD has achieved have DERISKED MNMD from a penny stock to a small cap biotech company with a very large drug portfolio and numerous future catalysts. I do not expect to make 10x my investment in a week, nor should you. Is there still tremendous upside even at the current valuation of \~$1.5bn? I strongly believe so and will let my position reinforce that.

I entered this space with an average cost of \~$4.9 CAD, holding 311,206 shares, and a book value of \~1.5MM. Yes you read that correctly. Do I panic every day and check the ticker? No. Does my heart beat thinking of the time I evaporated \~$500,000 in unrealized loss when the stock was at $3.4? No. In fact, I continue to pick up shares at what I believe is a discounted valuation. There will be many that look at $4.9 entry point and think that even I got in at the bottom. It‚Äôs all relative.

[OPs original YOLO \(Not a YOLO\)](https://preview.redd.it/m5g55vw3dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=463e90c35b488f6a370a63769daece2d5a07f5d8)

I only invested what I could afford to lose and although $1.5MM is a large sum of money, it is not my entire portfolio, nor would it impact my daily life. If I lost it all it would not impact my ability to service my mortgage, pay my bills, impact my other investments, nor prohibit me from doing the things I love. I continue to hold dry powder and monitor my investment on a monthly basis, while continuing to buy following successful milestones.

This is a very long term play that could fundamentally change the way we treat the body‚Äôs most important organ. We are just getting started. I have a very strong conviction on the future outcome of this industry and that is the reason I couldn‚Äôt be bothered about short term fluctuations. An important question to ask yourself is whether you believe MNMD can reach its next scientific milestone. Take things one step at a time and is there a probability the next scientific update will be positive? Emphasis on science, ignoring NASDAQ, candlesticks, and capital structure (for now).

# Institutional Capital

I work in finance (albeit project finance / private equity, and don‚Äôt value stocks for a living, so don‚Äôt consider me an expert here) but already know of a few moderately capitalized asset managers that are now participating in MNMD. The recent bought deals are evidence of sophisticated capital flowing into this industry. I personally qualify as an ‚Äòaccredited investor‚Äô and am having conversations constantly with folks in my circles who are investing heavily into these stocks. As more institutional capital flows in, the more stable these stocks become. Of course, this is all relative.

# Access to liquidity

As with all brand new industries, the capital requirement is immense in order to bring products to market. What drew me into the space was the fact that MNMD did raise capital. Biotech stocks do not have cashflow, thus their only path to fund operations is through equity raises. The fact that MNMD was able to raise over $237MM CAD since May 2019 is a positive for this company. Yes it is dilutive, and good job for paying attention in finance 101 class, but bootstrapping a biotech company is not possible, nor is servicing debt.

The path to commercialization of will be full of obstacles, however a strong balance sheet with sufficient capital gives MNMD the resources to get there. The current valuation has tremendous upside following scientific milestones and future equity raises and dilutions are a good thing, as it will be at an increased valuation.

There are definitely smaller cap companies out there that may double overnight, however for the risk / reward, I do not feel comfortable owning companies that don‚Äôt have a large balance sheet, nor a diversified drug portfolio.

# Believe in the Science

I do not feel I am in a position to write original content on the efficacy of these drugs. I have done my research and read a fair number of published studies but anything that I write would simply be regurgitating what others have said.

The biggest investors in this space are those with personal experiences with psychedelics because you have first-hand experience of the profound meaning extracted from one treatment. The ability to dissolve your ego enables you to deal with the root cause of so many problems ranging from depression, PTSD and addition, without approaching the problem by numbing symptoms. Herein lies the inherent value of this industry and will simply take time to prove it through trails. I have the conviction to continue to invest because I believe in the science. The data to reinforce this is on its way, and I personally want to invest now, knowing that the likelihood of very significant catalysts are probable.

# Forecasts

This of course is the elephant in the room for early investors, later\[er\] investors and bears alike. Is a $1.5bn market cap pricing in all of the upside already? Is this a $100bn stock? This company has zero revenues, shouldn‚Äôt it be worth zero?

The truth is, no one knows. There is tremendous risk with this company. However, I will not be selling unless we see some significant negative scientific outcomes. Again, less emphasis on stock price, NASDAQ, more emphasis on the science. Everything else will follow.

The various ways to value a company (DCF, sales / earnings multiples, liquidation value etc) all have their issues with an early stage company of this nature. Any sort of bottoms up DCF analysis is just guessing because variables such as patient count, dosage, pricing, market share, market penetration, amongst other have far too much variation to come up with a reliable figure. Discount rates and time horizon can favour your outcome depending on how aggressive / conservative you are.

Thus, the way I like to look at this market is a best case scenario for a single drug, based off historical sales data from one company and one drug. This implicitly takes into account patient dosage, competition, market share, market penetration etc, because one drug from one company has already proven its ability to capture such sales data.

[Letters and Numbers](https://preview.redd.it/37z2u5a9dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a0b8a6b8643b49666b9eef994eb70c4984f64dd)

I have broken out annual sales data for various comparable drugs according to MNMD‚Äôs current pipeline offering. This is the inherent benefit of MNMD, is that it has a diverse portfolio covering many underserved issues. Like many of you, I believe MNMD‚Äôs biggest blockbuster will be Layla, given the problem of Opioid addition plus MNMD‚Äôs IP rights on 18-MC to corner sales. Suboxone is the current drug on the market due to delayed onset effects ranging from 24-36 hours, compared to someone in withdrawal uses fast acting opioids 3-4 times a day. Suboxone itself however is still addictive and has a long list of negative side effects. Furthermore, it does not correct dopamine dysregulation in patients.

The sales of Suboxone alone are growing at an \~9% CAGR, with sales expected to reach \~$4bn in 2028.

The use case for 18-MC however, does not stop at Opioid addiction, and can be applied to alcohol dependency and smoking dependency among others. This means the TAM for 18-MC could be significantly larger than the existing market captured by Suboxone given its smaller demographics relative to 18-MC. Could Layla exhibit sales greater than Suboxone one day? Who knows. Sticking with comp sales for the analysis for now.

Various anxiety, depression and ADHD medication is also shown in the table to show sales potential of Lucy, Albert and the micro dose programmes.

Is there a possibility of a LSD, 18-MC, or LSD compound or derivative achieving blockbuster drug status? Do you think there is an inherent benefit to a psychedelic compared to an antidepressant sedative with side effects such as nausea, weight gain etc?

Your perceived probability and sales outcomes depends on whether you believe in the science. Those that don‚Äôt can easily be skeptical of a $1.5bn market cap many years away from profitability.

Those that do, look at the next half a dozen clinical trial outcomes as very probable and thus have applied a less punitive discount to the stock valuation. I have rationalized my decision to invest at $1.5MM because of my own perceived discount rate and confidence in the next 12 months of positive catalysts.

# Valuation Multiples

Now, as many of you know, investors pay a multiple for the future earnings of a company, today. If a drug makes $1bn annually, investors will pay a multiple of future earnings expected over the drugs lifetime, discounted by various factors.

There are various metrics to use here, ranging from Enterprise Value / Sales or various types of earnings metrics. MNMD is years away from having a real operating company, anything to sell, or even the corporate infrastructure to get it to market. However, the question has always been, how big do you think this company could get?

This is where things can get tricky. We used peak annual sales in the last section to forecast comparable estimates for MNMD revenues. Thus, I believe it is appropriate to use mature, large cap trading multiples instead of early stage bio techs, as our revenue estimates were mature figures with stabilized growth. If we were to use companies / drugs earlier in their lifecycle or clinical phases, the trading multiples would be much higher because the market is buying potential future sales. Can‚Äôt have it both ways.

[An ugly rainbow](https://preview.redd.it/farn3m3gdxv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0abe00f3b8456574265f74a0c54fab49a5fe60e1)

All of the chart data in the graph is specific to the pharma industry. However, there are various subsectors to the industry such as Contract Development Manufacturing and Contract Research Organization. MNMD would likely have to partner with each of these types of firms to scale its business, better assess market size etc, but wouldn‚Äôt trade at similar multiples given a different business model. Same goes for Packaging and Distribution.

The graph also shows S&P average which is a good rule of thumb.

&#x200B;

[More letters and numbers](https://preview.redd.it/1iybej4kdxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=88ee491b4a27ba8467d27b863f001fc9ba5ecceb)

Although the chart gives a good reference point for pharma multiples, I wanted to look at valuation from a more company specific perspective. The chart above shows large cap specialty pharma companies that are publicly traded. This will give you an approximate median value of what the market is willing to pay for a company that has a certain amount of sales. As you can see in the green box, industry multiples of EV/EBIITDA or EV/Sales will basically get you to the same place. Median pharma industry EBITDA margins are in the 40% range with EV/Sales at \~4x vs EV/EBITDA of 10x.

Note that the above list of trading comps is stale data, as of Sept ‚Äô19. I only want to use public data and have refrained from using Bloomberg, Cap IQ etc. Thus the information I‚Äôm posting is merely reposts of info available on Google. As you can see, Allergan is listed in this table as a live trading comp, and has since been acquired by AbbVie. Accordingly, I want to highlight some notable M+A activity:

Amgen acquires Celgne‚Äôs plaque psoriasis drug, Otezla $13.4bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.6x Thermo Fisher acquires Qiagen for $11.5bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.3x Abbvie acquires Allergan for $84.2bn: EV / LTM Sales = 5.4x Elanco acquires Bayer‚Äôs animal health unit for $7.6bn: EV / LTM Sales = 4.5x As you can see, companies are willing to pay a premium in M&A to acquire competitors and drugs, due to synergies, reduction in SG&A etc.

This is a very long winded way of showing that if one of MNMD‚Äôs compounds hits, and exhibits sales in line with any sort of comparable drug from the table above, this could be a $20-30 billion dollar company (\~4bn\*5-7x). If several of these drugs reach commercialization, this is potentially a $100 billion dollar company.

Now I agree that these projections are completely outlandish right now. I‚Äôm simply doing the exercise you all wanted.

Feel free to guess at your own forecast sales and multiply out enterprise value using the above metrics. Before you rip me apart for the extreme optimism, I understand that I‚Äôm using multiples for stable, reputable, large cap pharma. I understand that there is an extreme amount of stigma attached to psychedelics and achieving ubiquity for these treatments is a large uphill battle. There is an enormous amount of work, luck and time from now until sales and this is not to be under estimated.

**Do I think MNMD is worth $30-$100bn today? No.**

**Do I think MNMD is worth somewhere in between today‚Äôs valuation and $30-$100bn?**

Depends **whether you believe in the science.** If you‚Äôre reading this, odds are you do. I invested because I believe it too.

So instead, let‚Äôs take a lazy man‚Äôs approach to valuation and take things one step at a time.

# Simpler Approach to Valuation

The exercise above is to show you all the immense potential of MMED‚ÄôFs drug portfolio. Do I think MNMD is the next Pfizer, Abbie Vie or Eli Lilly? No. This is not a $500bn dollar company. However, I do genuinely think there is tremendous upside not factored into the pricing for this stock.

Fundamental analysis aside, I think the simplest way to approach valuation is from a catalyst + efficient market hypothesis perspective. Markets are not fully efficient, nor even semi-efficient, but there is some sort of reasoning in believing what the market is willing to pay. The obvious flaws in this are that the market right is riddled with irrational investors and a market of 300m financially illiterate traders isn‚Äôt more efficient than an illiquid market of 10 rational ones. As of today‚Äôs post there is a discount to the $4.40 price. To me, that‚Äôs just more opportunity to continue to scoop up more shares.

I have stayed out of the industry in the early days because truthfully I did not know which stocks to pick. Since then, much smarter people than me have done their diligence and allocated their capital to the companies that they believe are winners. This is part of an efficient market hypothesis.

Sophisticated capital flowed into MNMD @ 4.40 / share, with the expectation to make a profit. I also, invested in this company at $4.9/share, with the expectation to make a profit. If we establish this as a baseline, do we believe there will be more positive than negative catalysts in the next year and in the future, such that we will see accretion in the share price? Conversely, if we see negative outcomes in future catalysts, it will cause erosion in the stock valuation. Below are near term events which should have a significant impact on share price:

¬∑ Phase 2 readout‚Äì Q1 2021 Open IND w/ FDA for Phase 2b ‚Äì Q3 2021 Project Layla

¬∑ Phase 2a study‚Äì Second half of 2021 Strategic Pharma Partner Potential ‚Äì Late 2021 Various

¬∑ Combined MDMA LSD Phase 1 trail ‚Äì Q1 2021 IV DMT Phase 1 trail ‚Äì Q1 2021 First ever Phase 2a clinical trial Microdose LSD ‚Äì Q3 2021 Patent filed for neutralizer technology for LSD to shorter/stop hallucinogenic effects Game changer for safe, regulated environment for clinical administration Given that Phase 1 studies are focused on safety, what are the odds clinically developed LSD / MDMA fails a safety test?

Given that Phase 2 studies are focused on proof of concept and method, what are the odds the clinically designed process fails the test?

# Believe in the science.

Each one of these incremental catalysts derisks MNMD, and will bring the valuation closer to ‚Äòblockbuster drug‚Äô status, albeit inches at a time. Just as the bought deal derisked this company for me to participate, achievements in clinical trials will be evidence for more investors to jump in as well. Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves and guess at how large this company can get. Just think of what is the next step and do your own evaluation as to whether achieving it is realistic. Once we get through the above list, there will be more milestones to pass such as Phase 2bs and 3s. If we establish $4.40 as the baseline currently and MNMD has a successful outcome in any of the previously listed catalysts, there should be a significant accretion in valuation.

There is a noticeable omission for most of you, in that I‚Äôve left out the NASDAQ up listing, future dilutions and general capital structuring events. To me, a NASDAQ uplisting is irrelevant. This will add liquidity, although probably more volatility, but changes zero fundamentals about the stock. It should however, add more weight to the efficient market hypothesis and erase the discount I believe this stock is trading at. We‚Äôll see some analyst coverage with price targets that will attract more investors, but the fundamentals of the stock do not change.

With respect to stock price, it is impossible to forecast this because the capital structure of this company is completely unknown. IF we can even get to revenue generation, and this becomes a $30-100bn company, how much dilution will there be from now until then to back out a share price? The point is that there is so much runway in share price accretion from now until then, that I‚Äôm not bothered with anything finance related for this company. **There is potential for 50-70x accretion in the value of this company.** The focus needs to be on the science. MNMD has raised enough money to get though its next set of obstacles and fund operations, thus insolvency risk has fallen away for now which is really the only important financial point for early stage biotech.

Let‚Äôs take things one step at a time, believe in the science and be patient.

# Cash position & Expenditures

As you can see below, the quarterly burn payroll burn rate is quite low for MNMD relative to its cash position. It‚Äôs hard to discern which items under their historical expenditures are one off versus recurring, thus difficult to calculate their exact run rate. However, the huge positive here the low ratio of payroll relative to its cash.

[Tendies at Wendy's: Already in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/ici10ntodxv61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fde7f60fd7e2f8bdef405f6e5b022acf9e322a1)

Next up we have the projected use of proceeds from their latest raise, net of underwriter expenses. Now that the Over-Allotment has been exercised, MNMD has additional capital that it has further allocated to Albert, Lucy, Layla and the Microdose LSD program.

[Tendies at Wendy's: Soon to be in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/8gozyududxv61.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd203b18101c760f03790f8a700171a80995299)

General takeaway is that MNMD is well enough capitalized to get through its next phase of milestones. I will be keeping an eye on news surrounding the Microdose LSD program. Estimates at this stage for Phase 2a are $3-4m and the results of which will inform capital expenditures required for future phases. A positive milestone in Q3 ‚Äô21 should be an incredibly positive catalyst for this company.

Proving that you‚Äôve raised capital and have enough cashflow to get to the next step doesn‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôve picked the winner in the industry. It does however give me confidence that MNMD will continue to be a going concern for at least the short term and get to a point when new investors can come in at a much higher valuation. This is a real risk for the penny stocks out there without capital or IP, and that is the reason I chose MNMD.

Edit: Did some re-formatting to make it easier to read cause it's pretty lengthy and there's a lot of details. Hopefully it helps.

Edit #2: I went back into the trash compacter and salvaged the original data and charts since some people were asking. The resolution may be questionable, so apologies for that, you might have to zoom in.

2021-04-28 09:59:24,wallstreetbets,"the science with Psychedelic is advancing and seems promising--but what makes mind med such a good choice compared to all the other companies in this crowded space? they are far from alone and as best as i can tell don't have anything that sets them apart other than a slightly more diverse pipeline. a diverse pipeline is great but its arguably better to have the entire or large market share for one drug and/or pathology (ie first line for MDD or GAD). In this DD it lists the annual numbers for the current medications for psychiatric disorders, but there is an exceedingly low chance this company ever is able to control significant market share of any of those conditions.

I think the real issue here is that people are getting confused about the difference between being excited by the advancements being made with regard to Psychedelics and whether Mind med specifically is a good investment.

Edit TLDR: you can believe in the science/potential but also realize MNMD is a very risky investment. Lots of companies--and some very large pharma companies--are also studying the same compounds and MNMD doesn't have any exclusive drugs in their pipeline other than an aerosolized LSD-antagonist/reversal agent.

2021-04-28 11:40:44,wallstreetbets,"Finishing my doctorate in clinical psychology (one year away, woo!) and am very interested in this approach to treatment.  I fully anticipate opening a practice that utilizes psychedelics in the future but it's many years off until that actually occurs.  The first psychedelic expected to be granted regulatory approval is MDMA through the MAPS organization because they're the furthest along in the phase 3 FDA trial but it's not even expected to clear these hurdles until 2025.  MAPS is also a nonprofit and will likely be able to drastically undercut MNMD on prices for these substances in the future as long as MAPS gets there first in terms of clearing regulatory hurdles.  They'll already have approvals for MDMA under their belt by the time they move on to psilocybin (which they are already doing) and will likely be able to do the same undercutting for that substance as well.  Psilocybin is arguably the most exciting substance in this approach to treatment thus far and is incredibly cheap to produce- a profit-seeking company like MNMD will have a very difficult uphill battle to fight every step of the way.

Pair this with the complete lack of knowledge about the efficacy of these treatments by the vast majority of people in my field and you have a huge problem for MNMD.  I'm quite literally the only person in my program who ever discusses this approach to treatment- the faculty are completely unaware that this is a thing or only have tangential knowledge about what used to take place prior to the beginning of the ""war on drugs.""  This is going to radically shift approaches to mental health treatment but it's **a decade** away at least from being a reality in the grand scheme of things.  This approach to treatment currently requires special training as it's radically different from every other approach taught thus far.  There's simply no infrastructure in place for such a radical shift to occur in any sort of meaningful way that will make this company viable for a long, long time."

From a speculative point of view, uplisting (or any offering really) only makes sense for two people:

Outside of those manipulating the price, these will invariably be dumped to the detriment of all bag holders.  You can usually tell these with otherworldly valuations.  Like, ""Doordash is a 100 billion dollar company even though they post a loss on their best case year!  ...oh yeah, we own 20% of the company for listing it cause fuck you.""

2.  Those who grew into their company and need to move into bigger waters to fund their ongoing, upcoming projects into fruition.

2021-04-28 17:45:15,wallstreetbets,"While I don't disagree at all with those cynical options there is a valid third reason

3. Those who's valuation is constrained by the limited capital available in their home market and move to a bigger pool of capital to position the company to achieve a much higher valuation by making their shares accessible and liquid for a much larger base of investors.  

Certainly MNMD fits this category in its move to Nasdaq as does its psychedelic therapeutic peer Cybin Inc.  CLXPF which until last month was on NEO in Canada (I had never heard of it - I must confess) and OTC Pink here in the U.S.  

Yes part of the allure of larger valuations is the ability to raise capital on better terms - BUT it would be very hard to find any hugely successful companies that didn't require growth capital along the way to fund the expansion of their business"

2021-04-28 11:52:50,wallstreetbets,"That's the problem- suboxone generates more profit because users go back to it time and time again.  Psychedelics are currently being researched and marketed as one-time use ""cures"" for these issues.  I think there will be greater room for clients to undergo multiple psychedelic experiences as this approach to treatment is expanded but that's many years down the road.  The comparison to Suboxone in this post makes little sense given these factors and MNMD is not likely to be able to reproduce those profit margins with an alternative.

To be fair, microdosing may see the greatest profit margins but sound studies on microdosing for noticeable benefits have *barely* been started in the last couple of years.  The research that's out there is largely anecdotal and needs to be much more robust before it's even seriously considered by the FDA."

2021-04-28 09:46:16,wallstreetbets,I got a real balanced portfolio of a videogame store and motherfucking lasers.
2021-04-28 12:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Alright, so as someone who works in robotics engineering, let me educate you apes about what this means. In short, this is extremely impressive. There's two traditional approaches to LIDAR: time-of-flight and frequency modulated continuous wave. Time-of-flight (TOF) is fairly straightforward, and is also called pulsed detection - you have a laser and a receptor, you shoot the laser at something, measure the amount of time it takes for the laser to reflect off a surface (which doesn't need to be reflective like a mirror, if you weren't eating glue during high school physics, you'd know that all surfaces reflect light), and does some simple math to calculate the distance of the object. This approach is pretty slow and it gets fucked by sunlight, since unless you have a really powerful laser, the reflection is almost always going to be weaker than sunlight. The other approach is frequency-modulated continuous wave LIDAR, also known as coherent detection. FMCW LIDAR works much in the same way, but instead of measuring the time and power of a reflected laser, it measures the frequency of the reflection against a constant waveform, and uses some spicy math to figure out the distance of the object based on the Doppler shift produced by interfering the constant waveform against the return waveform. I have less experience with FMCW, so this is a VERY basic primer on how that approach works.

In any case, LIDAR has two big issues when operating in the field (at least in my experience) - interference from sunlight and a lack of range. Both are solved by slapping a more powerful laser on the sensor platform, but people seem to take issue with lasers that can cause serious burns and start fires. With the laser power restrictions in mind, you're really limited as to what you can do. FMCW has some promising results in terms of solving these issues, but there's a bunch of issues relating to the signal/noise ratio of such a sensitive signal. 

This platform from MVIS is a massive improvement - they claim that their platform is ""immune to sunlight interference"", which I'm somewhat skeptical of, but even the 250m range is EXCELLENT with a 30Hz sampling frequency. I'm not sure what exactly they're doing, but it seems likely that they've figured out a way to improve traditional approaches to FMCW in order to claim such a large range improvement at that sampling rate. Speaking of, the 30Hz sampling rate is also a very important bit of information, and it's pretty impressive. Normally, of speed, precision, and range, you can pick two. The sensor characteristics that they claim are REALLY good for a 30Hz sensor, and that sampling frequency is only going to improve with time. As it stands, this opens up a lot of possibilities for applications that LIDAR has traditionally been too imprecise, slow, or expensive to be practical in. The big one is autonomous cars, but this could also see use in robotics, military applications, consumer electronics, and VR/AR. 

TL;DR: Bullish as fuck, the science is impressive.

edit: don't award this, you apes. if you feel so compelled then make an equal donation to a respectable [science education charity](https://ssec.si.edu/donate) or your local children's hospital.

edit 2: this LIDAR tech also has big potential in archaeology, climate science, forest management, drone tech, and surveying.

MVIS has delivered on ALL promises since this Lidar story began and as promised is 100% on schedule for its April delivery. Remember, this was a PRIVATE demo. Whoever was there was already in talks with MVIS, this demo was to prove what was for sale all along. I am confident all will be revealed tomorrow in the EC. The CEO has delivered on every promise so far . . . how rare is that to find in a stock?"

Also thanks for sharing your insights."
2021-04-28 13:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you should post this in the mvis subreddit.. they'd love to read this, and I am personally looking forward to read this again when I do my before bedtime check of the sub"
2021-04-28 16:37:43,wallstreetbets,"one of the things i love about what they're doing with their auto lidar is they aren't just making something to get their foot in the door now, like what lazr or vldr have done.  instead they took the long view of it and made it a complete package that can actually be USED now, not a few generations from now.  this isn't just a long range lidar:  they have the ability to combine 3 sensors into one system, measuring short, medium, and long range simultaneously.

and they didn't just throw shit against the wall to see what sticks--they went to the auto industry and asked what they needed, then went out and built to those specs.  then to confirm them they put Judy Curran on their board.  she spent 30+ years at ford in development then went to ansys, a company that specializes in testing/benchmarking new products/software for the auto industry.

what this tells me is, unlike their flashy competitors that took the big headlines, they acted like engineers and kept quiet, did the hard work, and now they're flopping their fat technical dick out for everyone to see.  no pomp, no circumstance.  and they've sent their dick pics to only the biggest companies that wanted to see.

and the thing is lidar is cool and all, but personally i don't think it compares to the interactive augmented reality they've created.  the future is now and this tech will form the foundation of the next generation of computing.  it'll honestly be as big as the invention of the internet.  so that's why i hold on days like yesterday when shorts shit the price and momentum in 15 minutes flat."

2021-04-28 09:20:19,wallstreetbets,I see someone did their DD. Yes MVIS is the BEST in class LIDAR.
2021-04-28 09:24:04,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Even then that is only comparing the lidar vertical from MVIS and not all their other verticals.
2021-04-28 11:37:15,wallstreetbets,Plus we have Augmented Reality and other cool tech (our AR is in Microsoft's Hololens and probably the IVAS used for the military right now!) so let's just say we should be WAY more than LAZR.  CHEERS!!!
2021-04-28 11:06:28,wallstreetbets,"Also, keep the ar near laser display in mind too. We are definitely leading the industry in that field as well."

2021-04-28 11:40:12,wallstreetbets,"Bro - EPIC move.  I honestly didn't expect it.  I totally thought LiDAR announcement was coming tomorrow at Earnings Call, PLUS all of MVIS press releases lately have been coming AFTER HOURS and this one was PRE MARKET!  NICE MOVE SUMIT!!!!!

2021-04-28 13:25:14,wallstreetbets,Genius move. I bought at $1.50-2.00 still holding. Day trading just fucks you in the end.

2021-04-28 10:06:37,wallstreetbets,My theory is they saw MVIS tank yesterday and JPow speaking today usually tanks the market. This PR keeps its afloat so we can run up tomorrow
2021-04-28 09:03:39,wallstreetbets,How? Premarket?
2021-04-28 09:06:20,wallstreetbets,How do you buy before markets open?

And that's only one of their verticals. MVIS also has phenomenal products in multiple other sectors like their Hologens etc."
2021-04-28 10:54:41,wallstreetbets,Have read multiple times that MVIS is leagues ahead of all competition

2021-04-28 10:55:47,wallstreetbets,"I agree, Microsoft seems likely, since they know MVIS product due to Hololens 2, headquarters next to each other.

But at this point, who knows. Best in class LIDAR performance means better chance of solving those TESLA fiery crash etc. There‚Äôs so many players interested in purchasing MVIS to get leg up in the auto AI driving competition. My guess is as good as yours. This is gonna be a great season for MVIS!"

2021-04-28 10:45:19,wallstreetbets,This isn't only about short term gain. We could be in for a near future acquisition by big tech players.

2021-04-28 10:48:48,wallstreetbets,If enough people are cognizant the implication of this best in class LIDAR news + MSFT Hololens/ US Army $22B + short squeeze we could easily see $100 even before Friday this week.
2021-04-28 10:35:04,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve read through some stuff the last few days. And many might have better PT than me but I saw a lot of 80-100 by eoy beginning of next
2021-04-28 13:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Hold it until the buy out, lots of talk it could be reach 3 figures. LIDAR isn‚Äôt their only product, they also are the tech behind MIcrosoft Hololens and they have 484 patents."
2021-04-28 12:48:19,wallstreetbets,April 29 is earnings call. Everyone expected that they would wait until then to release this news but they dropped it a day early.
2021-04-28 12:45:59,wallstreetbets,Who said ?
2021-04-28 13:42:19,wallstreetbets,Plenty think it could be above $100 a share
2021-04-28 15:32:06,wallstreetbets,Sell.... cause you should buy more
2021-04-28 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,Once sold means no chance of comeback

2021-04-28 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,Do you realize that this LiDAR is best in class?
2021-04-28 12:59:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand this technology very well lol. Plenty of vehicles have sensors that can detect objects and lines (every car with lane assist has them, some of them are even LiDAR). But in order to have true Level 5 autonomous driving, you need a sensor that can see hundreds of meters down the road with a high resolution and at highway speeds. Trucks don't have anything like that, they have way less powerful ones with smaller range. It basically detects if you're going out of your lane or off the road in case the truck driver falls asleep. Still impressive but it won't let you get rid of the driver. 

The only companies that actually have sensor units in the market that come close to meeting those specs are VLDR and LAZR, but they use inferior tech that has size and performance constraints and they cost a fuck-ton of money (VLDR has been selling units to all the AV companies for like $100k a pop for the last few years).

This new unit from MVIS is smaller, cheaper (<$1,000), can fit behind a windshield instead of on the bumper or roof, and has better specs (longer range, higher resolution, can handle light interference from the sun and other LiDAR units). Much more technically impressive than what's in current vehicles. The existing products have definitely not 'already achieved greatness', they're all pretty shit but they do that basic things well enough and at a price trucking companies can justify."
2021-04-28 15:02:31,wallstreetbets,Yes

2021-04-28 09:37:44,wallstreetbets,"No, why? Until then its very high again"
2021-04-28 10:05:59,wallstreetbets,"Well you can but then it'll cost you more.

The lidar is probably more important right now, considering it's their next major tech up for sale, and it can't really be priced into revenue estimates yet anyway since they're not selling it until later this year. But come then they'll have the best product on the market before a bunch of competitors, so today's news is much more important."

2021-04-28 14:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. Based on my brief read-through of the patents you linked, it looks like they're doing a hybrid of both approaches. The last couple of patents detail a traditional time-of-flight measurement en masse with a grid of sensors, and the first couple detail the use of a FMCW approach to actively measure environmental interference. Essentially, it looks like they're using a bunch of tiny sensors to make a rough assessment, then sharpening those estimates with a more precise error-checking measurement, probably as a control weight to prevent interference from causing large swings in the sensor outputs. If this is the case, then I'm skeptical of how they managed to solve the laser power issue, since the primary advantage of using FMCW as a primary approach is that you don't really care about the power of the return signal too much.

It's certainly an interesting approach, though this probably isn't right because my brain is smooth like an egg."
2021-04-28 14:56:11,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I'll speak on this one. For those who don't know, MEMS stands for Micro-Electromechanical System, and is a blanket term for electronics that use changes in a tiny mechanical system to determine behavior. Most of the time, this is in the form of a sensor that uses some EXTREMELY spicy math to turn the behavior of that tiny mechanical component into some form of sensor value (as an aside, most common sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes are MEMS devices). Microvision's MEMS LIDAR device is essentially a tiny mirror that is held in place by a small flexible arm that moves based on changes in partial gas pressure (which in turn can be controlled via changes in voltage, i.e. software). That mirror allows them to change where they shoot their laser according to the horizontal and vertical axes, so they can create an image by moving the beam in a raster pattern. Additionally, they can monitor the resonant frequency of the mirror and compare it to a predetermined frequency to create an error signal, which they can then feed into a control system that does some extremely spicy math to figure out what the error of the return signal is and adjusts the sensor output accordingly. 

If anyone's an electrical engineer or an expert in optical physics, please correct me if anything is wrong; this is basically what I could glean from [this patent filing.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6331909)"
2021-04-28 15:48:41,wallstreetbets,yo fr? What do you do?
2021-04-28 14:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Seconded. I'm not an expert in optical physics or a EE, my degree is in computer engineering, I've just worked with LIDAR while designing guidance systems for robots. The opinion of an actual expert in the field should absolutely take precedence over mine."
2021-04-28 14:52:43,wallstreetbets,How do they work? Magic
2021-04-28 15:45:08,wallstreetbets,"MVIS lasers go brrrrrrr, but normal lasers only go brr because the sun is a deadly laser and it makes the computer sad. MVIS lasers go brrrrrrr because they use big boy math (the kind you can't count on your fingers) and really tiny special mirrors to make lasers go brrrrrrr in a larger area than normal."
2021-04-28 19:06:30,wallstreetbets,It doesn‚Äôt help me find glue in the dark in bright sunlight so I‚Äôm not worried about ouster. MVIS feeds my big boy muscles.

One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,‚Äù added Sharma. ‚ÄúWe believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability.

2021-04-28 11:18:22,wallstreetbets,Wasn‚Äôt Reddit craze that shot it up high. It was visibility of MVIS prospects and capabilities.
2021-04-28 11:24:27,wallstreetbets,"You got burned by PR, Lidar vertical is easily worth $30+ pps. People shorting this company haven't done 1 ounce of DD or they might have reevaluated the unlimited risk vs limited gains."
2021-04-28 11:27:39,wallstreetbets,I'm selling mine at 90 want some?
2021-04-28 11:54:50,wallstreetbets,"You don't owe me anything, but it's obvious that the only research you did was deciding to take a contrary position to the wsb crowd. MVIS is way undervalued no matter how you calculate its value."
2021-04-28 10:24:27,wallstreetbets,"I think, the biggest thing that people mocked about MVIS was that it was a company with no product yet and all that it had was patents. If you look at today's news, there is now a very real product and it's one of the few and best in its class.

It also begs the question, ""why would the CEO approve news about this to come out today, the day before the earnings call?"" Since mid-2020 they talked about getting acquired, I think this step is a big push to see some interest from big boys in the tech industry who want to expand their verticals. Granted, this is all conjecture. I'm just excited to see the volatility."
2021-04-28 11:09:04,wallstreetbets,"No kidding lol. That's why this company is still undervalued. 

Idiot above is saying it's old tech, yet the linked article proves it blows other Lidar systems out of the park. 

This product proves they are the best at making functional lidar, and they just landed a huge contract with microsoft and the DoD for their AR tech. 

Yet this guy is saying they have no products sold. It's a either a blatant lie, or proves his ability to research is that of an elementary student."

So,  a $10b buyout would net us $65 premium per share. Although some folks are certain that all verticals together are priced at $15-20b, which would push the premium to low $100s per share."

listen, just be prepared. I hope you make your gains, get out, and dont get too screwed. If i somehow lose a few k it happens, but I honestly dont think this stock is staying this high for long."

Does this mean I want to hold my shares for some time or sell when the buyout happens? (I have a lot to learn here so forgive me)
2021-04-28 11:34:35,wallstreetbets,"MVIS lidar specs beat LAZR. The confirmation of the completed physical product is over with now. LAZR market cap sits around 8b with their lidar tech. MVIS has multiple verticals other than just lidar. It's not crap, it's speculation. If things go as planned like they have been this company will produce them late this year for purchase. I don't know why a company with ground breaking tech on the horizon would go down in pps market cap due to financial speculation"
2021-04-28 10:59:49,wallstreetbets,"Hey, no worries, ask away. So, when the buyout is announced, you'll be able to figure out what the premium will be. So will everyone else, which will likely likely drive the price of the stock close to what the premium would be. So if they announce that Ford is buying microvision for $15B, you'd be looking at ~$100 premium per share, and the stock would likely be in the $90s. 

Another thing to consider is that the purchaser may arrange a stock deal, i.e. you may be getting Some Ford stocks instead of MVIS stocks. Or it could be a mixed deal. All that said, if the buyout happens, you'll be taken care of."
2021-04-28 11:38:56,wallstreetbets,"you're missing the point. This rally started around $10/share. There should 100% be movement on their news. But a stock more than doubling? 

None of the REAL numbers around this stock are playing out naturally, this excessive increase is another GME. Yes, the company has great upside, but so do many. The price volatility is not from the PR, man. Its from Reddit."

2021-04-28 16:44:58,wallstreetbets,"Beyond the short squeeze potential, the issue with AMC still is the leadership (lack thereof). They had their entire company saved by retail investors, yet did nothing with the money. They didn't consolidate debts, reshape their brand in any way, or convert to a new business model to compete in a new industry (theatres are dying, let's face it).

Instead, they cut themselves fat checks, attempted to dilute shares and only pulled out realizing how fucked they'd be to piss off their most loyal and only remaining supporters. Plain and simple, unless the management goes I could never touch this stock again. They simply have proven to me time and time again they give zero shits about the little guy."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Understand the potential of SRNE Pipeline - Abivertinib Some people seem to be unsure about Sorrento,  how legit its chances are of actually generating revenue. So let's take a look at the drug in the most advanced stage of it's pipeline: Abivertinib

(For those who don't like to read (you should! do your homework!). bottome line: the approved drug closest in similarity, but inferior in quality, to Abivertinib, is Aztra-Zeneca's best selling product. See numbers below). 

Ok, so 1st of all, we are explaining Abivertinib as it relates to its original use target: lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, so drugs that can successfully treat it have a huge market. 

Abivertinib isn't useful for all types of lung cancer patients, most probably for about 15-20% at most. Still, this is a big market, even before we get into covid.

Abivertinib is a 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor. **Now, what does that mean?** 

1st, it means this is a relatively new type of drug. It's not a breakthrough in itself, but the effectiveness of Abivertinib seems to be. So, one thing we know, it's high tech, so to speak.

2nd, the advantage of it not being totally new: similar 3rd generation inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. So part of the approval process has already been overseen and these inhibitors have proved their worth.

**Now, what does it actually do?** Well, to explain it simply:

A certain drug is given to patients with lung cancer, that works. But after several months (up to a year), the drugs are no longer effective.

To make them effective, 2nd generation inhibitors are used (remember, Abivertinib is 3rd generation). But, these 2nd generation, have an issue: all these inhibitors (from all generations) inhibit a certain type of protein that helps the cancer spread. By inhibiting the protein, they halt the spread of the tumor. But, the 2nd generation drugs, they also inhibit the ""good proteins"", so the dosage has to be low. In other words, there is only so much of those 2nd generation drugs that can be given to the patient. It's a problem.

So 3rd generation inhibitors where created and received approval. What makes these special: they are able to inhibit only the ""bad protein"" without inhibiting ""good protein"". Or at least, way more effectively than 2nd generation at doing that. 

**Why is Abivertinib special?** First of all, it's more effective. It does its job better. In trials, it is more powerful than all current 3rd generation inhibitors.

Also, it seems to use a different ""approach"" to inhibiting, called a different ""path"". So it's actually doing something that hasn't been seen before. And doing it really well, while also being less toxic. 

**Now, how does this relate to covid?** Well, as we all know, covid attacks the lungs. And one way to treat it is using  inhibitors. These are called BTK inhibitors. Which basically means, they inhibit a different type of protein that helps covid spread its attack. So to speak.

The problem has been that the current BTK inhibitors in the market, which were a big hope for treating covid, failed. They just didn't work.

And yes, you guessed it, **Abivertinib IS a BTK inhibitor**, which currently seems to be far and away the best option out there for treating covid. Really, it is. In trials, Abivertinib is working very, very well in a very small but significant sample. 

This does/did two things. One, it opened up the option for Sorrento to offer this drug as an EUA for covid. We are not there yet,  but the FDA is interested in exactly the type of solution Abivertinib could offer: a new drug, that isn't a totally new drug, just an improvement on something that has already been tested. A EUA request can happen in the next couple months.

And 2nd:  this development opened the doors for Abivertinib to also eventually be used for treatment of certain types of leukemia and lymphomas. Larger market options.

**Bottom line:** by all current indications Abivertinib is a better option than any other 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor and the best hope for an inhibitor that works against covid.

For perspective: Targisson (the product) an approved 3rd generation drug which most resembles Abivertinib but by all standards seems to be less effective, is Astra-Zenaca's top seeling drugs with **sales of over 4 billion dollars per year.** 

This is just ONE of the drugs Sorrento (SRNE) has in it's pipeline. Just one.  This stock is undervalued in a way that people just wouldn't imagine...

If you find this interesting/useful, let me know and I'll highlight some other stuff in their pipeline in a simple to understand way. Some of the stuff there is pretty amazing."

2021-04-28 08:14:41,wallstreetbets,Another thing that is often overlooked is their massive G-Mab library. What does that mean? Antibodies are very selective molecules that attach to a specific molecule or receptor on a cell. Blocking the effect of these molecules or receptors is one of the biggest breakthroughs in science. Sorento has a library of trillions of potential antibodies. We only need to identify which specific molecules or receptors are contributing to a specific disease and sorrento can design it and produce it.

2021-04-28 08:02:57,wallstreetbets,"They actually have all types of options that have amazing potential. Like, RTX which is for pain treatment. First, it's a non-opioid drug which is exactly what the FDA wants. 2nd, it already has orphan designation, which means the FDA has basically given Sorrento the rights to developing this new type of medication. Cause this is 100% new.

Also, besides treating pain that currently can't be treated in certain types of terminal cancer, this drug can potentially be used for treating athritis pain, which is a HUGE market because it targets anyone that has lingering pain from when they practiced sports. More than 20% of American adults suffer from this. 

Sorrento is planning on filing and NDA next year. And until then, we should be getting samples of good news on this that can spike stock prices. 

So basically: a totally new drug, FDA has bought in with the orphan designation, amazing massive market, pretty advanced stage of development. 

This alone would make a clinical stage pharma company be worth the 2 billion SRNE is currently valued at."

2021-04-28 08:34:48,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. Just for comparison.

Stanford is one of the top 5 medical research institutions in the world. They have a 130k compound library (basically, a library of items that can be screened for potential new drugs). Sorrento now owns a library with over 1 million compounds. So like, 10 times larger. Plus, all the facilities to do the research. They don't need to outsource or partner. So anything they discover, is 100% theirs. 

I really wish the squeeze experts, sadly the part I understand little about, would push this stock to where it should be."

I don't have an answer for you, but I work in pharmaceuticals. Pharma companies exist that do not do their own manufacturing and are extremely profitable. Its honestly the new way. You pay a lab in a cheaper country to do all your R&D, QC, and Manufacturing. You then do all approval process stuff like regulatory affairs, advertising, and quality assurance state side. You don't want to cheap out on RA, QA, and advertising. People with the talent for those areas are state side and demand high salaries. You can go cheaper though for QC and Manufacturing."

Personally, I like countries with a national healthcare policy when investing in cancer companies that have a diversified portfolio, and especially covid related products. My original was IMMU which ended up getting bought out by GILD. I think the ability to corner an entire market by investing in a country that doesn‚Äôt care about monopolies and in fact has it built into their system is a great way to profit. They also just bought another company and it seems like the only share dilution will come from share transfer and payments made will be from future royalties and performance expectations. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sorrento-enters-merger-agreement-acquire-130000609.html"

With a NNT of 7, an antidepressant will beat doing nothing 1  time out of 7. Yup. **That's shit**.  Why? Because we know jackshit about how depression really works, and  however smooth our brains are, it appears they still remain very  complicated thing (I guess that's a good thing?).What does it mean? It  means LSD, Shrooms, or whatever shitty therapy you can imagine with  psychedelics will work for some and won't for the others. Which means  MNMD will have to share the MDD market with the approx. **50** other fucking antidepressants. Also J&J's Spravato is less invasive and has better results.
* For  anxiety. Is it gonna be the same? NO. MNMD is right on that one. The  NNT of benzos is approx. 3 depending on the study. LSD is estimated to  be around 2. That's nice.  But don't pre-order your lambo yet. Benzos  are fucking easy to use, and they are addictive. Many people won't  tolerate psychedelics, won't have the time for it, or are afraid of the  compound to begin with (thx war on drugs). The pharma industry won't let  a hipster's biotech ruin its profits. So they'll either lobby against  (if you are a physician it's good news, more free cruises in the coming  years) or bring their own psychedelic drugs on the table (and they'll be  better than acid). Acid antagonists will just compound problems. All their pipeline is based on the premise that they can safely stop a trip with this antagonist. Else the patient will be tripping balls for too long, making the treatement unpractical compared to other psychedelics and state-of-the-art anxiolytics. That mean pushing 2 pipelines plus a combined drug pipeline to reach market.
* For addiction. Didn't find anything bearish about it except that it might not get approved, like for any other biotech.
* ADHD. There's no exclusive market in selling microdosed lsd, but it might just work. The data isn't here to predict the success of the therapy yet.

**The IP :**  It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath. Almost all the psychedelic biotech  decided to work with the same exact compounds because they are inept at  innovation (more below). There gonna be a lot of overlap, and many  lawsuits. Even better, almost all the IP I found related to the  psychedelics applications is very badly written, and, put mildly, trash.  Bullish on IP law firms.

**The people :**   In biotech, the idea isn't worth anything. Execution is the only thing  that matter (and luck). So who's behind MNMD? They have anywhere between 25 and 40 employees depending on how you count,  good thing if you [work there](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindmedco/people/), you'll have a nice title for your resume as  you're either a C-suite or a director or at least a lead. And most of  them don't work-work for MNMD, they are just consultants, or also work  on some other stuff on the side, because well, you don't need that much  businessmen in such a young biotech.They outsourced all of their  innovation capacities to their academic collaborators. Which is smart.  Or not. It will make scaling up extremely tedious without acquiring  everybody else. They don't have the chemical know-how, and neither the  patents, to produce. They'll need to partner with a big pharma or  buy/merge someone, which will considerably reduce the profits. They also  don't have much expertise in regulatory affairs either so that's 1 more  (costly) outsourcing. Their current philosophy is ""throw money at it"".  Which has been proven to fail in the biotech/pharma world, see eroom's  law. What about the AI guys (the whole handful of them)? They come from the famous  HealthMode (and also related Merlon) company. Never heard of them?  Because they never put a product on the market.Basically the company is a  weird employee merger between weed company veterans, an obscure 2 California based Czechoslovak AI companies and some expensive-ass  consultant-executives.

TL;DR : Mindmed is  trying hard to appear as the next big thing but all they have is a  highly contested pipeline of low-innovation drugs. They are stretched  thin between Drug Development and AI and lack the proper verticality to  achieve success, but are too high-level to succeed as an horizontal  growth company. Ride the hype while it lasts i guess.

Obviously just a rant, not financial advice."

Yet your weak ass paperhanded reptilian brain is scared. Here's why.

**The product** : So basically like almost all its competitors ([atai-linked](https://www.atai.life/programs/), [numinus](https://numinus.ca/clinics), [cybin](https://www.cybin.com/), etc) this company decided ~~not to invest in any meaningful drug discovery.

Candy-flipping is not ""next-gen"", sorry. Ibogain derivatives are not that good.~~  **>>>They are working with MindShift (from Switzerland on next generation psychedelics and have filed patents immediately for at least 2 brand new compounds. There are also other promising leads. This avenue, however, will reap benefits 15 years from now. In the meantime, MindMed is focused on currently available psychedelics, especially LSD. They are by far the most advanced with LSD than ANY other competitor. Derivatives of Ibogain are no good? BS. 18-MC is off the charts. Do you even research?<<<**

It could also potentially be fast tracked, as its a non hallucinogenic.

Ibogaine has too far great risks with toxicity ... imagine behing able to tackle the opioid crisis wjth even a slight 30-60% success rate even.

Also, we do know how depression works. Its a lack of communication between parts of your brain. Ever see a MRI scan of a brain on psilocybin or lsd? Its like conparing a highway at 3am, to rush hour.

Lota of universities are now offering new courses for therapists and counseling with psychedelic treatments.  This is here, its right at our door step. Not going anywhere. Big Pharma will eventually scoop us up tbh...

3. you make a lot of assumptions without proving it like ‚Äûmany people wont tolerate psychadelics‚Äú thats just not true, it depends on what psychadelics and you can stop the experiance with other drugs

Getting treated for depression sucks. No one wants fucking ED or the other heap of sideeffects.

2021-04-28 09:50:23,wallstreetbets,"I think this rant makes some really great points.  What Id add or argue is that realistically, turning an illegal drug into a regulated pharmaceutical is going to be a very difficult long path. As you can see addicts are targeted as a key demographic, well why wouldn't these addicts just go ahead and buy these drugs illegally to solve their addiction problem? They already participate in the illicit market so have no issue with illegality.  If you do some research, that is precisely what they are already doing. They are actually buying magic mushrooms etc illegally to help with their anxiety or addiction issues as they, like everyone else, are reading these studies as they are reported in the press. In the end, I see many of these psychedelics becoming legal but difficult to patent or protect with IP in any substantive way.   Im invested in Red Light Holland (TRIP/TRUFF) heavily for this reason as Bruce Linton has experience with this idea of turning the illegal into legal with regulations with his success with Canopy. That being said,  I have a small position in Mind med too due to the versatility of their studies. Im also invested in Field Trip as it has its hands in everything. I think the psychedelics investor community is currently blinded by companies focused on studies which will take years and require lots of luck. Legislation for legalization/decriminalization seems like it will outpace these studies and at any rate, I see consumers mostly preferring an organic natural substance as opposed to the synthetic pill.  Even celebrities are already microdosing.  How is Mind Med or Compass going to charge hundreds of dollars for a pill in 3-5 years which is already so cheap illegally? I dont see it.  They are making the same mistakes that they did with Cannabis just in a different way. My two cents at least"

2021-04-28 09:51:01,wallstreetbets,$4.20 is not a meme
2021-04-28 09:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Three flaws with what you're saying:

1. The NNT will improve.  There has only been one study that directly compared psilocybin to an SSRI, and by all educated accounts (I'm a psychologist who studies psychedelics), it was a VERY poorly conducted study for a variety of reasons.  Many researchers in the field were pissed off about how much of a faceplant that study was and how it hurt the whole field's reputation.  Hold tight, and the next wave of better-designed studies will show what some of the earlier exploratory research started to show: psilocybin is much more potent at treating depression than SSRIs.
2. From what I understand, the junk IP that companies like Compass have been pushing is part of a ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" strategy.  I think they know there's a lot of junk, and that's just some internecine warfare between companies.  I'm speculating here, but I don't think the success of these companies is going to come from IP.  It's going to come from partnerships with other entities in the medical field.
3. Oral dissolving formulations (which several companies are developing) will shorten the time frame of drugs like psilocybin without the need for an antagonist and all the problems that would come with them.  So, that's one novel, patentable formulation of a known compound that isn't bullshit and will have an appreciable effect on the cost effectiveness of the therapy.  MNMD might be more LSD-centric, so maybe this doesn't help them, but let's not paint the whole field with the same brush.  

That being said, I am skeptical about MNMD as ""the one"" to buy.  It's currently overvalued, it will be years before the company's profitability will be put to the test.  I'm planning to invest in the Horizons Psychedelic ETF, since the field as a whole is sure to explode, albeit in a way that makes it hard to pick winners.  But I'm not going to throw all my money into it yet, since it will be years before it exits the hype cycle and gets to real profitability."
2021-04-28 09:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Investing in MindMed right now is basically betting that psychedelics as a treatment class will vastly outperform the current class of prescription drugs available for mental health disorders (which have atrocious results and crippling side effects for the most part). MindMed is the industry leader and has a ton of cash.

I'm happy to bet on this sector through MindMed. I'm also extremely bearish about Big Pharma and the efficacy of conventional medicine at large vs. the risks, so that factors into my bullish stance on this company."

I am long on Mind Med but i know that some or all the outcomes could flop but its the chance you take. They have a lot of the big medical minds working on it and they are getting a lot of support from universities - hopefully we can get some institutional money behind it to progress it along.

Something I think gets overlooked is how psychedelic treatment is attractive to addicts who can‚Äôt or refuse to take the normal depression or anxiety for fear of relapsing again. Addicts make up a solid % of people suffering with depression and other mental health issues. Psychedelics offer a better alternative than the medicine today.

2021-04-28 12:34:22,wallstreetbets,"NNT is relevant, but so in NNH. the NNH for benzos is super low. Xanax is shit. benzo withdrawal is deadly.  

antidepressants and benzos do jack shit for opioid addiction and alcoholism.

you raise some legit concerns. but i think you overstate the problem with an NNT of 7. Enalapril vs placebo is an NNT of 100 for CHF death over the course of 1 year. Warfarin has an NNT of 22 to prevent Venous Thromboembolism.  

Statins for low risk patients has an NNT of like 160 to prevent an MI.

2021-04-28 12:40:56,wallstreetbets,"A good read for a deep dive into psychedelics and their potential for therapy is How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan. Great author and fascinating read. Between that and my own experiences, I have no doubt that psychedelics can make great medicine, but he raises some very good questions about how likely it is to be a good business.

The best results were coming from 8 hour sessions with two therapists. Also, the benefits of  a single session lasted quite a long time. So, a lot of human labor for a medication that you don't take everyday. Not at all scalable. I think it's going to be more of an inexpensive medication that's sold directly to specialized therapists, rather than a mass market drug."
2021-04-28 12:42:06,wallstreetbets,Shrooms could replace all of those or at least be an alternative. You‚Äôve obviously never done them and don‚Äôt know how healing they can be.
2021-04-28 12:42:26,wallstreetbets,"I think you underestate the efficacy of psychedelic assisted therapies. For instance, Dr. Griffiths found an 85% success rate for smoking cessation after a single dose of psylocibin. Compare against other leading treatments (craving reduction drugs for instance).

Bupoprion apparently has a 75% reported positive effect. But that's not after *a single dose* like in the case for psylocibin. And that's just for nicotine addiction. Ibogaine has had a very impressive success rate to treat addictions of a more dangerous type (see that god-tier DD you linked to). MNMD is pursuing a non toxic version of this compound (Ibogaine is dangerous in itself) to treat those types of addictions. And this compound is *proprietary*. 

There is good research on end of life anxiety treatment using psychedelics. However, those studies are limited. Basically, the studies exist because the patient was terminal. So the study could be done ""safely"". There still isn't enough rigourous research on psychedelic assisted therapies to treat anxiety in non-terminal patients. Nor is there enough rigorous research done on psychedelic assisted therapies to treat all sorts of other mental health disorders. 

The potency of psychedelic compounds is proven. But you seem to imply that we know what we need to know about them because we've been studying them since the 50s. Which I think is misleading. Considering there has been a war on them since then, studies have been made extraordinarily difficult. And what little research has been done has shown that psychedelics are very promising as medicine. Now there is big boy capital being raised to do this research and to bring a product to market. 

You make some good points that are worth thinking about, especially about competition. But as of now MNMD is blowing the competition out of the water. It could be that when the research results come out and they are less than favorable (hint, we've already gotten some results and they have been boss AF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYisIQ9Z40&t=508s) then we will have a much better bear case. 

Your points about competition is real. The leading competitors in the sector simply do not have the pipeline or the staff that MNMD. It doesn't matter to what extent staff are involved in MNMD. Most companies in the sector are young and operate roughly the same. It's not like Gabor Mate is working in the Nanaimo lab for NUMI. 

The thing is that this sector is new which will bring more capital in to do proper research. And considering the research we do have already suggests strong results. I am confident more research will simply further substantiate the effectiveness of psychedelics as medicine. And so far, MNMD is ahead of the pack. 

I think your best bearish point is big pharma not taking kindly to a potential new kid on the block acting as a disruptor. This is sort of both a bull and bear case. If big pharma is threatened that means MNMD is the real deal. But frankly, that's still years into the future. Lots could happen between now and then. As an investor I look at the pipeline, the research, the business model and the CEO. I also look at [CIBC being in on MNMD](https://www.wfmz.com/news/pr_newswire/pr_newswire_health/mindmed-files-final-prospectus-in-connection-with-bought-deal-equity-financing/article_8ebaa445-ec02-54f5-8da1-0bd4d65bd950.html). 

I'm still bullish on MNMD while being aware that yes, this is a spec stock."

The psilocybin experience worked wonders and the idea is that it connects the neural pathways in so many ways that it almost creates a highway around these pervasive thoughts.  Im 100% bullish on psilocybin but i admit that Im not sure the best company to go with.  I can say i enjoy each of their directions and why do we need to choose just one.

For comparison, the NNT for statin drugs given for five years, in order to prevent heart disease in people who have no history of heart disease, is 104. That means that 104 people have to take statins in order to prevent one extra person from having a heart attack"

2021-04-28 13:55:54,wallstreetbets,Mindmed will be at least 50 dollars in two years. Especially if Joe Biden starts talking about alternative mental health treatments. His son Hunter is a HUGE advocate for psychedelic therapies.
2021-04-28 14:03:24,wallstreetbets,MNMD's share price will continue to fluctuate based on volume alone.... just like other pinny stocks.  Whether you gain or lose will be based entirely on what large shareholders choose to do that day.

2021-04-28 16:47:48,wallstreetbets,"Solid post. It will take them a while to get off the ground. Academia --> market is always difficult. But we can't ignore the massive strides in research in this field recently. 

Yes, we're basically going back to where we were in the 50s. But I think the future is bright. MindMed will go up, but it's likely it won't survive in the long-term. With nine nascent research projects in early stages, they have a lot of options. 

To me, the ketanserin project is exciting. Ketanserin blocks seratonin receptor 2A, responsible for hallucinations. Psilocybin-dosed, depressed mice given ketanserin got the antidepressant effects of psiloycbin without hallucinations. 

But this is one of ~ten projects, all of which are in very early stages, and any of which could fail. But really, all MindMed needs is one of these projects to go to market. 

IMO, I'm going to give it to the end of the year and re-evaluate then."
2021-04-28 16:49:32,wallstreetbets,How do we know the ibogaine derivative is crap when they're still testing it and it showed promising results in rats?
2021-04-28 16:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Well done! Having suffered from major depression and personality dysfunctions for most of my life and going through a number of therapies, with the one most effective being the thought that if things didn't go well I could always kill myself I'm always heartened to learn of the possibility of new, effective treatments. Unfortunately, as stated, these don't usually prove out. My depression lifted on its own a number of years ago; the personality dysfunctions are less of a problem now that we have a pandemic that limits my interactions with others so things are going well."

2021-04-28 18:32:31,wallstreetbets,"I've never been a big fan of pharmaceutical companies. One failure can be so devastating. Maybe Mindmed does make it to the double digits (im hoping they do), but as soon as they mess up..their stock is going to crater hard. I still remember ARCT dropping 50% overnight and they still haven't recovered."
2021-04-28 07:13:45,wallstreetbets,"Listen, the only microdosing substance to treat psychological disorders that government will approve in the short term is probably ketamine. In my view, they will not approve psychedelic mushrooms to be used medically in the short term. Not to mention recreational use, that‚Äôs 10-20 years down the line."
2021-04-28 08:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you brought up the NNT because this is something that I‚Äôve been wondering about. Not only are they competing with current classes of medications like SSRIs and Benzo‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre also competing with medications that have been around for a LONG time, like MDMA and Ketamine, that are being investigated for the treatment of depression with promising results. Unless their LSD compound absolutely blows these alternatives out of the park (and they can actually patent it), there would be no sense in prescribing a medication that is 100 times more expensive when it ONLY gives comparable results. 

Not going to lie, (unfortunately) branding and marketing does make a difference in rate of prescriptions and profitably for medications. But if you have an inferior product, movements like FOAMed that are widely followed by a great many physicians will figure it out pretty quickly. I guarantee the difficulty in  marketing for drugs today differs pretty substantially from just 10 or 15 years ago. 

This isn‚Äôt like a cancer drug which tend to have very niche applications, and therefore fewer alternatives."

When it looks more promising they will swoop in and buy up companies at that point instead of putting a ton of effort into early-stage r&d
2021-04-28 12:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Big pharma WILL swoop in. Johnson and Johnson has already gained approval for an esketamine spray used in the treatment of depression.

I think the best option for MMED is to get bought out by a large drug company, that's about as far as they will go."
2021-04-28 09:53:39,wallstreetbets,"MMED makes up for most of my portfolio. I don't agree with some things OP wrote. A few things OP missed is the shift from big pharma towards natural products, the increasing amount of documentaries about psychedelics, the increasing amount of clinical studies, the push for decriminalization and legalization and so on. The market of ""natural products"" it's getting bigger and more people are realizing the war on drugs helped no one but the government.

Another one to look for (not available on WS) is Field Trip. They already released an app and they have 5 physical locations (1 in Toronto) where they're conducting ketamine-assisted therapy.

I'm hoping for nation-wide decriminalization in Canada in the next 5 years, and Canada (again) will have the lead for when they'll expand into the US. Let's not forget even universities have courses/programs for psychedelics-assisted therapies."

The book goes over personal stories of people that went through the therapies and what they experienced afterward.

2021-04-28 12:52:24,wallstreetbets,"> well why wouldn't these addicts just go ahead and buy these drugs illegally to solve their addiction problem?

The drugs aren't a miracle cure. what MNMD is in the business of is ""psychedelic assisted *therapies*"". And they are not just developping the drug, they are developping the distribution and treatment infrastructure. 

People who treat addicts are the ones who would be using these drugs. The drugs being illegal means there is no proven protocol for treatment and also means it's fucking illegal for a therapist to use them. But if it's legal and there is a scientifically proven safe way to use the drugs then the people who treat addiction have a tool for treatment. 

In addition to this, MNMD has a proprietary ibogaine based compound that the are developping. Ibogaine which has a good track record of treating addicts is also dangerous physically. But research and compounds developped from Ibogaine could help make it safe to use in treatment. 

As for the decrim thing, as I understand it decrim doesn't need to happen for a drug to pass FDA approval. 

> I see consumers mostly preferring an organic natural substance as opposed to the synthetic pill

Maybe, if stigma is lifted. That seems to be what NUMI is aiming itself. I see the general population continuing to believe the drug war lies and being more prone to buy a branded product than buying something with an in-built fear inducing messaging. Like LSD. I mean, cannabis is good for pain relief. But tylenol outsells it even though it's legal. People (unfortunately) trust the lab coats."

Likewise, if someone is in a poor state of mind, psychedelics might amplify those feelings and leave them with a traumatic experience if they never used psychedelics before. On those shows, people with addiction issues would typically relapse shortly after. Microdosing with MDMA and psychedelics might be more effective.

You have to listen  to one of the fathers of psychedelic research, who has been conducting research for more than 30 years. In Europe,  they have been doing research for much longer than in the u.s.

Here is a quote by one of the fathers of psychedelic research translated by google when asked asked about his research

 ""However, the researcher would not speak of a ‚Äúchild prodigy‚Äù for a long time, as he distinguishes himself from the American euphoria.  And calls headlines, according to which one is cured forever after a single dose, as ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù: ‚ÄúThat is the American groove, their belief in feasibility.  The Americans have an idea, grab it and run. ""  Psychiatry in Europe is more grounded.  He himself has already had inquiries from young American investors who see psychedelics as the business that is being done with cannabis in the USA today.  They'd rather patent a substance like psilocybin today rather than tomorrow.""

I don't really trust any test results regarding anxiety when the item you are consuming has be prohibited and policed to such an extent. I also doubt the people who have already used mushrooms to cure their depression would want to do a study, nor would they need to. I sure as hell wouldn't. Do these studies control for prohibition and the fact that legal repercussion may be brought out by the federal government? In my state you can get a possession charge if you have a metabolite in your blood.  


I think you have good arguments, and you may be right, but I think you undervalue the cultural importance and value already placed in mushrooms since they started singing about them in the 60s.

2021-04-28 09:23:23,wallstreetbets,We know what it does. We do not know exactly why it works.
2021-04-28 09:55:47,wallstreetbets,"Increases serotonin concentration at the synapse by blocking reuptake, but people with an without depression have equal serotonin levels and activation, so clearly there's something more to the problem of depression, potentially a downstream effect of serotonin activation, but there's no proof of any molecular concentration differences between regular and depressed people, only proof that the treatments like SSRIs help people with depression in one way or another.

There's also the possibility that it's a purely psychological issue, but depression running in a family is somewhat counterevidence to this, but at the same time you could imagine how being raised by depressed people could affect somebody's psyche."

2021-04-28 08:22:37,wallstreetbets,It does work like that. In 1 year anyone is free to make a 18-MC drug for addiction uses. You might be thinking of a NDA if you believe they can protect it longer.
2021-04-28 09:04:26,wallstreetbets,"totally agree on the second point. I'm not going to pretend I'm some biotech guru, because I'm definitely not, but when there is a lot of competition and there isn't exclusive protection from them having patented/discovered a novel compound its concerning. and that is if they are able to bypass all the other hurdles, one of them being the scheduled 1 designation that you mentioned."
2021-04-28 13:20:36,wallstreetbets,This is also a good point but I don't think it's the same thing.  A majority of the population probably wouldn't want to buy something from an illegal source.  You may be right but I think it's an apples to oranges thing.

Other things worked though.

2021-04-28 15:32:44,wallstreetbets,"I think what the OP is saying is that even if you believe psychedelics have a future in medicine (which I agree, I think they do), MNMD itself doesn't necessarily have an edge over the competition at this point in the game. Not as a company, and their product doesn't necessarily have an edge over current medications either. I bought MNMD months ago because I also believe in the movement, but I'm not putting all my eggs in this one basket. Because the likelihood of MNMD becoming the Pfizer of psychedelics is MUCH lower than pychedelics themselves making it as a legitimate treatment.
This is just my interpretation, not even advice, let alone investing advice. I like the stonk."

2021-04-28 16:29:50,wallstreetbets,"No, in the US."
2021-04-28 10:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes but it's especially pertinent in biotech. I can't remember the exact stat, but it's something like all but 1 of the top 25 most profitable drugs since 2008 were created in biotech. Most were then bought out by pharma.

It's because pharma is a sales industry, biotech is a medicine industry. It makes sense for pharma to achieve economies of scale in salesmanship while outsourcing the creation of new drugs.

Not only is it time consuming to create a new drug, but it's expensive. The average cancer drug biotech needs $200M off the bat. The average success rate of a cancer biotech is 5%. The average upside is about $20B over 15ish years. It makes sense that pharma lets VC fund biotech and then eats biotech up when it succeeds because pharma doesn't have the cash to run 150 parallel biotechs in order to diversify away the risk of pipeline failure.

Great video about the current financial ecosystem for biotech and pharma from a financial economist at MIT.  https://youtu.be/223uT_FJ36Q"
2021-04-28 08:57:28,wallstreetbets,To be fair

2021-04-28 19:00:02,wallstreetbets,"You very well may be right.  I want to invest in this but I'm concerned their methods will be difficult to implement profitably and I'm not sure what's to stop their competitors from copying their methods.  Knowing how patients operate, I'm not convinced that they'll be open to spending the money required to make this profitable.

I think MindMed would have a better shot if the DEA keeps these substances controlled and as a schedule II.  This way patients would be forced to see a prescriber and a therapist, as it is with suboxone and insurances would have to cover it.  However, it seems that we're clear on the road to legality."

2021-04-28 10:33:25,wallstreetbets,Your still making money in the end is the point. Difference is I will support before and through a rough patch just to make a decent profit I don't need maximum profit every time. That's greed at its finest and fighting greed with greed only ends bad.

2021-04-28 16:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol thats pretty ignorant to say. Not only in the sense that obviously ""most"" aren't but also what makes criminals bad businessmen? Bootleggers were criminals but were the starting point of many modern day fortunes and now everything they were doing can be done legally. You were a criminal if you held physical gold after 1933 but people who kept it and didnt give it to the government for a fraction of the market value were swimming in money.   


The funny part about ""illegal"" is it only fits within CURRENT definitions of the law. So somebody who would have been a criminal 100 years ago is now considered a businessman/entrepreneur. Everything is relative, besides the obvious offenses that leave no room for interpretation (rape/murder/theft) criminals of today could very well be working within the law tomorrow."

In terms of ""competition"", what other antidepressant therapy offers this type of profound experience?

Yes the report of an experience being profound is anecdotal, but a diagnosis of depression or anxiety is also based on the person's anecdotes as to how they feel.

I agree we don't really understand how this works or what it means (both the condition and the treatment), but the whole field is anecdotes and if people are reporting it helps, then we have to accept that it helps."

Additionally, this lidar sensor is designed to be immune to interference from sunlight and other lidars. One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,‚Äù added Sharma. ‚ÄúWe believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature.‚Äù"

2021-04-28 06:58:16,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0630. Nothing doing a day after more sideways action for major indices. Earnings results drove moves for individual stocks but there were no catalysts to shift the broader market.

Today is going to be about the Fed. The FOMC interest rate decision and accompanying statement is due at 1400 followed by the Fed press conference at 1430. Interest rates will stay where they are but it‚Äôs all about the commentary from Powell & Co.

Investors will be looking for any discussions of tapering and inflation. Last month Powell was able to convince markets (barely) that he was standing pat even with higher consumer prices. Any hint at all that his conviction is wavering will spook markets. Bonds are selling off a bit this morning, perhaps in anticipation, with the 10-year up about 130 bps to 1.64%.

We also have earnings today: Boeing, Ford, Qualcomm, eBay, and MGM Resorts during market hours. Apple and Facebook after the close.

If that weren‚Äôt enough we also hear from President Biden tonight, but that news (of higher taxes on capital gains and income for the uber wealthy) is already out, so would not expect there to be much of a market reaction to the speech. 

Earnings results have been positive and guidance mostly optimistic, including for consumer names (Starbucks raised its full-year outlook) and reopening plays (airlines are expecting better days ahead. JetBlue did so yesterday). Big picture things are probably set up for us to keep moving higher."

2021-04-28 09:56:27,wallstreetbets,"BEES and HEMP vs COTTON Facts.   

**Bees** are vital to the production of both conventional and organic **cotton** because of their role as a pollinator. Studies have shown that there are many benefits to **cotton** growth derived from insect pollination. They are linked to increases in **cotton** production, seed production and fibre quality.

**Bees** play a significant role in the ecosystem, **pollinating** about one-third of the global food supply. ... **Hemp does** not produce nectar, but **hemp's** impact on **bees** is valuable because the crop produces a large amount of pollen. When other crops are not available, **bees** can **pollinate hemp**.

HERE'S THE THANG,  It's time we heavily invest in HEMP, not only to save the bees but also for the survival of cotton. 

Follow the problem and the money will flow."

2021-04-28 10:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Same story every time.  Stock beats big time, pops after-hours and then sells off at the open.  Over the next couple of days it regains and gets to a new high.  Look at AN, LAD and many others. 

AMD beat handily and showed that they ate INTC's lunch.  The stock tipped 90 after-hours and now it is struggling to hold a 1% gain because the overall market is selling off or sluggish.  

AMD and NVDA are cheap at these levels.  It is only a matter of time before they are the standard for Data Centers and continue to innovate.  AMD is working on the next 5 year plan and INTC is struggling to figure out how it got killed from all angles.  (Apple goes to it's own chips, AMD takes share in Data Centers, their technology is not competitive anymore and they have supply chain issues.)"

They NEED to unexpectedly surpass shareholder expectations tomorrow. If they don't - you'll see a drop. Don't get in yet. Be patient. If it goes up, it's a better buy in this scenario than buying high and being stuck in the low. Not all shooting stars that drop are worth catching.

2021-04-28 13:07:44,wallstreetbets,"   ""Jerome Powell, nervously wringing his hands together, reluctantly steps in front of the podium. He squints hard as he tries to gain his bearings. Were the fluorescent lights always this bright? He couldn't remember. The recording lights on camera rigs 3, 4, and 5 snap sharp salutes as they blink on, signaling to his guts to twist in abject horror of what was to come. His assistant flashes a meek thumbs-up to Jerome from the safety of the darkness behind the cabal of unblinking observers. As he stares at his note card with the desperation-filled eyes of a drowning swimmer silently pleading with a lifeguard who doesn't see him, his vision becomes occluded; a combination of his forehead perspiration and tears. 


Unable to come to grips with the report to be, he instead pulls out his engraved Federal Reserve lighter. He gives a weak smile to his trusty tool, which he used to set fire to the value of the US dollar. But, that smile quickly contorts into a grimace of pain as he immolates himself in front of a captive audience. Unable to scream, he is slowly mummified by the super-heated wrappings of his polyster suit. As he is slowly shrink-wrapped to the floor, he drops his note card. As if it delights in the macabre display before it, the card flits playfully to and fro, before landing daintily at an angle before the the cameras, proudly displaying its written contents as a badge of honor: ""Today, we're raising interest rates by 0.001%.""


Inhuman shrieks sound from the crowd, as the conflagration spreads to the rest of the building. Every single adult in the country is rendered jobless and homeless, as the dollar's value plunges to negative one million. Every portfolio is flash-liquidated in a chorus of cacophonic panic. SPY closes the day at $7. GME blasts off to three million per share for some fucking reason."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Who poked the bear? As an europoor myself, I don't watch CNBC. Especially late-nights.  
But yesterday, I've stayed late just to see maestro (cocaine snorting, hand waving bear-sucker, which is afraid of stocks with high short interest).  
He mentioned the ""mob of wsb"" I think like 10 times. Also said that degenerates made AMC and GME worth something and most probably made something from nothing. And seems like it's MVIS time.  
So I was wondering, being not a fan of JC - he started mentioning WSB actively just lately (after Jan GME rocket) or he is picking on WSB for quite some time?  
Also I think he wants to say, that he is harassed and doesn't like this. Who poked the bear again? Somebody posted something on his twitter again? I just can't track the whole story and also lazy to search for it, maybe fellow ameritards can describe the whole background briefly especially on late developments?"

Meanwhile WSB is actually just posting sheep memes. He'll be fine."

2021-04-28 09:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is the consummate insider and realist. 

A great investor, if he was private, if he did happen to get burned initially in the GME story, I think he would have taken his losses and go long for the ride. JMO.

This will one of the great all-time stories on the street and the first display of real muscle by the ""organized"" retail investor all thanks to the reddit platform. 

Don't kid yourselves, the HFs have had their own dark web reddit-like platform in play for decades, with mouthpieces in the media and especially CNBC pushing their narrative.

So here is my take on GME. 

Will it hit $10,000 a share? Maybe, but look to the government to step in at some point. The investment/financial community routinely pays off politicians- Biden has been one of their water-carriers ever since he was elected. And they can use connections and options to push the day of reckoning out months, hoping that the retail investors will tire and cash in.

WSB has 10 million members. How many actively trade stocks? I would say all of them. How many have been burned at some time by the shenanigans of HFs and know it? Well, let's say half. So they hate the HFs. But it takes more than hate to pull this off.

Now, how many members have been successful enough at investing and have been burned enough by the HFs to want to jump into GME and buy 100 shares?  And hang on to them in a non-margin account for months or years if necessary and  risk losing a large amount of money just to stick it to the HFs and a corrupt system (the DTCC and Cede&co)? 

Let's say about 5%. That percentage includes me.

So 500,000 motivated retail investors hanging on to 100 shares each is 50  million shares total- five million more than the 45 million share float.

There is no strength in diversity, only in unity!"
2021-04-28 04:55:19,wallstreetbets,My view is he‚Äôs laying down the tracks for a narrative of who to blame when things go south for his pals over the coming weeks / months and shorts have to cover. Gotta paint retail as the bad guy and make it look like a movement or co-ordinated attack on markets.... edited to add: his performances yesterday were so clearly scripted and the acting was so poor it was laughable.
2021-04-28 08:11:11,wallstreetbets,"As I occasionally watch him, I try to understand what it is I find so annoying about him.

I think with him, it‚Äôs that whiny Jay Leno‚Äôish voice he has that has reached cartoonish proportions.
Your brain just starts to tune out the words he is actually saying and if someone immediately asks you ‚Äúwhat did he just say?‚Äù It‚Äôd be 50/50 whether you‚Äôd be able to repeat it."

The earnings call date is May 4th. VMS Eve has a history of flying 2 weeks in advance before an actual test flight, as shown from the last couple of test flights. Now, May 4th is 6 days away, and there is a very high probability that they will announce the test flight window then, since VMS Eve just did its test flight. When they do, history will repeat itself (again), and the price will rally. I highly doubt there will be another delay based purely off the fact that VMS Eve just flew a couple of hours ago.

2021-04-28 09:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Labs will have manned orbital flight in 2023 according to the CEO, and they have already launched and maintain satellites in orbit from their launch vehicle for customers. So revenue's exist and seem to be a better play on the upcoming sector if you want to play tourism. I am invested in them and used to be in VG up until late last year.

  
When competition exists like it currently does in the space sector and with the barrier to spaceflight seemingly coming down radically... it seems VG's prime product already had a limited window of monopoly before it would be surpassed, but that's if it was running TODAY. Specifically in the cost to experience ratio, price obviously matters. So if SpaceX and other orbital launch companies continue to evolve at their current pace I wouldn't bet on VG being a profitable investment or venture at this point. 

Put it this way; I ask myself if I had a disposable $250k (ticket price) to spend on a 90 minute suborbital flight, would I? I wouldn't and I say that as a huge space nerd who would wants to go to space though. With the current rate of development I would rather save the capital, invest the $250k, and wait a few years to see what happens. I'd rather hope to spend $500k in a few years to spend a day or two in space then have such a minute experience by comparison. But of course there is probably a market for those wanting short trips, I'm just not sure that the current price point justifies it myself. It could be successful. I just don't see a bright future personally and I almost want to say it's a cheap imitation for early adopters of space tourism to get a taste of what's to come. An awesome experience I'm sure, but a watered down one that I imagine will never break even fiscally. It could just be me being optimistic about the timelines of other companies, but DD and all."

Technical Analysis on Multiple Timeframes for $CLOV - all aboard!

I'd like to keep this pretty straight forward and easy to understand why I am bullish on $CLOV by looking at the charts to seek confirmation with multiple indicators, on multiple time frames.

First I will explain what indicators I use, what they mean, and what else is on my chart, then we will see what the charts say to me.  I am no expert but I have seen a few charts by now.

*Indicators used:*

* **Market Stages (top left)**:  Gives an estimate of what stage the stock appears to be in, either *Acceleration, Accumulation, Distribution, and Deceleration.*
* **Heikin-Ashi Candles:**  I am using Heikin-Ashi style candles, which basically stay 1 color, based on the trend.  So you can see, *BUY when its GREEN, SELL when it turns RED.*
* **200 day Moving Average (purple line):**  This is typically a key level that needs to be defended against bears, and it *tends to signal a strong reversal.  (I also have some 8 and 21 day EMAs)*
* **Standard Deviation Channels:**  The broken light blue lines above, below, and in the center of the chart *show us the trend,* as well as upper & lower deviations of the current price.
* **MACD overlaying TTM Squeeze:**  This is a special combination I like to use as they seem to support each other.  *TTM Squeeze shows momentum + trend.  MACD also confirms the trends* and offers buy or sell signals depending on whether the pink line crosses the darker line.  I always use these for an Entry and Exit.  For entries I use 1m and 5m timeframes, if they are supported by 30m / 1hr / and daily timeframe signals.
* **Buy / Sell Signals** (white arrows on MACD/TTM):  These are not to be used for trading but for giving *estimates on where a good point of Entry and Exit may be!*  On shorter time frames, you will see many more white / red arrows which are less useful than the ones on Longer timeframes!
* **RSI & Volume:**  *RSI is famous for its use by algos to determine OverBought, and OverSold movements!*  Its great when it supports the other indicators in an oversold / underbought territory.  Volume also is the leading indicator of momentum.

***light green & yellow squiggles are just there to help guide you,*** and see the patterns that I am seeing.  Obviously it can go against all these indicators, so they serve as a historical reference here to show a pattern.  I believe we are in the best position to load up here at all time lows..  so lets fuckin go!

\---------------------------------------------------

BELOW:  This is the Weekly Chart.  As you can see it says deceleration on the top left.  This is ok because the stock is so young id just ignore that since we've clearly bottomed out now.

* Heikin Ashi are GREEN.
* We appear to have found a bottom in April, rejecting the lower deviation of $6.35, and there appears to be strong momentum to keep us above the center deviation.  (The 200-day MA isnt on this chart yet)
* You can see that every time the center deviation has been broken through the depressed action of the short-sellers.
* MACD is signaling a reversal to the upside, and the red in the TTM Squeeze appears to be maxed out.  It will obviously take a few more weeks to see confirmation of reversal on the TTM, but MACD wants to cross over.
* RSI is not overbought.  Note the previous patterns, and note our beloved 5/21 options expiration date.  (yes I drew what I imagine the RSI will do lol, since thats what it does)



&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BELOW:  This is the Daily Chart - much more important than the weekly chart above..

* We are in an **Acceleration** Stage.
* **Heikin Ashi are VERY GREEN**, despite the continued attack by short sellers.  This shows buyers are in charge here.
* 200 day-MA finally appears.  It is at the center deviation, and shows our
* **Main resistance is that 10$ area.  Once we break through, we will trend towards the upper deviation of 14$ to our target area.**
* We can see, every time there is a 1-2 month Base, there is a strong upward reversal.  Likely, we are witnessing a battleground, and after Chammath promoted gamestop in January, short sellers went after him.  They went WAY TO AGGRESSIVELY here on clover, and have only provided us the absolute best loading zone.
* TTM Squeeze AND MACD both show an **incredible reversal.**
* We have **3 BUY signals** on the daily chart.  Each one was followed by a fantastic run.  Currently..  we are right smack dab in the middle of the latest buy signal (white arrow)
* RSI is not overbought.  Any volume will send it into overbought territory, so here is a great loading zone.
* Also worth noting that **we TRIPLE bottomed now.  SUPER BULLISH.**
* **There is currently a Bull Pennant forming.**

*Processing img v2mfhcpausv61...*

BELOW:  This is the 4 hour chart - and not as useful for equity, but it supports the bullish thesis anyway.

* We are in Accumulation - that means Buyers are in control, and this would support the overall trend on the above Daily chart!.
* Heikin Ashi are Green.  - BULLISH.
* We have another Buy Signal.   BULLISH.
* RSI not overbought.   BULLISH.
* Trending along the Center Deviation.
* and Aggressive action is holding us ABOVE the 200-day moving average signaling a lot of strength here.
* **Once we break through 10$ we should have no problem getting up to 14$**

*Processing img siw1vspausv61...*

BELOW:  Here is the 1 Hour Chart.

* **Stage is Accelerating.  This agrees with the Daily and 4 hr chart.  BULLISH.**
* We keep **breaking back above the 200-day MA** ***purple line*** after the recent triple bottom.  BULLISH.
* **This past week is forming a low volume bull pennant** considering the deviation channels show an up-trend and we are riding that center / 200 day.  The sustained move we have had the past few days is the wavering flag / **pennant on the right side.**  
* It is also making **Higher Lows** each week (we see \~3-4 weeks here)
* **Upper Deviation and recent high show $10.70$ will be our target** this week given a continuation in the bullish momentum and with a little help from papa Joe

&#x200B;

*Processing img jbq3dbpausv61...*

BELOW:  Finally, here is the 30 minute.  Its less useful unless you are day trading but it supports the bull-thesis.

* Stage:  Accumulation : BULLISH.
* Deviation Channels show upward-trend - BULLISH.
* Riding the center deviation channel UP above and rejecting the 200 day crossover.   (Purple Line). BULLISH.
* Buy Indicator (white arrow) into Tomorrow!
* RSI has room up!
* Volume..  needs..  BIDEN..  MENTIONING..  MEDICARE..  EXPANSION!

*Processing img lxlnpbpausv61...*

* **Whats great is the S*****hort Term timeframes*** **(30m and 1hr) have an up-trend, and it is** ***supported by a reversal*** **in the indicators on the** ***Long Term*** **time-frames where the deviation channels haven't yet begun to support a long term reversal (likely also because this stock is less than a year old!!!). THIIS IS BULLISH AMONG ALL TIMEFRAMES.**
* **Unfortunately, the short-sellers have lost control as noted by the Triple Bottom on the daily chart & the battle above the 200-day moving average (purple line)**
* **I will be surprised if we dont break 10$ this week** (if not tomorrow, when Biden talks about Medicare Expansion), So get in NOW or get in LATE.
* **All we need is** ***Volume!***  *Thats it!*

Hopefully this provides some bullish views on $CLOV, as well as helpful Technical Analysis tools and info!  Be early, or be late!

2021-04-28 03:51:59,wallstreetbets,"Not sure whether I'm just behind on my drivers or what, but no graphs are showing whatsoever.    


I'm in with 2k shares on CLOV, so don't take this the wrong way.    


Two points. 

1)  When you just dismiss something out of hand, it does take away from your otherwise great writing.    


""As you can see it says deceleration on the top left. This is ok because the stock is so young id just ignore that since we've clearly bottomed out now.""  


If it's so clear, why doesn't the marker, whatever it is, show that?  If you dismiss something out of hand, it appears you're trying to hide something.  Most people, especially those who have been manipulated for years in the market, can see that.  


2) Your closing.  ""We just need volume"" requires a whole lot of other things in order to happen.  A news release, continued buying by lots of retail and no selling from institutions, something outside of our control.  Government mandate that everyone use CLOV.   So, yeah, volume isn't a simple thing to solve.  


Other than that, the play was great."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MNMD One Of A Kind Research I Wish Was Funded 5 Years Ago  I just want to say that seeing a lot of interest around here focusing on Mind Medicine has warmed my ape heart. I know all of us retards just want to make (or lose) as much money as possible but this one is, unfortunately, a bit too close to the heart than I'd like.

I love GME, and AMC, I will own them and continue to buy GME like a 401k till I die. However, MVIS (large position at 11 (gain)), CLOV (large position at 15 (loss)), BB, SPY PUTS (Margin Called More times than I like to admit), etc are just squeeze or yolo plays.

MNMD is something else, it not only presents possible endless tendies but fuck we could be looking at the new generation of treatment for depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, and many other mental health disorders. I had people in my life that I wish had the opportunity to experience this type of treatment. A treatment outside of conventional pharma or therapy, both of which I am a huge advocate for (please always seek help), but sometimes there is a different means. Something that could have helped the person who everyone said they ""tried everything"" for. I'm sick of hearing we tried everything when there is more. I hope we can continue to progress and alter our perception of how to treat the many different things that so many struggle with every day.

Even if the only thing this company produces is one new treatment at least it adds one more thing to the ""tried everything"" process, because it's one more thing that could have maybe helped him."
2021-04-27 23:14:58,wallstreetbets,Well said. There is so much more we need to do for mental health and exploring new ways is a good start.
2021-04-27 23:35:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm 62, suffered from crippling depression most of my adult life. I've been on ssri's in the past and they worked for some time, then stoped, then made things worse. About 10 years ago I was deep in it and was really done. I randomly tuned into an am radio station while driving that had the Thom Heartman show on and just when I tuned in he said, ""our next segment, magic mushrooms can cure depression"". The timing couldn't have been better. Listened to the story about the research Johns Hopkins had done and decided to turn around and try the one thing I hadn't. Long story short, after doing the recommend dose, 3.5 grms, I was amazed. The experience was incredible but more importantly I was better. I haven't had symptoms since, no more drugs, no more suicidal thoughts and feel everything more fully. Now I dose twice a year and have never felt better. 
I'm in on MNMD and will be holding."
2021-04-28 00:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes.

My depression hit the fucking fan at 17, I was suicidal and didn‚Äôt have energy to do jackshit. I‚Äôd just lay in bed all day, thinking of ways to end my shit. Man, it was a hard summer. Suicidal thoughts, no energy, no motivation, didn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything that should‚Äôve concerned me. 

I started ignoring friends, family no one knew how I felt. 

I had tried a lot of shit at the time, cocaine, weed, amphetamine, and shitty shit like that. But  later on I started micro dosing on psilocybin-induced shrooms, over a month a felt a lot better. Micro dosing once per week. It made me feel alive, it‚Äôs been a while since I taken it last but shit man it helped me, really did, I tried DMT too, both worked wonders. The effect was euphoric, it made it easier getting out of bed in the morning. No shit thoughts keeping me down, barley felt suicidal, just alive. I‚Äôm happy I tried it. Worked a lot better than antidepressants which just made me act like an emotionless tree stunk."

2021-04-28 13:21:13,wallstreetbets,"Not to disparage the utility of this drug class but you can't claim these drugs are free of side effects. Any biologically active substance that is introduced into the body (either the gut, mucous membranes, lungs, directly injected into the circulatory system, etc) WILL have side effects and adverse effects in at least a portion of the population. 

Some examples:

\- Spectrum off side effects related to variations in metabolism of the drugs. Some may not metabolize it at all, others may over-metabolize leading to increased or decreased neurologic activity of the drug.

\- Various ""allergies"" can develop when individuals have immune responses to the drug or the drug/protein complexes that form when the medication circulates in an individual."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WFC Earnings: Why UWMC will crush their guidance Disclaimer: There's been plenty of positives about UWMC which include a 6.2 forward P/E, trading near book value, 5% dividend yield, high short interest, low float, former SPAC stocks being heavily oversold, closing loans way faster than the industry average *blah blah blah*  

The focus here is to purely talk about why UWMC will beat their guidance. 

**Wells Fargo's earnings report:**

Mortgage originations were slightly down between Q4 and Q1, driven by the decrease in correspondent loans (where the bank underwrites/funds/sells the loan to another entity that will service it). 

Despite rising interest rates the share of refi originations grew from 52% ($28.0B) to 64% ($33.2B) during this same time period. Representing an overall increase of +18.3% in closed loan refi volume. 

**Takeaways for UWMC: (Earnings announced for 5/10)** UWMCs¬†2020¬†production¬†mix¬†was¬†comprised¬†of¬†76%¬†refinance¬†and¬†24%¬†purchase. In their Q4 earnings calls UWMC provided guidance for closed loan volume in Q1 to end between $52B and $57B. Considering that UWMC closed $54.7B in loan volumes during Q4 ($42.5B refi and $12.2B Purchase), this represents a very conservative estimate. 

If we estimate that UWMC Refi production grows similarly to WFC and *purchases decline* then we can estimate $59.1B in closed loan volume for Q1. Already +$2.1B higher than the high end of guidance. 

($12.2 \* 0.72 + $42.5B \* 1.183) = $59.1B 

If we estimate that UWMC Refi production grows similarly to WFC and purchases *remain constant* (offset by a growing broker channel and share within the channel) then we can estimate $62.5B in closed loan volume for Q1. 

($12.2  + $42.5B \* 1.183) = $62.5B

**TL;DR:** Even with a low estimate UWMC is set to crush their $52B-$57B guidance.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Let's Get CLOV Right My fellow WSB apes: I wanted to take this opportunity to address my fellow $CLOVtards about what we've been seeing recently. Before you downvote/try to remove a CLOV post, there's been endless rumors on $CLOV: folks think we're primed for a short squeeze, we got woke fucks arguing gamma squeeze, then you got the classic daytraders hopping into the ticker with surging volume.

Let's get something straight with $CLOV. We aren't fighting for a squeeze- this is a **once in a lifetime investment opportunity**. We see a lot of names trading on hype and other manufactured momentum these days, but $CLOV's current valuation, fundamentals, and mission are arguably amongst the most attractive in the market today.

# What does Clover Health Investments (CLOV) actually do?

People who just wade into names for the hell of it are surely screwed. But assuming this 10M member community are true Apes willing to hold this stock indefinitely, we are on the precipice of a bonanza. Clover competes in the Medicare Advantage space, which is on the verge of replacing Original Medicare Plans.

Original Medicare is a clusterfuck. Part A covers 80% of covered hospital expenses and Part B covers the equivalent percentage of covered doctors expenses. Private insurers fill the space for **Part C** (Medicare Advantage) and Part D (covers prescription drugs uncovered by Medicare).

[As we can see, the Medicare Advantage market is heavily expanding. Market membership has spiked nearly 5X since 2005, and is projected to represent 51&#37; of overall Medicare plans by 2030, a continuous increase from its massive 39&#37; share in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/elle314lqtv61.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c966658c73dabbb0d40f693ddc101ccec48f55)

Of course, Clover's primary mission is capturing market share within Medicare Advantage and slowly pressuring competitors. According to Clover itself, from 2019-2021, the company had 42,594; 58,056; and \~70,000 members respectively. So as a rough guesstimate from this raw data alone, Clover's capture of the Medicare Advantage market has fluctuated between 0.19%, 0.24%, and 0.29% (assuming the TAM doesn't change in 2021 and CLOV misses on its membership projections).

[The biggest Medicare Advantage players right now are United Healthcare \(UNH\) and Humana \(HUM\), capturing 44&#37; of the market in 2020. At roughly 0.24&#37; of the market in 2020, CLOV clearly has a long way to go, but this is an impressive 26.3&#37; increase in market share!](https://preview.redd.it/h9f6ygkqqtv61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ed3c1eea536b6982b68f1f2d64cea7429b15f1)

If we consider the Medicare Advantage market's TAM is currently $270B and growing 14% annually, some quick arithmetic indicates Clover's market share of 0.24% at 26.3% growth equals just 0.063% of total growth. When considering the total market is growing at 14% annually, Clover represented just 0.4% of total market growth in 2020.

These are minuscule numbers indeed considering how young Clover is, but delving deeper into the numbers/what CLOV actually does provides investors a more reliable understanding into the MA market.

# How is Clover performing, and how is it different?

[As of October 2020, Clover holds roughly 8&#37; MA market share across its current geographies, which consist of 74 counties and 7 states \(8 in '21\) that cover Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Since these states all have at least 30&#37;+ Medicare Advantage penetration, I really like Clover's strategy of locking down saturated markets and then eating up the rest.](https://preview.redd.it/8honcat1rtv61.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef30830ff0ad81428fc731b4e3b5c6add0871f3e)

[Clover Health Investments is a rapidly growing company, intensely investing in R&D\/capital expenditures while forgoing near-term short-run profits. Essentially, if the 10-year ticking up scares you, CLOV probably isn't for you. If we compare full-year revenues between '19 and '20, we notice CLOV is growing at roughly 45.5&#37; YoY. As part of the whole \\""go-go growth club,\\"" the losses expectedly are piling up as CLOV fortifies its product. It is encouraging to see the firm close net losses to $91.6M in 2020, down from $364M in 2019 and $202M in 2018.](https://preview.redd.it/9kqm73x5rtv61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=82522a8fd181720c2c1d41337f6af8f8965eef81)

So we get the idea Clover is growing far faster than its competitors (albeit in a crowded, but ballooning) Medicare Advantage market. But what is it that distinguishes CLOV from big players like UNH, Humana, and CVS?

# Fellow ape, meet The Clover Assistant!

[https:\/\/medium.com\/clover-off-the-charts\/the-value-that-clover-assistant-provides-to-primary-care-d9ee157b8402 | A good article by Sophia Chang \(Chief Clinical Informatics Officer at Clover\)](https://preview.redd.it/r5houhtcrtv61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2569f5249d153a2611f6463ea5007c41fbb1853)

Just an ape's thoughts on Clover Assistant- no CS background so don't kill me :) But from what I can tell, Clover Assistant acts as a product offering you might see see from a big data analytics company like Palantir, only Clover is aimed at Primary Care Physicians/Practices and geared towards healthcare.

In the linked article Sophia Chang describes how the Clover Assistant reduces transaction costs in the industry by giving PCPs better insights into their clients' health, pre-existing conditions, contraindications, prescribed medications, and institutional guidelines for ailments like diabetes. Clover Assistant is able to continuously log all this information, updating it with regards to any changes in a patient's diagnosis, new treatments, or medications that are potentially effective.

Furthermore, Ms. Chang's personal experiences with Clover Assistant render the software as more sophisticated than some data collection apparatus that transmits information in live time (imo). She describes in great detail how this product is going miles to help diabetic patients alone:

* Using the Assistant while seeing Clover members automatically keeps PCPs up to date with the American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association guidelines
* The Assistant is capable of **management recommendations** based on Clover's formulary and member's out-of-pocket costs; it can pinpoint specific medications that could be more effective against a patient's co-morbidities, like dealing with a diabetic with cardiovascular disease
* The Assistant can also **suppress inappropriate recommendations,** so it would be smart enough to veto a high-dose statin therapy to someone with active liver disease
* Finally, and as Ms. Chang accurately states, most importantly, The Assistant shares the **specific reasoning** why a recommendation is being made, to best support the PCP

All in all, the Clover Assistant clearly seems like a groundbreaking innovation for the healthcare, and more importantly/specifically the Medicare Advantage market. When considering other players in the field like UNH, CVS, and Humana, their strategies for offering private insurance are archaic and soon to be left behind. As the Medicare Advantage continues capturing more of the overall Medicare market, I believe the Clover Assistant will enable high sustained membership growth over the coming years. It seems like a no-brainer that doctors, physicians, dentists, and other PCPs would want a revolutionary software by their side instead of hoping their business will be streamlined for the challenges of the 21st century.

# The Bottom Line

If you can see Clover Health's advantages over its fossil-like peers, believe in its growth story, and are willing to make a bet, I'd say ***now*** really is the time to start buying shares, calls, etc. (\*not financial advice\*). $CLOV stock currently trades at roughly $9.30/share, which is below the PIPE offering at $10/share (this is what Chamath personally paid, what Chamath's company Hedosophia paid, what Fidelity Investments paid, and below what I'm sure many other VCs/billionaires paid for this future giant).

We've also heard a lot of talk about short interest/volume/remaining float. While I personally own mostly shares (but am slightly interested in this topic considering I'm flooded into the 5/21 call line too), $CLOV really could soar with the right confluence of events. I wouldn't necessarily call this a squeeze though- what would you call TSLA's movement when it went from $28/share to $500+?

I can't really say for sure what the short interest is, but we know for certainty it's at least 35% as of 4/15 (this doesn't factor in 50%+ short volume that came in the week after). It is also notable that Clover's CEO, Vivek Garipalli owns roughly 83.584M shares, equivalent to roughly 17% of the total shares outstanding. (This was a source of immense controversy recently- analysts didn't know whether or not to include this in the short float). Nevertheless, Garipalli's agreement indicates he can't sell a single share until $CLOV stock hits $30+ for at least 90 days, for whatever that's worth.

When considering UNH, Humana, and CVS are all worth 50-100X right now, there definitely is a mismatch. Either the big players are incredibly overvalued when trading at a healthy 17X forward earnings, or $CLOV is going to be a $100 stock pretty soon. Factor in impending announcements about Medicare Advantage expansion in Congress üëÄ- I guess we'll see. ü§∑üèΩ"
2021-04-28 05:20:24,wallstreetbets," Nevertheless, Garipalli's agreement indicates he can't sell a single share until $CLOV stock hits $30+ for at least 90 days, **for whatever that's worth.** 

&#x200B;

 \- It is the incentive that will continue to motivate the CEO. IMO it is worth a lot knowing that. 3 Months at $30 means the business is growing and providing the care that people are going to need through affordable plans and savings. I'm bullish"

Also, saying you think it should go to $100 makes me not trust your DD much. Simply because you don't understand market caps. This company does or owns nothing worthy of a 100b market cap. DD has to be more than the hype pieces found in investor relations pages. You didn't even give a bear case, tell me the risks involved in investing in this company, not just the goods.


Edit: fat fingered it, meant 10b market cap. Seems less ridiculous, but still stand by my assessment."

2021-04-27 23:55:08,wallstreetbets,"It's not out of the realm on this stock. Because of where it IPOd, most shorts are likely in the 10-15 range. The options chain has low delta, so could gamma up to 20-25. At that point shorts might actually cover, since it would likely go to some new FOMO top and could re-enter.

All of that is dependent on the stock spiking quickly, like if earnings were good.

1.	‚Å†Lidar : MVIS have been developing their own LIDAR, which Sumit Sharma has called best in class. They had a demo in April. Please look at this DD which compares specs with competitors : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
2.	‚Å†Augmented Reality: MVIS tech is in the hololens, this is a fact. S2UPID on YouTube , also on Reddit had torn open the hololens and clearly showed the parts labelled MVIS. Microsoft had 22Billion deal for Hololens. Microsoft is reliant on MVIS in this sense
3.	‚Å†Buyout : do I even need to explain this one ? Sumit (CEO) has always been open about this company being for sale.

will be addressing the nation with his ***American Families Plan*** which, as written by co-crustfuck Nancy Pelosi: ""Lowering health costs and prescription drug prices will be a top priority for House Democrats to be included in the American Families Plan....**Now is a historic opportunity to also make an important expansion of Medicare that will guarantee health care for millions of older adults and people with disabilities struggling with the health and economic realities of the COVID-19 pandemic.**"" Sanders has called for changing the Medicare eligibility age to 50, while a growing number of Democrats (60ish) have called to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 in his address tomorrow evening.

What happens to this overhyped Clover Health Medicare Advantage plan provider if PapaBiden drops the eligibility age? You tell me.

So let's assume you think this might happen (or maybe you don't). Technically speaking, now is a justifiable time to enter $CLOV anyways. We have seen a succession of higher lows and are forming an ascending triangle that looks ready to pop. RSI has plenty of room to run, and dips are bought up quick. 485,000,000 shares changes hands in the two high volume days (\~4x the float) under $10.5, which could imply that weaker hands were shaken out and took profit on the recent bounces. We have also seen positive news come out regarding approval to operate in additional states, which caused the spike on 4/8. The short term target for this setup is is \~$10.50.

As for tomorrow: I expect to see buying in anticipation of Biden's potential announcement, and a major pop if it comes to fruition. I do not think we are going to have some short of short squeeze, but we can still fuck the bears.

We have the possible announcement, a good technical setup, a polarizing figure at the helm, and a solid bottoming formation. Throw in ten million degenerate autistic retards, and we have ourselves a nice pot of American gumbo that may pay for your wife and her boyfriend to take a trip to Cabo.

**Extend expanded ACA premiums tax credits in the American Rescue Plan.**¬†Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and Americans facing illness should never have to worry about how they are going to pay for their treatment. No one should face a choice between buying life-saving medications or putting food on the table.¬† President Biden has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act and lower prescription drug costs for everyone by letting Medicare negotiate prices, reducing health insurance premiums and deductibles for those who buy coverage on their own, creating a public option and the option for people to enroll in Medicare at age 60, and closing the Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of Americans gain health insurance. The American Families Plan will build on the American Rescue Plan and continue our work to make health care more affordable.¬† The American Rescue Plan included a historic investment in reducing Americans‚Äô health care costs.¬† The biggest improvement in health care affordability since the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue Plan provided two years of lower health insurance premiums for those who buy coverage on their own, saving families an average¬†[of $50 per person per month](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html).¬† The American Families Plan will make those premium reductions permanent, a $200 billion investment.¬† As a result,¬†[nine million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html)¬†people will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums, and¬†[four million](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-if-american-rescue-plans-enhanced-marketplace-subsidies-were-made-permanent-estimates-2022)¬†uninsured people will gain coverage.¬† The Families Plan will also invest in maternal health and support the families of veterans receiving health care services.¬†"

2021-04-28 16:53:03,wallstreetbets,Yea agreed. I was just messin round brother. All goodüòÅ
2021-04-28 00:40:24,wallstreetbets,Oh alright. Basically what I have is a call option. An option means you have the right but no obligation to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Btw a call means your bullish on the stock. In order to control 100 potential shares you have to pay a premium. For 500 dollars I control 300 shares of clov. If the stock goes past the strike even price my contracts become more valuable. If you contract has more value than what you bout it for then you can sell it back to the market for a profit. If you choose to exercise your contract that means you have to have enough money to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Most people sell the contract because buying 100 of any shares requires you to be a baller. So options are a good way to making money as well. Warning do not sell calls or puts as that puts you on a short position and if you don't have the 100 stocks you're fucked. If you're a beginner buys calls or puts. Puts means your bearish on the stock but you bought the right to sell the stock at a certain price. I would recommend YouTube if you need more help. I'm on my phone so hard to explain well.

2021-04-28 00:46:39,wallstreetbets,So confusing.
2021-04-28 00:49:16,wallstreetbets,Basically you can  buy calls or puts which your only risk is the premium for the contract. And then the other side is you can sell calls or puts so you have to have buyers and sellers. If you're a beginner you want to experiment buying calls or puts not selling calls or puts because your loss can be extremely great
2021-04-28 00:53:24,wallstreetbets,Right. Ok. I think I got it. YouTube is my friend
2021-04-28 09:39:36,wallstreetbets,"My only question about options, is aside from paying the premium. Do I need to then have cash on hand to exercise the option ?"
2021-04-28 00:54:44,wallstreetbets,Wish you luck in the market bro. I've been steadily making some. Just remember you havent lost your money until you sell so you might as well hold unless you can turn that loss into a profit somewhere else

2021-04-28 11:54:51,wallstreetbets,You don't need to have the cash until you go to exercise the option. Otherwise you just sell the contract

2021-04-28 01:05:52,wallstreetbets,Uuh I'm not sure on your question but I assume their shares were red but somehow their contracts were in the green lol.
2021-04-28 12:17:34,wallstreetbets,Please don't buy options on stocks that have run up a lot if you don't know what you are doing. It is an extremely easy way to lose money. Read up on the Greeks first.

2021-04-28 01:10:34,wallstreetbets,"It's a process bro, you will get there after a couple months. Just remember know when to take your gains. I'm guilty of being greedy. But I recommend whatever you put in, once you're up 15 to 20 percent pull your gains. Be objective and have a plan that's my advice and maybe someone else will second this."
2021-04-28 02:19:12,wallstreetbets,"I second this. Theta decay (ie options that you bought out of the money decreasing in value) is real. One of my first option trades was up 100% at one point, but the stock price dropped and they expired worthless. If your contracts are in the green and expire in less than 1-2 months, it may be a good idea to start taking profits.

Edit: /u/dewmybutthole since I'm really responding to you"
2021-04-28 10:04:41,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Thanks man. I feel in a couple months I‚Äôll get the hang of it.

1.	‚Å†Lidar : MVIS have been developing their own LIDAR, which Sumit Sharma has called best in class. They had a demo in April. Please look at this DD which compares specs with competitors : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
2.	‚Å†Augmented Reality: MVIS tech is in the hololens, this is a fact. S2UPID on YouTube , also on Reddit had torn open the hololens and clearly showed the parts labelled MVIS. Microsoft had 22Billion deal for Hololens. Microsoft is reliant on MVIS in this sense
3.	‚Å†Buyout : do I even need to explain this one ? Sumit (CEO) has always been open about this company being for sale.

2021-04-27 23:01:33,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, the pattern is obvious now, but I guess there will always have to be someone at the other end to hold the bags."
2021-04-27 23:26:15,wallstreetbets,"There hasn‚Äôt been news yet, and that happens Thursday/Friday night"
2021-04-27 22:45:25,wallstreetbets,I agree. Bleed and spike. Less than before. 26 was a good call. I had 20 or 22? Bought at 10-something. Damn near doubled my money though.
2021-04-28 05:31:26,wallstreetbets,So much for looking into MvIS balance sheet. They have a shit ton of debt and will have tiny amounts of projected cash (680mil) after 2025. Good luck holding a bag until then.
2021-04-28 16:04:37,wallstreetbets,I hope for the best for you üëçüèø
2021-04-28 15:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Connect the dots friend.  The tone has changed over the last month, we are very close to a strategic investor dumping loads of cash in or a complete buyout.  Tomorrow EC will have garbage numbers but once Ivas starts shipping and a partner is publicly on board, this company is going to revolutionize the industry.  

Look at their BOD additions in the past 12 months!  These are not peons in the industry!

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PROXY STATEMENT SUPPLEMENT FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MAY 4, 2021 Huge news for AMC APES!!! The only questionable thing holding back the squeeze was the vote to allow AMC to create 500M new shares. The vote was planned for May 4 (May the Forth Be With Us Apes). CEO Aron later announced (and filed with SEC) that he would not create any of those shares in 2021! Huge news. Small spike.

People were still worried if they could trust him. Then TODAY, they just removed that final road block. They cancelled the request to add more shares. No move vote on adding shares... no dilution.

Silverback Adam Aron lured shorts and eviscerated them!!!

Nothing holding back AMC on market open tomorrow. The glass ceiling has now become a diamond floor for us to stand on and rocket upwards.

2021-04-27 22:26:19,wallstreetbets,"For shits and giggles lets say

They dilute 43 mill share @ a market price of 11.50(lets just say hypothetically in 1 day)

your looking at less then 10 percent of the float.

&#x200B;

so a drop of MAYBE 1.25-1.50 IF they release all shares at one time.

&#x200B;

I dont think most AMC HODLer's mind a 2,3, or even 5 dollar price drop.

&#x200B;

The AMC crowd seems to be alot more dedicated to long position HODLing in this stock then ive seen for the option plays with GME/MVIS/PLTR/etc

Maybe I'm wrong, we'll see if the float doubles, making it a 10x increase this year alone.

Oh what did the AMC board do after they released 400,000 shares earlier this year? Oh that's right they gave him themselves bonuses and nothing else.

I don't trust that board."
2021-04-28 02:14:39,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre wrong. 

The Certificate of Incorporation states that additional shares can‚Äôt be introduced without shareholder approval. What this is saying is they can propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, which only board member approval is needed, to increase the authorized shares. The fact that it says ‚Äúor for other items at any point in the future‚Äù points to this as well.

They‚Äôre stating that they can amend it to not require shareholder approval to issue new shares."
2021-04-27 22:52:48,wallstreetbets,They have sales agents who receive a percentage for selling the stock in private negotiations. It‚Äôs not being released into the float and is prob being sold to hedge funds to cover their shorts.

**Background**

&#x200B;

* **Mosaic Company** is the leading U.S. producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash. 
* **Potash** is vital to the agricultural industry as a primary plant nutrient. **Potash** increases water retention in plants, improves crop yields, and influences the taste, texture, and nutritional value of many plants. 
* High soil **phosphorus** (P) levels are essential to obtain high **corn** yields. 
* Keeping it simple: **Crops rely on fertilizer. Mosiac produces the fertilizer.**

*  Usage of corn steadily rising in the U.S, creating more demand in the future.
*  China [buys](https://www.agweek.com/business/markets/6863479-China-purchased-230-million-bushels-of-corn-this-week-and-theyre-not-done-yet) 230 million bushels of corn in four days.
*   In [this](https://www.agweek.com/business/markets/6863479-China-purchased-230-million-bushels-of-corn-this-week-and-theyre-not-done-yet) article Randy Martinson of Martinson Ag Risk Management says China seems to have a good appetite for corn that isn't diminishing, and follows by saying ""I don't think they're done buying.""
* [This](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/020321-chinas-buying-to-keep-us-corn-prices-firm-stocks-tight) article explains the whole China and U.S corn fiasco better than I ever will.

Keeping it simple:  

### China's demand outlook positive

**China's import demand for corn is expected to remain strong, fueled by high domestic prices, the need to restock grain reserves, and growth in feed consumption, the US Department of Agriculture's Beijing attache said recently.**

&#x200B;

Supporting [**article**](https://www.reuters.com/article/usda-crops/update-1-u-s-says-strong-demand-to-cut-corn-supply-prices-hit-highest-since-june-2013-idUSL1N2M21VN) about supply and demand of corn.

**Institutional Ownership: 83%**

Take a look at [this](https://investors.mosaicco.com/financials/institutional-ownership/default.aspx), as it will show you everything you need to know about institutional ownership within Mosaic. Some Institutions have recently increased their position size aswell.

&#x200B;

**Option Activity**

u/tallsalesman posted earlier today about unusual option activity, so i recommend checking his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzsl0o/hidden_gem_mos_mosaic/) out.

&#x200B;

From u/tallsalesman "" On June 18th there‚Äôs 3 separate call orders. Ones for $168k, ones for 29k, ones for 49k. The big call is for sept 17 for 1.3 million. ""

&#x200B;

Take a [look](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MOS/options?date=1623974400&p=MOS) at the options chain, particularly at 40 strike price. Their must be some high conviction that  these will print.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is probably so much more information that can be added, though I just want to get this out so people are aware of this company. I'm sure someone can do a way more in depth DD.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR-   High Demand---->Corn and soybeans rising-->Higher prices of fertlizer and phosphorus---> Higher profit margins MOS--->Raises PPS?

Mosaic has a massive liability in their closed gyp-stacks.  They reached a settlement with the EPA in 2015 over mis-handling over 60-billion pounds of hazardous waste in 2015 for over $600M.  After the HRK/Piney Point fiasco, Mosaic very well could end up having to de-water their closed stacks.  I spent over 12 years working in this industry.  I know it very well.  Nutrien has similar exposure to phosphate prices, has far less liabilities as they aren‚Äôt making radio-active gypsum as a by-product and is an overall better-managed company."

2021-04-27 22:07:51,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a solid point, but they will use this for the next few years until they realize it‚Äôs doing more harm than good. 

OR 

They realize this and begin to provide a more organic product that does wonders. Far less likely, but possible. 

But your point is a good one."
2021-04-27 22:08:49,wallstreetbets,Do you know of any markets for this? I‚Äôm not well diversified in organic farming.
2021-04-28 10:06:44,wallstreetbets,"Totally. I don‚Äôt know your level of experience so I don‚Äôt mean to insult you or anything because that‚Äôs not my intention but oh man do I remember way back when I first started options trading I was see super high open interest and I would just tell myself ‚Äúwell if they believe it then it has to hit that price!‚Äù And I would be so confused when it didn‚Äôt get anywhere near that price. 
Here‚Äôs my unsolicited advice....What I like to do is analyze Google search terms for the company, for the market the company is in and other applicable keywords to get a good idea of the overall sentiment in the company/investment. I‚Äôve found that this can sometimes bring a lot of clarity to that."
2021-04-28 08:46:32,wallstreetbets,Mmmuah
2021-04-27 22:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this comment I appreciate the insider view I‚Äôm looking to invest in both nutrien and mos but it looks like MOS is more liability 

Phosphogyspum was approved in road construction Do you think now MOS may be forced to get rid of these stacks of public pushes for it?

Last question if you don‚Äôt mind do you think fertilizer prices will keep rising with tariffs on Morocco/Russia or is that just a small piece of this"
2021-04-27 22:16:59,wallstreetbets,"Regardless, we‚Äôre going to need phosphate for the foreseeable future because of the way our food system is built.  That said, I‚Äôm way more excited about some of the ag-tech companies that are helping farmers increase revenue per acre by growing a more diverse set of crops.  Watch the documentary ‚ÄòKiss the Ground‚Äô - there are reasons to get excited about the future of agriculture."
2021-04-27 22:19:53,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt.  There are funds out there that are basically financing farmers to generate more revenue on their land by switching to organic and regenerative farming.  There are also a number of tech companies that are into measuring changes in carbon content of soil.  If carbon tax becomes a thing, then I can see the potential for farmers to claim huge credits for sequestering carbon.  Unfortunately these are all private companies/funds."
2021-04-27 23:31:50,wallstreetbets,"With regard to phosphogypsum, there are a few important things to understand:

1). The bulk of the $600M settlement wasn‚Äôt a fine.  It was funding set aside to pay for the future clean-up of these sites.  So some of the liability is priced in.

2). Only phosphogypsum in central Florida‚Äôs Bone Valley is radioactive.  Elsewhere, the gypsum by-product can be used but it is of minimal value.

3). The real problem isn‚Äôt the solid material, it‚Äôs the entrained water.  The gyp is mostly water and as it settles/dries, it leaches out acidic water with high nutrient and metal concentrations for decades.  This is in addition to any water that was on top of the stack when it closed.

Mosaic purchased the Plant City site from CF Industries about 3 years ago.  It was never profitable and was shut down about a year after purchase.  Mosaic of course now is responsible for closure.  That‚Äôs part of why I say Nutrien is better managed.  Mosaic has been left holding numerous bags.

In any case, in the near term (less than 3 years) I don‚Äôt see much changing with the stacks because there are multiple technical and regulatory challenges.

As for fertilizer prices rising.  It‚Äôs complicated.  Prices used to be controlled by the major phosphate producing countries similar to OPEC.  Russia decided to go alone and tanked prices maybe 7-8 years ago.  I don‚Äôt have a feel for the global capacity and all of the moving parts.  I do know that Nutrien in Canada got out of the phosphate business about 2 years ago so between the Redwater and Plant City plants; production capacity in the North America has been reduced."
2021-04-27 22:18:56,wallstreetbets,Which stocks would you recommend I do more research on? I‚Äôm more for organic and things that are actually beneficial.
2021-04-28 11:01:58,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your time replying great info
2021-04-28 12:43:24,wallstreetbets,"No problem.  I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with the P/E for Nutrien but my experience working with them at their Redwater (Alberta), White Springs (Florida) and Aurora (North Carolina) sites was all pretty positive.  I was never impressed with Mosaic‚Äôs management in FL or LA but you have to keep in mind that I work on the environmental side of the business so what I do is always a cost center.  Mosaic is run quarter to quarter and I see a lot of deferred costs adding up.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a big fan of their phosphate operations in FL and LA.  That said, many investors are looking quarter to quarter or in the case of WSB, day by day.  In that context, the long term challenges of phosphate in FL may be a moot point."

Here's why:

I had millions - literal millions - of shares of that company. I didn't mind that they were issuing shares to raise capital, because I figured they were going to use the opportunity provided them to make a big move to be able to come into reopening with a real jolt. Maybe a $PLAY acquisition or at the very least a partnership. Use the time to retool their operations to an all in one entertainment option of some sort instead of the tired old model of $20 movie tickets and overpriced chicken sandwiches.

Instead, executive leadership used the money to hand themselves fat bonuses for ""saving"" the company when they literally didn't do anything but let the share price be elevated on sentimentality and meme status and act like they had something to do with it.

Then they asked to issue even more shares. No vision. Just cashing in and using the company like an ATM.

So I voted no. Millions of times. Then spent a few days unwinding my position. The company is dead to me. I don't know why anybody would invest in them. They had an entire year to come up with ideas on how to grow their operations or make a move, and they literally just collected their paychecks and raided the company coffers.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Was $2.5k In Profit; Limit Sell & Stop Loss Were Both Reached Multiple Times But Never Filled. Word of Warning: Make sure the options you buy can actually be filled, lest you end up like me and have to sell below an already trending down price. "
2021-04-27 21:38:13,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not saying RH is good, but it‚Äôs not Robinhood‚Äôs fault that your limit order wasn‚Äôt filled. Nobody wanted to buy at your limit price, the orders all go to a clearing house at the end of the day, so changing brokerages wouldn‚Äôt have helped.  Put in a stop loss market order if you want to bail on a position quickly."

And then when the stock dropped to $728 and was $7 away from your strike price, you're upset that you didn't get a fill.  


Just so you know, option prices are volatile.  I don't trade TSLA,  but I imagine they are even worse.  So, let me break it down for you.  On the way up, you can get a premium.  On the way down, you're lucky to get a fill at halfway between the bid/ask.    


Options are even less likely to fill when there's a significant drop.  Doesn't matter if it's Robinhood, TDA, CS, or Fidelity.  They will all try and sell if you set a limit.

2021-04-28 13:01:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean this with all due respect, seriously. Just trying to be educational. 

You have a fundamental misconception of the ‚Äúmarket value‚Äù of your options. The ‚Äúbid‚Äù is the highest current price someone is willing to buy that contract at. The ‚Äúask‚Äù is the lowest price someone is willing to sell that contract. The ‚Äúmark‚Äù (what you see as the price of the option on your platform) is the midpoint where buyers and sellers need to meet to make a deal. The difference between the two is the spread. Blue chip stocks have a very narrow spread typically. Super volatile stocks usually have wider spreads. 

The way to think of this is if you wanted to guarantee a sell of that option RIGHT NOW, you‚Äôd have to sell at the bid price. If you wanted to buy RIGHT NOW, you‚Äôd have to buy at the ask price.

If you trade options on a highly volatile stock you face 2 issues: First - the spreads are going to be wide so what you think of as your ‚Äúprofit‚Äù really isn‚Äôt your profit (because the spread is so wide), and second: with the stock being so volatile, your chances of getting filled at a limit order is much much lower. 

Let‚Äôs say there are 10 people with 1 contract each and they all have a limit order at $3. Let‚Äôs also say your are the 10th person in that queue. As the VERY VOLATILE stock drops significantly there are only 9 people willing to buy at that price. Everyone gets filled except you.

This also happens with limit orders when stocks gap up or down. The thing is stocks are MUCH more liquid than options, so getting skipped happens less often. 

It isn‚Äôt RH, it isn‚Äôt your broker, it is your understanding of how options and the options market works. I had something similar happen to me early on, and although it cost me money I have never forgot the lesson."

2021-04-27 22:22:57,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve had limit orders on cryp to be $400 in the money and not fill. If RH aka Citadel can‚Äôt make enough $ off the spread between their order flow and the actual bid/ask price they won‚Äôt fill you. I‚Äôve had it happens tons of times on stonks and options too. It‚Äôs just the most egregious on cryp to.
2021-04-27 20:09:55,wallstreetbets,Interesting..If it was the edge of a limit price. You might not get any takers right away. I have had options just not filled because no one was willing to pay/take the posted price.

2021-04-28 14:36:52,wallstreetbets,I remember learning this the hard way also!  Always check option volume before purchasing!
2021-04-28 12:37:41,wallstreetbets,"So much this

And we still see a shitload of RH screenshot all day
Oh well"
2021-04-27 20:17:43,wallstreetbets,Very true and additional pro-tip: try selling options to escape the cycle and collect the retard fee instead of pay it
2021-04-27 22:10:29,wallstreetbets,"That's the confusing part to me though. Market price for my options at one point was $4.15 average bid/ask. As I've mentioned in other comments, I bought at $2.80 my take profit was $3.80 and the stop loss was $3.00. Neither filled, whether the stock went up past my take profit or down below my stop loss. It didn't even try to fill *below* my stop loss. The market value was \~$1.25 by the time I checked my account again and I had to set a new sell order at $1.00 just to sell them."
2021-04-27 22:26:09,wallstreetbets,Like 50 cents after 50 options trades. So about a week.
2021-04-27 22:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah E*TRADE is $.50 per contract. Obviously this means to stay away from high numbers of cheap plays, and stick closer to in the money plays.... and I‚Äôm honestly ok with that. Every long shit I‚Äôve taken was a bust anyways. But as far as filling or whatnot, never had an issue."
2021-04-28 13:05:34,wallstreetbets,"I tried to sell at a profit, that's what my take profit was there for. Even my stop loss was high enough up to make me profit. But even when the take profit was below the mid price for a while, nothing happened. I'm not blaming RH, I'm just showing everyone to be careful with options and reminding them to set them up in ways that are likely to get filled so they don't end up in this situation."
2021-04-28 13:20:52,wallstreetbets,"Right, I'm not really trying to blame RH, this was more of a first-hand cautionary tale of exactly what you described. My only complaint is that the bid price was over $4.xx for a while, and my take profit was set to $3.80, with my stop loss at $3.00 (with a cost of $2.80 each). Sadly I made the mistake of not watching my position closely and came back to a big loss. If the bid-ask only went above my take profit for a few seconds or minutes, of course it isn't likely to fill, but there was a pretty decent amount of trading done above my limit. Of course, as you said, volatility and liquidity are likely why my order did not fill, it just sucks that the price I was trying to sell at was essentially giving the bidders a discount in that moment, but no one wanted it.

Many things were wrong with this trade, and I know how risky it was, but I wanted to turn a quick profit and to an extent my plan worked out, there was profit to be made on my trade. But this was a good lesson that ""profit to be made"" is worthless if you can't exit your position.

I really do appreciate your kindness of trying to be educational. Even if someone else reading this thread already understands what you said above, it never hurts to be reminded how not to burn yourself."
2021-04-28 12:47:50,wallstreetbets,"Not to be mean, but you clearly don‚Äôt understand the pricing of options and how they work."
2021-04-27 20:31:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I guess my perception of what ""the edge"" is wasn't correct. I set my take profit at $3.80, and the bid-ask went up to $4.05-4.25 and never filled."
2021-04-27 20:29:03,wallstreetbets,"There was some stiff in between these two trades I didn't SS bc it would just be too much to look at, here's the basics: 

I was going way up in profit, bought more on the way up, went even more in profit, set take profit and stop loss, walked away, came back to -$4k due to take profit and stop loss not filling"
2021-04-27 20:41:02,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm not using the correct terminology. I just know that on a call option, on Robinhood at least, it gave me the ability to set the min/max I wanted to sell my positions at."
2021-04-27 22:13:23,wallstreetbets,"This has been a know fact for a while, get the hell out of there."
2021-04-28 00:58:20,wallstreetbets,All these weird stories about RH is starting to make me wonder if they are basically just a reskin of yahoo finance with make believe buying and selling Ponzi scheme.  Account holders get issued ‚Äúshares‚Äù that are basically IOUs from a dark pool while RH front runs trades with a massive credit line to trade on margin.

Also unlike most, RH puts the tools to do this temptingly and irresponsibly right before you, there‚Äôs not any or many others do.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$APHA and $TLRY... LET'S GO. On, like, Thursday. So, as many of you already know, Aphria (APHA) already voted to merge with Tilray (TLRY) and the latter votes in three days to make the deal final. 

It's fully expected that Tilray will agree to the merger, and both stocks are moving identical on the market today. 

If you're holding aphria, you'll gain 0.8381 of Tilray shares. Which is right around where theyre both sitting. (At least for the moment.) 

Why would you want to invest if the stocks are going to convert to around the same share price? Because despite the slim profit margin, sales are going to get a nudge from the companies merger regardless. 

Keep in mind, this is one of the bigger cannabis stocks. With Broken Coast (Aphria) releasing new concentrates on 4/26, and Tilray names to Times most influential companies on the 4/27. 

Via Tilray regarding the merger:
""The business combination is expected to provide operational efficiencies that are anticipated to generate approximately C$100 million (US$78 million) of annual pre-tax annual cost synergies within 24 months of the completion of the business combination."" 

Short sale or diamond hand, waiting on USA legalization, you're set make money on this stock either way.

I expect it to be like mvis. Climb heavily, and drop. Gains at the merge, followed by a delayed spike and eventually evening out until there's more news.

Aim higher than breaking even, but by cents, not dollars.

2021-04-28 01:33:54,wallstreetbets,"No they aren't. They are for hard-core consumers, compare it to specialty liqour. 

Its a slow mover, not like a preroll or large format flower."

2021-04-27 20:37:05,wallstreetbets,"And I bought one of the ""contaminated"" brands when we were switching to rec. Didn't hurt me, but with lung collapse hitting the local news, it was a serious concern.  

Knock off carts are fucking dangerous. I don't know if people outside the rec zones know how bad it can be."
2021-04-27 20:34:57,wallstreetbets,"I've heard of Lume. 

If you're looking for a quality cart from michigan, check out platinum vape as well. It's smooth, strong and tastes wonderful.

Some carts, especially discounted, taste like garbage."
2021-04-27 20:22:43,wallstreetbets,"Yea, that‚Äôs how weed works too.  In Washington you don‚Äôt even have sales/excise tax added on at the register unlike with alcohol, it‚Äôs included in the price."
2021-04-27 20:31:52,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs where the cannabis industry got the model. You‚Äôre exactly right.
2021-04-27 22:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Ya'll give me the best advice.

Look at trends a month or two old, compare to charts today and read the news. Boom. New stonk to buy.

2021-04-27 20:45:38,wallstreetbets,I got a couple contaminated ones too. The name is escaping me but it‚Äôs caused me some respiratory issues. Not anything crazy like some people but scary enough.
2021-04-27 20:46:06,wallstreetbets,Dank Vapes! That was the company. Or whoever.
2021-04-27 20:33:41,wallstreetbets,Personally I‚Äôd rather pay a little extra to know what I‚Äôm getting is what I‚Äôm wanting. Dunno if you smoked pre-legalization days out here but... I‚Äôm much happier not dealing with black market games. Not to mention.... the growers are able to do their thing without fear of being raided etc.
2021-04-27 20:18:49,wallstreetbets,Seems cheap though? I‚Äôm in Ohio and on the black market zips are 240
2021-04-27 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,I just thought the prices would be higher than the black market I was wrong though.

2021-04-27 20:31:04,wallstreetbets,"I haven't looked at the stuff that they sell in 1/2oz but I assume at the price its low/mid shelf.

Looking at the 1/8ths, top shelf priced at $70 means $560 for an oz.

Most stuff is sold in 1/8ths or 1/4ers because of testing/packaging/labeling laws. Ozs and 1/2oz sell a lot less often than 1/8ths. And you can't just bust open an oz bag to measure out an 1/8th anymore because of those laws."
2021-04-27 20:35:24,wallstreetbets,Ohio is such a disaster with cannabis and there are some amazing gorilla growers there too. A couple of the best growers I know here started in Ohio. Politics is ruining a lot of revenue for the state. Not shocked though.
2021-04-27 20:47:26,wallstreetbets,Same. I really have no complaints. I remember when the dank was $350 an ounce if you were lucky enough to find someone selling more than an eight. Haha. The good ole day but glad times have changed.
2021-04-27 22:54:58,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with that unless it bugs you personally.
2021-04-28 18:08:52,wallstreetbets,What market? Concentrate sales make up 35% of the market here in Michigan.

B.C. doesn't represent all smokers. neither does anecdotal evidence. Maybe as a retail shop, your concentrates suck."
2021-04-28 19:29:58,wallstreetbets,"You are simply ignorant on the nuances of the cannabis industry. Don't be upset though, I'll give you some free knowledge. 

BC has the most cannabis educated consumers in the entire country. I would say only Cali has a bigger cannabis culture in North America. 

Ontario is the biggest market in Canada only due to population. BC is second biggest. 

And guess what? Concentrates sales suck in ontario too!"
2021-04-28 19:38:14,wallstreetbets,"You're ignorant to geographical differences. It's okay.

Concentrates make up 35% of sales in michigan, despite being over half the population of your providence.

I understand it's confusing, with a single state being more populous than your whole ass self.

2021-04-27 20:00:12,wallstreetbets,"As a note for those concerned about the 43 mil shares, Utilizing shares is what GME did during their squeeze.

The 8-K is another juicy tidbit that says the 43 million authorized shares are to be sold at the most favorable prices over time by the sales agents under the instructions provided by AMC. There is up to a 2.5% commission fee, which incentivizes the sales agents to sell at the highest price possible.

2021-04-28 08:49:11,wallstreetbets,"The 43million shares they are looking to sell at market should already have been baked into the price when they originally announced it. Regardless of what ""analysts"" claim, the price should be closer to 16-18$ a share on a bad day and potentially 20-22$ after covid clears up. I would rather see them sell the already booked 43million shares now than wait and take on higher rate borrowed debt when rates shoot up. 

Taking the 500 million off the table is really positive but we are in Bizarro World so we might see a pullback while everyone digests it. The current PreMarket price is still a good buy in level. Anything up to 15.50-16.50$ for a long term holder is fantastic IMO."

2021-04-27 21:03:21,wallstreetbets,At least yall have a chance now. I personally don't like amc but that 500 million share dilution was ridiculous and would kill the chance of everything
2021-04-27 22:49:50,wallstreetbets,"Some quick back-of-the-envelope math says that those 500m additional shares are going to be needed over the long run...

[Q1 losses were just reported](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-to-sell-up-to-43-million-fresh-shares-but-calls-off-plans-to-seek-approval-for-500-million-more-11619564599?siteid=yhoof2) as *a minimum* of $567.2 million...43m shares at $11.50/ea (current price) = $494.5 million, which means that selling those 43m shares doesn't even get their heads back above water...

And then of course there's that $6 ***billion***+ in high interest debt still on the books with no discernable revenue stream to service this...those 500m shares could therefore be literally life-or-death for this company, so while nobody wants to see that kind of dilution, it's pretty likely that that's going to need to occur sometime over the next 2-3 years.

Do with that info what you will; I don't have any AMC stock or options, I'm just a bystander that's fascinated by the drama of all this...I like going to the movies -- AMC needs to start selling a *lot* of popcorn if they're going to survive in the brave new world of big screen HDTVs at home and a dozen streaming rivals with much deeper pockets..."
2021-04-28 05:26:26,wallstreetbets,"Dilution is the wrong way of looking at it. 

It's **raising capital**, which any company will try to turn into more capital. That is how a for profit business works. If you don't think your company can do that, use money to make more money, why are you invested in it? If you think it can turn money into more money, raising money is a good thing!

Also: public market funding is about the cheapest money there is. No series ABC, or bonds even come close!"
2021-04-28 11:56:42,wallstreetbets,Still 42 mil though right? Way better than 500 but still a decent amount

Riley Securities, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc as sale agents to sell the remaining 43 mil shares  ‚Äúat-the-market offerings.‚Äù  They stated that they will pay the sales agents a commission of up to 2.5% of the gross sales price per share sold through them as agent under the Distribution Agreement. Which basically incentivizes them to sell the shares at the highest price possible. So technically if a squeeze were to happen they could then sell those shares to the gay bears or over time.

2021-04-28 08:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I know no one wants to see the share price of AMC go down but a dilution isn‚Äôt a terrible move for the longs term of the company. Considering they could use that cash to accomplish two things

1) maintain the infrastructure in place / not make too many cuts do to corona virus lost revenue 

2) they could reinvest the cash into remodeling their movie theaters to create more of an experience. Pre- corona the business was being hurt by people just watching at home and streaming. Theatres were starting to combat this by making the seats larger / reclining , better food, service that will bring food to you before the show, allowing alcohol in the theatres. All of this made it more about the experience of going to the movies and less about just seeing movie itself. To me that seems like the only way this business continues regardless of corona virus. 

I know a lot of people are invested in AMC and don‚Äôt want to see it go down, but diluting here wouldn‚Äôt be a terrible move. It might be the move that allows them to survive while their competitors die, ultimately leaving them with more market share."

This literally says they can offer 500M to 1B worth of shares at anytime without stock holder approval...if you read the full document they literally say they do not have enough cash to make it through 2021 and would need to achieve 90% of precovid capacity by Q3 in order to not do another offering or some other sort of capital raise.

2021-04-28 04:20:41,wallstreetbets,Are these stocks still worth holding onto? I just don‚Äôt see a movie theatre company going anywhere but extinct since everyone streams from several platforms from the condor f the own home. I personally haven‚Äôt been to a movie theatre to watch a movie in at least 10 years. It‚Äôs 2021. Why is there hype about this?

2021-04-28 05:42:53,wallstreetbets,My GOD. AMC just pick-pocketed existing shareholders for another half a BILLION dollars with a 43 million new share issuance and you're saying the CEO respects shareholders?
2021-04-28 08:52:10,wallstreetbets,Then.... why is it dropping....
2021-04-28 11:00:54,wallstreetbets,"Um... just looks to me like they don't know what they're doing. ""Massive dilution! No wait, maybe not. But we might again in the future!"""
2021-04-28 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,"Not really, all he cares about is staying afloat.  He is trying to survive and dilution is happening which is already having consequences.  So the company might survive at the expense of a lower stock price when is all said and done.  You should go to the nearest AMC theater to get a feel for the business and you will see that is not looking good.  So simply go check it out for yourself and make up your mind."

Announce you're taking 500 million shares that were never issued off the table on the same day you also announce that you're selling 43 million shares that are ON the table - further pickpocketing existing shareholders.

Wonder how much AA's bonus is going to be next quarter."

Then only the ugly kids would like you. AMC is giving (selling) more crayons."
2021-04-27 21:23:59,wallstreetbets,"More shares being created mean that your shares are worth less. Selling shares should balance, because an equivalent amount of money comes in to the company.

2021-04-27 21:34:22,wallstreetbets,It's pretty straight forward. They won't vote to dilute this coming meeting. They pushed it back to a date who knows when.

Maybe people said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt need them till 2022, why bother voting on it now?‚Äù.

CEO went on Twitter yesterday and said ‚ÄúI hear you guys, we don‚Äôt need the 500mil anymore, so we ain‚Äôt voting on it‚Äù. Then it was signed and became official.

The reason stock price often goes down after something like this is because EPS goes down and you own a smaller % of the company which matters for voting rights etc"

2021-04-27 20:27:51,wallstreetbets,If they issue more shares then the value of each share goes down. Anyone with shares in AMC will be down.

I get the resurgence immediately after Covid, but is that it? You guys hoping for a big bubble post-Covid and then selling off as theaters continue to decline, or is there more to this that I‚Äôm not seeing?

Edit: oye I‚Äôm just asking a question, do you gotta be so immediate with the downvotes? Lol. I just don‚Äôt understand the current situation. I‚Äôve held gme for over a year now and I felt like it was a good thing that they were selling shares, regardless of how many, amc holders don‚Äôt? To me that sounds like you guys don‚Äôt have faith in it long term, is that not accurate?"
2021-04-28 00:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I think long term and invest fundamentally not technically. It makes more sense for me. If you get out in time and make money, great. But realistically, long term, a stock will always correct to match the actual earnings of the company.

2021-04-27 22:46:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm curious as well
2021-04-27 20:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Oops I just realized I missed a key detail. Even though in the interview where he promised that they wouldn't use any of the 500m shares, people were still worried about the fact that he was still pushing a vote to have 500m shares for possible dilution. Now he straight up says they're not even gonna discuss/vote on 500m shares for a long time, basically hinting as to when the squeeze is over."
2021-04-27 20:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Retail investors own about 80%-90% of the float, so I'd assume AMC is being very careful right now. If they let down the retail investors, I'm pretty sure retail investors will retaliate quite hard."
2021-04-27 21:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I mean this as nicely as possible but you should do research on the stock and form an opinion.

Yes this is good for the short term and it's good if you believe in the squeeze. However even if it's a good thing it doesn't guarantee the stock will go up. 

I would say there's a good chance it'll go green tomorrow but if its red that would be a bit surprising. 

Earnings is coming up soon too probably. That's something you should look into and keep track up if you're holding."
2021-04-27 23:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Because it‚Äôs a dogshit company. Just like everyone thought GME was a dogshit company before the concept of a squeeze entered the picture.

2021-04-28 13:39:30,wallstreetbets,"Float is big and retail investors have 80-90% of it at this point. Short interest is 26-27%, GME popped from 32%."

2021-04-28 06:49:22,wallstreetbets,Worst part is i sold for a loss then it skyrocketed to 14 ... facepalm. Learned my lesson
2021-04-28 17:38:50,wallstreetbets,I sold at a 1k loss. Kicking myself on that one because as soon as I sold it exploded to 14 per share next day. That would had been enough to get me green.

2021-04-28 01:17:27,wallstreetbets,"AMC is a decent long term play. I believe it will double from its current rate long term, maybe triple. AMC literally has earned itself and gained for itself a massive legion of long term investors. 

If a squeeze happens or when it does. All of us will reap the benefits. The moon is the limit. 

I own Gme as well. I bought Gme at 35 and sold 75 percent at some point. Brother you need to diversify and get in on some AMC. Can‚Äôt hurt you. Not recommending you bet your house. But cover your arse ? Yes! 

We are still a good price to get in now before our summer attack campaign starts."
2021-04-28 00:53:02,wallstreetbets,Theyre holding for a squeeze and post covid to drive up prices. At least that's what the hope is for.

2021-04-28 01:06:00,wallstreetbets,"I hear you man. I have a solid portfolio as well. However, based on fundamentals I still believe AMC will double from its current level. You and I both know 90 percent of ‚Äúsolid‚Äù companies are trading how much P/E ahead of their true value ? 

Squeeze first and then a solid and decent flat price for AMC. It is a great stock to own at this level ahead of summer. If you want a speculative move and some decent profit. You may want to join.

AMC on the other hand, people will either realize how much they miss going to the theatre, or they won't, no drastic changes coming, as you implied. But I truly believe that after being locked down for so long, people realise they took thing slike movie theatres for granted. And if movies on the big screen die forever, that would be a huge shame for everyone. Even the people that only went once a year for that big Blockbuster.

Not to mention it is far easier for the millions of amc investors to support their company on a casual basis than it is for Gamestop. Going to a movie you can do regularly, you only need a new video card or video game much less often."

2021-04-28 06:34:52,wallstreetbets,Read the bottom .it said from time to time . In the sec filing bit also said these kind of offerings usually are spread out over a 3 year period .they will sell them along the way .or they couple be about to aquire some of the smaller theatre chains that went out of business. That would be a huge catalyst . In previous years amc is known for buying out smaller companies .they have over 1 Billion in free cash on hand . I could see Adam Aaron doing this an really sticking it to the short sellers tbh.

2021-04-28 19:48:19,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt disagree that AMC might see an uptick in visitors. But what kills the valuation is the absolute insane share dilution they‚Äôve already done since the end of 2019. Looking at the previous pre-pandemic ATH and comparing it to the size of the float today is an apples to oranges comparison. Especially since they are considering eventually selling another 500m shares.

In the winters, I worked at adventure ridge at night managing activities and guiding snowmobile tours. Best years of my life.

2021-04-28 06:08:10,wallstreetbets,"Occam‚Äôs razor my friend. They have engaged 3 brokers to sell their shares, filed an 8-K, have been talking about issuing those 43m for months now, explicitly said in their March filing they are reserving their right to issue those 43m shares in 2021, and lastly the market cap is higher it‚Äôs been in ages. 

Does it have to be this week or today? No. Will they wait until December to issue? Unlikely. 

Much more likely they capitalize on this price ASAP."

2021-04-27 21:09:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not fud it‚Äôs reality. They had to sell shares then and will have to sell shares again in the future because their business model is obsolete and they are losing loads of money every quarter. Nothing has changed about that. Top it off with a $5B market cap which is literally the most this company has ever been worth since it began public trading and you have to be a special kind of retarded to think this is a good investment. Owning this stock is just paying off a failing company‚Äôs debt in perpetuity.

2021-04-27 21:27:43,wallstreetbets,I guess we‚Äôll have to let the free market decide then won‚Äôt we? Just because short interest is relatively low does not mean a squeeze can not take place. A rising price fucks those that are short. Those shares must be purchased. At higher prices. Driving the price higher. It won‚Äôt be infinite obviously but it could still take place at a smaller scale.
2021-04-28 00:42:31,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs just hope it‚Äôs not the fifth grader.
2021-04-28 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,"Lol, well it does take a herd of tards to liquidate HF‚Äôs. Most people didn‚Äôt trust AA in the AMC sub until yesterday, and people are still cautious. They‚Äôve had those 43 million shares since 2013 and even if every single share was bought by Citadel or Melvin Capital, they‚Äôd still be way short of what they need. A lot of those shares will go to retail and hopefully a whale or two. AA‚Äôs response to the 43 million so far though has been ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt made any decisions yet.‚Äù

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôs gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it‚Äôs gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we‚Äôve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don‚Äôt really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we‚Äôre not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It‚Äôs IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin‚Äô companies, theres plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

That means hedge funds need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit or else they'll have to cover. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.

I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  
""This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.""

One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers ""digesting"" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.

One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.

One could speculate that the ""chip shortage"" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.

All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.

With AMD, there's no need for WSB or individual investors to try to turn it around on the short selling hedge funds, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, diamond hands, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.

AMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. My price target is $120 which is more conservative than even some analysts."

My tinder responded, ""Who?""

I reply with, ""Oh she's the CEO of AMD! She's Taiwanese.""

Her reply to this was along the line of just because she was a programmer doesn't mean I should expect her to know every thing in the tech world.

2021-04-27 21:23:02,wallstreetbets,"I think you need to look at this from two perspectives, specially when saying you want whoever gives 4k/60fps first. 

AMD offers two different products here competing against two different companies.

AMD vs Intel for processors.
AMD vs Nvidia for graphics.

As some have said, AMD is kicking butt in the processor game. Their processors are just way more price competitive while still offering like 95% of the single core capability of Intel and destroying them on multi core.

Graphics cards are another boat though. Yes, AMD has made great graphics cards, but THE NAME in the game is still Nvidia (though I hate their efforts to make things proprietary). Though AMD is hedging at Nvidia pretty hard too...

Honestly AMD should start manufacturing more PC parts as well, get a RAM and motherboard kit and good to go."
2021-04-28 00:06:08,wallstreetbets,Most current cards can run that. The problem is software developers releasing unpolished half baked bullshit. Optimization has been garbage.

Entirely disappointed as I bought 4/30 calls in anticipation of them just hammering earnings and issuing higher guidance, both of which happened."
2021-04-27 21:15:53,wallstreetbets,They are not related.. it's been debunked. You can find it in her wikipedia page.
2021-04-28 00:09:35,wallstreetbets,"AMD always beats earnings, but the price moving up after earnings is new to me. They usually beat the hell out of earnings followed by a huge dip. 

It didnt pass AH because theres a 30 billion dollar dilution in the works. Itll pass AH soon enough.

Plus scooping up market share from intel with data centers is huge. Data center growth has no known ceiling. Becoming a leading supplier for their chips is big."
2021-04-27 21:58:13,wallstreetbets,Because you like your computer to be slower and warmer?
2021-04-27 22:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Honestly not a bad choice. Intel have slashed the prices of their chips now they've realised they don't compete in performance. The tables have turned... If you want a cheap CPU and don't care about having the best performance, buy an Intel üòÇ"

On the bright side, I've never heard of someone bending their multi hundred dollar CPU pins a second time."

2021-04-27 21:54:18,wallstreetbets,"It depends.  Its possible you get lucky and you only bend a pin that really doesn't matter and the CPU boots and posts for you.  Otherwise, heat gun, microscope, and a lot of stress.  Linus Tech Tips did a video or two on repairing a borked CPU.  It looks nightmarish."
2021-04-27 22:55:18,wallstreetbets,"OT but... I did this with my Ryzen 9 5950X when installing it, i dropped it and bent 2 pins. I just used my phone's camera as a magnifier glass and tiny tweezers to bend them back to close enough. They don't have to be perfect, just enough for it to drop into the socket. Then the socket will straighten it all the way."
2021-04-27 22:00:14,wallstreetbets,Usually you can fix it with a index card and careful bending before inserting. I have done it before.

You're absolutely going to screw it up the first couple of times unless you are a jewelry maker or some other job that requires extreme precision. You need a soldering iron with an extremely fine tip, tweezers, and more patience than most people possess.  

If the pins are just a tiny bit bent, with AMD chips you might be able to wiggle them into the socket, clamp it down and pray.  With most intel sockets the pins are actually on the motherboard not the processor so it's an even bigger pain in the ass."

Their graphics GPUs are actually faster in two most popular resolutions 1080p and 1440p. Only 2% of gamers own a 4k monitor. And many prefer high refresh rate gaming 144hz or more where AMD is now king. Which happens at the lower resolution monitors.

So for the widest use case AMD has faster GPUs. Nvidia however is still more popular due to 4k crown and some other propriatery features they maketed well.

But technologically speaking a much smaller AMD is competing and beating the two big guys Intel and Nvidia at their core businesses.. and just this year they are investing in more R&D quite significantly. In other words this looks like just a begining."

Funniest thing is they crashed during early Covid, i.e. when Covid hit the West  (March/April 2020) because for some reason people thought that in a global shortage, the kingmaker would suffer. It's come up about 3.5x in the year since.

&#x200B;

Edit: The reason people thought it would suffer is due to possible raw material and shipping/supply issues, as well as component shortages at the places they sell to i.e intel, amd, apple, third party OEMs, which would make them buy less.

2021-04-28 04:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Shortage can be supply side or demand side (not the right term but people are familiar with those concepts). Previously, there was equilibrium between the two. During covid, supply side increased, but demand side increased many times over. Hence the shortage. The shortage could have happened on the other end too, supply decreasing a lot, and demand decreasing a bit. In the second scenario, their Revenues would be much lower.

&#x200B;

usually, especially for big industries like this, Supply and Demand are always correlated so they don't just take off in the opposite direction, Demand necessitates supply, and supply can induce some demand, etc."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MNMD Starter Due Diligence Alright so you've obviously heard the craze by now about psych stocks and I'm sure a lot of it has been gain porn and fat stacks. If MNMD's poor up-listing performance today didn't turn you off, here is some DD that will hopefully give you a better idea of what the company does. Plenty of people seem to think that MNMD is going to be selling tabs of acid and caps of mush to folks, but that's just not it. Take a look at whats below if you're interested.

&#x200B;

**Psych Sector Quick Overview**

At the moment, there are (I think) 28 publicly traded companies in the sector. They are pretty much all penny stocks, except for Compass and Mind Med. This is a nascent sector and most likely an extended play given the time it takes for the drugs to come to market. Basically the sector can be divided into three main groups: **1) Drug Developers**, **2) Clinic companies**, and **3) Recreational Companies**. Many companies blend these different categories but the one we are looking at today is predominantly in the drug development space. The drugs they are working on can be classified into two distinct categories: **1) Classical psychedelic compounds** (Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.) and **2) Novel psychedelic compounds** (Derivatives and Novel Formulations). MindMed is focused on developing a blend of these two. There's an incredible wealth of research that has gone into these substances and how they are presumed to be far more effective than traditional therapy options in treating a variety of psychological disorders and ailments. In fact, **Ketamine is already being used** in assisted therapy in many places around the world. The sector had quite the run last fall and early into the new year. Looking like there might be another run based on a couple of big-name catalysts in the coming weeks. Because of the volatility and anecdotal hype, plenty of people have likened the sector to weed. But anyone who has felt the benefits of these drugs knows it's not the same. Sure, most of the companies are going to fail, and many don't have a lot to offer at all. However, MindMed is one of the biggest names, with the biggest backers and the most expansive drug pipelines, so it's nice to think they are in a league of their own.

&#x200B;

**Mind Medicine:**

To get us started, their mission statement: ‚ÄúMindMed‚Äôs mission is to **discovery, development, and deploy** psychedelic inspired medicines and therapies intended to treat diseases in the areas of **psychiatry**, **neurology**, **addiction**, **pain**, and potentially others such as **anxiety disorders**, **substance use disorders** and **withdrawal**, and **adult attention deficit disorder**.‚Äù

The company breaks its process down into three parts that I‚Äôll preface here so that you can reference them as you read through:

* ***Discover:*** This is where new compounds are being discovered, formulated, and tested in pre-clinical settings. Making sure things are safe and effective.
* ***Develop:*** Where the clinical trials start-up and the big money is spent.
* ***Deploy:*** Commercialization, distribution, scaling, access; the business side of things.

Will touch more on these different stages and what they have going on further down.

&#x200B;

***MindMed: Financials and Company***

Drug development is crazy expensive, and MindMed has taken the opportunity many times to raise capital to finance its growth and development over the last year. Investors have complained quite a lot about it over the previous year, but it‚Äôs a reality we‚Äôre just going to have to deal with. Also, on this note, keep an eye out for up to CAD $500 million to be raised over the next two years; the base shelf prospectus has been filed and will be effective in the near future. \*Sorry, I really don‚Äôt feel like doing all to currency conversions between USD and CAD.\*

***Funding ‚Äì***

* *Total Funding:* As of March 30, 2021, MindMed had a **cash balance of $203 Million (All in CAD)**
* Tranche 2: February 18, 2020 MindMed completes second tranche for **$9,227,000 CAD**
* Tranche 3: February 26, 2020 MindMed completes third tranche for **$10,252,000 CAD**
* Offering 1: May 26, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal financing for **$9,582,000 CAD**
* Offering 2: October 30, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for **$28,751,000 CAD**
* Offering 3: December 11, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for **$34,523,000 CAD**
* Offering 4: January 7, 2021 MindMed completes bought deal for **$92,100,000 CAD**
* Offering 5: March 8, 2021 MindMed complete private financing deal for **$19,500,000 CAD**

**Base Shelf Prospectus:** On April 9th, 2021, MindMed filed their final short form prospectus, pretty much laying out a way for them to more easily ***raise up to $500 million (CANADIAN) whenever market conditions are optimal for the next 25 months.*** *So be on the lookout for some pretty decent money-raising when/if the share price is looking crispy*

MindMed has never shied away from milking the pockets of eager investors; nor should they. The consistent interest from investors is a great sign; it's not as if people are scared of throwing their money into this company.

MindMed **burned through $24.2 million** CAD in 2020. **Total comprehensive loss** for the year of 2020 was **$35.1 million** but was offset by like $8 million.

***Expenses ‚Äì***

One of MindMed‚Äôs recent filings laid out how they intend to allocate their funding over the next year or two reasonably well. If you‚Äôre looking for this kind of information, you can find the MD&A filing on SEDAR. They also lay out how they anticipate allocating funding from specific offerings to specific programs. It‚Äôs a lot of information, but I‚Äôm not going to include it here. Quite a few of MindMed‚Äôs acquisitions have been predominantly made via the offering of shares, so they haven‚Äôt had the same level of cash burning as some of the other emerging companies in the sector. For example:

* **55 Million Class A shares were offered for their 18-MC program**
* **81,833 Multiple Voting Shares** (8,183,300 equivalent) were **issued to acquire Health Mode** (plus a cash payment of $286,000)

***Fair Value of Common Shares:*** Haven‚Äôt been able to find any estimates or projections. If you know of any, just send a message, and this will be updated. The recent offering prices and warrant exercise prices might give you an idea of what investors have been willing to pay for the issued shares. Will put those below. Also, the up-listing today saw some tremendous volatility and the stock reaching all time highs. (RIP to the fella who bought for over $8 USD premarket lol)

&#x200B;

|**Offering Close Date**|**Unit Price**|**Warrant Symbol**|**Exercise Price / Date**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|***May 26, 2020***|**$0.53 CAD**|**(MindMed).WT**|**$0.79 CAD ‚Äì May 26, 2022**|
|***October 30, 2020***|**$1.05 CAD**|**(MindMed).WS**|**$1.40 CAD ‚Äì October 30, 2023**|
|***December 11, 2020***|**$1.90 CAD**|**(MindMed).WA**|**$2.45 CAD ‚Äì December 11, 2023**|
|***January 7, 2021***|**$4.40 CAD**|**(MindMed).WR**|**$5.75 CAD ‚Äì January 7, 2024**|
|***March 8, 2021 (Private)***|**$3.25 CAD**|**N/A**|**$4.40 CAD ‚Äì March 9, 2024**|

&#x200B;

***Company and Investments ‚Äì***

To build the company MNMD has focused on acquiring compounds, partnering with labs, and acquisitions. The partnerships they have with labs for R&D are reputable academic institutions that MindMed has agreed to help fund. In turn, MindMed has exclusive access to trials, data, and discoveries. The chart below is taken from their filings hopefully, it gives you a sufficient idea of what the companies structure is looking like.

**MindMed: Pipeline**

MindMed has a pretty comprehensive pipeline of drugs they are developing. This pipeline has started to expand more due to their partnerships and acquisitions. Through their partnerships with labs, universities, and researchers, MindMed has exclusive licenses, including DMT, MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin. There are currently **four trials going on at University Hospital Basel**, and **13 have already been completed** giving MindMed some very valuable data to help push their approvals and research along with faster than they otherwise could have. Here‚Äôs an overview of their programs, compounds, and trials, along with their stage of development.

***Discover:***

* April 2020, MindMed signed a nice **exclusive collaboration deal with** **University Hospital Basel‚Äôs Liechti Lab** (some of the most prolific psychedelic researchers). All IP, trial data, and tech that‚Äôs developed here are MindMed‚Äôs for the foreseeable future. This originally only gave them **access to LSD trials** and data, but they‚Äôve since upped their game and expanded the deal to include trials and data on **MDMA, DMT, MDMA-LSD (candy flipping), and Psilocybin**. Any solid discoveries or advancements will be integrated into MindMed‚Äôs pipeline. For example, MindMed already gained data from an ongoing **P2 LSD-Anxiety trial from UHB.**
* February 11, 2021,  **MindMed announced a partnership with MindShift** out of Switzerland. This partnership is **focused more on developing novel psychedelic compounds** to add to their pipeline. This has been a huge trend in the sector. Companies are trying to modify the compounds to be more conducive to the therapeutic process. Lots of talks have been had around **taking the ‚Äútrip‚Äù out of the trip**. They are basically allowing people to feel **the benefits without hallucinating**. Their CEO said some **compounds have already been identified** for development, but there‚Äôs not much on what exactly these secret compounds are. However, patents have apparently been filed over these compounds, so if any of you sleuths can find them, it would be much appreciated.

***Develop:***

* Once psychedelic compounds are identified, they‚Äôll move onto this stage. As of now MindMed has a couple big ones in the works which you‚Äôll be able to find more details on in the chart below. The trials of focus right now investigating 18-MC and LSD for different purposes.

&#x200B;

|**Company / Partner**|**Compound**|**Disorder / Purpose**|**Progress / Stage**|**Rights / IP / Data**|**Market Competition**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MindMed (Project Layla)|18-MC (ibogaine derivative)|Opioid Use Disorder, Withdrawal, and Potentially Other Addictions|P2a (Q3 2021)  P3 (**at the earliest** **2023)**|Provisional patent filings (MindMed Assignee)|Company focused on developing other Ibogaine derivatives.|
|MindMed (Project Lucy)|LSD|Anxiety|P2b (Second half of 2021)|UHB Data|Many companies in the sector are focused on treating anxiety|
|MindMed (UHB)|Ketanserin|Psychedelic Antagonist (The Naloxone of Psychs)|P1 (ongoing)|MindMed + UHB have filed a patent application preserving worldwide rights|Benzos have been used to kill trips.|
|MindMed (UHB)|LSD|LSD Cluster Headaches|P2 (ongoing)|UHB Data and Rights|Some other headache type trials going on, but not as far along|
|MindMed (Project Flow)|LSD|Adult ADD|P2a (approval granted Q3 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|No ongoing trials in other companies investigating this|
|MindMed|LSD|Microdosing (focus, creativity, mood, anxiety)|(Starting soon)|Honestly don't know|First ever P2a clinical trial for microdosing LSD. Very little competition this far along|
|MindMed (UHB)|DMT|Neurodynamics|P1 (Q2 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|A smallcap is investigating intravenous DMT therapy for stroke patients|
|MindMed (UHB)|LSD + MDMA|Candy flipping Investigation|P1 (Q1 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|No candy flipping trials have been conducted yet|
|MindMed (MindShift)|Novel Compounds|Investigative|Launching early (Q1 2022)|Patents filed preserving rights to the novel compounds|Many companies are focused on developing their own compounds so there‚Äôs a ton of emerging competition here|

* I wasn't able to actually list the companies they are competing with here since the bot woulda flagged me but if you're curious shoot me a dm and I'll send you the full list.

MindMed has some additional compounds that they plan to develop that there hasn‚Äôt been a ton of information posted on. However, they are the assignee of a family of patents in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand for psychotherapy using **3-MMC**. The disorders it covers are distress, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder. A lot of other MindMed IP is being held as trade secrets for the time being, so there‚Äôs not a lot to say about it at the moment other than they are expanding their pipeline significantly.

&#x200B;

**MindMed: Partnerships and Technology**

Alright, so now that we have all the major trials and compounds pretty much covered, the third part of the MindMed process is the ***deploy*** phase. This is where their technology projects and other partnerships come into play. The chart below should give you a decent overview of the three biggest developments to come out of MindMed in this front.

&#x200B;

|**Partner/Project**|**Purpose**|
|:-|:-|
|Project Albert|JR (CEO) has been stressing the importance of *Project Albert* for some time now. He has repeatedly emphasized that MindMed is a drug development *and* technology company. *Project Albert* is based on designing and integrating digital therapeutic tools into the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy process. They‚Äôre looking to integrate wearables, tracking, platforms, and other tools into the therapy process so that it can be more patient-personalized, effective, and informative. They‚Äôre also hoping that this part of the company improves the access people have to these medications through telemedicine.|
|MindMed + HealthMode|MindMed added HealthMode to the company to expand *Project Albert*. Using AI, MindMed aims to help speed up the clinical research process and improve patient monitoring efforts. MindMed took on HealthMode‚Äôs entire team and portfolio and will begin to integrate what they have into the trails being developed as well as future patient monitoring platforms.|
|NYU Langone|MindMed is now funding a program at NYU Langone Health to train and prepare the future psychedelic researchers and psychiatrists for the future when these drugs come to market. This isn‚Äôt so much a revenue-generating project as it will benefit the sector at large by having professionals prepared to deliver these therapies.|
|MindShift Compounds AG|I know I touched on this briefly earlier, but the MindShift partnership is where MindMed will gain access to second-generation psychedelic compounds. We all know about the classical psychedelic compounds (LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, DMT, etc.); second-gen compounds are being tailored specifically for different therapeutic purposes allowing companies to engineer more effective and, in some cases, safer compounds. Tons of companies are going down this path, so it‚Äôs good to have this partnership to add to the portfolio.|

&#x200B;

Hopefully that helps some of you out and get you familiar with MNMD. Below this is information on the compounds and trials that MNMD is pursuing. If you aren't interested in a bit of science feel free to cut it off here. If you are, keep reading.

&#x200B;

**Information on Compounds and Trials :**

Sections in Order:

1. **LSD Neutralizer**
2. **Cluster Headaches**
3. **LSD for Adult ADHD/ADD**
4. **LSD for Anxiety**
5. **18-MC for Addiction**

&#x200B;

***LSD Neutralizer***

As I‚Äôm sure a lot of you know, LSD trips last a while. When we are looking at LSD as a compound to be used in assisted therapies, that trip duration brings up some major question marks.

1. Assisted therapies require trained professionals to guide the sessions. Therapy sessions aren‚Äôt cheap; the cost of therapy alone is a major barrier for many people seeking out mental health support. Couple the cost of the compounds and the specialization required for extended psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy sessions and you have a recipe for some potentially pricey treatments.
2. LSD is not toxic to the human body. You don‚Äôt see the same type of physiological or neurotoxic potential that traditional drugs have. However, that does not mean we‚Äôre home free here. It‚Äôs important to recognize that LSD does have some potential health harms that we should all be aware of. Improper use can lead to potential physical harm. Bad trips can lead to emotional distress. If you don‚Äôt screen for underlying psychological conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia some people can experience serious cognitive harms.

This neutralizer technology is purported to act as an off switch for LSD trips. Quick pill and a little while later the trip is over. This funky little compound is called **Ketanserin** and it‚Äôs a major part of dealing with the two issues I mentioned above. If you‚Äôre able to control and attenuate the trip, you‚Äôre able to reduce the time needed to conduct the therapy session. This can reduce costs related to therapy  making it more affordable for a greater number of people. In theory, it could also allow people to take higher single doses, should the therapy demand it, and have the effects neutralized when needed.

Now onto the harms‚Ä¶ Luckily for all of us, the harms mentioned above can be managed/mitigated. Proper psychological screening can work out issues related to underlying conditions. Managing set and setting helps reduce the potential for harms related to improper use like stupid behavior and bad trips. This LSD neutralizer is just another great tool in the therapist's tool belt that can be used to mitigate harm during therapy. Being able to stop the experience allows for a failsafe on the therapy sessions which ensures that no one comes out of it worse than they went in. As an add-value, this compound could be sold to recreational users (in theory) to ensure safe at-home use and could also be used in ER departments where occasionally, I'm sure some people come in experiencing bad trips.

Cool beans, so how does it work? Well, let me use a quick analogy to get the ball rolling.

We are all aware of opioids and how people can easily overdose on them. Guaranteed many of you have also heard of Naloxone, the antidote for an opioid overdose. Think of Kertanserin as you would think of Naloxone.

Naloxone and Kertanserin are both antagonists that act against the effects of their respective counterparts. Opioids produce their effects by interacting with the four opioid receptors we all have in our brains. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that works by binding to those receptors and knocking the opioids off of the receptors for a duration of time; allowing for people to seek the additional help that they need. [Source here](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/understanding-naloxone/) (If you‚Äôre in Canada, go to the pharmacy and get a free Naloxone kit.. you could save a life)

This brings us to Kertanserin and LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD have been theorized to produce their effects through partial serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. (Agonism being the opposite of Antagonism) Kertanserin works as an antagonist to the same receptor, allowing for the effects of LSD to be attenuated. [Here is a study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4610-0) that substantiates the claim that Kertanserin fully blocks the subjective effects of LSD. [Here is another one](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.030)

&#x200B;

***Cluster Headaches***

Yeah, you get headaches, but do you get cluster headaches? I sure hope not. If you do, oh boy does MNMD have the treatment for you. Cluster headaches multiple short, debilitating headaches that can occur repeatedly for expended durations of time. Cluster headaches can go away for a while and then spring back up on you years later. They don‚Äôt affect many people [(\~0.1%)](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/188/3/217.3.full.pdf) and there isn‚Äôt a lot of information out there on what causes them. Regardless, they are painful and people shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with it if they don‚Äôt have to.

Traditional treatments for cluster headaches include oxygen and sumatriptan for single attacks; and verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and more for cluster [attack periods.](https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102410363490) However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that LSD and Psilocybin are both more effective in dealing with individual attacks and attack periods.

[One study](https://ck-wissen.de/ckwiki/images/1/14/IHS_IHC_2009_BOL_Halpern.pdf) using a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD, 2-Bromo-LSD (BOL), found that three single doses of BOL can either break a series of cluster headache attacks or reduce their frequency and intensity. Furthermore, for some, BOL allowed them to achieve remission from their previous chronic cluster headaches. No adverse outcomes were observed in the study. The interesting thing about this study is that the researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of action is unrelated to the serotonin receptor agonism that scientists are theorizing is responsible for hallucinations. This means that it isn‚Äôt so much about the hallucinations, but something else that these beautiful compounds have in store. They theorize that the positive effects are the result of serotonin-receptor-mediated *vasoconstriction*.

[A very recent 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13311-020-00962-y) study backs this up when evaluating the migraine suppressing effects of Psilocybin. The study found that ONE SMALL SINGLE DOSE of shroomies magic chemical, psilocybin, was far more effective than traditional treatments in dealing with migraines. Furthermore, the suppressing effects of the psilocybin on migraines were sustained over two weeks. Again, this study backs up the previous claim that the effects are independent of the hallucinogenic properties of the drugs.

***LSD ‚Äì For Adult ADHD***

Stimulants suck for a lot of people who had ADD/ADHD. They often kill your sex drive, they make you irritable, and they sometimes make you lose weight among many other things. Having a viable alternative is something many of us have dreamed of for a long while. I guarantee you‚Äôve all heard the stories of Silicon Valley execs micro-dosing LSD to improve their productivity and creativity. Well, it looks like our ex-silicon valley CEO now wants to lay down some hard science on this practice.

So what does the anecdotal evidence say?

[Study 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02791072.2020.1761573?casa_token=FGgn9elCDA4AAAAA:P3_F-W3CDq-kHsfupA86zgGYB-guSujfCYtu-F3yHZ1IZOeYvNs3M9uwdWrt_HkQvEIqD4aPYtRW):

* General effects have been described as ‚Äúa really good day‚Äù.
* 80% of people surveyed reported a positive or neutral experience.
* The most common reason for stopping the micro-dosing regime was that people felt the practice was ineffectual.
* Many patients reported positive impacts on depression and anxiety.
* Some patients felt that micro-dosing long-term exacerbated their mental health issues.\*
* 69% person of surveyed college students who micro-dosed reported at least one negative side effects from the practice. The most common negative side effect was hallucinations (44.2%). (Maybe from inaccurate dosages?)
* One other very common concern was the legality of the practice. (Gotta hate those stupid laws)
* Multiple studies reported that people consistently felt great improvements in creativity.

[Study 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02791072.2019.1593561):

* Many patients reported that they wanted to microdose for their diagnosed ADHD/self-diagnosed attention issues.
* Most surveyed reported productivity increases and that they procrastinated less.\*
* This study proposes that despite LSD and Psilocybin acting on different neuroreceptors than traditional stimulants, that their effects could be positives because they are still stimulating drugs.\*
* A substantial amount those surveyed reported substituting micro-dosing for their stimulants.
* Participants reported improvements in home life including a more giving, patient, and open attitude with family members.

[Study 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00672/full):

* The most prevalent mental disorder diagnoses in this study were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD/ADD.
* Microdosing was rated more effective than traditional treatment options for ADHD/ADD.
* The study theorized that micro-dosing is often preferred because it doesn‚Äôt come with as many negative side effects.
* Specifically for ADHD, micro-dosing did not come with the same crash that stimulants did.
* An additional advantage was that there was not a need to microdose daily. Rather the psychedelic doses were taken every few days (usually).

[Study 4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881120953994?casa_token=LL80YSLkwSMAAAAA:YE-Nf67RFWcQKBHN6CDxKm_eJJQEQVpNoDudsrmGscL9AMU1vdW3rwXzpHN4EsTnzOehk_eQMhtK):

* The most commonly reported effects of micro-dosing were improved mood and creativity.
* A previous study found that participants performed significantly better on a divergent creativity task following a small dose of psilocybin.
* A 2019 study found that the acute effects of a microdose of LSD were an increased feeling of vigor, friendliness, energy, and social benefit.
* The most commonly reported challenge related to micro-dosing was reported to be ‚Äúnone‚Äù (lol)
* Some challenges include impaired focus and physiological discomfort. These may be once again due to improper/high dosages.
* Lack of precision in terms of the compound you are purchasing can also contribute to negative effects.

If you are wondering about the theorized mechanisms of actions and stuff I would recommend you check out [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119857204). There is a lot to it, but you can sift through the section titles quickly. I would recommend reading Question 5, 6, 7, and 8. (Page 1043-1046)

Ultimately there isn‚Äôt much clinical evidence to back this one up. I‚Äôm glad MMED is taking the steps needed to address this gap in the literature. It will for sure be one that I am paying attention to. Consistent themes in the studies included some negative effects related to dosage. I think that a clinically dosed regime would resolve a lot of these issues especially if a determined dosage scale based on body weight, metabolism, and other factors was developed. However, one major concern I have is that there is anecdotal evidence of microdosing exacerabting underlying mental health issues.

**LSD ‚Äì For Anxiety**

A lot of the current focus in terms of LSD and anxiety has been its use in palliative care. People who are faced with some pretty scary diseases have reported some great improvements in their condition after psychedelic experiences. Anxiety is a very very broad category of diagnosis. I won‚Äôt be able to cover them all here but I will list the 12 broad diagnosis possibilities the DSM-V gives us. The ones I focused my research on are bold.

* Separation Anxiety Disorder
* Selective Mutism
* Specific Phobia
* Social Anxiety Disorder
* Panic Attack
* Agoraphobia
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**
* Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder
* **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
* Other Specified Anxiety Disorder
* Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

[***Study 1***](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881114555249?casa_token=J8Q8H2JouXYAAAAA:95_8VljUYfbiwXvmRWPb50WxwavksJhfR26xxtf8mSS1GIHYTDxR_V2rENfuYS5KOR1iHxilvy22)***: LSD-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening Disease***

This study interviewed 10 participants who had undergone LSD-assisted psychotherapy to assist in dealing with their palliative-related anxiety. After 12 months the patients were interviewed and none of them reported any lasting adverse reactions or effects. 77.8% of patients reported a reduction in anxiety and 66.7% reported a rise in quality of life.

If you‚Äôre interested in reading about the first-hand accounts I would recommend reading more into this particular quallatative study. Some of the effects and stories are very profound.

[***Study 2***](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201786)***: Modern Clinical Research on LSD (Very Comprehensive)***

*Mechanism of Action: (For the Science People)*

* LSD potently binds to serotonin 5-HT receptors (1a, 2a, 2c), dopamine d2 receptor, and a2 adrenergic receptor.
* The hallucinogenic effects are mediated by the drugs affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. This has been proven due to the ability to block these subjective effects using an antagonist (See the LSD Neutralizer).
* The full scope of the mechanisms of actions has not been fully identified. However, one key mechanism is the activation of frontal cortex glutamate transmission.
* LSD binds more potently to 5-HT2A receptors than does psilocybin.
* Unlike other serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD binds to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In humans, LSD may enhance dopamine neurotransmission. (COOL)
* LSD increases functional connectivity between various brain regions. (COOL)
* Functional brain imaging showed more globally synchronized activity within the brain and a reduction of network separation while under the pharmacological effects of LSD.
* LSD decreased default mode network integrity.
* LSD reduced left amygdala reactivity to the presentation of fearful faces. (COOL)

*Adverse Effects:*

* Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil side.
* Adverse effects 10-24 hours after administration include difficult concentration, headaches, dizziness, lack of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, imbalance, and exhaustion.
* No severe side effects have been found and it is physically non-toxic.
* Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a rare disorder stemming from psychedelic use. Occurs almost exclusively in illicit use or patients with underlying cognitive predispositions **like anxiety**. (Uh oh)

*Effects on Patients:*

* Profound anxiety or panic was not experienced by patients of one study.
* LSD mainly induced blissful states, audiovisual synesthesia, changes in the meaning of perceptions, and positively experiences derealization and depersonalization.
* At 200 micrograms, LSD acutely induced mystical experiences in patients undergoing psychotherapy. This is important because previous studies with psilocybin have shown that mystical experiences are correlated with improvements in mood and personality and **better therapeutic outcomes in patients with anxiety**, depression, and substance use disorders.
* Music has been used to produce greater feelings of transcendence and wonder in patients.
* LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces and enhanced emotional empathy.
* LSD produced moderate ego dissolution.
* LSD produced lower fear perception which may be useful in psychotherapy.

*Mid/Long Term Effects:*

* The use of classical psychedelics is associated with lower psychological distress, lower suicidality, and lower mental health problems.
* LSD in healthy subjects increase optimism and trait openness 2 weeks after administration and produced trends towards decreases in distress and delusional thinking.

There isn‚Äôt a ton of research on LSD for treating anxiety out there right now. You‚Äôre far more likely to find literature on psilocybin. This could be for a variety of reasons but regardless it is fantastic that MMED is again, researching to fill the gaps here. My biggest takeaways here are that LSD is showing some significant promise concerning treating anxiety. The effects that it has on the human brain make it a fantastic candidate for integration into therapy sessions. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of the role of the therapist. I‚Äôll have to look harder into what MMED is doing to develop therapeutic processes but like [Study 3](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454576/FULLTEXT01.pdf) iterated, the relationship between the therapist and patient is imperative. Additionally, the patient needs to be equipped to deal with any adverse outcomes or reactions that could arise throughout the treatment. I think this part in particular bodes well for MMED since the LSD neutralizer is a fantastic way to ensure safety throughout the entire therapeutic process.

&#x200B;

**18-MC ‚Äì For Addiction**

Ahhh 18-MC, MMED‚Äôs promise child‚Ä¶ Addiction is a bitch, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. The toll it has and continues to have on the world is horrible. Opioid overdoses are consistently increasing, alcohol dependence continues to destroy families and lives and cocaine abuse is no joke.

[STATS](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf)

1. 52 million people currently use opioids.
2. Opioids are responsible for \~2/3 substance abuse-related deaths.
3. 11 million people inject some form of opioid on a daily basis.

I could list all the addictions in the world but I‚Äôm sure you get the picture. It‚Äôs a serious issue, one that MMED seeks to resolve with 18-MC.

Before we look at 18-MC we have to talk about Ibogaine. [This study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) gives a great overview of Ibogaine but I‚Äôll give you the summary here. Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that is found within the *Tabernanthe iboga* plant in West Africa. The plants' root bark can be consumed in both refined and crude forms, and in high doses can produce trance-like states with visual and auditory hallucinations. Ibogaine has been theorized as an effective natural treatment of substance use disorders.

How Ibogaine works on the human body and mind is still speculative. Ibogaine serves as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. This particular receptor is a molecular target for several abused drugs. [A previous study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20a%20pivotal%20role,for%20several%20drugs%20of%20abuse.&text=These%20ligands%20include%20the%20NMDA,partial%20NMDA%20agonist%20d%2DCycloserine.) on NMDA receptor modulators found that agonism of these receptors has some limited benefit in treating drug addiction. However, without further study, the way it produces its anti-addictive effects are still in question. For all the science buffs out there, [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077262) rules out one other mechanism of action of Iboga Alkaloids.

Ibogaine has previously been investigated as [a treatment for opioid use disorder](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf). A study in 1999 focused on ibogaine in the opioid detoxification process. Patients were treated using different doses of ibogaine based on bodyweight. 76% of the participants did not experience opioid withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. Furthermore, they did not seek out their substances of choice for the three days they were under observation post-treatment. Another 12% of the patients did not experience withdrawal symptoms but still decided to resume drug abuse.

[Another study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) on individuals who sought out treatment for their opioid use disorder found that after 12 months, 75% of participating patients tested negative for opioid use. To back this up, a later study found that one month after treatment, 50% of patients reported no opioid use for the following 12 months.

Despite this promise, Ibogaine has the potential to be a dangerous compound. There have been 19 documented fatalities from Ibogaine, one of which was under medical supervision. [Ibogaine induces body tremors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) at moderate doses. In high doses, Ibogaine is neurotoxic. Ibogaine also has the potential to decrease the human heart rate and impact blood pressure. These possible dangers served as the impetus of **Stanley Glick (Big Stud)** and colleagues to try and produce a safer synthetic iboga derivative. 18-MC is born

Since 18-MC and Ibogaine are so closely related I‚Äôm going to pull from some more recent studies on both of them to give insight into the efficacy of these drugs on addiction.

[This study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2017.1320802) found that the clinical effects of ibogaine on opioid withdrawal symptoms appeared to be comparable to those of methadone. In this particular study, 50% of patients reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days, 1-month post-treatment, and 33% reported no use in the previous 30 days at the 3-month mark. These rates of reduction in use were greater than those who had been treated with buprenorphine. Drug use scores were improved relative to pre-treatments and were (moderately) sustained over 12-months.

In one of Glick‚Äôs [early studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) on 18-MC in rats, he and his colleagues found that it shared all the purported anti-addictive effects of Ibogaine. The advantage of 18-MC is that it is theorized to **not have the same hallucinogenic activity as Ibogaine** since it does not bind to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, it is **less toxic than Ibogaine both physiologically and neurologically**.

It is theorized that 18-MC will be able to assist in dealing with more than opioids, however. Alcohol, amphetamines, and cocaine have all been mentioned as possible substances of abuse that can be addressed.

One important thing to take out of all of this is that one of the studies found that abstinence from drug abuse lowered over time. This means that there is a potential for repeat treatments over time. Despite this, the frequency in which this would have to occur appears to be significantly less than current alternatives like methadone treatment.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Mind Medicine is developing drugs to treat all your mental health needs. They have the biggest and best pipeline out of any publicly traded psychedelic stock, they are the farthest along overall in terms of aggregate trial progress, and they have emerging compounds that are going to be put into trials starting soon. The CEO loves the idea of integrating tech into the space so theres more than just drugs to get excited about. Revenue is far out but money making opportunities are not."

2021-04-27 22:34:08,wallstreetbets,"If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice."

2021-04-28 01:10:43,wallstreetbets,Already buying more. Love this angle and untouched gem. Coming close to 500. Aiming for 1k within the next few weeks.

2021-04-28 03:32:17,wallstreetbets,"Speaking as a psychologist, this is truly a promising industry for a myriad of reasons:

- Cheaper, more sustainable alternatives to contemporary SSRIs and like medications.
- More easily observable effects from the drugs in question (psychedelics tend to not run nearly as many active and inactive ingredients, which can inflate studies into efficacy of medications).
- An appealing, refreshing proposal to burned out patients who are looking for an escape from the old way of doing thing.
- Invitation to numerous corporate, Collegiate, and journalistic studies and investigations, many of which will offer compensation for Mind Med's time and resources.
- Entirely new jobs in a variety of locations, further stimulating a growing industry.

I could keep going, but I will say this: I cannot say this will moon, but I believe in time this company can truly go places provided it has early support ane good leadership.  Both of which seem present, as of now.

Disclosure: in 427 shares @ $4.71 avg."
2021-04-28 03:56:32,wallstreetbets,Goddamnit!! I was going in small on a momentum play and you just had to pull out this DD. Guess I'm 5 year long now and adding more... there goes my play money.

2021-04-28 05:58:59,wallstreetbets,How long till options available on this beast
2021-04-28 06:21:42,wallstreetbets,Nice write up. What is their market cap as of yesterday's close?
2021-04-28 07:06:00,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt see anything about FDA approval in there yet. Definitely a long term play but I hate betting on the FDA to make a good decision regarding previously ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù substances.
2021-04-28 07:27:24,wallstreetbets,"As a recovered opiate addict / migraine sufferer and also someone with ADHD, I love mindmed. I sold my position yesterday due to the regret of holding through every other up listing I have been a part of but will be doubling down on the dip. 

I skimmed through your DD so I don‚Äôt know if you mentioned this, but due to drug laws in other countries, companies outside Canada and a few others can‚Äôt even study these compounds effectively. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there is no competition but limits competitors to countries where the benefits of said compounds can be studied freely. That is slowly changing but has given mindmed a sizable lead that will be difficult to catch up to. 

This is also in no way going to be cannabis 2.0, the recreational market is not a thing here, it is not an apt comparison, for what it‚Äôs worth. 

Other companies worth taking a look at (but are less positively positioned than mindmed, in my opinion) are NUMI and Compass Pathways. There is also a psychedelic ETF (PSYK) if you want to invest in the industry as a whole."
2021-04-28 07:54:19,wallstreetbets,"my god, this was posted 12 hours ago....I just finished reading it. But, I do appreciate the time the poster took to write it."
2021-04-28 08:12:27,wallstreetbets,buy anything under 10 and hold it for 3 years
2021-04-28 09:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Although purely anecdotal, one of my friends who was in the military had pretty bad ptsd that's plagued him for decades.  Nightmares, suicidal thoughts, flashbacks, the whole deal.  All these stopped a couple years ago when he started taking mushrooms every few months (like literally 2-3 times a year).  He no longer has nightmares, no longer has that ""thousand yard stare"", no more bouts of rage, etc, and is generally happier and more positive than I've ever seen him.

I'm invested in this space, albeit not in mnmd, but this is one of those things where I'd rather see the industry grow than just make a quick buck off it (although I'm still very bullish on the industry as a whole).  I think a rising tide will lift all ships here, and good competition is really good for companies longterm.  I'd be worried if only 1 company was showing promise."
2021-04-28 09:26:40,wallstreetbets,I like what this company does so I brought just now @4.32 a share but my gut instinct tells me this stock is going to keep drilling despite being a great potential product. This might be one of those situations where the gains are made a year from now if not more.
2021-04-28 09:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Great info, little long, must admit to skipping a few areas..."
2021-04-28 09:58:10,wallstreetbets,First time I've ever purchased stock. 10 shares for 4.20 a share.
2021-04-28 10:55:21,wallstreetbets,TL;DR Just bought 1000 shares
2021-04-28 11:10:37,wallstreetbets,Do you like the stock? what company do u work for?  I‚Äôd wait for the stock to lose like 75% of value before looking to buy and it might take 1-2 years before it starts to make any real gains.  This is not technical I‚Äôm just not going to be a bag holder for the first few years and neither should you.  Weed stocks looked great at first then came crashing down for years and are just starting to hold on to their new acquired gains.  Shorting is better for now don‚Äôt get caught in the hype

2021-04-27 23:26:12,wallstreetbets," Family practitioner here, I could not agree more than this guy, mental health has been gaining a lot of attention recently. I am a huge fan of alternative medicine / eastern medicine, including THC and CBD. I t recommend some of my patients, ""off the record"", who suffer from chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, depression and other mental health to try THC and CBD and have seen good responses. There isn't enough data on uses for LSD or MDMA but it would be interesting to see what micro-doses of these drugs may have on the body. What would be more significant is if these MNMD medications do not have all the nasty adverse side effects that anti-psychotics and mood stabilizer have. That would be a game changer. I have high hopes for this company and I really think in 5-7 years we may see some big moves from this company, which is why I started to invest for the long run."

2021-04-28 02:01:34,wallstreetbets,"The laws have passed here in Oregon but they are dragging balls on setting up the administration and allowing doctors and patients to prescribe. Or even how to. When marijuana became legal it was overnight they had a clinic and referral process with licensing and everything. Now, it's almost 4 months since the initiative became law and Still no way to access it. But as soon as that changes, mushroom stocks will go through the roof. Just like marijuana stocks."

I have believed in microdosing psychedelic drugs for a few years now, but I'm not so sure how a business could do long term. Also, I heard companies that act sort of like pharma companies can be the most volatile form of stocks out there. I'm more nervous with my .5% of my portfolio in this than I am with my 50% GME, 20% Tesla.  Hoping to learn from this rather than focus on making moneys."

2021-04-28 11:35:56,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is that MindMed IS still developing (testing) 18-MC. It's in Phase 2a of clinical trials, and MindMed is aiming for Phase 3 trials sometime in 2023. 

If Phase 3 trials bode well, it's the last stage of clinical trials required by the FDA before they will even look at a novel drug. 

If the Phase 3 trial results are still positive and statistically significant, MindMed then submits a request package to the FDA in order to get 18-MC approved as a ""safe"" new medication that's ready to be released to the pharmaceutical market (the general population by way of a doctor's prescription)."

MindMed definitely has potential, and not just because of Mr. Frigging O'Leary! Although he's a big management benefit, it's the novel approach to ALLEVIATING various psychiatric issues rather than trying to CURE or MASK them completely.üëåüëç

I honestly think MindMed is going places, is still worth the stock investment, and current share owners should hang onto what they have. I believe that within the next 6-12 months, their stock value is going to increase significantly - it may double by December! ü§ûüòä"

2021-04-27 20:08:03,wallstreetbets,I think what he means is that psychedelics *should* be mostly medicinal but because of regulation and misinformation/lack of understanding in the past they are treated as a recreational drug.

2021-04-27 20:43:58,wallstreetbets,And what if big pharma jumps in?
2021-04-27 22:18:29,wallstreetbets,"Some places are starting to push to legalize recreational shrooms.  By the time the FDA gets around to review they could be legal and easily acquired.  You can even grow them at home. 

I want no part in a clinic business that has no exclusivity on the drug being administered. 

It‚Äôs the synthetic compounds that are most interesting but those are going to be the hardest to get through the FDA in my opinion."

-inflation is going up, BUT WAIT, it's well within expectations. If it goes above it's fake and/or temporary, and will return to below 2% shortly afterward.

-the labor market is our major concern (lol), but far from what we'd like to see. We'll continue monitoring the situation.

By the age of 5, I had been to every continent on the planet, barring Antarctica. For my 12th birthday, my parents got me diving lessons, and by the time I was 13, I could scuba dive to a depth of 40 meters, as well as go cave diving.  
  
I got a pilot‚Äôs license by the age of 17, and I learned to sail just before my 18th birthday. Instead of going to university, I decided to travel around South America, exploring its rich jungles and beautiful landscapes.  
  
During my trip, I met my now wife who was also an explorer. For our honeymoon, we sailed around the Caribbean and we discovered 3 new islands which we named after the cats that I had growing up.  
  
Over the course of my life, I have come across great treasures and wondrous experiences. But in all my life, and in all my travels, I‚Äôm afraid I have never come across a single person who thought MNMD was a good investment"

2021-04-27 22:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Ok so, here are my reasons why $JD is extremely undervalued. I have a pretty heavy position in this company right now and I would love to argue if anyone has a bear thesis.

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks.
2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.
3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.
4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.
5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.
6. Cathie Wood has been adding to her JD position for the last week. She is pretty heavy in this company. She carries it in multiple of her ETFs with a significant holding.
7. Reversal already started. Big hedgefunds are already buying into China tech. Don't believe me? Check on [https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php](https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php). Search ticker JD or BABA
8. There's been alot of anti-china sentiment in the US lately due to covid, and this could potentially be another reason why China tech hasn't been performing lately. This is just a guess though, but earnings will change that

Day 3 - lost sense of taste 

by day 15 - I was 99% better (never got sense of smell back to normal like 5 months later) with never visiting a doctor besides to get tested and test positive so i could be excused from work for two weeks....and a follow up with doctor to ensure i could go back to work safely after 21 days"

2021-04-27 23:51:23,wallstreetbets,Might be because every dollar they make is priced in for the next 30 years TSLA going nowhere

2021-04-27 21:58:25,wallstreetbets,it's easy to go from 10k to 100k especially when you're riding on profits. You take big risks because if you lose you can make it back through working or whatever and usually it pays off. When your port gets large you become a pu$$y
2021-04-28 00:17:23,wallstreetbets,Do you care about me

2021-04-28 01:22:43,wallstreetbets,"College isn‚Äôt useless but it‚Äôs use has diminished decidedly and it‚Äôs cost has risen drastically. I agree that some people did not make prudent decisions, but I would counter that with the point that many of them were pressured to go to college at 18 before they had any experience in a work environment or really any understanding of who they were. College is helpful for advancing you when you‚Äôre ready, it‚Äôs not great for getting a leg up from the beginning, but that‚Äôs what it was sold to people as."

I think they are good from a technical perspective. But they are way to small (about 7k cars per months irc) to judge if they will succeed in the future. Tesla makes about 750k cars this year and still doesn't make a profit with selling cars. It is a very hard industry and a lot of the newcomers (Lucid, Nio, Tesla, Xpeng, Farasis, Sion, Huawei, Xiaomi,...) will fail. But it is hard to predict which will succed and which will fail."
2021-04-28 04:41:25,wallstreetbets,NIO is one of the biggest EV manufacturers in China. China is the biggest EV market in the world. As long as NIO does everything the CCP asks them to do it‚Äôll fly
2021-04-28 04:43:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm invested, because it is the most promising NEV company from China. They were the first who build a ""no charge process"". If your battery is empty you just drive to a Nio-station and they automatically change the battery.   
From the growth factor they are very similar to Tesla and in the long way they have a huge potential to become the Chinese Tesla. They are the company with the best monetary foundation. Big companies invested in Nio during Covid-19, not in BYD or others."

After that you are either diving hard into depression or doing a few more lines and breaking into ‚Äúholy shit I think I hear the SWAT team outside my door‚Äù paranoia territory. I have tried to extend the coke Ballmer peak time thru extensive research but have so far been unsuccessful and ended up in rehab twice.

Hope you prove us wrong and pull something crazy out though, good luck."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve analyzed the growth of the followers for all US public companies in Twitter, FB, Instagram. Check out the top 3 ones with the fastest growth of followers over the past month. I‚Äôve been collecting data on the number of followers on corporate pages of the companies in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram over the past 3 months. In addition, I also analyzed the website‚Äôs traffic and the popularity of the company's website search request in Google to see if followers on social networks are converting into leads and to take a more comprehensive look at this situation.

I don‚Äôt have statistical confirmation of the connection between the number of followers of the brand in social networks and a positive effect on the stock price, but according to the simple logic - this definitely can affect it. If people are interested in a product and what the company does, they will follow it in the media and become its customers. Sooner or later, this will be reflected in the company's profits and quarterly reports, so do not underrate this data.

You can find the resulting list below, hope you‚Äôll find this information useful:  


**1. XPENG INC. ($XPEV)** \- Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. The most dynamic growth of followers in Twitter and Facebook. 

[$XPEV](https://preview.redd.it/axabltzxorv61.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=f37b2478f0668aeef974af352c49d70ec88423e0)

**2. WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION ($WDC)** \- computer hard disk drive manufacturer and data storage company

By the way, they are quite active in hiring new people - 700 open job positions with 24K employees - an indicator of the company's healthy growth.

**3. SUNRUN INC. ($RUN)** \- solar panels and home batteries manufacturer. Here you can see the sharp increase in the number of Facebook followers.

Furthermore, the guys are actively expanding their staff, and their traffic has been steadily growing for the last 4 months. Of course, all this in the complex was reflected on their revenue - take a look at the last graph.

2021-04-28 00:59:14,wallstreetbets,"That's an actual and intentional fucking lie, you scumbag. Property, plant, and equipment of the company is worth 715m, as of the company's latest report, and the company trades at 2.15b currently.

Its net assets alone are valued at 888m total, so the only way you could reach that conclusion is if you were intentionally trying to mislead people, cunt."

2021-04-28 07:14:10,wallstreetbets,"If it were worth 9b, they would've valued it at 9b in their own earnings report. Why would a company intentionally *lower* the valuation of their equipment? It's misleading enough to constitute fraud, and it makes the stock less attractive to investors (fraud notwithstanding, even).

Source your claim and I'll back off."

2021-04-27 23:58:03,wallstreetbets,Seriously. RSI indcates oversold and it bounced off support like 10 times today. Feel like OP picked a random number nearby even though TA doesn't agree with that number.
2021-04-27 22:19:25,wallstreetbets,"I could of, but I didn't have 700 of them then. Cause I bought the dip. But realizing that I could go lower I sold itm cover call to cover my ass.  So now, I will be ""okay"" no matter what. Instead of fucked or on the moon."

2021-04-27 23:51:34,wallstreetbets,But you lose your collateral aka 700 shares of MVIS. That‚Äôs okay with you? Stocks going to 60+ for buyout. So you gave up 42k for a 4k immediate profit. Crazy strat IMO.
2021-04-28 00:24:32,wallstreetbets,"Check the short interest. Obviously a lot of profit taking occurred, but MMs did their best to supress the price. RSI now indicating oversold and bounced off resistance multiple times. Baby mavis is a slingshot ready to explode. How long it takes to unfold is the question."
2021-04-27 21:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Hmm true, however if they announce a sale of the company for a few billions then that's gonna do the magic? No?"
2021-04-27 23:54:32,wallstreetbets,"I can always buy back in if that's the case but the game plan is to close the position when it's drained of intrinsic value. Like I have said in other threads.

2021-04-28 01:44:29,wallstreetbets,I hate news. I hate that they say microdosing lsd and mdma when it‚Äôs mushrooms that are the real life savors and medicine. Lsd has no place in medicine in my opinion. Mdma maybe. Way Better than lsd and actually can help in ptsd patients but lsd? Give me a break it gets me so upset as someone who pushes for mushrooms as medicine for the new world but you hear about microdosing lsd? Bruh. Mushrooms are the future and will save people and has real medicinal potential but lsd will cause more harm than good period.

I agree that there is a lot of potential here to treat this patient population as well as others.  However, my concern is that psychedelics may reach legal status soon just as alcohol has and cannabis will soon.

If psychedelics become legal and can be purchased over the counter I don't see how a pharmaceutical will be able to compete with this.  It seems like there would be too much competition from natural and generic formulations."

2021-04-27 23:23:47,wallstreetbets,"Chronic cluster headache issues. Been to many neuros and always given pills, shots, etc. Always as an abortive, never as a preventative. Cluster headache is the worst pain I've ever felt. I was in a non stop cycle for around five years. Couldn't eat, sleep, or function at all. Was talking to a friend and he mentioned some documentary he saw about the mushrooms for all kinds of ailments and the headaches were one of them. I brushed it off for about a year and couldn't take the cycle anymore. Finally took .4g. It did nothing. The next week I took .5g. I laughed my ass off for 45 min and fell asleep. I had one headache the next day and haven't had one since. It's been a year now. I've had to take no pills, no shots, and no other procedures. I wish I had known about this year's ago. Needless to say, I got in on MNMD under the old ticker on otc as soon as I went a week with no pain. At least for me, this is life changing. This is the ONLY stock I have a real belief in. If any of you have cluster headaches and are stuck in cycle, there is hope."
2021-04-27 23:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Family practitioner here, I could not agree more than this guy, mental health has been gaining a lot of attention recently.  I am a huge fan of alternative medicine / eastern medicine,  including THC and CBD. I t recommend some of my patients, ""off the record"", who suffer from chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, depression and other mental health to try THC and CBD and have seen good responses. There isn't enough data on uses for LSD or MDMA but it would be interesting to see what micro-doses of these drugs may have on the body. What would be more significant is if these MNMD medications do not have all the nasty adverse side effects that anti-psychotics and mood stabilizer have. That would be a game changer. I have high hopes for this company and I really think in 5-7 years we may see some big moves from this company, which is why I started to invest for the long run."

2021-04-27 23:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Check up on manna in the Bible. It grew outside of the homes of believers and from wikipedia:

In the description in the [Book of Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus), manna is described as being ""a fine, flake-like thing"" like the frost on the ground.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-e1614-3) It is described in the [Book of Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers) as arriving with the [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew) during the night.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-4) Exodus adds that manna was comparable to [hoarfrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarfrost) in color,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-e1614-3) and similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-5) and was like a [coriander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander) seed in size but white in color.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-autogenerated10-6) Numbers describes it as having the appearance of [bdellium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdellium),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-autogenerated4-7)  adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which  were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked  with oil.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-8) Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-autogenerated10-6) The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna ""bred worms and stank"":[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna#cite_note-autogenerated1-9) the exception being that stored the day before the [Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath) (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight. Exodus 16:23‚Äì24 states:

If any of you are familiar with picking wild psilocybin mushrooms this will seem very similar to you.

Though Jesus said in John chapter 6 "" [**49**](http://biblehub.com/john/6-49.htm)Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. [**50**](http://biblehub.com/john/6-50.htm)This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. [**51**](http://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm)I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.‚Äù

The flesh, or Christs body is later referred to in the Bible as the church. This is often attributed to the churches most of us are familiar with, which they can also be, but the body of Christ is more blatantly the believers in God. Which   1 **John 4:8**  tells us - He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

For those dealing with anxiety remember  ‚ÄúFor God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of **power and of love** and of a sound mind‚Äù (2 Timothy 1:7).

## [Philippians 4:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:6-7&version=NKJV)

6¬†Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;  7¬†and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  


That Philippians verse means so much to me because I overthink things constantly and wind myself into rabbit holes every day. A part of my mind use to think if I didn't know the entire bible I'm going to constantly be going to suffer the same thing every day. I use to think this until I found that Philippians verse. Be thankful for what we have, make some petitions and requests and the peace of God which surpasses ALL understanding will guard our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Surpasses ALL understand, that's what really did it for me, and every time I make a prayer like this I know all the extra is out of my realm of understanding and the things I was thankful for reminds me of where I was trying to go before I got derailed."

""I tried to tell all y'all, but nobody listened"" (or however that fucking fever dream of a music video/meme song said, lol.) Them and other companies like CMPS, RVVTF, FTRPF, VEGGF And others in this new ""field/industry"" that will, 100%, blow up bigger than when cannabis did EVER did...  like he said, in about Three to Five years, b/c that's around the estimated time when ""COMP360' \[by CMPS\] will get FDA approval... And it is going to get the approval, no doubt in my mind. We are literally in the beginning a new psychedelic revolution...

2021-04-27 20:51:45,wallstreetbets,You're lucky dude. DMT definitely did not wipe away my anxiety or depression like that lol
2021-04-27 20:55:54,wallstreetbets,This is the #1 reason I tell people I like to do mushrooms.  It's a massive emotional release for me and it really does reset your perspective.  I can't weigh in on dmt but I imagine it's more a more profound and deeper resonating experience.
2021-04-27 20:56:02,wallstreetbets,Have experimented with psychedelics and can confirm. The way OP of the post has explained it is perfect. It‚Äôs a reset and you get to perceive the world once again as a youth.
2021-04-27 20:57:47,wallstreetbets,You feel like EVERYTHING is possible.
2021-04-27 21:01:27,wallstreetbets,Love your Username

2021-04-27 21:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I've only done DMT once, it was a pretty nice experience. But I was a little disappointed that I didn't see what my friends saw. They all had very similar trips that was more about life, whereas mine was more patterns and geometrical shapes.

What was your experience like?"
2021-04-27 22:08:39,wallstreetbets,"I think I seriously need to try this.  Where/how do I safely start?  I've had 37 years of a shit childhood with high expectations and hard work to be successful that's accompanied by an overbearing amount of anxiety, stress, depression, and chronic physical pain.  This sounds like what I need."
2021-04-27 22:47:51,wallstreetbets,Wait your supposed to feel alive and not anxious as a teen?
2021-04-27 22:57:35,wallstreetbets,That's called old age lol. Our body gets tired easier as does the mind and spirit.
2021-04-27 23:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Agreed 100%. I think that‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs wrong & missing in today‚Äôs society. I believe people need to reconnect with themselves, with what‚Äôs around them, to truly connect with the world & others. Advancements in technology have created this hugely detached void"
2021-04-27 23:55:49,wallstreetbets,how does the experience differ from those of drug addict? Were there no addiction? Few dose was enough to change negativity for a long term?
2021-04-28 00:09:59,wallstreetbets,I had similar results as you with dmt.  It saved my life. It teaches you to be present .  I now meditate daily and only use dmt when I need another reset
2021-04-28 00:21:31,wallstreetbets,Well. I‚Äôm sold
2021-04-28 00:38:34,wallstreetbets,Did you take ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù levels of DMT?

2021-04-28 01:18:30,wallstreetbets,"I had a similar issue with anxiety and clinical depression. The first time I too LSD I noticed that I felt so happy, unburdened, driven, and hopeful the next day. It kept with me for about two weeks, but I‚Äôve never forgotten that feeling."
2021-04-28 01:53:54,wallstreetbets,"Yay. This makes me absolutely happy to hear. I‚Äôm an advocate for making our world a better place. There‚Äôs so much shit out there that sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to change your perspective on things. If microdosing allows that change, why not?  Good for you!"
2021-04-28 03:33:32,wallstreetbets,"I think that it needs to be said that there is no negative side effects to psychedelics. I can not speak for DMT, but I can for LSD. A bad LSD trip gave me anxiety, and has triggered panic attacks years later. Maybe it is PTSD from the trip itself, or maybe a chemical in my brain was altered. Regardless, I had little to no anxiety before the trip, and after I dealt with severe anxiety. It has definitely subdued over the years, but alas was triggered by LSD."

Intent people. Intent."
2021-04-28 07:56:24,wallstreetbets,"It breaks down all the views you built up over the years and you see everything fresh. Like a child. I don't know tho, dmt was really intense. I rather do schrooms or my favorite, lsd, liquid only lol."
2021-04-28 08:23:28,wallstreetbets,Same. Psychs in general are gonna be big. For the human race and for tendies.
2021-04-28 08:35:14,wallstreetbets,I had a mushroom trip really change a lot of things in my life for a few years. Eventually I fell back into some of the bad habits after a couple harsh breakups. But now I‚Äôm 27 and not sure I want to face those demons alone ya know? I understand that if I tripped in the right mind frame it could help confront a lot of things. But boy do I have some major shit to confront and not sure I‚Äôm ready to handle that
2021-04-28 09:12:49,wallstreetbets,"I fully support micros. Made my own with a blend of turkey tail, lion's mane, and B+.  Took them for about a year. Best year of my life. I had just quit drinking and it helped me relearn how to live without cigarettes and alcohol.

2021-04-28 09:24:55,wallstreetbets,"The field that will blow this hole thing open is the study of neuro-genesis. This is something I only know a little of but am really excited for the future of mental health treatment. Psychedelics and other compounds in mushrooms like lions mane are showing to stimulate high fire rates in the brain and seem to show an ability to create new neuron pathways. This can be good or bad depending on your state of mind and focus.  If you are going in to this experience with, let‚Äôs say a mental health professional or ‚Äúshaman‚Äù or whatever, they can guide you to breakthrough or around old pathways of addiction, PTSD, spirituality... etc. etc. The science behind this could change our understanding and treatment of mental health. In other words.. I like the stonk"
2021-04-28 10:22:49,wallstreetbets,This is amazing. Is there a legal way to take DMT in the US?
2021-04-28 10:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Can you give your weight, dosage in g or mg, and drug name?"
2021-04-28 10:39:51,wallstreetbets,100% agree. A psychedelic reset from time to time has always been good for me. Gets you out of a depressing rut if you're able to calmly navigate the trip.

2021-04-27 20:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there's good studies on how psychedelics can really *solve* a lot of mental issues that modern medicine (big \*\*\*\*ing pharma) currently only *resolves*.  So there's a good chance big pharma will still try shitting all over these companies to prevent them from killing their golden egg.

If you could convince your customers that they need Adderall daily just to function (running $XX a day) and someone comes along and says ""Yo we go something that may be a pretty reasonable solution, come try it out"", then that would ruin your cash cow.

I rly thought it would go up 5% and I would get out for a quick trade but noooo that shit just nose dived


Fucking hippies taking profits"
2021-04-28 06:14:51,wallstreetbets,"oh, that me"
2021-04-28 06:28:08,wallstreetbets,should I buy at 4? 200k shares?
2021-04-28 01:52:40,wallstreetbets,Not even close to the top friend. Easily a 10 billion market cap. üöÄ
2021-04-27 20:04:02,wallstreetbets,I had a similar experience with shrooms and exercise. The experience wasn‚Äôt my first or most ‚Äòrevealing.‚Äô I got the urge to run amd haven‚Äôt lost it since.
2021-04-28 08:25:28,wallstreetbets,I would say it closer to a religious experience than any religion could ever come close to.
2021-04-28 15:07:40,wallstreetbets,I've had some good acid saved for a while. I just wasn't in the right headspace or happy with where I was in life but I find myself wanting to give it a try for exactly this reason. Life just seems easier or makes more sense after a good trip. I just wish it was easier to find. Seems like everyone either sells just weed or just the crazy hard stuff. DMT is by far my favorite drug but I've only been able to get ahold of it a handful of times.
2021-04-27 21:04:49,wallstreetbets,"Same position, but unlike you, I feel more skeptical about the effects and am wary of any one size fits all solution to such a complex and devastating debility. It feels like one big hype train with studies on the effects of these types of drugs in treating depression only recently being done, like within the last year or so. Plus anything relating to drugs coupled with youth on the megaphone of social media tend to ratchet up these kinds of issues up to level 11. Until rigorous studies can dissect the pros and cons of psychedelic treatments for depression and is accepted by a wide pool of doctors and scientists then I think we should contain our excitement until concrete results come forward. Also, the causes for depression and anxiety can‚Äôt always be solved by taking a pill, many times it‚Äôs fundamental flaws in our society and the way that we live our lives. More often than not it‚Äôs those things that need to change, but making those kinds of changes usually is much more problematic (read unprofitable to the parties concerned) so the culture of diagnosing an illness with a prescription becomes the default.

Edit: phrasing"
2021-04-27 22:38:25,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not permanent, eventually you will be brought back down. But it‚Äôs the positivity that you remembered from the experience that will keep you striving, and there‚Äôs always round two if you need to remember again. Just be mindful."
2021-04-27 21:29:04,wallstreetbets,It doesn't work for everyone
2021-04-27 22:32:44,wallstreetbets,"This is the real deal! I‚Äôm a doctor and many of my friends are psychiatrists, we‚Äôve been lucky enough to take part in a few psychedelic retreats and they work! They not only help heal people with psychiatric illness, they help everyone live a more meaningful and abundant life."
2021-04-27 22:35:53,wallstreetbets,"It's so mainstream it has 100s of studies proving the effectiveness of mushrooms and other psychedelic drugs against anxiety, PTSD, and some other things.

You should try it safely after researching instead of being fearful, if the 100s of current studies don't prove the effectiveness then you are not skeptical but afraid."
2021-04-27 23:21:03,wallstreetbets,It is most effective with a guided professional. Your brain creates pathways that become more malleable while using psychedelics. A professional can help guide your thoughts to positivity so that better pathways develop. This can also be done with people that dedicate a great deal of time to meditation. Deep meditation has a similar effect on the brains malleability.
2021-04-27 20:12:59,wallstreetbets,Very well said and I had a very similar experience and am in total agreement
2021-04-27 21:07:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm stealing this.  This is mine now. 

But fr, what a fucking genius analogy."
2021-04-27 21:16:05,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs so good to hear about your friend. We‚Äôre def in a place where modern pharma isn‚Äôt what it used to be and people are begging for alternatives.  That puts mind med and others in a great place for growth.
2021-04-27 21:14:49,wallstreetbets,"I was alone, but if you‚Äôre set on having a doctor I‚Äôm sure you could find someone somewhere that wouldn‚Äôt mind sitting by.  Even an emt would be good to have near. You kind of just black out though. It lasts 5-10 min but feels like an eternity.  I was scared about not being in control but it was that lack of me that allowed me to progress."
2021-04-27 21:13:00,wallstreetbets,"I used a crack pipe lol.  I bought an e nail, and special tool, etc but it kept burning too much.  The crack pipe worked perfectly.  I believe they have pens now that work really well for a good hit. 60-70mg is the blast off starting point for most."
2021-04-27 21:11:40,wallstreetbets,"Did you blast off?  I did around 70mg each time and watched myself die.  It was incredible.  The first trip showed me my anger, my neglect for others, etc.  some could say it was a bad trip but it was amazing to see myself how others see me.  my second one was all about the future. My ability to connect with others, empathy, etc.  that‚Äôs where the real change took place."
2021-04-28 03:20:26,wallstreetbets,Hahah they better fucking not!
2021-04-28 02:41:39,wallstreetbets,"No, In Sweden. See my last AMA post."

2021-04-27 21:16:53,wallstreetbets,"I suppose it will depend on the strength and price of their product. It will have to outcompete their dealers price and strength. These kinda drugs tend not to be the   stuff druggies choose to pop like candy,they can, but good luck to them, a mama matrix spanking is not a good time haha. The rave or spiritual scene may dig em. I'm rooting for them and bought in:)"
2021-04-28 02:21:48,wallstreetbets,That sounds quite awful. Thank you for the info. I'll sell off what I bought once I break even.
2021-04-28 12:47:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I'll hold and look for an opportunity to add shares!
2021-04-27 21:39:17,wallstreetbets,Nope. Just checked. Nope.
2021-04-28 13:28:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah I honestly wanted to know but I guess for some reason this is a problem.

2021-04-27 20:24:16,wallstreetbets,Most people I know say psychedelic hits the reset button on anxiety and depression. It can come back but might be about something else.
2021-04-28 04:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) helped me deal with my problems a lot better. Anxiety, depression, and anger issues. I still have bouts of anxiety and depression, however, I haven‚Äôt had a single anger breakout since. It‚Äôs been two years."
2021-04-28 04:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Also understand that certain psychs aren't for everyone. LSD makes me more depressed, but psilocybin makes me feel good long after the trip for example. Have 10 MNMD @ $4.37"
2021-04-28 12:00:17,wallstreetbets,They've been studying this for a few years and it's totally legit. So much so they are doing studies with Alzheimer's and dimentia patients.

2021-04-27 20:41:53,wallstreetbets,Be advised. Hallucinogens may cause schizophrenia in people who were already predisposed to it. Such as having a relative whos schizo
2021-04-27 20:39:25,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so yes, but also a particular focus of ""I want to be my best self"" with a trained trip-sitter would be the difference between getting a gym membership augmented by YouTube and getting a gym membership while hiring a professional trainer."

2021-04-27 22:05:33,wallstreetbets,"It seems incredible but they are very powerful drugs. There were studies in the 60s where alcoholics were going sober something like 40% of the time after their first guided LSD session, for example."

2021-04-28 08:30:54,wallstreetbets,I just checked their website... the farthest along studies are in phase 2. Most of the titles look vaguely similar to studies done in the 50's and 60's.
2021-04-27 21:25:12,wallstreetbets,The company has 28 million in assets and 26 million of that is cash they are using to conduct studies. This company has absolutely nothing of value yet. They have hopes and dreams that their research will lead to something valuable and that something valuable only has value if it can be legalized. Investing in it is just hoping that this company can find something before they lose all of their investors' money.
2021-04-27 22:14:01,wallstreetbets,Right on!
2021-04-28 10:45:40,wallstreetbets,Same! Bought in at $4.17

2021-04-28 14:48:19,wallstreetbets,Just do a lot of research if you decide to do the DIY route. There's still some downsides. You could get to dosage wrong throwing a wrench in your plan. Apparently some people experience slight negative emotional changes. But that's why we're all waiting for this to get into the hands of licensed doctors.

2021-04-27 22:34:18,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a doctor and SSRIs block the beneficial effects of psychedelics. You need to slowly wean off of the SSRI with your doctors help and then micro dose.
2021-04-27 23:23:30,wallstreetbets,Deep meditation can have similar effects on the brain as psychedelics. Of course meditation requires a much greater commitment. Both are most effective when used with a professional that can guide your thoughts.
2021-04-27 20:55:19,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I feel like LSD is the one that makes you more introspective and helps you get over mental problems, more than shrooms can. Shrooms are more fun. *(just personal experience, not a doctor, take my advice with heaps of salt. practice safe use of drugs)*"
2021-04-28 01:03:42,wallstreetbets,get off the pills! thats my best advice !
2021-04-27 23:30:08,wallstreetbets,"Cause is the wrong word in this case I think. The cause is the genetic predisposition, psychedelics seem to trigger the disease to start sooner than it otherwise would've."

It‚Äôs misinformed people like you who spread needless fear mongering ideas that the psychedelic medicinal community is up against.

Alcohol can induce psychosis as well.

Have you ever taken any psychedelics?"
2021-04-27 22:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Man different varieties, but most of the time anxiety is generalized as it comes from the same place in the mind. Just like how PTSD can be caused by any kind of event but it's treated by the same things.

That said, I would avoid anything psychoactive, marijuana included, if you have schizophrenia in your family. Other than that, be responsible and start small. It's much better to not trip hard enough than to trip too much. Source: have taken ludicrous doses of psychedelics."

If I had to describe LSD, it makes you think out of the box and think objectively. I saw myself and many others just completely put aside any biases they have and look at the world and others objectively. What are our weaknesses and stenghts, what do we value the most in our lives and what should and can we change to be better people. Things like that. So many of the prejudices I never even knew I had just disappeared.

After my last acid trip, I just completely lost my appetite to smoke cigarettes. Just put my usual morning cigarette back into the pack and stopped cold turkey and I felt great."

I did do some ecstacy going up and that deffinately made me think in a more accepting and accelerated way. I'm glad it help you/ your friends put aside silly differences with others. Having gone through life a mixed dude with a very white name I've always thought very openly and have been very accepting by nature. But the older I get the more I realize others aren't always inclined to think like this as people are more so taught what to think and drugs can actually help open their minds to bigger meanings and that IS groovy!

2021-04-27 22:06:20,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre exactly right. 
An example of what I mean, I bought way OTM options on TSLA for literally like .10 a piece for a $1000 strike price. TSLA went to like $800 and that initial .10 an option I spent I ending up selling for like 25x what I risked. That‚Äôs what I mean by more shares for your money. 
If TSLA goes up $5, you‚Äôre not gonna make any money if you have shares of TSLA . Unless you have the money to buy that many shares which most people don‚Äôt. Whereas if you own an option on TSLA and it goes up $5 depending on where your strike price is that‚Äôs a decent amount of percentage you‚Äôll make off of it. 

Most stock shares aren‚Äôt gonna give you 10x your money. If you‚Äôre good at picking penny stocks then maybe. But I‚Äôve never been good at it and it‚Äôs not consistent for me. However, with options, I‚Äôve made 10x on my money a bunch of times over the past year. The percentage of gain is much higher with options rather than just shares. Because again, 1 option = 100 shares
If a stock goes up $1 and you own stock you‚Äôre only making one dollar. But if you have 500 shares worth of options that‚Äôs a $500 gain. 

Hopefully this is making sense. I‚Äôm telling you I literally don‚Äôt even look at shares anymore. It‚Äôs such a drastic difference in profit margin from shares to options. So much so that I literally won‚Äôt buy anything other than options.

EDIT: someone explain to me why I‚Äôm getting downvoted. Genuinely, if you downvoted I would love to hear why. I‚Äôm explaining how I‚Äôve made better profit percentages for less risk, more reward, and I‚Äôm getting downvoted? For sure would like to understand why. 

PS: How do you think DFV made so much money on GME? It wasn‚Äôt because he bought and held shares, it‚Äôs because he bought options and he was right."

2021-04-27 20:18:44,wallstreetbets,Not exactly the recipe for profitability though. That's why it will probably never be main stream. Less effective+not lasting=$$$$ in big pharma logic
2021-04-27 21:12:05,wallstreetbets,"Esketamine is, plain old ketamine is not. And neither of them are  by any means ""main stream"" yet- I had to go through hell, and also go around my insurance, to be able to get ketamine prescribed. After over 2 decades of severe persistent med resistant depression, hospitalizations, true compliance on everything from abilify to Zyprexa, and *still* couldn't get a doctor to prescribe to me, for months. The doc I use is a researcher, private office, and one of the very few in my area. And I live in a very liberal place. 

Trying to get treatment with esketamine proved pointless- hard to find docs, my insurance won't cover it, out of pocket it's thousands more than plain ol ketamine, crazy restrictions on how it's used. 

The two aren't comparable."
2021-04-28 09:28:29,wallstreetbets,"Mainstream treatment for depression is Zoloft and shit. Ketamine is becoming more commonly used, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it mainstream. It makes up a very small percentage of treatment plans compared to SSRI‚Äôs, etc. Psilocybin is in the process of approval, but that‚Äôs also a far, far cry from being mainstream treatment. 

I do believe that they will be mainstream in the next couple decades, or at least I really hope they will. As someone who has been prescribed medications like xanax and Zoloft, I‚Äôd love to see better options available.

I started using mushrooms a couple years ago and they have improved my quality of life. They helped strip a lot of baggage I was holding onto and they made my counseling sessions a lot more productive. Mushrooms won‚Äôt solve your problems, but they sure do help with facing your issues and figuring out much more healthy ways of dealing with them. In my experience, anyway."

And time isn't on your side, which is the most important factor in investing.  


There's a reason people say time in the market beats out timing the market.  Some people get very lucky but many more people straight up lose all their money making risky option plays.  People say only invest with money you can afford to lose, but that applies even more to any money you put into options.

Microsoft leads in augmented reality hardware with its holo-lens and could use Lidar sensors to further improve its environment mapping. Just in February '21 Microsoft released its industrial edition model of the lens so it's still in active development. These guys currently use camera sensors for the HoloLens based on the Kinect, but as they want to lead in industrial augmented reality applications, there are still advantages to lidar systems that they do not use. As an example, the current 3D-object resolution is not high enough to detect my Micro-penis (coincidence?), therefore it is missing out on potential applications in the pornographic industry. Imagine buying an ogre of a hooker that actually looks like Shrek thanks to holo-lens. $MVIS can make this happen. There were rumors of acquisition back in September that Microsoft denied, however they were lying because Bill Gates planted microchips in their vaccines probably.

2021-04-28 08:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. About 8 or 9 months ago my coworker was new to investigating and was deep in the OTC penny stock game like many new investors are. Talked my ear off about this for months. Bought in around .40 cents or something retarded. Most people are seeing this as peak information parity and are exiting and selling. This up-listing, in my opinion, is just going to create expectations that weren‚Äôt there 6 months ago and will likely disappoint lots of people. 
With that being said, they truly are a solid business. Bright future, solid high profile investors, good financials and so on...HOWEVER....this isn‚Äôt a tech stock and I think a lot of people are expecting 5-10 dollar swings month over month... and it‚Äôs just not that kind of play."

2021-04-28 15:08:16,wallstreetbets,You're welcome.  I really enjoy listening to her explain her reasoning behind her stock picks.  I wish you all the best!
2021-04-27 22:45:02,wallstreetbets,"The 500$ is because he has 5 850c contracts. So if he had just 1, it‚Äôd be 100$. 10 would be 1,000 etc. 

Options like being in 100s. The reason why 1$ increase is worth 100$ per contract is because when you are ITM (which means you crossed the strike price) in this case 850, you can essentially calculate profit as if you personally owned 100 shares of that stock bought at that strike price of 850. 

So for example, if I buy 100 TSLA shares for 850$ and TSLA goes up to 851, gaining 1$, because I have 100 shares, that‚Äôs really 100$ profit for me. 

The delta is what tells you how much profit you‚Äôll make. So if you have .5 delta, you‚Äôll gain 50$ per 1 dollar increase on the stock. If you have 1 delta (the highest possible) you gain 100$ per 1 dollar movement. (Although it‚Äôs easy to just assume 1 delta when doing calculation because IV and such will usually padd that extra 1-delta difference."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIAC 360k LEAPs YOLO to retirement. üöÄüöÄüöÄ Been watching VIAC since the drop a couple months ago. Now that the closed hedge funds have liquidated 98% of their positions on this stock, it can resume climbing. 

P/E ratio is 11. S&P average P/E ratio is 28. It's 140% undervalued here. 

Paramont+ is not being considered in current analyst's evaluation. Even if paramount+ becomes 20% the size of Netflix or 30% the size of Disney+, that's an extra 100% market cap alone.

VIAC raised funds when the stock was $85. Institutions won't sell their shares under $85.

Current IV is super low, a 100% jump in price on VIAC is equal to 800% gain in options for LEAPS!! Don't have to worry about theta burn.

Earnings releases next week and includes the new Paramont+ subscriber numbers. If they beat expectations (which is currently 11 million, even though 9.5 million came from CBS All Access) this stock will fly.

I bought 360k in $50 calls expiring 1/2022. Should be worth $2M - 2.5M by expiration and I'll retire with lazy index funds

Finally, whang is nuts. His buying inflated viacom and I don't think it can recover that price quickly. You've got more time which is good, but also were moving out of pandemic so people may be less interested in TV and more interested in getting outside.

Netflix has already seen lower than expected subscriptions. That will likely be the same for the whole industry.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I Followed The Smart Money with Jon and Pete Najarian...so you didn't have to. Here is what I learned: I'm a fairly experienced trader..but I felt like I was missing something.  I knew there had to be a secret to making the highest returns but I couldn't figure out what that secret was.

One day I was watching CNBC and heard this ad, ""The secret to making the highest returns is knowing which stocks are about to make the biggest moves...""

Right then I knew I had to pick up my landline phone and called in to FOMO order the book and companion DVD. I mean how could I pass it up...the book was free  I just had to pay the low price of $9.99 for shipping and handling.

Here is what happened next:

1. I went to my local Radio Shack to pick up the newest DVD player. I ended up getting a Sony.
2. I listed my Magnavox VHS player on eBay
3. I checked my mail daily, and finally when the items arrived I ripped them open, devoured the book and watched the DVD

# What did I learn? And how can you score major profits just like the Najarian bros?

&#x200B;

1. at 12:30 PM EST, login to your favorite brokerage app and buy thousands of options on literally any stock you want
2. At 12:50 PM EST, go on CNBC and mention during your segment of ""Unusual Options Activity"" the EXACT SAME options you just bought.
3. At 12:51 PM EST, sell those calls that you bought 31 minutes ago, after people watching the show FOMO buy them and you make a nice profit.
4. You do this again, because you always give two stocks with unusual activity on TV.

The book and DVD did not mention what role the pony tail plays in your success.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, I've enlisted the help of my buddy /u/laseryellow and [**compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôs gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it‚Äôs gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we‚Äôve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don‚Äôt really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we‚Äôre not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It‚Äôs IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin‚Äô companies, theres plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

2021-04-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Way undervalued EV company RIDE is massively undervalued right now. Valued at low 1.8 billion market cap. Compare this to competitors (Nikola which doesn‚Äôt have a working vehicle or even a factory is valued at over $4 billion)

Cheaper vehicle and so saves a larger % of money from green credits than competitors 

Only EV company to participate in a grueling race like the San Felipe

Will start production in September 

Selling to fleets vs focusing on straight to consumer is a much better business plan as the infrastructure for EV hasn‚Äôt been built out yet. Contractors can leave vehicle to charge overnight vs with consumers who need electric charging infastructure.

Shorts like Hindenburg have beaten the stock down through complete BS like semantics regarding preorders. Lawsuits have been widely publicized to beat this down. Reality is - Every EV company including Rivian is being sued and suing each other. 

Straight up American goodness. 

Im all in with 1200 shares and long dated calls through September"
2021-04-27 21:12:55,wallstreetbets,"The only potential this company has as far as I'm concerned is short squeeze potential. The leadership has demonstrated that regardless of whether hindinberg is lying, they just arent that smart. The ceo used poorly chosen wording to suggest something that was both inaccurate and important to potential investers. And as for the race, it was a total embarrassment. Maybe actually test the thing on sand? Get a driver who knows how to actually race and not some random dude? I could have done a much better job and I dont know shit about running a company. They demonstrate a lack of common sense and that's not worth a gamble to me."

What are your personal feelings on the company?"
2021-04-27 22:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Analysts are projecting it in the $35 range, which is basically where its trading. For a company like this that's basically an industrial minerals company I would expect the analysts to be fairly good at valuing it, as opposed to a high growth company where you can speculate the future size. Now you could speculate on future potash prices due to corn supply/demand but IBISworld is only projecting a 2% growth in yearly revenue over the next 5 years. Of course IBISworld could get it wrong, so if you think potash is going to the moon then go for it. But for me I'd be much happier to invest in a growth stock that has 5-10x potential as opposed to this which is hard to argue even a 2x. It's also got a 14B market cap so it would be very difficult for the reddit army to pile in and affect the price."

2021-04-28 08:33:57,wallstreetbets,"I would not count on it. This is a 30 year old company that has not accomplished much. It brags about patents. In 25 years I obtained 20 patents, made no more that a few thousand bucks per patent thus far. Most patents are of little economic value for various reasons. Technology patents are notoriously easy to get around and hard to enforce. Look at financial fundamentals, not hype. LZAR has better integrated lidar technology and partnerships with a dozen automotive companies in addition to Airbus"
2021-04-27 22:20:27,wallstreetbets,"No guarantees of course. It was going to moon Thursday for sure when the pps was $10 last week. Now with the unexpected media and WSB attention, it‚Äôs more difficult to gauge how the PR will affect the price"

2021-04-28 07:29:45,wallstreetbets,"This could be the case, I sell software and was at the Virtual Microsoft Partners conference (Inspire 2020) in the fall of 2020. I was working with Enterprise Microsoft Reps selling our software as a partner. Hololens is huge for them (2021), especially in manufacturing. What they are doing with it is impressive. Asks for it in manufacturing have skyrocketed. Microsoft will loan out a unit for testing to get in the door. Digital Transformation is the big push at Microsoft and hololens is a big thing (augmented reality, should see huge adoption by business especially manufacturing)."

2021-04-27 22:57:39,wallstreetbets,"Done plenty of ""DD"" and MVIS is not the only LIDAR company either.  I'm not saying they are ""bad"", but literally every year there are a bunch of buyout rumors, etc.  Apparently last year it was pretty serious and the deal fell apart.  I would be very curious to know why.  (Numbers didn't line up or product wasn't as advertised or ? )"
2021-04-28 00:04:03,wallstreetbets,It takes time. I'm pretty positive they aren't going to sell for 2 or 5 bil They know they need to make their shareholders happy. LAZR is at 7bil without the military tested AR. They have all the right people in place to make the best deal. The NDA means they are in contract negotiations. I would rather have them drag it out and get top dollar. They know what they have. Bottom line is the buyer is out of time. Autonomous vehicles and AR is coming quickly and this tech is key.
2021-04-27 22:23:16,wallstreetbets,Wait so do I buy in now
2021-04-27 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,REMINDME! 6 MONTHS

2021-04-27 21:11:04,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day
2021-04-27 21:55:41,wallstreetbets,The fuck is this
2021-04-28 07:02:09,wallstreetbets,AR yes. Only truly tested one.... Lidar yes..... (A sample) automotive long range version (so far all the specs and as important the cost to produce it are better)  It is coming this month (and we are running out of days). PR soon I hope. This is not  P&D. it's a buy and hold type. If not this month it will happen if you're not patient who knows. Think long and hope it's sooner rather than later. The A sample may be the only thing keeping the sale/strategic partnership from being wrapped up or it might drag out a bit.
2021-04-28 09:41:54,wallstreetbets,"See this is where the devil is in the details.....

They made an announcement this morning that the sample is ""done"" but that it will be available in  ........... Q3 or maybe Q4.........."
2021-04-28 01:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes.  Always nice to give a tip of the cap to Roko's Basilisk."
2021-04-28 09:48:33,wallstreetbets,Proof of concept is what companies want before they sign big contracts. This is fine with me. If you are impatient there are other stocks out there. I'm patient and up 1000% in a year. I can live with that.
2021-04-28 09:51:30,wallstreetbets,"st96badboy:  ""It is coming this month (and we are running out of days)""

also st96badboy: ""  If you are impatient there are other stocks out there.""

?????"
2021-04-28 10:24:35,wallstreetbets,"?? Sorry,  I guess I misunderstood and it got away from me there. I read it like you thought Q3 4 was too far off in the distant future.
I'm happy with their product announcement on schedule and what they promised.

2021-04-28 18:26:32,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands are rough.  Call me paper or whatever but I could have minimized my losses if I only let go earlier this afternoon.  Now we close practically where we were yesterday AND we already had the announcement about the new tech.  If all we are holding out for is a lackluster earnings call - I think it's time to sell your calls before they hemorrhage any further...
2021-04-27 20:42:36,wallstreetbets,How I found out about the next stock
2021-04-27 21:50:23,wallstreetbets,Hope you saved some cash to buy the dip.
2021-04-27 22:06:39,wallstreetbets,"Tried to warn people last night but post was removed.

2 billion market cap but only 3 million in revenue.... 


Didn‚Äôt have time to buy outs at open all well."
2021-04-27 23:52:21,wallstreetbets,"There was really nothing indicating a massive exodus going into today.  Pre market trading had it over 30, and then all the pirates abandoned ships triggering panic spree and letting the shorts win.  Last time I ever believe in the supposed collective will of redditors"

2021-04-28 11:55:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not uncommon for a retard to buy at market open
2021-04-27 20:38:56,wallstreetbets,I was watching the volume and that's why I didn't buy in
2021-04-27 22:08:27,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt just follow what people are doing. 

Look into the company before you jump or know the reason for the increase.

3 million a year revenue is a little small for 2 billion market cap. 

if you don‚Äôt know what revenue or market cap is then you are were you need to be. 


buy my calls and puts please."
2021-04-27 21:19:21,wallstreetbets,ahh the newbie times - when swings of 20% still make your heart race. Pretty soon you will be leveraged to the tits and the only way to get your adrenaline rush will be OTM calls for your whole net worth.
2021-04-28 01:35:47,wallstreetbets,Hold it until it‚Äòs gold
2021-04-27 20:41:09,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 11/share. if it falls below 15 I'm throwing another grand at it immediately. mark my words.

&#x200B;

I don't think it'll fall anywhere near 15 personally."

2021-04-28 02:04:17,wallstreetbets,Haven‚Äôt sold yet but I wish I had so I could increase my position on the down swing but it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm still probably going to buy more regardless is I can time a good buyin today before the PR hopefully sends it higher.
2021-04-27 20:12:16,wallstreetbets,">en bought back in double my holdings at 19.81 right shortly after the bottom of the dip.. ain't skeered

2021-04-28 09:50:30,wallstreetbets,"How does LIDAR work? It bounces laser beams off surrounding objects to create a 3D map. How do you think that goes when bouncing lights on snow/fog/rain?

LIDAR does not work any better in snow/fog/rain than visual feed, look it up. Only radar/ultrasonic can. 

Only thing LIDAR does better than visual feed is working in the dark, and with camera advancements/AI, even that is challenged.

On a pure camera vs LIDAR basis, the LIDAR would detect speeds as it has perception but AI and 3D models have remove this constraint.

Only bullshit coming out here are your claims about LIDAR capabilities."
2021-04-28 02:45:31,wallstreetbets,Yes is that bad though?

2021-04-27 20:37:00,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 11. Was going to cash out when it fell from 26 to 21 and decided to hold tight. Hoping it goes back up.... if it hits 18 I may just bail and flip it elsewhere.
2021-04-27 20:43:40,wallstreetbets,Just in case what? It triples and u make 40$?
2021-04-28 05:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes, once it had spiked in price so quick had to do a quick profit take. Took out initial investment and a bit, but left one share because of the chance for continuing gains and I wanted to let one little guy ride, lol"

2021-04-27 21:29:02,wallstreetbets,I personally had not paid any attention to the stop loss/stop limit. After seeing this post decided to do a little research. What a world of difference that could have made for me over the last year.  Thanks for posting! I was able to learn a little something and put an extra tool in the belt today.

2021-04-28 04:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Lol then you should specify, fidelity does allow sell limits after hours you just want a good till canceled limit order for after hours which it doesnt allow. In fact i dont know any brokerages that do for retail. Manage your limit orders better. All brokerages have a max time for day orders for their after hours and premarket."

Edit: any helpful insight appreciated"
2021-04-27 21:26:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm still on RH because the way they have their options laid out is great and the gain/loss graph is fantastic. I've moved more than half of my portfolio out of RH though in the last 4-5 months.

I've also got accounts with WB, Fidelity and Etrade.. Power E-Trade is pretty good but still doesn't come close to RH's UI.. I do hate Robinhood though, but until other brokers actually improve their UI's and become more competitive I'll still have an account there."

2021-04-27 22:57:30,wallstreetbets,Do brokerages also give you tax information?
2021-04-27 23:48:26,wallstreetbets,None. I have 15 contracts though. If I make money off this I will invest into shares.
2021-04-28 01:36:08,wallstreetbets,"No it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs using Robinhood and bought calls instead of shares, straight retarded, no wrinkles."
2021-04-28 00:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Just read a couple DD here and there and saw the price finally move pretty high in what's been weeks. Didn't do any extensive analysis or nothing. This was a mix of some DD I read, the stock moving, and my own feelings."
2021-04-28 10:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't they want you to sell not buy, they need to buy they don't want you to sell so if they're being squeezed that means they literally have to buy which means they want you to sell so they can buy"

2021-04-28 06:13:23,wallstreetbets,I tried to move to fidelity but they can‚Äôt identify my identity so i just left it lol
2021-04-28 14:53:08,wallstreetbets,Also make sure you call once the transfer is complete and have them switched over to cash because RH sends them on margin!!
2021-04-28 10:18:09,wallstreetbets,You just triggered so many tender little soy boys lol
2021-04-28 09:09:33,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs gonna be a GUH
2021-04-27 23:47:31,wallstreetbets,Technically they can expire worthless.. no bag to hold!... I‚Äôve been greedy and got screwed for not taking profits early on OTM calls.. then just sitting there watching them go to a damn penny a piece hoping I can make some money! Risky game but it‚Äôs fun ü•¥
2021-04-28 12:57:41,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll probably be left holding the bag regardless based on the broker that you‚Äôre using
2021-04-27 20:24:29,wallstreetbets,Not sure when you should sell but you should know that next week will have some big-time Theta burn. Try to avoid that and take profits in advance.
2021-04-28 11:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck to you.  I have puts at $100 expiring at the same time.  Hopefully one of us will be ITM, but I have a feeling we will both be at $0"

2021-04-28 13:36:55,wallstreetbets,"Please prevent yourself a breakdown, cmon man take it from someone literate like me in Finance. Sell this shit, its way overvalued and can only be profitable by timing right. This drew way too many people in that have no idea what theyre getting in to. There is no squeeze happening, if it would it already happened (which is not weird to assume after >1000% returns ytd). All these mysterious looking dd is mostly out of context taken info, dipped in the conspiracy sauce."
2021-04-27 20:22:50,wallstreetbets,"Except that it will. At its peak, before the Reddit squeeze, this was a $50 stock... and it is well past it‚Äôs peak."

2021-04-27 20:24:14,wallstreetbets,"only ATM ITM calls... not far OTM. Which is what people usually get with GME, retarded shit like 800C that does nothing but help hedge funds and hurt squeeze potential. So it's good OP got 187s"
2021-04-28 13:07:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah you definitely belong here.
2021-04-28 11:40:41,wallstreetbets,Fuckin wot
2021-04-28 13:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Im... not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say. 

You don‚Äôt own anything when you buy on robinhood. You can‚Äôt sell because they don‚Äôt have anything to sell for you. And they don‚Äôt have the capital to cover their loss. So instead of being a normal broker they are literally stealing money and when they lose they don‚Äôt allow you to sell. 

I hope that makes sense. I have no idea what you were trying to say."
2021-04-28 17:58:17,wallstreetbets,Good smooth brain!
2021-04-28 08:58:40,wallstreetbets,More like paper hand at $300

2021-04-28 00:13:18,wallstreetbets,Be warned Fidelity denied my transfer from RH because for some reason it came across as margin even though I have a cash account.

2021-04-27 20:20:39,wallstreetbets,Seriously? Ever since this play came into fruition the mantra was to buy shares. It‚Äôs been the long staple of GME advice.
2021-04-27 20:31:31,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter unless you're planning to exercise. If the stock goes up in value so do the options, even the otm ones. Then you sell the option back to the market for a profit."
2021-04-28 11:25:58,wallstreetbets,What if it goes to 100 and then goes back to 200.
2021-04-27 20:48:51,wallstreetbets,Why not buy options on 3x ETF and call it both?
2021-04-27 20:53:05,wallstreetbets,Sure.  Why not.  They're only 15 years late on implementing the strategy and I'm sure dog treats guy knows more about selling video games than Gabe Newell
2021-04-28 13:47:11,wallstreetbets,But I'm now 19k from yesterday's 10k and it hit 180 per share. Are you sure? Gme is the highest its ever been in weeks. Do you think it will hit 200? Genuinely asking. I'm hoping it hits 200.
2021-04-28 11:43:51,wallstreetbets,"MVIS payed off. Which means statisticallly I've never been wrong on a yolo before. All that's left is my GME play to profit. GME better üöÄ üåô if it doesn't moon well fuck, that's all my money. That's going to make me sad."

2021-04-28 01:56:01,wallstreetbets,And the high borrow rate on margins.  And how you are using margins even when you have a cash reserve.  You can hate on RH all day but it is leaps better then fidelity.
2021-04-28 00:27:27,wallstreetbets,They transfer margin accounts. The account is settled and moved over. But I have heard of people having similar issues. I‚Äôve also heard it‚Äôs usually cleared up quickly with a phone call to Fidelity to better understand what is needed.
2021-04-28 01:42:28,wallstreetbets,"eh? yes you can. you have to request it on your account

unless you mean you can't figure out how, and then I can understand"
2021-04-27 22:35:40,wallstreetbets,"Nobody talking about how he's already down like $30k? He put 1/4M on this shit and he's down 30K in a day when the share price was at $180.70

Shares will have to go past 190 by tomorrow or he's eating a loss quick. 

That's what tells me this is real. 

People gambling on RH only post pics showing green for the victory lap. This mid-week panic post ain't gonna save him from a bad option buy. 

I hope he at least has a stop-loss because this could turn hard on him and I'd rather have $100k than zero."
2021-04-27 21:23:50,wallstreetbets,Time and volatility are really the main things to consider tbh.

2021-04-27 20:50:05,wallstreetbets,Sorry man. Not an options sub
2021-04-28 18:23:20,wallstreetbets,Whats theta look to take tomorrow at open? Not giving you shit just curious how much a hit each day is hitting that needs to be made up.
2021-04-28 14:49:59,wallstreetbets,Thank you. My reality was breaking apart trying to comprehend.

You get what you pay for, though, as you don't see Fidelity crashing on heavy IV, and in fact get much better price improvements due to Fidelity's superior infrastructure."

2021-04-28 12:56:09,wallstreetbets,Yea I‚Äôm really mad
2021-04-28 12:49:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean, he was referring to buying shares (investing in the company you believe in). You're holding call contracts you can't afford to exercise. These have an expiration, so ""hold"" doesn't really hold the same meaning he was conveying.

Just a heads up: you were up $8000 when I looked before, now currently $4500. If you held till expiration, to get the same profit ($4500), you'd need the share price to be about $3 over the breakeven price ($207.60). You'd make the same amount if you take your profit now and invest your original 25k into shares and it hits that price point. Of course if you hold your Calls and it moons, then you have the potential for much higher gains at the risk of losing it all.

What the hell am I babbling about? This is WallStreetBets: YOLO APE!!

Edit: now I'm the high one. I was looking at 187.5 Put prices"

Shameful attempt at manipulation of peoples fears.  IF you actually wanted rich people to not ""walk away unscathed"" and pay what they owe the government, you would want the IRS to be properly funded and not the husk they've been made by starve the beast.

You get a lot less (potentially) now due to new rules.  That money could have been seriously life changing but now it‚Äôs less life changing.  You people who think more taxes are better are insane.  You‚Äôll learn, but it will be too late.  Say you inherited 5 million.  Is it just ok to take grandmas earning away from your family?  Because if you sold your inheritance to buy your dream house for 3 million you‚Äôd be a million short after a%75% increase after a mil.  It‚Äôs like your brains are completely fucking rotted out!  You prob feel bad for having money, and you are glad to donate it to the state...because you are a fucking moron!  Why should they get a huge piece of your grandmas accomplishments they aren‚Äôt getting now?  So if you have no job or ambition, go around like a victim wanting others to pay for your existence because ‚Äúlife is  hard‚Äù , suck off your parents till you are 30, and you think others should pay for your stuff...Fuck you!  

Also, you‚Äôve been completely brainwashed to be accepting of new taxes.   No one with half a brain or an iota of life experience, or unbiased historical education,  would think it‚Äôs a good idea.  This communist socialist ‚Äú give me‚Äù and envious/jealous mentality are a cancer.  Instead strive to get there.  That‚Äôs what is all about!  Opportunity not outcome.  You think these politicians are actually knowledgeable in this stuff?  All the economists are not running for office, lawyer‚Äôs  are.  They barely listen to people that actually have a clue because ...re-election.  Truth hurts so we will destroy it all if I can get 4 more years.  Things are already worse under Biden.  Check the gas prices.  That effects everyone but some more than others.  People with less have to often commute, especially if they are rural.  Often people live rural to save cash.  It‚Äôs cheaper to live rural, but that gas cost really hurts.  It‚Äôs an instant hurt.  Many are already hurting and it‚Äôs just begun.

If you think I‚Äôm wrong  or have to ask why, then you are screwing your future (hopefully successful self) or you are just stupid.  Bringing  down others will not lift you up, it will just bring them down closer to your   level.  So everyone can live like shit.  Yay!  No hope then why produce?  Everyone should have hope!  We live in a country with so many opportunities!  You have to be hungry for it and work hard/smart.  

Next‚Äî-No one owes you shit!  You are a burden unless you are producing.  I think most agree that short term help needs to be there for people, but if you are living a life of mooching, of excuses, you can fuck right off.  So what if you didn‚Äôt choose to be born.  You are here and not one person or animal/plant ever consented.  Get over it.  If your are legitimately disabled then yes, you should be helped.  

If your company has to pay more taxes then they will cut jobs.  They will just force more people to compensate by working harder.  Sounds fun!  Not sure what else they can cut since this is already the norm, but we will definitely find out.  Stocks go up when they fire people!  Saves cash...

Even when I was a kid I knew this was bad and my parents were non-political.   I didn‚Äôt  even know their affiliation growing up.  It‚Äôs logical.  I remember walking out of a college class because the professor was spouting  lots of American hate and colonialism hate...essentially trying to make everyone feel bad for the sins of their ancestors.  Well guess what asshole, we didn‚Äôt do it!  How about a real solution instead of ancestor guilt.  ...this was back in the late 80s and I went to college early at early at 16.   

I thought to myself, this guys a fucking communist, Turned out that he was actually a communist‚Äî which used to be a big deal.  This was actually rare back then and the govt would not let you into any sensitive position if you sympathized with communist/socialist ideology.  Now you can‚Äôt do college without being  inundated with opinions and bullshit rather than learning, and learning how to just think and use reason.  But you think you know how...you just don‚Äôt.  They don‚Äôt want you to think, why would they?  You are easier to tax and control if you are warped.  Down vote me all you want, it won‚Äôt fix your stupid.   You, and the younger generations, stupidity will lead to ruin for all.  If you can‚Äôt see this then you are just the average,brainwashed, compliant citizen they are hoping for.  If you can then you know what‚Äôs coming.  

Hard for me to imagine an investing site advocating for taxes.  It‚Äôs twisted.  Takes the most special of the special for that.  I‚Äôd think these people would actually have ambition, lol.  What a joke.  I will absorb and enjoy my downvotes."

2021-04-28 00:22:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm just gonna say I don't care enough to read some old man rage rambling about taxes on reddit, but I'll comment on the one thing I did read: grandma buys a stock and never cashes out.  You inherit the stock.  You pay the taxes on all of grandma's unrealized gains.  You think that's such a wild idea that you want to write fucking paragraphs about it?  I don't care.  And no one is begging to be taxed you weirdo.  The government misappropriating tax money is an altogether separate issue that we might have a lot to agree on, but my only point was the naked fact that cost basis for inherited stocks isn't fucking communism.  A lot of things can be life changing, so what?  Not paying taxes on the cost basis was a good deal.  That good deal ending isn't some evil unfairness.  It actually makes sense.  You should be more upset about what your taxes go to.  And I think I scanned over something about poor people are all lazy or some shit like that so honestly, I'm wasting my time even typing this to some dickbrain like you."

It does not magically become money, it represents existing money traded from USD for <XYZ> stock/coin. The most appropriate laws for stocks would be akin to how Forex is regulated.

Additionally, stock investment carries significant risk: yes you can write off losses if you realize them, but who with a net worth under $100,000 wants to do that?"

2021-04-27 23:37:20,wallstreetbets,"if you look at screenshots of Futu it is the same software as Webull. They also share logos with moomoo. Moomoo is some sort of media arm of Futu and pushes HK/China ADRs by promoting their PR videos on the moomoo site. Last week moomoo pushed several GSX related videos tied to their rebrand and ""investor day"" that was insanely ridiculous. 

The valuation on Futu is based on the traded value of 30% float, giving them a $20Bn valuation up 1300% yoy on $337MM profit on $427MM in revenue. Ok, sure. Now look at their announcement last week that they need to raise $1.5Bn to stay competitive in a ""extremely competitive margin sales business."" 

Why would a company with \~75% margins two years into the black need to raise money? Why would same company push known fraudulent ADRs? Why is there no paper trail (that I found, admittedly using circumstantial evidence here) connecting them to Webull? If Webull just like robinhood is making their money selling order flow and they are also connected to these fraudulent, or at least very suspicious other firms, what else are they doing with the order flow?

I hate the Schwab app, but I can buy OTCs and they aren't selling my data to fraudulent ADRs. At least not yet. And God know what will happen if there is real fraud and my money gets stuck in there. Seems way riskier than RH. At least you will be able to sue RH."

2021-04-27 21:26:55,wallstreetbets,Ummm debt is a good thing. It means the company has cash on hand.
2021-04-27 20:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Not really, people were expecting that these 3.5mm shares were still able to be sold and not already sold. No more dilution is scheduled as far as I know (which is not much)"
2021-04-28 06:20:09,wallstreetbets,$180 is pretty much a steal for a stock that is going to be valued as infinite.
2021-04-28 05:59:18,wallstreetbets,"It's reeeaally hard to say and that's what makes it so much fun. The people going on about a floor of 10million are retarded but it is possible. IF everyone plays by the rules IF no government intervenes and IF everyone actually holds until 10million.

Now imagine this going to 50.000$. Would you keep holding? Maybe yes, but would you just sell one or two shares to at least guarantee you're going even? Or imagine at 20.000$ when everyone's talking about how there's going to be some form of intervention soon. Would you keep holding despite the fear that someone shuts it all down?

These are the thoughts that everyone will have during a massive FUD campaign once the sqeueeze hits.

So yeah 10mil is mathematically possible within the rules of wallstreet, but I don't think we can achieve it. The counter-argument is the tulip inflation in the netherlands where tulips were traded in such ridiculous values that a tulip basically went for the price of a house. Consider the price of a house right now and then cautiously assume a peak at ""four shares for a house"" if you want to take the tulips as a sort of precedence.

So yeah. I think it's generally expected that this flies way past 1.000$ per share. There is a *guaranteed buyer* on the other end.      
I personally fully expect it to hit 10.000$ per share and I won't sell there either.      
The real question is how much further it will go a) before people just sell to save their profits and b) before the government is forced to intervene."
2021-04-28 06:42:46,wallstreetbets,Definitely. GME is the most talked about stock in the entire world. Check out the stock maps in Europe- GME is the most popular in many of the counties. According to a recent GameStop filing there should be \~28 millions shares in float. But estimates there are probably hundreds of shares (everything else is a synthetic share from short hedge funds borrowing stocks to short). GME is turning around their business to be an ecommerce company. AMC is just coming back from Covid and that is all it has lol: same CEO same business model. GME is getting new board members and is changing their business model (check out their store they have started selling computer parts and they are testing out internet cafe locations).
2021-04-28 12:06:50,wallstreetbets,"If you divide the number of shares by just cash on hand, it's already close to being above that range."

2021-04-28 06:31:56,wallstreetbets,There is very little selling pressure. The reason that the price seems so deflated is market makers like Citadel/Virtu Americas route their buy orders to dark pools where market price is not effected and for sell orders they sell directly to the market.
2021-04-27 21:07:24,wallstreetbets,It's also brilliant because they bought up millions of shares at 4$... then turned around and later sold shares for 157$. It's an absurd profit for just reselling some shares.
2021-04-28 06:35:55,wallstreetbets,The difference between now and late January is shorts have way less captial than before. People are saying that if does reach a high enough points \~500-600 then short hedge funds are gonna get margin called and they will have to cover all the shorted shares.

Everything else is speculation at this point as to the the company's future. Which is fine if you believe it is a growth stock and that's your angle and you're willing to pay a premium for it now. At $10 it was way undervalued. At $175 per share it's probably closer to double what it's worth. I would not call it a value stock if I was long. Just my opinion."

You can't possibly manipulate anything, its all disclosed way ahead of time and you can't place orders or buy and sell with limits etc... it's all at market and all conducted by a third party after filing all kinds of shit.

2021-04-28 08:34:50,wallstreetbets,It's to defer the taxes on it until years in which you have available deductions to offset the amount of tax you pay. So essentially people will take out money from there when they have deductions that don't roll over so they take out TFSA money so those deductions aren't lost. Alternatively people will invest in their TFSA and then put the gains into their RRSP every February and take the cash out when retired at a lower tax bracket. Either way it's deferring tax to a later time when you have an opportunity to take it out at a lower rate.

2021-04-28 01:04:28,wallstreetbets,"FYI all -

i just looked at the last 45 earnings for amazon, and compared price day of to 5 weeks later. here's what i found.

16% of the time, amzn's stock price increased >15%. 84% of the time amzn's stock did not increase by >15%. Among the times that amzn saw a 15%+ increase over the following 5 weeks post earnings, the average gains was 19%.

Something to keep in mind if you wanna buy a call option. Historically we've seen big gains 16% of the time following earnings for AMZN."

2021-04-28 00:56:57,wallstreetbets,"yeah strike price just goes down proportionally to the split. so if there's a 10 to 1 split the strike price drops to 10% the original number.

You're not telling me you have puts on amzn going into earnings are you?"

16% of the time, amzn's stock price increased >15%. 84% of the time amzn's stock did not increase by >15%.

So if you wanna buy a call option, keep in mind you have something like a 10-20% chance that it goes up 15% in the next 5 weeks."
2021-04-28 18:01:22,wallstreetbets,How do you mean?
2021-04-28 11:02:03,wallstreetbets,16% isn‚Äôt winning odds. I‚Äôll sell calls with a 74% probability before I buy them at 16%.
2021-04-28 08:27:22,wallstreetbets,Ha no. I was just wondering
2021-04-28 13:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Well, I was referring to the day of earnings and the day after earnings, not over the last few weeks."
2021-04-28 11:09:37,wallstreetbets,"I did a simple model basically comparing a 16% chance of a 60k win vs a 84% chance of losing 1.7k and the odds were slightly positively skewed. Basically this reflects a 5 week call option with a 4000 strike. I got 60k cuz that reflects winnings for a june 4 call with a 4000 strike + a 19% move from current price. 

This just puts us into a general ballpark tho. In reality there are infinite outcomes not just 2 binary outcomes since you can sell before expiration and i just picked 19% because that's the average 5 week move for the 16% of post earnings periods that amzn moved over 15%. 

This might not be super clear but basically this gives us a general ballpark and it appears to be slightly good odds. Not a home run but good enough for me to bet especially since I'm way more bullish for fundamental reasons this earnings period than I would have been during most previous amzn earnings periods. The ""split"" rumor isn't priced in at all so a 5+ day is possible without the split, with it who knows.

Anyway I shared my piece. Sounds like some in this thread are running alongside me. t minutes 30 hours to takeoff."
2021-04-28 14:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Ah true. Yeah, I'm assuming to have a chance at +15% over the next 5 weeks we will need a 4-5% move after earnings minimum.

You're right in general amzn takes a couple weeks to make a big leg up."
2021-04-28 18:01:04,wallstreetbets,So would your total cash value remain the same?
2021-04-28 18:16:38,wallstreetbets,"Initially yes, but you would be subject to market condition after the split just like owning any stock."

2021-04-28 01:12:29,wallstreetbets,"Yay!

Except access to this amazing American market is currently prohibited. Rest-of-world I get, but this constant talk of US legalization is a fart in a hurricane right now.

Disclosure, I am long TLRY."
2021-04-28 01:15:24,wallstreetbets,"Tilray/Aphria already have access to the US market through Sweetwater and Manitoba Harvest. Once legalization occurs, they will make a big splash by acquiring a MSO."
2021-04-28 01:31:18,wallstreetbets,"I concur, hence the long position. Just a little fatigued by all the ""US gonna legalize and TLRY to da moon!"" 

US legalization is a big deal, but let's be realistic about how TLRY can capitalize on that situation. Acquiring an MSO is not a trivial proposal and they have yet to complete the APHA merge. TLRY looks like they have a solid 5 year business plan. I'd prefer to focus on that, but I guess that doesn't feed the meme-machine."
2021-04-28 11:01:25,wallstreetbets,Well the one thing I would say with regards to US legalization is that it will spur legalization around the world. Many countries look to the US to set an example and you could certainly see the flood gates open after US.

2021-04-27 21:24:14,wallstreetbets,"GME as an online retailer, not realistically that good. They cant sell downloads from the PS or XB store so they're limited to selling physical copies online, they already do that now. Only thing they've said besides that is they're going to sell computer parts. Anyone who buys that long term goal might understand numbers but they dont understand the business of game sales. They're competing with every other online game seller- Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target. Their app better make people orgasm because they're not going to have an easy time otherwise...

It doesnt matter tho, their future visions or successes has little to no impact at this point. Especially with AMC being held around 90% retail. No large institutional sell offs. The 500Million share dilution is now off the table, after they kept doubling down on their shorts. Both are in a perfect position to moon. They're just taking 2 different flight paths."
2021-04-28 11:23:44,wallstreetbets,GME already has partnerships with msft. You really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
2021-04-28 11:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Can you share a link to that info, is this new? Otherwise you know they can't sell digital copies through the Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo platforms. They have the same safety rights for security purposes granted to them by Congress via Apple verse fortnite. So again, it leaves them with no means to make digital sales. They're left with no option but to compete with those other companies I name you already sell games online. That's why they're also jumping into computer parts, another physical item. They have no chance of becoming the Amazon for gaming. You can already get parts really cheap on Amazon, eBay, or TigerDirect. It's not like there's a gap in any of this part of the market. I'm not saying they can't survive I just don't think they're going to become what people are expecting. But regardless of that, either way the squeeze is coming. At this point it's just supply and demand, how well they do in the future is irrelevant."
2021-04-28 11:49:16,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you taking about they have no means for digital sales? That is one of their primary goals lol
2021-04-28 05:32:17,wallstreetbets,How you feeling today buddy?
2021-04-28 13:33:00,wallstreetbets,"They can't sell they ps, xbox, or Nintendo store front. They dont allow that and they have that right for platform security assurance. This was decided in court. So how are they going digital, by what method?"
2021-04-28 14:19:32,wallstreetbets,Buddy do you seriously think the GME board doesn't know what they're doing? Lol come on you think they came this far without knowing what their limitations are? pull your head out your ass.
2021-04-28 16:05:37,wallstreetbets,"So your argument is you blindly trust in the board. You don't have any actual facts to back up anything you said, nor did you dispute anything I said. K"

2021-04-27 22:14:31,wallstreetbets,"thats not how stocks work

you buying stocks on wall street of an all ready listed chinese company doesn't put additional money into the hands of the company unless they were selling their own shares. You would know if they were selling their own shares and almost all of us would never be part of an IPO. 

You're buying stocks from other financial firms (probably based out of USA ran by americans) and other retail traders probably americans"

I guess you would have to know that clf was a mining company a year ago and now they‚Äôre a steel company with their own mines

It's a super simple formula. 

Surely everyone involved in the stock market understands how compound interest works?"
2021-04-27 20:42:41,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't matter if you change small details like the percentage growth rate. You're blatantly ignoring how compound growth *works*. Your cash needs to grow exponentially in order to afford a strategy like that and it can't. As in, not physically possible."
2021-04-27 20:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Oh, man... you're so close to understanding this.

The cash value is totally irrelevant. Strictly looking at share count, it absolutely works.

the company is in the whole 15 million every year. 


If anything this company signals the top as it did go to above $500 before crashing during 2001...

go look up the stock history from that long ago. fucking insane.


on GME it isn't worth 200 or its current price but as long as other people buy the cc and the volatility stays high i could get used  to doubling my income but more than likely going to cash out and take my extra 7k and get a new fridge."
2021-04-27 23:09:55,wallstreetbets,"No doubt that a lot of the price has run on speculation. That combined with the crazy inflation in the market overall...fundamentals don‚Äôt matter in certain situations. The price is exactly at what people are willing to pay. You said it yourself, GME is one of those situations. MVIS is too in my opinion. GME was a good company and the shorts tried to ruin it, unfairly. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to believe MVIS is in the same boat. I think they have some leadership, manufacturing, and technical knowledge issues, but ultimately they have a good product and the infrastructure to create it."

On the asset prices yea I am getting concerned about investing in some really good companies that are secure but are already over valued by 2 times fair market value. Makes investing difficult when revenue for the next 5 years is already included in the share price."

2021-04-28 10:44:57,wallstreetbets,"Or maybe possibly Apple/Fisker/Foxconn are working on the Apple car?

I mean, all signs point to yes, no other EV startup fits the bill.

Fisker has already partnered with Foxconn for their second vehicle, While Foxconn really only cares about producing Apple products. 

Apples expectations of design and innovation aligns with Fiskers more than any other EV company.. also no word from Apple yet, and we're expecting an Apple car around the time frame of Fiskers second car, and about that.. 

Fiskers second vehicle is codenamed ""PEAR"" mind you... a bit on the nose to me I think.

Any slander and poor analysis of Fisker seems to stem solely from short sellers and speculation based on Henrik Fiskers last auto company flub, but the guy has been designing cars for BMW before he went to work for Ford designing cars for Aston Martin before going off to start his own auto company that failed really only because of the battery supplier.

Also let's not forget in 2007 big dick Tesla Motors hired Fisker to help design the Model S... and that seemed to go pretty well, maybe someone can do a DD write up on Tesla, last I heard they were doing ok"

2021-04-28 03:44:01,wallstreetbets,"**According to Wikipedia:** 

""MP Materials is majority-owned to 51.8% by hedge funds JHL Capital Group (and its CEO James Litinsky) and QVT Financial LP, while Shenghe Resources Holding Co. Ltd., a partially [state-owned enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise) of the [Government of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China), holds an 8.0% stake.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-screener-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-7) Apart from institutions, the public owns 18%.""

&#x200B;

**About the Mine  (Also from Wikipedia):**

Discovered in 1949 in [San Bernardino County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino_County), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), Mountain Pass mine consists of a [bastn√§site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastn%C3%A4site) ore-body with significant concentrations of rare earth elements.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-14) The mine once supplied most of the world's rare earth elements.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-15) Mountain Pass is the only operational rare earth mining and processing facility in the United States.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-Bloomberg_Californian-8) The expected Mountain Pass mine life is approximately 24 years.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-2020_S1-16)

MP Materials produced 28,000 tonnes of rare-earth oxide equivalent from Mountain Pass in 2019, and 38,000 tonnes in 2020, 15.8% of global rare-earths production.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-usgs-1) Shenghe Resources is the sole buyer of MP Materials' rare earth concentrate.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials#cite_note-17)

&#x200B;

I find it interesting that Shenghe Resources is really the sole benefactor of the mining operation, since it buys all the materials mined.  It looks like China is greatly benefitting from our natural resources here in California.  This makes me feel very uncomfortable because I don't trust the Chinese government and I really don't like the idea that another country is utilizing our land and natural resources.  You state that, ""The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point. [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue. The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).""  However, how can we become independent from our reliance on China for rare earth materials when China is mining those materials on our own soil from the only rare earth mining and processing facility in the United States and is the sole buyer of those materials?  What the hell are we doing?  

I hope you make money on your investments and options,  and I wish you all the best.  I just don't feel comfortable investing in China.  I've been in GME for months and I like the stock, and I like other stocks, as well.  I think MP looks good from your DD, but damn, I wish it didn't involve China."

2021-04-27 21:57:34,wallstreetbets,"Battery swapping won't work unless standard batteries can be agreed upon.  We're still years away from optimizing the battery cell, so near term it doesn't work.  There would be too much differentiated inventory to be kept on hand and fully charged.

What would work is a semi range fully loaded of 450+ miles.  That would allow for 8 hours of driving range, and cautious truckers could top up during their 30 minute mandated break, so you could maybe even take that number down to sub 400, depending on the charging capabilities of the batteries.

Tesla is promoting getting over 600 miles, but I am not sure if that includes a full load in the trailer.  Won't really know until they start production and release final specs.  Assuming they use their newer 4680, they should have a variant suitable for long haul trucking in the near future."
