03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m considering writing a stop-in put order on a few candidates that might free-fall if these fund margin calls and liquidations don’t let up. I’ve seen some really weird price actions on some of my calls lately that didn’t match up with the share price. Something weird is going on in the last hour of trading every day since last week.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does the SEC regulate the comment pages in Yahoo Finance?   

Nope!

The SelfAwareWolf is stronk in this one!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aww, errbody *so* damn interested in protecting the customers suddenly. Funny how y'all didn't give a good goddamn when they weren't making any serious coin. Tf outta here."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They didn't care when it was losses up in here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck this tool bag.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just in case SEC looking right now, how about investigating fucking insider traders of Wall Street, is that too hard of a job? Because if it is so, how about licking my hairy nuts instead? You always have a choice, pick an option you'd like."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I still have losses. 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He looks like a computer generated character from shenmue
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"all this ""reddit trader"" shit is a bunch of horse hockey, all the hedgies and market makers are here too."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have April 1st calls so I assume this rocket is taking off right after
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You wont regret it!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT sucks but it will be some nice loss porn🚀💥
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,💪📈
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure there will be some nice action in the short term stock play. But I am employed in an industry that has me involved with this company from time to time on the regular. In their segment they are at best mediocre. Unless they are able to rectify this by a complete overhaul of operations, this is not a long-term value company in my opinion."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do some DD and then come back to me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck bro. Im doing my best to recoup my 3k loss when I was up in GME calls because I learned about this thing called time decay when I was up lol. I’m getting there tho and I swear the amount of education I get from here is worth anything I lose.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,👍😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man. Keep grinding. Come join theta gang and sell options instead of buying them haha. Good luck to you too!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wym time decay. Share the education 👍🏾
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man (wipes away tears)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll find out. Just give it time
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,😷
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in this bitch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re definitely retarded....I didn’t sell either time too
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT will be above $30 by end of week. It’s Morgan Stanley vs Reddit/WSB 🔥
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is 284k CAD about 750 USD?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did they feature you in the article ""YOU CAN LIVE OFF THESE THREE TOP STOCK DIVIDENDS EARNERS"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful. Whats your broker btw BMO?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God these RKT posts are the definition of FOMO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why RKT? The stock hasn’t moved significantly in the last 12 months.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a spike, nah. Nah."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Morgan and Stanley are totally gay for each other.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bout Tree fitty 🤔
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yah
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not exactly. There’s a lot of fomo only cuz the company has good fundamentals. Most people myself included think that the price will eventually hold when it spikes. Probably closer to ER though
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,it's only FOMO if you buy in on the way up.... RKT is not up (yet) lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely heard Stanley eats cereal out of Morgan’s butt, and he pours the milk first."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A fellow canadian autist eh? This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"maybe you should try ibkr, with BMO you get shafted on both commission and currency exchange"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sirrrrrrr!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am a greedy retarded degenerate who was stupid enough to hold it all the way up to $42 and back down... will probably do the same again and then sell for a loss
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Made good money betting against them first thing this morning. Saw it exploded out of the gate... up 15% in under an hour... over $27/share.  I said, hmm... no way that's going to continue.  Bought a Put at that moment.  35min later sold it for 220% gain.  Have also made a bunch from buying RKT Calls earlier this month. RKT has turned into my personal ATM.  Loving it!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold mine today, so $RKT should rocket just fine now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, what happened today? Was it the great shake out? Someone knew something in the morning and then pulled the rug from under all the new fish."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re taking off tomorrow 🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you just make this day up to flex on us poor folk?

I respect it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this time just sell a little bit & Venmo me since you wanna leave the profit on the table ?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Send me your money and I'll pay a hobo to kick you in the nuts. 

Win-win"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt they’ll get back up to $42 for some time but for your sake I hope they do 💎
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! Trade that volatility.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Morgan Stanley dumped 20 million shares which stopped the run in its tracks. As to whether they or others started the run in the first place to get out of margin called positions isn’t clear yet.

More shenanigans to come I’m sure."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,20m share margin call thing?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just saw a bunch of posts about RKT in the last hour or so and felt left out.

If it helps half of any of these gains are going straight to the taxman to pay for peoples stimmy checks.

Thats assuming I don’t lose it all by the end of the year at which point I would need one of those said stimmy checks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally did the same shit with SPCE before it took of. Yolo’d at 15 - 17 went up to 24 then back to 19 then I sold... then it went to $60
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been watching RKT since early February.  It seems to be constantly/consistently moving up & down by $3 - $5.  Ever since it hit $40, it never ventures far beyond $26 - $27/share.  On the other side, it never seems to dip below $21 - $22/share.

SKT has also become reliable for doing the same.  Doesn't seem to venture under $15/share too hard before coming back up.  But never goes far beyond $17/share.

Not an advisor. Just an ape with determination to make money on both sides."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I loaded up, if that helps ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought them selling block shares caused the run since it was above the trading price it was at.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If your name is Archegos apparently yes!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you get a nice dividend tho?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao damn. Honestly, just tell me your next yolo, im just gonna buy & hold"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the type of ape that all apes should ape
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah its at the bottom of the screenshot.

Errr it may however already have been spent tripling down on another XL position which I was already down 50% on... maybe"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's genuinely one of the nicest things I've heard said about me. Thank you, Ape Brother"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What is said position? 🙃
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,To  the fucking moon and then some bitches
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry I already threw my money in the trash.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"100 leap call at $28, i was gready today"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How can anyone be happy about rkt? Its been stick forwver
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And another RKT.. This is done. Everyone got their divs and moved on.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best place for it, IMO"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,so... buy $WM?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash is Trash
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait 6 months then tell me if it wasn’t a good price at $23.80.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,most of the time when you FOMO on the way up it ends badly. So most of RKT holders now are buying *in anticipation* of a spike
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Strangle options” just auto correct on phone to STABLE options so it is clearly meant to be, whoooooo!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, and this is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a financial advisor, just someone who likes bdsm option plays.         

Personally, I think the May $27.50//32.50 straddle would be a better play(personally, still wouldn’t play it), but generally I have avoided the straddle on psxp due to the lack of volatility, while the option positions continue to have high volatility."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a small position. Long term the stock should be fine. I'll either get a fast swing or be married to it lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, DD is well written. I go to sleep, so cant comment more."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good realistic DD
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Legit love that the media has started combing this beautiful retard pool for the other side of the story. Ma, we're on the teevee!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Deeez nuts
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real danger to the market are retailers losing confidence due to cheating being allowed at the top and on the inside and nobody being prosecuted/imprisoned by the SEC. This will hurt the billionaire class and make the world more socialist. If that's what American Capitalists want, that's what they will get at the rate they are going."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this one of the few authors that actually came here and read something before just spewing shit fed to them by some hedge fund. He should be lauded for doing the bare minimum I suppose
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There's most likely people working there that already browsed here. It's like fight club we've infiltrated every facet of society.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Clever AND original!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Aww don’t get salty
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not salty, I've no reason to be, your comment is just unoriginal, not funny and doesn't make sense."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But this is wsb - it makes perfect sense!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🧂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It was kinda funny though
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🧂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife’s boyfriend said this thread made deeez nutz salty.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at the top. Currently riding a unicycle.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’d think the stock would be at atleast $30 with how many dip buyers there are
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,99 Camry pretty good though...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you call it a dip when it doesn't come back up?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,pltr $45 by next week i turbocharge the 99 camry
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s going to be a run on ‘99 Camrys. 8/21 ‘99 Camry calls 🚀🌝
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My friend, you are an absolute mega chad. I’ll see you in that lambo when I’m riding my razor scooter with a caprisun my guy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch the double negatives.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to love this stock.  But why is it just hanging in the low 20s?   Just blows my mind.  Should be higher.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR? You’ll be lucky to afford a 10 speed after this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope these print for you 🤴
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I vote Camry. Like even if this shit goes to the moon. I’m still voting you buy a 99 Camry haha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your strike price is $25.
Rookie numbers. 😤😤🥱🥱"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Whatchu think I rap for?  To push a fuckin RAV 4?!?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,99 camry is car equivalent of an old nokia cell phone literally indestructible.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this rate, I'll be rockin' some '08 Converse All-Stars -- unable to afford laces, so I won't be able to hang myself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky you. I bought at the ATH. Driving a 2011 Sonata. Will be for a very long time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll catch you taking the bus
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,why not both
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What about an 89 lambo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,25 below for the next 2 months
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I drive a 99 Camry you degenerate! There is nothing wrong with it. Fuck the Lambo! Get in a Camry with your tendies!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with a Camry
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lambo's will break down where as a 99 camry won't
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Well done
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Or catch me outside how bout dat?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d take the 99 Camry if I had a choice
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Camry pretty reliable tho. But get you a Lambo.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. Been trying to find my balls to make a similar move on them.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That Camry is a downright reliable vehicle.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I also drive a toyota camborghini
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Camry's will outperform a lambo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,HEY!!! I drive a 99 Camry!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash me in a lambo how bow dah

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiot

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Camry 3.5 is the way lol  


I'm also holding this bag. 3.5K down atm. DIAMOND HANDS!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$25??  go farther out. like way farther. they say the farther you are the closer you get to the MOON!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you my long lost brother?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, sorry, that would be my fault. You see, I bought in at $23 so it had to immediately drop another dollar as soon as I bought or else my portfolio might be green for a day. Obviously, the universe can’t have that so... here we are. My bad honestly, I should have let you guys know I was buying."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, PLTR has a fk ton of shares. Its market cap is 40 billion despite being 22 a share. Compared to something like Roblox which is 65 and has a market cap of 36 billion. Just be patient and if your’e trying to trade on the short term for Palantir dont"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This one and RKT are so artificially held back it's not even funny. Both have a steady upward Trend overall, but it's frustrating to see it start to go up and then get its legs taken out from it time and time again"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was gonna say, my gram gram rocked a Camry for a good long while. Solid fucking cars."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife’s bf drives a 99 Camry..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Car is bulletproof
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I offered my dad my '08 TL and he refused insisting he loves his '99 Camry.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"U should come and get your wife, we’ve been having sex just for exercise. We call it sexercise. Every night man doing sexercise."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How you gonna afford the gas bro
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't tell if this means long or short on PLTR...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hopefully my wife will finally be in the car with ME instead of her boyfriend
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,pourquoi ne devrais-je pas utiliser des doubles négatifs

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He said please don’t use double negatives in shitty french
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,7 minutes in heaven with PLTR ensues
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro that didn’t explain what specific data you are looking at in this pic that MADE you buy so much...obviously & please go into detail too.
Don’t just say oh it’s cuz the graphed line reached 400. Idk what that means.

Thanks 🍌 🦍"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No Bobbie. John was my half brother. 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh Shitty, France undoubtedly my favorite part of France"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i bought so much because im fucking autistic. someone on here told me this was the way to win my wife back . click the pic and look at the bottom for my position
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s pronounced shitté madamoiselle
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, you’re not a financial advisor. Never mind, good luck fellow moron"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term rkt is a rocket 🚀
Short term may go thru turmoil"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wish was granted several times today...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is one company whose management team **may actually be** on the side of investors. Patience :-)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re not selling CSP for a sub-$22 cost basis, you truly are a smooth brain."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"RH though. 

Wish Fidelity would hurry up with their app game. 

Good luck!  I got a little RKT maybe I should load up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with that battery charge.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying shares for the long term and calls for the short term.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was skiddish. Those 20k share sells every 15 minutes had me sidelined but the RKT holders really don’t flinch. That’s when I said “fuck it”
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"RH to check market, Fidelity to check Gains"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think anyone left in any of the stocks are falling for their (hedge funds) shit anymore
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Rocket Companies themselves make money hands over fist.

I doubt anyone really sells his/her shares at this point. It's not like that stock will crash. So why not just hold and see what happens. Eh."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good to see that at least 0.09%of your portfolio is diversified
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey you got a GuH notification
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,52 million in volume with this result. I can’t believe how shit today was for RKT.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT - we are a guh on launch --

Me - 💎🦍💎 soon 🍌🍌🍌"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I come live with you in your new house?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the last of 0.09% ?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was expecting a slow climb, so I sold some puts with a $26.89 strike. Then the stock jumped and came back down. I got out of the short puts (with a little profit) because this behavior didn't seem right. The stock wants to go higher."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have thrown that at GME lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a distraction from GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meh. Didn't hurt a bit.

I didn't hear no bell!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao how did you lose a house it’s not like it could get up and walk away??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Save ya money🤦🏼‍♂️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT will moon whether it's tomorrow or next week. This is going to be GME #2
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And another RKT.. Take the loss and move on.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Should’ve sold some covered calls when you saw the spike crazy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of people using this as an opportunity to exit from the high price they bought in at.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's says they'll buye the house that I'm looking for
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The crayons are getting to his brain. Who needs reading anyways?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Somehow Vanguard did me a favor today, I had a market sell order I floated early morning that just sort of hung around for an hour somehow and then got filled at 26.85 lol."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you, GME! 💎🙌🚀🌓"

Earnings will be breathtaking!!!!
My non-financial advice would be HODL!!

Currently sit @2500 shares!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m confused, why is there such a high influx of RKT posts this afternoon?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang You’re all in
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Without a “I know I am on Robinhood but plan on moving away” disclosure I simply can’t trust the content of the post

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is an awesome adventure
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"price starting climbing in the morning,

volume was high,

then,

only then,

Morgan Stanley dumped $20m of shares and it came back down, at least from what i understand"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've honestly been just randomly sharing my yolo for the passed couple weeks. Haven't checked here to see rkt spam, my sincerest apologies mate"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yee
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically not, robinhood yes, I still got 258 gamestonks on my etrade ;)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh robinhood is my yeet account, I got a etrade and fidelity for less risky plays, robinhood sounds like the perfect host for such content..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably will run around and desert you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They sent chimps into spess before man
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you mate
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So like the full story with what I've gathered with this ticker, tutes own alot of the shares and have been selling covered calls, then trashing the stock, collecting premiums and then buying back cheap lol hence the consistent ups and downs with this one."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats a good summery of today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No need to apologize, it was a sincere fomo induced question? 😂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn strait they did! We are riding this rocket to the moon! 🚀🌙
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watching the price today, made it look for more then a moment that it was going to have a rise as before. Had a clear look of failed to launch in spite of engine ignition.. or wale splashed the ship."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Disgusting what they continue doing to RKT
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a reason you waited til today to buy it after it shot up if its a “long hold”? buy high sell low
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT to the moon!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rkt was been hyped by CNBC. That says everything
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf did I just look at??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk $RKT monthly looking a little like the challenger disaster. 

Good luck tho."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair value to me is 48$.  This is a steal for long lovers
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,didn't wait till today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,98K of pure $RKT love
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re getting downvoted for being rational. Go figure with these new schmucks on here and their short Gamma reverse squeeze to the Earth’s core bullshit. Followed up by a screenshot of a Robinhood account and 5 sentences that are barely considered a paragraph which they call DD.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That sounds dirty. I'm in.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put a call on it 😬😬
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We can all agree that RKT has been a disappointment but HF's are going to regret shorting this stock to oblivion. This is a solid company with great current earnings and massive future potential..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ugh. Can you go back to r/stocks r/ investing or wherever else with that? Got some DD on an awesome high reward play that doesn’t mean I sit on it for 5 years while it grows with the S&P, then phenomenal. I’ve been making a few hundred dollars every 1-2 weeks by flipping it. But, that’s about it’s potential right now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you seriously just accuse people of writing shitty DDs and then tell them to go back to r/stocks or r/investing? You do realize WSB is meant for memes right?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently there's a lot of people on here that disagree with you. I guess we'll see...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,BB was my safe investment when I entered at 12.40 in Feb. GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't sure if I did the right thing buying 200 more shares of BB, at least I know I'm not the only retard who kept buying the dip."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,May your gains be pornographic
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,1248 shares at $12.06 average. Bought 208 shares at $9.6 this morning. No FUD here. Just pure conviction. It's a matter of time before $BB prints.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoping uncle Chen pulls out a nice juicy hulk dildo for you sir
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is a legit company again after years of languishing while transitioning away from their legacy business. I'm rooting for them and will be buying more at the open! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last guy who YOLOd 6 figures online, did great the next day. So I’m in on BB now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,NOW THIS IS HOW YOU YOLO!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have far less but been holding this one and averaging down for a couple of months. Hope it moves in the right direction after tomorrow report.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding BB for a while, this make me feel better about them."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"GL Boss! if they can show some revenue growth, you will be golden"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,May your gains bless those around you with tendies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I yoloed £1500 I borrowed from the local drug dealer at $16.75. and I never knew what market buy was. I'm here for a green day

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My BB loss makes me PP
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My 3k shares look like an incel's shriveled pepe compared to your 50k hammer.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do I have the feeling we gonna get palantiered?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Niceee another big ape. My 20k shares is looking like it's not enough by the day 😢
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been resting on my 700 shares. Averaged at $12. Gonna drop some more in and make it an even 1,000 tomorrow."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got a feeling you should've short sell/buy put in this case.

GL though. Hope I'm wrong."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is good. 🍀🍀🐝🐝🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 800 shares, sorta wish I bought options cause I feel like this is going tits the wall tomorrow"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I should probably snatch it up when it goes on sale. Stonks almost ALWAYS go down on an earning report because fucking papers hands exist at all levels even when everything sound great.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares will be fine long-term, but you will not see a bump with tomorrow’s earnings."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so hard.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Any estimate on what time the report comes out
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think earnings matter, have you seen Apple?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cant see shit atleast list how big the blocks were by the ticker you smooth brained fuck welcome home

Edit: Retard listened"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TIL I have 4 blocks worth of a penny stock.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Disca is amazing to bounce back like that.  Think it hit bottom guys?  Went from red to Green to red to Green back to red.  Keep getting bought up in dips.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Those the longs in archegos?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hallelujah holler back
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Think they are trying to balance getting back their money.  The stocks is collateral for the margin.  If they hold and wait for the price to settle or go up they lose less.  Some of them are investment banks and if they are long these stocks already why crater the price.  Make sense to take it and hold.   I don't know about GSX and stuff that seems sketchy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/29/business/stock-market-today/how-one-funds-bad-bets-are-sending-shock-waves-through-wall-street

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am getting in on VIAC, see if it bounces back"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m confused on why these hedge fund retards buy these blocks instead of them going on the open market and crashing the stock. Then you could get it cheaper as you buy it back up to the price of the block.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not retail buying, mostly institutional..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Smoothed brain fuck.  I'm still laughing at that.  🤣😅

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Someday you too can be a hedgie.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did Morgan and others unwind the remaining 60b in positions?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not certain it hit bottom, but I took my chance and made the bet. If it goes down anymore, it should only be a little, like today.  DISCA is a great buy imo.  Great financials, 64% profit margin, shark week."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They need extra collateral in the event of a certain firm squeezing
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"cant afford this shit, tldr please"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Live? Omg lol this is a domino effect

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you crash the market too quickly, retail gets scared and you can't take their money anymore"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,yea this is from the continued liquidation of archegos
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the “welcome home” got me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk how fast they would unwind it.  Dumping it too fast craters the price right?  Why didn't they dump slower?  So they have a couple of big banks as their brokers.  Is it first come first serve?  Whoever gets to the bacon first?  Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a free account 😂

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I did a dumb thing today:

I used up all my PDT day trades last Friday, but saw a good opportunity for an SPY put late in the day today. I bought the option, but then realized the expiration date is TODAY!!!

Apparently SPY has more than just weekly options, wow who knew lol. So I decided I'd rather let it expire worthless, if it does expire worthless, it was very exciting to watch in a really weird way.

Turns out, it went ITM! But what ended up happening is that E-TRADE automatically closed my position before I could, I was waiting until the very last minute hoping that it would end OTM and worthless.

So since E-TRADE was the one who made the PDT technically, since they sold it, it appears that I have not been flagged for violating PDT rules.... at least so far. Very interesting, I hope I don't get PDT status, otherwise gonna switch brokerages I think."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,In with you in this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well you said PLTR is a great investment a month ago, so sure... this will definitely work out well"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pleas fly again
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought some esp w cathies space etf coming
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just watch the videos of the successful test launches. It’s awesome, may not be a profitable business for sometime, but the work they’re doing is awesome."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just ask chamath about it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I get this is the first company to offer commercial space flight, but if your tickets are $250k per round trip how many customers are going to pay that?  Would anyone buy it more than once?  

Maybe if they offered the world’s fastest route from NYC to Tokyo on an epic 1 hour flight."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company keeps moving goalposts and does not have a working product or a revenue stream from their primary activity.

2020 flight revenue target: $16 million. Realized: $0

2021 target: $155 million. Realized: $0

The only things they sold so far are t-shirts and mugs and now they are talking about a 🤡 NEW 🤡 spaceship."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right. Please fly.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not 4/1 40c calls? Think of the possible gain!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t get any of this.  My favorite color is red and that’s a whole lot of money. I’m in!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in on this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,In for the ride!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in at $17. Not selling till Branson makes the flight or dies trying.... ha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a rocket but is it the challenger rocket?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the rockets
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can easily trade 5 bucks a day and if shorts have to cover,
it will hit!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made money on pltr 
I sold when it hit my target 
I didn’t say stay married to pltr"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They are gonna charge 250k a ticket
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You realize chamath owns like 15 million shares through the spac that took spce public right? 
Yes he sold some personal shares to fund some of his own margin calls but the spac he used to take spce public still owns 15 million shares of it...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess it depends on how rich you are and how much you liked the experience. 
There are 46.8 millionaires in the world. Lots of possible travelers"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"8,000 customers is 2 billion in revenue......"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you missed the 600 pre sold tickets at 250k? 
They are establishing a foundation of growth and scale before even opening. It’s like an airline getting more slots before opening. Once it opens its to late. Tell me how long it took Amazon to make a profit? Spce will dominate this market and anyone who can afford it will go, only people who still owns it are true believers with 💎🙌 so very limited downside with huge upside potential"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,*pleas
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because risk wise if I am wrong, I have time to wait owning the stock. It’s to much money to lose and if I’m not right tomorrow or this week I know I will be eventually. Everyone who can afford this trip will take it. So it will pop and owning the stock makes sure I don’t miss it by a day. I do think and believe it will pop this week but I can’t propose it happens and losing cash isn’t how I like to roll so having time to wait makes sense for me and my goals"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So jelly
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah musk and space X has the monopoly on those
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure you did. Everyone in wsb times the market perfect. I'm sure in the 3 days this month that it was above $26 you sold. congrats!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i care bout his personal investment only
His personal investment shows his conviction or lack of it 

Not a fruit basket he shares with others"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I imagine space vehicles are much more expensive than air planes. 

How much of that revenue is going to be tied up in maintaining your assets?  

If it’s anything like airlines the margins will be thin."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The challenger was a space ship that blew up
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As soon as I buy I put a sell for an appropriate profit, maybe he does something similar.

Regardless, he posted that right before a 12% run which was just fine, what’s the problem there?

If you hold longer than that then you should know you’ve given him less than a month to determine if it was a good play or not through a down market. Go off I guess."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Grape and water Mellon bro 
If you already own a half watermelon that owns spce you don’t need to keep ur grape when it allows you to keep 3 other water melons going, the guy has a lot of spacs in play and throws around hundreds of millions like we throw around thousands. The $219 million he sold to fund operations was good business considering he still owns $450 million worth through his first spac that started the roller coaster of SPAcs


I’m not a fan of the dude, I’m a fan of making money. The way you make money is look at upside and downside potential. The holders at this price are true believers, only direction left to go is up"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I literally watched it happen live
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"cool man. i'm happy for you and any sell orders you place. get that profit, homie.

that really had nothing to do with what I was talking about though. Generally just pointing out that this guy has 4 posts, 2 are about this (with price points of 34 and 38, which is super scientific) The other 2 were deleted, but one of those was PLTR, which has sucked donkey balls for the past month, despite that 12% 4 day run up that you pointed out."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Feel like space r like the new money grab 

What do you think ?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely it spends on the gig tho 
Huge opportunity is huge reward
Space X is having millionaires pay 55m a seat to the moon. It’s starship can take 10-12 people.
This will carry a lot more with 90 minute flight times at 250k a pop 

I can’t speak to the other names but I see big upside in spce especially if the shorts have to cover"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I meant SPAC

my bad

Do you think that’s a money grab
Seems like a different kind of mutual fund or etf basically : S

But I am retarded I could be wrong"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is dumb as fuck 

I want it to work so bad lmfao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When PLTR jumps to $25 tomorrow...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WSB I REMEMBER!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,OH MY GOURD!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe elon will tweet about karps hair and save your ass
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m jacked to the tits 500 shares and 5 cash secured puts sold. Love pltr
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ape bought the right to buy 1.5 Million worth of $PLTR. Most likely op will get theta banged and the contract values will decay. The vertical spreads of near by options is implying a 10% chance for OP to break even.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope 16k is no big deal because you’re losing it all.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least roll them out, give yourself more time. You’ll lose a few contracts but it’s a short week and your potential gains could be a lot more per contract"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you also learn options today? Welcome aboard comrade.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL. We're to the point where we need a megathread for all the PLTR losses.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been retarded on my plays on PLTR myself I am glad to see someone’s brain is smoother than mine. I decided to stop being overly retarded and just buy 100 shares and forget it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This has a great deal of potential 😅
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some special shit. You - you are SPECIAL.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel good about this one ngl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my fucking god you're retarded. Say hi to theta for me!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this on apha calls years ago. Hopefully satan gives you the same deal he gave me.http://imgur.com/gallery/TBOCXvp   

  plus I got a dope 1 day P/L screenshot out of it. I won't be averaging down options ever again(except 40$ 2023 amd calls). GL"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yolo?

More like premeditated loss."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Genius!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLD!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,True retard would excersize.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta catch em all!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard theta likes retards so you are good
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I’m in."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was going to be hopeless but your average cost is 0.24!!

If it bounces to 22.5 in the morning you have a chance at tendies..

It is still a super dumb play, considering PLTR is dying."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens if you’re otm? I know it’s worthless so do you lose 16k or just the 1k?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why why why
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"sell sell sell man. geez

!Remindme 3 days"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rip
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,For fucks sake man😅🤘
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dear lawd please sell that. Either way kudos on your retardedness. I hope it prints for you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Impressive
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Classic
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,damn I wish u the best
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,losers average losers
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I please have tree fiddy for the bus?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,These will print
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My hero <3
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow PLTR is in max pain mode. Time to buy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro u should get out either way ASAP I know u want a spike happen. But go and and grab closer ITM calls to save ur arse from Theta.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im with you brother

40x PLTR 4/1 30c @ .24 avg. Down 91%"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its certainly not the dumbest play I've ever seen. Godspeed, I hope it works out for you!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Please post a vid on friday please post a vid on friday
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i’d instantly nut
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Agriculture futures next???
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,so… you’re saying there’s a chance?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh fuk didn't realize it was a short week my 200c gme 😭
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,theta will only take half the value away tmrw😅😅😅
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Excersize what?  None of those calls are in the money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye bye 16k
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,all of it lmao. hopefully tmrw will open green and i can sell on the IV spike

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe in you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just thinking about it gets a little pre nut action
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,next move is to corner the soybean market
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You do know they don't have to be ITM to excersize correct? Like I said. True retard thing to do. Yolo.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck bro I hope you don’t lose all that shit. If you wanted to sell it now, who would buy it? Bc the person who would be buying it would still only have three days right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you even unload so many contracts in a short-window? Slam the ask?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d nut for you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,does soybean make for good rabbit feed?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ornamental gourds
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or sell the options. And grab stock. Take the small loss.
But with everything happening marketwise, everything will be tanking."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess that's true, just not really retarded and more insane."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"probably a market maker so they don’t care. i’m betting it will open strong tmrw and i’ll sell on the IV spike, but if not i’m fucked"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Market makers will absorb them.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes..confirmed, got a herd brewing on soybeans now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, theta is going to eat these alive. Maybe next time, roll your options out sooner? Anyway, I've lost waaaay more than this and have a healthy fear of plans not working out, now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re really trying to get out without too bad a loss then trying to sell at the IV spike at maybe an extra $500 or so loss would help your calls to sell?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Im pretty sure he bought those today. Avg cost $0.24
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hes going to wake up tomorrow down 25%
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Weed stocks expiring before 4/20? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Do you even smoke weed bro?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The 10th dip is usually the charm
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I learned the hard way never buy the dip with options. Also do not diamond hand options - set a stop and stick to it.  If the option turns around you can always get back into it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just had a 7 later burrito from Taco Bell that have me diarrhea, it's a sign, it's about to shit the bed!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 merger announcement. Weed day right after that.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gg
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha my average cost is $50/share. I wish I had these prices.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately this can get far worse
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,bro charge your phone lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro this is a long term play . You need not to worry, we haven't federally legalized yet and the merger hasn't happened . I'm holding for at least 3 -5  years. I own shares in both tlry and apha."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You aren’t buying anything on robinhood you dumb fuck
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🦍Strong together 🦍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,#rip.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mindlessly buying dips is something I could never get into. I'm no better than OP, I've lost tons."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm up over a 100% on both of these stocks . I bought back in early December.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still buying the dip on Robinhood?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a noob so take it easy on me but- how tf do stocks expire⁉️⁉️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have learned a good lesson little grasshopper.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is prime Wsb DD
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold their electricity to buy more dips
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless this shit goes up 50-60% by friday this guy is fried
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You sure about that?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No but options do 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, motherfucker."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Care to elaborate then?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RH loans what you buy back to hedge funds.  Any purchase of GME or any other stock doesn’t affect price.  I hate all of you robinhood idiots with a sincere passion.  You’ve had months to move your shit to a real broker and continue to post screenshots in here.  Fuck off.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone’s mad because their meme stocks are red.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you lose money or something
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Vix call options
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"PUTS on NATO, got.it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this falls in the category of realpolitik which is different from discussing domestic politics. You say nothing political here, the risk is there plain and simple"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"In some ways, we are really engineering the tools of damage and allowing them to be taken over by foreign governments that fully intend to abuse them.  It's a huge risk, and we should be more concerned about it.  If governments don't play by the same rule sets, they can't be expected to abide by those same rules, especially when abusing them is a strategic advantage."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Adding to this Russia’s investment in gold with their sovereign fund. Russia would profit from the dollar losing value if such investment was made
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Been thinking the same with large CCP backed companies holding large stake in American Markets and the possibility of selloffs. I think at most 30% drops are possible. It could be mitigated buy telling people it was an economic attack and halt selling to let markets voice back or have american banks pick up the slack. Also concerned about hostile takeovers and foreign interest in certain proprietary technologies. Who knows. We could have been in a Cold/Information War with China for the last 5 years for all we know.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably why they keep threatening to delist chinese stocks. US approach: Let them rig the horse race, we’ll just shoot their horse after it gets out of the gate."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Genuine question because I have no idea how international finance works but if China wanted to crash the US economy couldn't they just call in the billions the US owes them or dump treasury bonds?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where’s Bruce Willis when we need him
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is something that I have worried about for a while, not specifically China, but any country or group with enough money could bring down global markets.  I just cross my fingers and keep playing the game until things look dark, then I keep playing the game, but buy a bunch of physical assets to hedge against currency/market collapses.  There isn't much that me, a poor disabled person can do to impact that situation, so I don't really dwell on it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The worst 'attack' on defense contractors ever would simply be... peace.  Anything else plays right into their profit motive.  Also, given how much of US debt China owns, it would be pretty self-destructive for them to do anything that'd hurt our economy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what will cause the next crash, and it will be blamed on DFV and WSB. Because people will believe anything and you can't imprison anyone from Wallstreet."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cannot stand. Markets are too interconnected. One crashing will lead to the others crashing too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But why would they? If we crash who would buy their cheap plastic shit on Amazon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Also the reverse of this...false flag of international manipulation to cover domestic fuckery
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy more GME, got it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. Doesn’t have to be China, in fact I don’t think they would even make it to my top 5 potential nefarious candidates. It is a huge liability to much, much more than the likes of Citadel. Unfortunately the GME congressional hearing didn’t give me a lot of hope, but I think those are just our “for show” politicians. This cancer has to be cut out of the US financial system."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the god damn truth. its a metric fuck ton more digging for facts and checking sources.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't seem that farfetched, US and other Western powers have been doing it to other countries with blunter instruments (sanctions and state debt) for decades.

What's important about that is that it basically corners us into actually fighting the fight on their terms, because our behavior has blown up the moral high ground we might have won allies to our side with; just as how our torture program torpedoed our human rights bona fides for at least two presidencies.

Thankfully, the solution is similar and relatively easy: put our own bad actors on a leash."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Very interesting. Thanks for the post.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,\*Golden losses for most.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"China’s taking us over anyway, that’s why we gotta squeeze GmE so we can build our own nation state on some island somewhere"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a great point and I really hope some of our leaders can wake up and realize the existential threat presented.  I’m more conservative and don’t believe in a ton of regulations, but where something touches National Security, it requires more scrutiny, beyond question.

Have an award."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For people who are not smarter than a 5th grader, please explain in simple terms."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My feeling is that we are in WW3 but it is not being fault with bombs, tanks, and jets but on the battleground of the stock market and using misinformation, loopholes, politicians, bankers, and fraud. Not sure who the key players are but this seems like a huge event."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me and I agree strongly as there has been claims of cyber attacks and corporate espionage so this wouldn't be a huge leap. You lost me with the complaint at the end. Let apes be apes.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had the same thought in early February when the video of the IBKR guy surfaced. If restricting buying of certain securities was necessary as to not crash the markets, I wondered what malicious actors might be able to do. It could also have been a bunch of bullshit, of course.

I am also worried, although not invested myself, that the most popular alternative asset is effectively controlled by China. Crash the markets, launch 51% attack, gg."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So Hodl?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is so fucking retarded. Just no.... there are so many things to pick apart with this idea.

1. Only authoritarian govs with billionaires could do this. So like china and russia? They both have crazy economic restrictions on them so yeah how would that work? The most recent incident with archegos was with a chinese national bankrupting himself and the underwriters of his leverage reclaiming collateral. How the fuck would someone making terrible plays cause insolvency in defense stonks???????

And just what the fuck makes you think that A) the institutions providing the leverage will allow themselves to be fucked? They are in the business of not getting fucked thats why they are still around. 

My god you are so fucking dumb

Edit: couldnt keep going on points my brain went smooth thinking this through. 
But basically this would be impossible as the domino effect in the US would literally obliterate the world economy. Who is china going to sell to? Where will the europoors invest when they stocks suck and bonds have real negative yields. Plus the stock market is not the economy, if you wanna talk real insolvency risk you gotta look at fixed income. Idiots being idiots in the stock market cannot cause the scenario you are talking about"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although they are nominally communist, fiscally they are certainly not. The CCP does have more control over their myriad of companies compared to the US but those companies are also essential to the Chinese economy, and the economic boom of the chinese economy is essential to the CCP staying in power. Undermining the trust of their own companies and economy in order to land a cheap shot on the US sounds like a losing proposition. Even if things went to plan and crashed the American economy, it would take the entire world's economy with it and instability from economic unrest is the last thing that China wants."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can try to liquidate their t-bills - but they can’t “call in debt”. By trying to dump their t-bills they will reduce their value which will kill the value of the dollar which would kill their trade. This would then drive the cost of imported food through the roof and they’d have an instant famine.

Now China does have a goal to reduce their dependence on exports for their economic well being - they are also investing heavily in Africa. Basically Africa will become to China what China is to the US. When that happens then yes they could dump their T-bills and convince the world to move to a different currency.

You should watch for large military intervention by the Chinese military in Africa as the harbinger of this transition."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly why you should be leery of anyone on reddit saying China is authoritarian but it's not ""an international bully"" like the US.  Yes, i'm being 100% serious, i've seen this touted in numerous places.

It's coming, but China has to have sufficient domestic stability in order to push outward.  People don't seem to understand just how large china is.  China is the same size as the US (roughly) with about 4x the number of people.  Their largest issue is managing the domestic population's base needs.

Once they transform enough external countries into their logistics line, literally **everything** else is in place for China's industry and military to start expanding outward.

Oh look a coup in Myanmar, which China had slowly been losing a foothold in as the country opened up more external relations.  Seems like a great time for China to step in and ""help them out with that""."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes perfect sense. I had a follow up question if you don't mind : if our dept to China is all from t-bonds not loans (which a quick search would suggest your 100% correct about) then why do I hear all over the place that dept to CN makes up a large part of the national dept. Is that a gross mis characterization? Are we late on interest? Or is all the eventual interest added to the debt as soon as they buy it? Thanks for the info either way - Google top results aren't super helpful on the subject

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the problem is key positions in congress are held by loud mouth self serving demagogues. Most of them don’t ask questions to get insights into the matter it’s always some kind of competition to be the center of attention
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol. You think they have “experts” advising them. Mostly, it’s just poorly paid interns who are super young. Congress cut a bunch of staff a while back to try to cut costs and also lost some human capital that way. These people are not geniuses, they are overworked and underpaid (yes, I think raising the wage of a congressman might attract better people), and spend half their time fundraising. I think most Congressmen start out as good people who want to do great things for the country, but get sucked into the institution and all it’s roadblocks. Then, they stay there. Forever."

This country got fucked over by moronic and psychotic politicians being manipulated. We have every right to blame them. They just see it as a way to get power and $$$ and don't give a shit about the damage they do to society. Who else is to blame? They are suppose to be the caretakers of humanity while the populace goes out and does the work required to make it all happen. Instead they fuck us in the ass while we are busy trying to survive from all the insane shit they throw at us.

If anyone is to blame, is is them and the elites. You think the bums, hookers, and drug addicts are to blame? Come on, stop being stupid. They chose to be leaders so they are the ones that take responsibility for failures, of course they don't, but they are suppose to."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"....but what about the server deal from 2014? Had IBM still owned it considering the explosion in cloud it would’ve turned a profit.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have absolutely started expanding it's international influence, they are just allot more subtle about it. Instead of building military bases everywhere they just quietly come in and buy up everything - starting with the politicians. I come into contact with allot of african immigrants and I'm always curious about thier opinion on CN. I would say it's a 50/50 split between hating chinese ""investment"" and thier own government for taking the money"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s still debt - it’s just a government bond - we simply have a special name for it. Bonds are issued by the entity wanting to borrow rather than going to a bank and getting a loan. This makes it easier on the borrower since they don’t have to seek out people willing to hold the debt. Bonds are rated for credit worthiness by “independent” third parties: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/rating

Technically we could go into a long discussion about maturity where China probably holds a selection of short, medium and long term us government bonds which make up the national debt. Technically only the shortest term bonds are t-bills. The others are notes (medium) and bonds (long term). But as far as the financial instrument is concerned they all are bonds.

The deficit goes through a bunch of financial magic by the fed that securitizes the debt which then makes it “go away” through inflating the monetary supply (we call it printing money)."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That definitely used to be the case, but is becoming significantly less so, as they have expanded out so much through the BRI and other investments.  They've taken the tech and built up internally. They've been on this trajectory for a long time, and we ignored it for short term gains. Pretty soon they won't be very dependent on our economy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Their main staffers are definitely not interns. They tend to be extremely skilled people. And they work with experts across a range of fields from private industry to universities. I've been on advisory teams in the past and have been extremely impressed with congressional staffers. You're basically just perpetuating a bunch of assumptions.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you read my post or did you have that rant preprepared?  Most of these politicians are far more capable than they appear in public and lean on the experts on their staff.  They can't all be experts on finance, military, cyber, etc. But they absolutely have experts on such things they work with.

They tend to play it down in public to appear folksy and appeal to the average person to be relatable, but they didn't all get there by accident."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Few things that stop China dead in the water.  First would be food supply.  China isn’t self sustainable in food production.  China depends heavily on US for feeding is crowded population.  At the end of last year China was making record grain purchases from US because no matter how much tech you make, if you don’t have food you will have unrest and death. China was very close to being broken last year due to food and coal shortages.  Second would be that China doesn’t have a free population or free companies so they could be barred from our capital markets.  Also world currency is pegged to US $, Breton woods agreement.  Another consideration would be history in chinas entire history as a civilization they have never been much of an aggressor nation"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will agree that their main staff, like the chief of staff, is, and better be, highly skilled. But the reality is that these people have like 10 staff at the most that have to deal with issues facing their district/state and nation. Their districts are WAY too big (700,000+ per rep, same 435 reps since 1929). The pay is (relatively) not great, half of America hates you, and a lot of the work gets pushed to interns. This is not a stereotype. And of course they work with experts, but don’t most people who have dynamic jobs? I think the original post was about the national security implications of what is happening and how complicated it can be. My point is that Congress had become so out of touch with the world and technology (re: Facebook hearings) that the American people have basically gave up on them, and look to the other two branches to solve problems. I think it’s institutional, not personal. I appreciate the insight, and would be curious your take."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Those aren't really big hurdles at this point.  Food probably being the only substantial one.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Other than that time where they took over most of the known world and completely changed history for all of us.

After that they shrank back and laid dormant until now. Based on current developments we’re looking at two world economies forming - US, EU and associated “first world” - but really just Paris accord countries versus Russia, China, and Africa.

The first group is going to simply tax themselves to death while the later group will feed on the carcasses."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can agree with that to an extent. They have a huge number of challenges and no one can be an expert in all things.  I think the most challenging areas for many of them are technology and emerging fields because they just change too fast for people with divided attention to stay in the know. Regulating the tech field is extremely difficult, and even techies have a hard time staying up to date.

It's also a matter of even finding the experts that both know the field well AND understand policy ramifications enough to translate it to policy makers.  A lot of researchers aren't interested in that side of it, and tend to avoid it.  It's hard to find people that span both worlds and hard for congressional staffers to find those people as well. As with any group, you often turn to those you know first and that can definitely present other problems."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate that. It's unfortunate. I wish people did understand it because we tend to get a really tainted view of politics from soundbites and clips of rare statements on the news and internet. But we should be somewhat happy that we do have so many skilled people in those fields.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Outliers exist in any field.  We just tend to pay attention to the most outrageous.

It is such a demanding job and the rules for elections, fundraising, etc make it exponentially harder to actually do the job. It is easy to say these people are lying morons (some are: like how many Benghazi hearings did we need?) but we have some great people in Congress sucked up by a sometimes archaic system. The speed of change has become so rapid now it leaves us open to potential problems. We need term limits, and expanded House, a larger staff, and campaign finance reform. Should be easy!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Term limits can have their own problems if too short.  But maybe a 20 year max or so.  But it takes time to learn all the things needed to do the job well so too short and you always have people that don't know the ins and outs.

I think the biggest issue is a voting public that has determined rhetoric and pop culture should supersede knowledge and decision making capabilities. We chose to turn it into a popularity contest and sometimes that bites us in the rear."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why the grain tariffs worked well.  But I’m talking about a situation where China was an imminent threat.  If the grain tariffs are upped or held strong China will literally be eating from our palm

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This will be their worst performing ETF. If anyone longs this, enjoy seeing negative returns for a long time."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Might be just me, but this seems like one of her worst etf’s. Also..... I want damn spacex, oh well."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most infuriating thing. Space exploration is a consistent loss leader. It’s nature is to never make profit which is why it should be funded through the government for the good of humanity.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.... not touching this one. Risk/reward is not worth it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does GME count as a space stonk (since it's going to the moon)?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What growth is to be had in space? Nothing up there but a cold vacuum and it's too expensive to get up there anyway. Only thing useful is maybe satellite based internet but spacex is private
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,do they have space x holdings?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Boiler room!!! I guess i dont know what they really do but there mom answers the phone and shes really nice lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the OnlyFans IPO?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Number 2 holding is another Cathy Wood ETF
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So here's exactly my thing, all of their themed ETFs are kind of same-ey. If you want ARK, their highest conviction picks are shared in ARKK. Look at this list, its second biggest holding is literally another ARK ETF, PRNT, and then there's the usual Nvidia, Xilinx, Tencent, Alphabet, Komatsu...Netflix??

Yes, some of those companies will have incidental ties to space. Sure, FPGAs and GPUs will be useful in developing and getting to space. But it doesn't seem so strongly space themed, apart from the rarer entry like Virgin Galactic."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have found my true home here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$69.69 buying first day Cathie will send you feet pics as a bonus.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering this myself. Can't find the opening price anywhere.

Trimble and Komatsu do make sense. Literally anything in the space of satellites, rockets, earth observation/surveillance, even defense would have made sense.

But JD, Alibaba, Meituan etc. make no sense at all.

Since I'm actually bearish about those stocks, they don't even make sense as performance filler for the ETF. I wouldn't be surprised if the momentum stocks will actually hurt the ETF performance in the near future."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is somehow not even in it's top 10 holdings.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God spce has been hurting for so long now. I remember when it was deep in the 50s.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Somebody pointed out in another thread that NVIDIA is basically working at 100% capacity and can't meet current demand. They also won't be able to bring more production capacity online for a few years due to lead times. And even at that point how many chips/cards can they possibly sell to space exploration players? They really only stand to see a couple percentage points of growth potential from the space industry in the medium term and virtually nothing in the short term.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next level growth stocks, nice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When will he learn?!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes even less sense is you commenting that under a link to a video of a badger shoveling coke at a guy's face.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty simple theory to explain JD/Ali/Netflix/etc

In the description it says not just space stocks, but stocks that will benefit from space tech.

Space tech leads to more internet users. More internet users is more money for all the stocks that ""don't make sense"" in this ETF

That said.... I'm a bit disappointed in the holdings. I can make them all make *sense,* but I was looking for a less shitty, ARK-Vetted version of the UFO ETF, AKA something with more pure space exposure."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean Trimble does make sense to be included... but who would ever point out Trimble as the NUMBER ONE most important space exploration company?

I bet this list changes drastically in the coming days or weeks"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah fuck me, I went all in on spce"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. How long and how much money to achieve that goal? Which is why the government should be funding it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When is avatar 2 coming out?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of stuff we use today was developed by nasa in the space race era but it is such a very looooooong term thing. Most companies struggle to stay afloat during that period. Any profits go back in to research and development. The nature of the industry.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,John Deere makes tractor beam technology right?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, have an upvote. Must have misclicked and cited something. It stays!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even so Netflix makes no sense. To single it out out of all companies that would benefit from orbital internet doesn't hold up.

If that were the point; Ark has an ETF based around ""Next generation internet"" companies (ARK-W) so those companies should be the ones that would benefit most, right? Well, on that list Netflix is not #1 but #18..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I was hoping for too, I’m also confused as to why Deere and Workhorse are there as well as their own 3D Printing ETF.

I love Momma Wood and wanted to jump into this but I think I’ll pass unfortunately"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"On Friday $PENN had a volume of 3.53 million. BlackRock (as of Dec 31st) owned 15,401,568 shares. If anything, Blackrock could have liquidate their position in $PENN LAST FRIDAY. Last Friday $PENN had a block transaction of 15,714,164 shares. They could have very possibly bought 300k shares sometime between Dec 31st and March 19th and then sold the position on March 19th."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because all these stocks are unbelievably overweight and they can see a crash coming.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why all these companies are selling everything off. I see they are but can't grasp the reason for it. Thoughts?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they are selling at a high prepping for shit to tank to buy low. Hold some cash folks.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I, too, have a complaint about Portnoy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I just wanted to point this out because FUCK Dave Portnoy. He has been all over Twitter tryna convince his followers to buy the dip on shitty $PENN stock while insiders have been dumping it like their life depends on it. AVOID THIS STOCK LIKE THE PLAGUE. 

This is probably because $PENN owns a 36% stake in barstool."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy puts or no balls
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To say that it’s a Ponzi scheme is dumb. They tied their sails to barstool who’s a huge brand, all while sports gambling is becoming legalized throughout the country. So many states have the barstool sports book app as the top betting app in their state. There’s a reason it ran up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The larger issue with the squeeze is IT WILL PROVE WALL STEEET BETS WAS RIGHT and more than all the filthy cash they stand to loose they also stand to loose the physcological hold they have over the people and the market and that once lost probly cannot BE BOUGHT BACK...Just think about it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would anyone take investing advise from paperhand portnoy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Penn was added to the s and p 500. Pretty sure blackrock liquidations are probably so they don’t overweight the stock
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You realize they just got into the s&p500 right? I don’t think they take “ponzi scheme” companies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"PENN is actually legit.  The growth of PENN and other gaming companies is going to grow substantially. Literally sports gambling is going to get legalized state by state. There’s a lot of big names selling off, it’s no different. Funds sell shit and move money around all them. Moreso with the choppy markets the last couple months. It’s Also a way for the big funds to get in cheaper. PENN will be over 150 in the summer. DKNG over 80, WYNN over 150. CZR over 100. Sir this is a casino you should do your research on the casino and gaming industry"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am extremely bullish on sports gambling long term. But, I cannot for the life of me trust Portnoy. I may buy puts."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it black April people are preparing for? I see YouTube videos being posted that in April a large correction or crash is coming. I'm thinking these institutional elites are prepping for big dip buy that they are creating. Am I just being paranoid?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys buying puts?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Dave portnoy

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When do they update holdings? Would be interesting to confirm this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"interesting i didn't know that, thanks for pointing that out! perhaps it could be other funds liquidating their positions now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"overweight is considered a good thing. you're looking for ""underweight"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Their company is going to need capital to pay some tendies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They want cash to buy GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There was some dumbass that got liquidated for 30 billion this might be a reaction from that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I understand it(and i dont, i really am quite ape) he bet with his own ~$20bn on the stock market, but was given leverage by banks on top(ie they loaned money so he can buy more than his own capital - i think he makes more as a result and the bank get paid more by him? this is the bit i dont really know/get).

But basically banks were giving him about 5x say than he had - so he invested $100bn of the banks' monies alongside his own. He's gone bust - the banks are holding his 'assets'/shares and need to get their $100bn...soon. If its tied up in tumbling stock - they need to sell sooner rather than later or get a worse price. Irony is because the trades and volumes of stock are so huge this leads to massive supply increase without demand and in and of itself causes the stock itself to tumble in price even quicker etc.

I *think* that's sorta what it is - but I'd need someone actually smart and properly in the game to proofread the crap i just wrote and correct it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the thing. They know stuff we don't.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My assumption is that they don't think the recovery is going to be as good as everyone hopes. Lets not forget 18.4% are behind on rent. There is going to be more blood at some point they are just trying to stay ahead of the curve locking in profits. Unfortunately we had our chance to do the same at the beginning of February and instead we have all bought the dip for the last 2 months. Unfortunately I feel like my bag is one of those ones in Harry Potter. I keep putting more money in it but it doesn't get any bigger.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cuz they fucked up back when they bought into Gme amc and others with intentions to short them possibly out of business but it back fired because the retail investors won’t sell so margins being called is inevitable across the board now we have to wait to see who’s phone starts to ring
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro I see what you did there. And I HATE it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well the main purpose of this post wasn't to complain about Portnoy. I personally have no stake in $PENN so I don't really care.. but he is a piece of shit for trying to push the stock on his followers at a time when insiders are selling like crazy and he probably knows it's going down
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And Portnoy got a shitload of PENN shares in the sale.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly why
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i didnt think i needed to explain that lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I personally wouldn’t touch this stock with a 10 foot pole. Portnoy is definitely a piece of shit. But $PENN is evidence in and of itself that the stock market is a casino, and the house always wins. No other stock would manage to enter the S&P with such shitty financials... definitely some shady shit going on. Bet at your own risk."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock ran up 1500% while the company had its worst year of earnings (net income down 1600%). I think there might be a slight chance they're overestimating the impact of Barstool (which they don't even fully own, btw)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been trying to say this for a while.

This isn't a fight for your tendies so to speak. This is a fight to preserve an industry that has told you for decades that you don't understand the markets, let us do it for you.

Hedge fund managers have been taking home hundreds of millions of dollars a year for year and years and years. Retail investors are increasingly younger, understand technology and that they can do it themselves without paying someone to do it. Retail investors will eclipse fund investors very soon."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">physcological

Was that really your best effort?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That literally makes no sense lmao
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That was a questionable decision to say the least. I have a feeling it was very political or perhaps a shot to get retail to buy in while hedgies/institutions dumped their shares. But to add a company to the S&P when they’re not even profitable brings up a lot of red flags. Even TSLA was profitable when they were added to the S&P... and have significantly higher growth potential than this shitty casino company which doesn’t even come close to dominating in its industry.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed. I'm holding a ton of garbage...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The recent liquidations has nothing to do with GME and AMC as far as I am aware. They were 5x leveraged on GSX and when that started to go downhill they were forced to sell their other positions to cover their loses and the chain reaction of selling to cover losses and having their positions fall even more led to a margin call forcing them to liquidate everything
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. I'm holding both and get how the shorts work, just seeing it actually play out is fascinating. Glad someone is calling them out."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a retard but: Blackrock is the biggest holder of GME shares, and vanguard one of the biggest. If they did any shorting on GME, it is only a small amount to hedge. But the reality is that if GME goes up, they are making a shit load of money just like us."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I’ve been following King Autist Burry’s comments about index funds, and security analysis. I personally think he’s taking a short position on passive index funds like S&P for this reason. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to add this to the S&P at its current state, and wouldn’t be shocked if there were a back room deal."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well it does make sense that they are in need of capital to potentially close short positions, which may include GME, among many others. Certainly indicative of a big event that is about to happen, but any guess is a good one at this point."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, I love the stock too, but not everything is “because GameStop”"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason it liquidated was because it failed...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, as much as I wish they were liquidating to buy GME (I have a call), I don't think this is the case."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So explain the etfs?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Source?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I thought it was a reference to Mr. Portnoy's (Dave's dad) complaint segment on PMT. Now I see where they got that from.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. If shit did makes sense and stocks were trading at their fair value then $PENN would be worth $40/share right now at most.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It did.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,so they liquidated their entire position because it was being added to the S&P?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Any day now these stocks are going to get type 2 diabetes and start having heart attacks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Blackrock is long gme. They hold a massive amount of the float.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im speculating that there’s really only gigantic sells offs like this because they know something is coming. Maybe they did share recalls on all those over leveraged HFs to collect their shares, make tendies and set up for something else. 

Blackrock said “you really wanna fuck around?” Packed their shit up and about to watch this place burn. 

If it was blackrock, why? Only reason I can think of is shit is hitting the fan and they are taking profits now, will wait for things to rock bottom and swoop up new lows

Edit honestly I’m grabbing popcorn now. This could be quite the show. Regardless of who it was, all that was needed was one margin call. There just needed to be one person who said enough is enough. I hope it keeps going"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you even know who BlackRock and Vanguard are? They are not in the business of shorting companies. If either are going to take a side on this trade it will be long GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Right still nothing will explain the russel 2000 and the 30+ others that contain amc Gme that haven’t gone up in many weeks...safe to say the same day all this gets sorted the etfs will recover and that but of shady fuxkshit will not be forgiven...so I’ll ask again what about the et fucking fs my friend
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I don’t understand the background behind PENN and the portnoy relationship. Why do you hate this shitty stock so much?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its probably normal re-balancing. Shockingly firms like Blackrock aren't emotionally attached to assets like PENN. If their position grew too much they probably shed a portion to fit their allocation strategy. This doesn't mean ""run for the hills"", it means they were too heavy in one particular position. This also doesn't mean Blackrock doesn't like PENN. They could just be cashing out their gains and looking for other entry points down the road. Nowhere does any of this action indicate PENN was a ponzi scheme"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that to Tesla
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The topic of the recent liquidation of Archegos capital has nothing to do with GME. Whatever is happening with the ETFs is not related to what is happening with Archegos.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the entire market goes down or gets volatile, naturally all the stocks become volatile as well. That is the only \*known\* correlation between the liquidations and GME- its the same as the correlation between GME and the rest of the market. By relation I mean direct connection: There is a direct connection between the liquidations and the price action of VIAC or DISCA since those are the stocks being liquidated and sold in large blocks. I have yet to hear a credible rumor or see evidence that the liquidations of Archegos \*directly\* impacted GME.

Your original statement claiming that Archegos Capital had short positions has no backing, therefore I said Archegos Capital has no relation with GME."

Until it actually has space innovators, hard pass."

1. 3D printing allows creative shapes and flexible components to be produced for space rockets, satellites etc. (just as an example check the NanoDi patented tech).

2. Once in space or in another planet you are not going to build a manufacture to produce or replace your parts. Instead a more compact 3D printing machine will do just fine.

More competent engineers could elaborate further but I hope I have explained the basics."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You know there's been huge 3D printing competitions for in situ resource utilization on both the moon and Mars right? Even with launch costs getting lower & lower we can't bring everything we need to establish a persistent presence.

Right now the hotness is Starlink & who the fuck can bring any sorta competition to SpaceX in regards to launch providers and satellite constellation services.

This actually happened with Kidder Peabody and led to the end of the firm.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,that's fucking beautiful
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Investment banks have developed a way of creating a zero-coupon bond, called a strip, from a coupon-bearing Treasury bond by selling each of the cash flows underlying the coupon-bearing bond as a separate security. Joseph Jett, a trader working for Kidder Peabody, had a relatively simple trading strategy. He would buy strips and sell them in the forward market. The forward price of a security providing no income is always higher than the spot price. Suppose, for example, that the 3-month interest rate is 4% per annum and the spot price of a strip is $70. The 3-month forward price of the strip is 70e^(0.04 * 3/12) = $70.70. Kidder Peabody’s computer system reported a profit on each of Jett’s trades equal to the excess of the forward price over the spot price ($0.70 in our example). In fact, this profit was nothing more than the cost of financing the purchase of the strip. But, by rolling his contracts forward, Jett was able to prevent this cost from accruing to him. The result was that the system reported a profit of $100 million on Jett’s trading (and Jett received a big bonus) when in fact there was a loss in the region of $350 million. This shows that even large financial institutions can get relatively simple things wrong!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So the margin called hedge fund was holding RKT?  RKT was up 14% this morning. Are they getting margin called for a different position?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. Thank you for the explanation. Just a smooth brained ape
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh was up 10% today jus saying was a huge huge smash down..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is what limit orders are for. 

If you go ahead and setup your ""10% gains"" orders as limit orders (or whatever percentage you're content with), then if it spikes while you're at work, it'll sell it for you, so you don't miss out. I actually did that on RKT today, funny enough. Been sitting on calls for 3 weeks, at -$800 the whole time...today they barely scraped the line of +$250 this morning as I watched it climb and I was like ""Okay, go ahead and setup a limit order, so that if this dings +$500, I can go ahead and get rid of these."" 

Lo-and-behold, while I was focused on work, it just barely pinged +$500 profit. It triggered my limit order, and then 5 minutes later, RKT started heading back down. It happened fast enough that even if I were watching it, I probably wouldn't have gotten the order price picked and setup quickly enough to sell it at that price. 

Could it have mooned higher and I would've missed out? Yup...but I was content with $500"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It plunged shortly after, so you’d have to have a lot go right."

>Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It closed $145 billion in loans in 2019 and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion.

>  
>""That’s a lot easier to do when you’re a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and software people.""

They're buying back because shorters are suppressing the stock price, most likely because people have bought so many calls on the company that they push the price down so the calls expire worthless. Also may be competitors or the big banks since they don't want RKT to grow and eat their lunch. Who knows."

That jump up to 27’s this morning was buying by MMs for hedging all those calls at 25’s+. So...now she’ll poke around some more back to sub 10M volume.

From what I read, they had taken a lot of leveraged risk and completely screwed up their hedge.  Like, pathetically so.  Their 9 biggest positions in a highly concentrated portfolio moved downward together Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  

Remains to be seen for sure, but it appears they were using statistical modeling to determine those stocks had very low beta based solely on history.  That was likely true, but only empirically and historically.  There was nothing intrinsically inversely correlating any of them them that would prevent them from moving downward together - and so eventually they did."

What are the odds RKT used some or all of their billion dollar buy back (I'm too busy to crunch numbers right now) to collect this block due to the extreme dislike of short sellers? Is that even a possibility without a filing or is this a special case where that might be an available option without a ton of previous notice?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, what is that hack edit job in the last 'screenshot'"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason this sells at a premium is because anyone who wanted to buy this many shares would be driving the price up as they did it so to lock in all of those shares at only 5% of market is great. without that dynamic you can never sell for a premium because people will buy on the open market. Thank you for the upvote in advance.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This will mean nothing when RKT is at $50+ in the summer. Morgan Stanley is an irrelevant.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been making a killing on rkt puts. I didn’t know why the stock was nose diving daily, but this explains a lot. 

Some people might think that because Morgan Stanley dumped all those shares that RKT is a bad buy. The fact they sold for 25.25 is huge. How did they sell shares at 25.25 when it’s barely been above  25? The news is breaking today, but When did they do it?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Or shorts can buy it and cover

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Archegos got margin called so the banks are liquidating their holdings to keep from bigger losses.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They mean the only reason someone would buy it at a premium like that is because they anticipate shorts exiting positions, thus initiating a squeeze, and bringing the stock to its fair value."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they didn’t buy from a block, then they would be buying on market, buying this many shares in market, would itself initiate a squeeze, meaning the squeeze would be in full swing before they even had a chance to accumulate all the shares they want, raising cost basis and lowering potential profits"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You buy the shares and then call them back from the broker. It’s what Burry did with his GME shares
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The block would not cause the squeeze it is the opposite, dropping 20M shares would tank the price.

Essentially someone has been willing to pay 26$ per share when it currently trades at 24$ to make sure a squeeze can still happen."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,FMV for rkt is around $35 as a mortgage it would much higher as a fintech most people see it being at $35 so I’d adjust your spread to account for that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not likely that they would buy back above $22
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My math puts the total at $505M.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly. Exercising a large buyback opportunity on the open market would not benefit them the way that making this block purchase would. They are already partners with Morgan Stanley so that phone call going to Jay Farner first would make a whole lotta sense
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If someone bought 20 million rkt shares on market it would cause the price to sky rocket and they would not get every share at $25. They would definitely pay 30 or more for some of the shares
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"they haven't sold yet, they are asking for $25.25/share. And when they sell it will be a private exchange, won't show up in the market data"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh man I hope $40ish end of thursday.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless they know something we don’t. Could be some shorts covering sometime this week and then they will put the block shares out to be bought
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone gets it troll. Doesn’t make it a good trade though.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[RKT was at 30%-40% last friday](https://preview.redd.it/vk8wiusi8bp61.png?width=1739&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fcbf7acdbdb1f350f2e195ca8c46183a351c2de). couldnt find GME i think was it was hovering at 20% from a post i saw
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Morgan Stanley is an investment bank. Allegedly they, among others, margin called Archegos and are selling assets to stop losses. Who knows if these are all shares from that as there's speculation they might have also exited any positions as well."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,there are not enough buyers at this price point - if you dump it then most of the shares you sell would be sold at a very low price. This is why MS isn't selling on the open market
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,😬
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"1 million in an hour made it jump 7% just last week. There's no way to sell 20m at 5% shit would drop every 20k you sell. Are you an actual retard?

Don't answer it's rhetorical. We know you are."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,From what I understand this is a long hold and since shorts could have possibly got out and we won’t see any sexy price action.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well gme and amc are up next. Gonna follow this one closely
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel That’s what they want you to think. I think they’re liquidating in preparation for bankruptcy and using archegos as a scapegoat for all the sus shit they’re pulling in the 11th hour
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean margin called in thus circumstance. That they were one sided and had to pay up?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so more speculative and less mechanical - thank you!

Would selling in a block like this trigger some sort of need to 'find the shares' to facilitate the transaction? Or is it basically just numbers at this point and if it goes FTD, everyone shrugs and the world moves on?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant shorts buy it to exit their position?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's my point though; because this isn't being bought on market, what would generate buying pressure for a squeeze?"

Essentially."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don’t need to find shares because MS has the 20 million shares on hand, they aren’t buying over the market. 

The entity buying at this premium is buying speculatively that either 1. Rkt is very undervalues, or 2. They can make back the premium and then some if a short squeeze were to occur by selling only a percentage of the shares they have on hand"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,MS already have the shares - they recovered it from the margin call
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but why would they? It’s selling above market value. They would lose money, especially if they entered below 25"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"you buy the 20M shares at 25 off market, then you start buying on market until it goes above your cost basis, or push it way up into the 30s,40s,50s,60s etc, then sell a portion of the 20M you bought off for a large profit, and hold the rest long term for basically free.

Basically if you thought the stock was worth a lot more, or that you could push it higher with little effort cause of the low float, then you could make good money with the 20m purchase off market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"what if the price is rather ""arbitrary"" b/c it appears to be close to ATM lately so they just want to get what they can get while the going is good so to speak..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyday that the price is above the price that shorts entered their position, they pay interest on those shares, if the price doesn’t drop over time, then they hemorrhage money to maintain their positions or they exit and take their loses. All it takes is one catalyst to spur a short covering."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Foursies. Don't forget me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless they are trying to trigger a short squeeze to get the price of RKT higher so they can sell the shares. They are trying to get cash quick so if they can get the price at $25.25 or higher they should have no problem finding a buyer

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Data I have seen in show that invesco is the largest instiutional investor with 10 m in shares. So where is MSgetiting 20m?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,MS didn't recover it from a margin call... they've always had the shares as the shares were part of a swap agreement.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk I’m still a noob but my brain tells me if they exit their position by buying shares on the market it would drive the price up. If they exit their position thru this block or some of their position it keeps the price static.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"if they have a short position bigger than the block, exiting it would make the price go up way beyond the premium."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Well said!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're ignoring the question. The sale and purchase of this block is done off exchange, so it has no effect on the price when it executes. It does put slight upward pressure because it's being offered over market value (as opposed to being below market value it would cause a drop).

If $RKT is at all primed for a short squeeze, the larger shorts would utilize this block to exit and kill the squeeze. The only thing bullish about this is that would allow for more natural price discovery, IF the shorts stay out. The more likely scenario is they wait for RKT to climb up near $30 and then short it down again."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It was dilutive regardless of how you look at it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes that’s true, but then they would lose the difference between the purchase price and what they bough, and al the interest accrued by maintaining the position"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would they utilize this block? It’s selling at a premium, if they took out any of their positions before $25, they would be buying it to secure a loss. That’s not what they want and I doubt they would.

If they’re actually anticipating a squeeze, they might use it to potentially cap losses, but they’d probably rather wait the volatility out and slowly cover if/when it drops."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me feel a whole lot better thank you sir
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you still got 160+ you will be alright. Easy to get them back. Stay strong bro don’t let your self down
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well think on the bright side. You no longer have to worry about loosing money now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,is that $200 positive?  or $200k negative?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fappability: high
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Stay strong brother. I’ve nuked my account 3 times now. Just gotta get hot again
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Friday 0DTE lottos. The ultimate addiction
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. 50k to 5k on one tsla overnight. 50k to 6k on blnk. Both were Thursday with 0 dte
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tsla 3/19 $670s two weeks ago on Thursday. Bought at $665, closed -15k at $653. Friday morning gapped down to $630. -90%"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You are beyond braindead. Welcome to the club!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just out of curiosity, how big of a hit is this to you overall?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Account is now at 15k. Was at 185k feb 10. So down a little over 90% from ATH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he's asking basically if this is your retirement money or your I'm so rich I can throw away $160k money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not rich. Started at 25k which was most of my savings. So yes, definitely could use 150k"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this begs the question, why the fuck would you gamble on 0dte if that was all your money?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,he didn't get from 25k to 150k by playing safe.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because imagine if they hit...🚀🚀🚀🌕
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk bro I did it too. Smooth brained ape want big boy money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. How else do you take 25k that high in a month?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dude, you may have a gambling problem"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the answer
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the first glance, I thought the price went up to $324"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You're not a real ape until you hold through a 30% loss.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Technically breaking the rules with not even a 1% gain/loss.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No pos, guau!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great consolidation from gme/amc today. I am thinking they will ladder attack after one of the alleged catalysts this week, boomer hedgie logic."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make sure you have stock lending option off bro, or else your shares will be used for shorts."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Calm down with your tiny ass gain. Post when you are up or down bigly

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bravo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,UPC 🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one wants to say anything about op saying amc, but he bought GME? True retard"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Impressive
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,dude get in on viacomcbs. im selling covered calls on that 200% iv jesussss
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did. That was scary, and I made it out the other end (only down 8% now). 


The *real* apes will hold through a 3000% profit on the way to the moon."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently GME is exempt to all rules so who cares.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ape

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 10 after your last DD, down 5% but your logic is sound. Always bet on companies that help people."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they’ve had a wonderful year in terms of stock price up 390% I wish I had about ten of these to work with ... some great stuff you have here sir
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wondering why we’re still getting dicced in the market, down and down. But I still bought more"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD. Gracias
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,—
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid work. We are getting punished right now and that’s right off of astoundingly good news from R&D day last week. Classic case of good news tanking for consolidation right before an aggressive move upward. I wish I had more spare cash to throw at it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 50 shares at like $4 because of a wsb dd last year. Sad I didn't put in more
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Take my money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus great work here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more on the dip today averaged up.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"IONS just came out with their HAE drug meeting the endpoints for phase 2 . However, I don’t think that we should be overly concerned. Its also administered with injections and final approval is at least 1 year away. Your thoughts anybody?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Added more today. Very confident in BCRX
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God like
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding tilray at a pretty high price but I’m certain the merger will benefit me long term
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s get high together
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Under most circumstances, the stock of the company doing the buying/consolidating goes down and the company that gets bought out goes up

Source: pretty much every M&A"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weed will never be decriminalized, let alone legal, in Indiana. Shit, we couldn't buy alcohol on Sundays until 2018. The prison system and pharma are dug in so deep here, its a legit racket. I wish we'd go green but I can see IN being a bitch about it even if it was legalized federally. As a regular consumer for physical and mental relief, it fuckin sucks. Ill still buy more share of YOLO though."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The SAFE banking act won't change anything about the state line laws. Cannabis still will have to be grown and sold in each state not crossing lines. That's why MSO'S have an advantage. They have a huge head start setting up in each individual state they sell in. Canadian companies have to either buy existing probably smaller MSO'S at a premium or build from the ground up in each individual state. Not saying it can't happen. Just saying it's going to take huge capital to do that. Only 2 I think could afford it and Tilray is not one of them. Constellation owns a big chunk of Canapy Growth so they have the money to grow in the US. The other is Cronos which is backed by Altria (Phillip Morris). Those 2 have the capital. Other than those 2 the 4 major MSO'S ( CURLF , GTBIF , TCNNF , CRLBF) are growing fast. Trulieve will probably end up merging because as you mentioned they are a one state operator. The other 3 are positioned all over the Country. It's complicated but small steps like the SAFE banking act really do help the MSO'S while keeping the Canadian companies from expanding into the US easily. Not that they couldn't do it but it be extremely expensive and most like Tilray would over extend themselves from not having enough capital without a major backer like the 2 I mentioned."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, eventually"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They haven't been able to sell a single gram or drink (SweetWater) into one of the largest marijuana markets in the world. They've built a massive beautiful cake, they are just waiting to plaster icing all over it with US tendies. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a FD play. It's a buy and hold until you see ""marijuana is legal!"" As a headline play."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will come one day. Probably not soon for you though, but one day!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that as non-legal states see the tax revenue from neighboring states, they'll wise up and want in on the action too. There are some pretty conservative states that have already legalized it to varying extents."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're clearly undereducated on the subject, bud. 

Even ShitDial has over 500m in cash, and they are the worst LP. 

Also, no one said SAFE would do anything for state lines. Please use your reading, comprehension, and grammar skills next time you comment. Jesus."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy MSO's
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lfg
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy MSO's? You're paying more for less with LPs
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I really fuckin hope. Its a damn travesty I can't even get a medical card and risk being arrested for a natural stress/pain relief that benefits me more than the poison pills the VA wants to give me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats more than Tilray has in cash!! And 500 million won't buy shit as far as an MSO. Canapy Growth has a deal to buy Acreage Holdings if federal legalization happens. They are a small MSO that did 30 million last quarter.  The deal is for 4.3 billion. That's my point. To buy into this market will cost huge money. Something Tilray does not have.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have MSOs. 4front is my biggest.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear ya man. Former EOD here. The VA is a joke.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"After the merger with APHA, the (new combined) TLRY is expected to have $456 million cash on hand, plus the combined assets of both companies including the quickly-expanding number of contracts TLRY has inked with Germany, Portugal, Spain, France, and the UK.

I get that you’re a TLRY/APHA hater, it’s pretty clear because you’re intentionally ignoring the biggest cannabis sector merger ever that’s happening in three weeks or so, so I’m pretty dismissive of your points."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, the VA can suck my hairy ass balls."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with ya. The worlds a lot bigger than the U.S.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly thats less than 500 million no? If the acquisition of a small MSO cost CGC 4.3 billion than 500 million or excuse me 400 something million won't buy Tilray much. I'm not hating. Just talking about realistic entry without allowing companies like Tilray to export their product from Canada to the US is not going to be so easy. They have to move operations here not using Canadian supply or aquire at a high price tag in the multi billions which as you just stated they don't have. MSO'S are already set up and rapidly growing.Just sayin.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, do you! Good luck."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep buying the dip but It keep dipping.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well one man's PLTR is another's SNDL 
I to have stockhold syndrome.  My support group meets every Tuesday for tacos ."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well on the bright side none of those will expire worthless lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A long term investment is just a short term one that went wrong
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know the feeling, bought at 29, bought at 24, bought at 22"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the OP Cathie Wood?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate pltr so much yet I keep buying
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,#lol.  Why didn't you buy at under $10? 😎
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you even buy a 2.5C. (Judging by your losses you picked it up when the stock was north of $25 a share.)

Youre just asking to get triple fucked by the bid/ask at opening and closing, and by whatever theta is there. Just buy shares lmao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in at $28 thinking that was an absolute steal. But the market was like ""Hold my beer""

That's what I get for investing what I was willing to invest all at once. Good news is this company should be around for a while."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I should help everyone out and sell my 145 @$24 PLTR? Then it will definitely go up immediately to $50
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At least one of them is up 36$ :)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr.....the dip never ends.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started buying JAN’23 $30 when it was low 30s. 

Printed nice tendies when it hit 45, thought I was going to retire end of the year, than I went all in at more or less $38 (thought I was buying a dip...)

Needles to say that since then, I’ve been working out more, drinking game went up as well. 

I’ve been “buying dips” since then, like you. I trust this company, but it is hard, being down 40% after hitting a 10-bagger in January with GME... but yeah, PLTR is a long-term holding."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you been copying my trades?! Geez. At least my average stock price is finally getting lower.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I got 500 shares and 399 4/1 25c... so yea I’m buying the dip right there with you... I hope we can bump this up a few bucks tomorrow... lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip today... like I did last week... and the week before... PLTR is that toxic ex I just can't stop thinking about
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The moment that company partnered with ibm is where the fall began. Any company that partners with ibm is doomed to fail. Source I work at IBM and it's literally the worst ran company I have ever seen.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re leveraged to the tits. Keep it up
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel slightly less retarded now thank you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bagholders united in here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying. That is what I'm doing 🤣
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm stretched to the Gills on PLTR!
I'm Hocking my grandmother 
so I can buy more, sorry granny.. 🐂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait is that 2.5$ strike call option?? why??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehh discounts for me, waiting on some funds to clear to buy more"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you my calls spanked me.


364 shzres @24.04

40x PLTR 4/1 30c....  down  $893  (91%)

Holding to zero baby!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold on Feb 8th bought March 5th and sold again on March 10 I regret nothing
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Either you buy the dip or the dip buys you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see post explaining that the shorts will have to buy to cover calls, and the price will go to the moon. What I experience is price will drop to take me out of the money, deadline passes, it drops to keep me out of money on the new deadline, and repeat. Good thing I own shares, so eventually I will win."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr gang here too.  Seems like no matter how much Cathie buys it can't keep it from going down.  😳
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put my hand up on your hip, when i dip you dip we dip"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,“Hurt me daddy” lmao glad I zoomed in for the full pic
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your $17.5 strike leap is red?  Lol.  IV is a biatch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this shit actually ever gonna pop?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought some mo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got some calls too, was thinking they would perform well with all of their news of working with the gov, but now all I see is red 🥲"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m here with you, 36 call contracts kept avg down until my knees buckled 

Wtf I no longer like the stock 😭"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,had a really good laugh. Hindsight is 20/20 but really good luck OP!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold PLTR today. I will buy back in when it reaches $10.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Definition of buying the dick instead of a dip
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't talk myself into investing into a company where management is cashing out.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir is a shit face company with a soy boy CEO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some of this stuff by accident, punched in the wrong ticker and the other thing was about the same price.  Been itching to unload it since and break-even keeps getting loftier and loftier."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My pltr puts do be lookin spicy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Quit buying the dip monkeys 🐒 😂🤣😂 are you that autistic
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At least yours are all leaps. you'll be fine lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"they meant shares, but leaps still got some time"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This stonk has such a high volume , why is the stonk not moving at all ?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you buying $17.5 call? is it cheaper?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Story of my life lately. Waiting for the tendies by EOY. Time to sell some premiums.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm so happy I sold when it was around $38. I thought I had the patience but nope, I didn't."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the stock u should keep buying..I know that!...But I have no position in this ever since I profited from months ago when this thing hit $33ish for the first time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh hurt me daddy is where I lost it too man.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m afraid to buy into PLTR right now. Support is questionable down here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is me , but I’m buying the stocks. Every day I see red!! I love red!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even as retarded as I am, I know they're talking about the actual securities when they say that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its actually  21.66 now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the dip that never eeeends, yes it goes on and on my frieeeends."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip even though everywhere you look it literally says sell...lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, ummmmm, you don't have any exit strategy when you get into options?  Like a falling dagger catch at -5% and -12.5% or something then look for a better entry point either later or somewhere else?

I am new to /r/wallstreetbets, but have been generally successful with options.  Is this just not fashionable here or is there a reason?  What is the overall strategy?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a good buy where it currently sits?  I don’t know much about this company. If Cathy put some money in it she must see it’s long term value. What’s it’s deal?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🤙🏽🦍🌙
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I cant believe i actually timed my exit pretty good. Havent been in PLTR since 34$
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guh, how can you cut me so deep even though you never met me?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If your buying PLTR above $23 something is wrong with you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao now you the long term investor 👋😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a YOLNOOOO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can relate
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I though they secure a big deal from amazon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to learn and its a huge uphill battle. What does the picture mean with the call in red and dates? First one says PTLR $12 call 6/18 exp - 1 buy. I don't get that. I trying to make sense of it. Does it mean on May 18th he buys 1 stock if its 12 dollars?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"can someone explain what I'm looking at?
it looks fine, right? calls of 12$ in June. what's extra 12 is profit?
also what are those random $values?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This needs a meme.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhh... me too , and I bought on momentum too... all the way up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, hate to see it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like tacos
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you do that remind me thing so I can come back from tendie town and pay homage to you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy stonks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Picked up a whole mess of PLTR hoping to unload same day. Didn't work out so hot. Now I'm stuck selling covered calls
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"$NOK $NOK, who's there? A long term investment."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally made me almost piss myself laughing. Truer words have not been spoken.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Too real lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you beautiful bastard. I’m fucking crying right now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Leave tankergang out of this

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m getting margin called on my 400 shares - to the tune of $50!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is genius.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Judging by your tone this was a bad idea?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did anyone think a $50bn valuation was a steal?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in at 28.08 after buying dip after dip after dip.  Fuck me!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please do it, save us"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I already tried selling some covered calls to force a reversal but now I'm just profitable on those and my shares are even lower!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The first stock to go negative
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,True story
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this is wonkavision - the never ending dip bop a tropolis - i present to your PLTR - AND GOOD DAY SIR

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"....or this helps IBM not be so shitty. Hmmm, what do you think?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The Palantirian force is strong in here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it literally can’t go tits up
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Slap my ass and call me Sally!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I maybe regreting fact that I didn't buy more
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino so not until you sell for a loss."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you sell it will lol

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and obligatory fuck you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,heh heh me too. then i got dumb and bought back in at $24....ugh!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m scared too...daddy Karp please don’t hurt me anymore
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it is
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh that little guy up there? Don’t worry about that.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My strategy is hold until I’m at the point where I would lose my overall initial investment on my portfolio.  This is around $17 for Palantir.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at my buys. I’m going out on a limb here but I think you’re asking the wrong guy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. Source: me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The 12c call number is the strike price (call=betting the underlying share price goes up).  The date is when the contract expires.  If Palantir is below $21.98 share price (the call contracts breakeven) then the contract and my tendies will all be worth $0.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your on wsb, we do not know what market cap is. Do you think 28$ is a lot of money? No = Cheap = buy. Yes = expensive = sell. Not sure? Hold."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you see, this is a company that has to send a team of expert engineers to stay on site, long term, for every single new contract it gets, which means it has to constantly hire and train extremely highly qualified engineers in a market where engineers are already in short supply, so to retain those engineers it has to pay them a shitload of stocks as compensation, so much so that PLTR can't even make a penny of profit despite those billions dollar contracts and may possibly never scale like a traditional tech company, all the while the stock based compensation continuously dilutes the value of shares held by investors.

TLDR all of the above which means... stonks go up!!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm yeah, that cuts real deep :') But I'll be back to buy the dip tomorrow :')"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doubtful. The IBM way Is to partner or outright buy a company tell them do things your way because it's working and then proceed to absolutely decimate how the profitable company runs with an audacious amount of ibm paperwork bloat that slows literally every department to a crawl. And then proceed to layoff half the company and complain it's not running as profitable as it used to and work isn't getting done fast enough. 

Wrap this around your head. For 1 task at my job I have to create 11 tickets. 11. Yeah not a typo. Prior to ibm buying us I needed 1 ticket to do the exact same thing and it would take me about an hour. Now it takes me 9. Just because paperwork."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sadly my calls expire in May, I’m in for earnings by force not by choice 

But the dip never stops if I bought shares I would’ve been better off just selling calls instead"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If its any consolation I had 40cs that would've netted me a pretty penny and then 1/28 happened. Expired worthless.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But thats not the only thing...i bought the dip at 21.44 and sold at 21.66 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense.  At least you have a strategy.  Reading your post I was worried.

15-17 dollars seems like a solid entry point on PLTR, though.  I had limit buys for a couple lots at 18.5 for several weeks.  Never got that low when I was watching."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's alright no one knows how low these stocks dip, sometimes you have to look at the charts and see whats the lowest it has been,  right all stocks are dipping. It a great time to buy but you have to buy at the absolute low. Eventually the stock will double. Hold I'm in this with you! Remember this."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You basically paid a 10% fee for 10% more leverage. (Feel free to correct with the actual numbers at the time you opened the trade) and you're pretty much locked into the trade now since you will take a haircut getting out, so the lower theta decay doesn't really matter.



>If it hits $35 these will all print more then shares would 

If by ""print"" you mean instead of making $10 you would make $12, minus the $1.50 you lost getting into and out of the position, then yes. And if it drops then you also lose the difference, minus the $1.50 from getting in and out.

At that point the single-digit increase in leverage isn't even worth thinking about"

They also have no clue what they're doing. I was called into a meeting with the ""web architect"" of the parent institution after I floated an idea on an interim solution to get our current website served under their domain (e.g. www.parent.edu/child). This guy starts the meeting by boasting about his decades of backend web experience and then proceeds to screen share and load up baby's first introduction to the wrong technology, reading off each bullet point and telling me why he thinks it's a bad idea. He wouldn't let me stop him so I let him go for half an hour before embarrassing him in front of a project manager.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much love. Waiting to see where this goes by the end of next week -- just ahead of the ""Double-click"" event coming on the 14th. Nothing too revelatory, but it's more marketing than anything. It's supposed to be more about private clients than public sector. Personally, I wish they could show more of the controversial clients.

It pays to advertise."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what it is clicking off checkboxes and making sperate tickets for now upper middle management. Because upper mgmts friends know fuck all about networking. I have to write out a fucking essay on why I have to do a thing and then wait for it to get approved by several other mfers above me that probably think I wave a magic wand and fix shit. All the while a whole gd data center is down. And update social media. Send out emails to customers affected. Gotta do all secretarial work because they laid off the whole damn department that used to do that. And then get yelled at it took me several hours to fix the problem. When I'm literally stuck waiting on approval to do the work. 

I would love nothing more than my stocks to moon so I can buy the company back from ibm and sink them to the abyss. I would be too bored not ever having to work again and I would rather get back to the days of knock this shit out fast and right so we can shoot nerf guns at each other for the next 6 hours."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time consider using a normal margin loan to increase your leverage. You only pay the interest rate on the amount you borrow, so instead of getting the $2.5 ""discount"" by buying the 2.5C and then paying the theta like it were interest, use 1.1x leverage to achieve the same effect and pay 5% on the 0.1x for a 0.5% effective interest rate on the position. Thats 1% over a 2 year period, compared to the 10%ish of the option play, and you'll make more money"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deep ITM calls make sense when the stock has way more strikes available. Like if you buy AMD $40 Jan. '22s, there's very little cost beyond intrinsic value, but they will move nearly 1:1 with the stock at half the price, so you can buy twice as much. At $2.5 on a $20-25 thing you aren't getting nearly the same leverage"

Yet it’s worth more than most of the top 5 defense companies who generate anywhere from 10-50b in sales 

That’s an absolute hysterical joke. Palantir is stupidly overvalued and loaded to the tits with dumb money. Thiel took it public for a reason....to dump on your fucking asses because other VCs in the private market didn’t wanna bother investing in this turd of a business model anymore after seeing 15+ years of VC money dry up and amount to nada.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think its going to crash? There hasnt really been an earnings run up, so things dont actually look that bad"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They IPO'd 5 months ago at $12 and have since doubled that evaluation. Do you really think there is any room for them to go higher? How much in sales could they have possibly made that would warrant OP's 30 or god forbid 40 calls becoming ITM? It's a stupid bet. I'm not saying it's going to crash, but it's very probable that it goes nowhere or down a dollar or two. That and OP bought his options when they were jacked with IV means he has to be twice as right to actually turn a profit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, IV is high, but not super high. P/E is 18, which means the company has actual valuation. Its a real company, different from those other companies like MVIS, HGEN, and BCRX that have no product and are severely overvalued. ASO is dipping as I type, so I might actually get some calls"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean they earned close to $3/share through Q3 so it’s almost guaranteed that they hit that after factoring in Q4 numbers. Let’s not forget that they grew earnings, during a global pandemic, simply by improving the way they do business. 

While it might not happen by 4/16, a $30 price point is only a P/E of 10 so not exactly an aggressive valuation. Also, I’m not really sure why the initial IPO price has any bearing on the current value. They did a 2nd offering in January at $21, should we consider that as well?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll see.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The biggest margin call I've ever seen since my 2 months of trading.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oblivion gold glitch / GTA / minecraft cobble generator / etc were merely practice runs for stock market infinity squeeze, gg"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much the total loss of this whole sub from day 0 to now adds up to
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"2 billion divided by 10 million degenerates = 200 each.. Not enough.  
2 trillion margin call divided by 10 million degenerates= 200,000 to each degenerats..This is the way"

Anyway, hedgefunds are like the cancer of our financial system. They destroy anything."

Archegos didn't have the cash so they went bust and had to sell all they have asap. They sold package deals through Goldman and Maegan Stanley (so they knew the fire sale was gonna make these stocks crash) there was also discovery and Viacom in the bunch.

So MS and GS also sold their shit companies at the same time.

Credit Suisse and Nomura were late to the party, so CS sold at a $20bn loss, and Nomura dgaf, and just kept the bag last I heard"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They got me for a few hundred dollar mistake on 2016 taxes years later - 

Ended up being $1800 after interest & penalties. Was filling my 2019 return in near future & kinda disregarded it - that's nothing to the IRS, right? 

At that time all investments were in 401k, single & took standard deduction, so was still able to do a 1040ez, only other deduction was max student loan interest payments per usual.

Slightly overpay as would rather get ~ $1k back than owe them money - once I know my refund you're going to take I'll send you a check for the difference. 

Ya bad idea, got a call from HR which, um I don't want calls from HR - very vague and just please come up to our floor, ok - fuck, was like ummm what'd I do - IRS got a garnishment order. Was wait, seriously, over $1800? Okay. 

Called IRS & after hours on hold managed to stop that real quick by paying them $100 monthly & was like - you guys already have!!!! most of that, was just going to pay off the balance once that was credited - 2 months later after refund they kept showed as a credit, paid the $250ish remainder in full.

Insane they were that efficient at chasing down what was initially an innocent $800 mistake they caught via auditing a two year old return... yet the rich openly brag about tax fraud."

Somebody who does ""short squeezes"" on GSX, VIAC, DISC using 5x leverage. 

I mean I have no idea, maybe they were just retardedly long and short RKT for whatever reason, but the more I'm reading about Hwang, this guy belongs here. I could easily see him being on wallstreetbets.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tell the board of directors to stay away from your stock. They literally took your stocks value as a basis for selling more to raise cash, killing your stock value."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, not bankrupt. I should be clear and I’ll edit my previous comment.... it’s probably too late to get in on SNDL puts. The stock shouldn’t be worth more than a dollar. The company issued so much stock during the SNDL craze and they have tons of cash because of it. Their market cap isn’t justifiable. I THINK the thinking is that they will acquire another company but some of that bump is already priced in. 

TLDR; the stock price went up. They were almost bankrupt and then they sold more shares and the stock didn’t correct enough. My puts are all deep in the money. I think buying puts now would have a low chance of profiting."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t true so to say, it was examined in a report from the 1980’s I remember seeing that proved a correlation to be statistically significant between joining s&p500 and the price rising, but markets are much more efficient today and a lot of funds can just re-shuffle stocks around

So it was claimed that this effect is negligible and in no way a provable/significant correlation anymore between the 2, even though people still strongly believe it, although I read this months ago and have no idea the source so I might be talking rubbish"

2021-03-29 19:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Transocean's Hedge Fund Historical Manipulation and What is in Progress A couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.

**The Hedge Fund Play:**

In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.

Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.

To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres & Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.

I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.

Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.

Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.

In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

[RIG](https://preview.redd.it/eghbkjl3nzp61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84565866abc86314337836e1206d4000161a934)

**Industry and Company Background:**

Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to Covid-19 lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand.

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year.

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.

With the up-trending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year.

Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil.

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.

From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets.

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.

**Recently - New Play:**

A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analyzing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.

My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Some legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.

The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.

This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR, I got a day job buddy"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m holding a small position on RIG based on the book value and the fact that their competitors went bankrupt. Have been wondering why this stock is falling. Thank you for sharing this.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, what a great read. Thank you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"1st, thank you for the post.

2nd. RIG was my first ever stock I bought and that was in 2015. I still have it, to today.

3rd. I worked for TSF on a rig, I know them, love them, a great company, clever and a market leader.

4th. Do not forget, they took the beating in the oil collapse in 2016 and the oil and gas industry actually never recovered from that. Then COVID, then this manipulation going on behind the curtains, they fight politicans, corruption and whatever destructive forces is out there and they still survive.

YES, RIG is here to stay and for any individual or any company to break down a company that provides for thousands of families and 100,s of thousands of families from the spin off effect, should just take 3 minutes to think about the hardship they create purely because they cannot accept the fact that they were wrong, they should have believed and rather supported a great company like RIG.

RIG and everyone that is covered in grease and drilling mud, sweating day in and day out to make the SHORTS and HF's fancy cars run, just do it to put bread on the table put kids to school and earn an honest days wages.

I am with you on RIG!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work for a company who supplies equipment to oil exploration companies. Far from an expert of any sorts but I watch the industry closely as it’s part of my job to understand it. 

Almost all of RIG’s main competitors have now completed refinancing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. They were never bankrupt just stuck in an impossible cycle of debt restructuring which they’ve now escaped. All now have cash on hand & much less debt to address through the forecasted long recovery even with the recent higher oil price. You say oil companies are reluctant to award contracts to these companies and that is simply not true at all. The other aspect of fixing the exploration sector is reducing the number of rigs causing the oversupply in the market... aka their “assets”. That means scrapping rigs for a lot less than their listed value. Companies who have gone through Ch11 do this almost for free, whereas RIG will take the hit at full value. You have to factor this into their near term future as these distressed assets have related costs which they must eventually admit defeat on & cut their losses.

I really hope RIG does survive, just don’t bet on a miracle recovery because they were the brave outlier. That’s not something that’s typically rewarded in this industry."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a play on market dynamics and macroeconomic factors. The entire oil industry including big oil have been struggling with profitability due to the low price of oil we've been facing for the past couple of years but due to factors as Eljefe2800 mentioned including the rise in demand and supply issues, it just started to turn around  months ago and progress is continuing. Even large juggernauts like XOM are having the same issues so profitability alone should not be the sole factor of an investment. If you are so gone-ho on profitability then put your money where your mouth is and start shorting Peloton, Zillow, DropBox, and AirBNB as they have never been profitable yet they are trading way above their book values. Even our beloved GME and AMC have negative profitability as well. At least RIG has positive EBITDA, trading under book value, have a growing backlog of business that would last them years, and at the same time been beating analyst expectations in the earnings calls. If company profitability is what you are looking for then stick with Boomer stocks and put your money on silver."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would think its would be probably less than 6 months this time since court scheduling is now back to regular hours for most states now, plus even during the height of the pandemic, and trying the actual case last year, they were able to dismiss the case within 6 months. I would expect the appeal will probably be sooner than that."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,SDRL was actually one of the companies that filed bankruptcy during the covid lockdowns last year. I believe they just came out of bankruptcy recently and are faced with several problems as mentioned above. The messed up part is that SDRL also had filed for bankruptcy back in 2017 when the 2016 Oil crisis hit which proves the fact that these shitty companies that came out of bankruptcy have no spine and will more likely to go back into bankruptcy if there are any hick ups in the recovery.

This is the way..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought this sub was retarded, but fucking 5x leverage, on that scale?!
Like even the retarded trader I am would need to think about that deal.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,man y'all still using RH?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,😎
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to this stuff, so I'm trying to understand.  You sold 23 calls and you have 2300 shares, so they're covered calls, right?  Where would the possibility for a margin call come in?  You can always cover the contracts with your shares?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So... price low - ape buy?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's how all of our portfolios will look like in a week or two when they liquidiate the ""smaller"" HFs having longs in GME. It's just one thing we need to do HODL!!!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy Moly!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's your true average though, once you count the premium on those cc against share cost? I'm guessing you're not as badly off as the raw numbers would suggest"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery is a good company imo. Undervalued if you look at their free cash flow multiple. You might have to wait a while but I think this will bounce back once all this selling is over and done with. Best of luck
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a legit guh right up there with the bunny story. Makes all the right plays and simply get fucked by circumstance anyway. Sorry this happened to you & hope it all pans out okay.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,he bought? dump it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch that hurts.  Hope you make it back.  I holding my VIAC.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I bought 50p after someone said to and made 375%.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang is that you?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge with some GME and you will be fine
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You were doing so well. Sorry buddy 😢
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,To bad. Discovery is expanding in to some interesting stuff. Hedgies can’t be trusted to even button their pants like a big boy never mind manage any bodies money
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh ya keep it coming. fck thats good loss porn

but yea good luck OP. home you make some back"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah now looks like a tasty buy time. Hedge it fam
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck brother
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God speed my friend.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Moral of the story. There's always a bigger retard out there
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's ok dude. Sometimes you need to blow up a couple of accounts before you have one with 7 figures.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,whats discovery? is that a tv thing?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, look at the bright side, you only lost 6K total............"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I don't understand covered calls.. But isn't the share price going down good for your CC position? I thought selling a call option was bearish??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery needs to do a documentary for this.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why invest in a TV channel?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Should we expect this to drop all the way back to the pre-rocket levels of around 24?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,-80k. Oof

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Op isn't 5x leveraged. By the title, they are 1.7x leveraged. It was the hedge fund that recently blew up that was 5x leveraged... For 80 billion dollars."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point it’s a given that if you do something dumb on RH it will be sold to a HFT will use that info to fuck you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets, 😎
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling the options made me money. The shares I bought as collateral for the options (that I bought with borrowed money) did the opposite of making me money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He doesn't need to cover the calls, those are green.  He sold CC and the stock went down, which means he keeps all the premium (he already rolled it once), and doesn't have to give up the shares.  

His problem is the stock crashed hard and he used borrowed money to buy it when it was high.  For shits and giggles sake, lets say he borrowed (margin)  $6000 from his broker to buy all his DISCA shares.  DISCA tanked 50%, now his shares are only worth $3000, so he is technically $3000 in the red with his broker.  It was money he didn't have, hence the negative balance."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,stock got 'downgraded' the other day to target price of $59 by WFC. Even the negative analysts don't think it should be as low as it is right now. It's a good stock at the current price. If I wasn't so levered rn I'd throw a lot of money at it. In a sense I'm still doing that by not selling.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Very tempted to get in at this price? Anyone else?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I'm afraid of, but all these fire sales were too darn tempting and now I'm red on everything but GME."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold the initial CC's for about $6.50 per share, then the shares fell about $35. I would have been completely wiped out without the CC's. Net result was about -75% of total portfolio."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Döömp eet
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's good for the value of his covered calls because he can buy the calls back at a cheaper price than he sold them for. It's bad for his account overall because the ""covered"" portion means he owns discovery stocks, which are now worth ~40 dollars as opposed to the 76 dollars he bought in for."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a hedged bullish position. Down is bad but he's protected a little bit by the premium he collected
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hogs run free

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was referring to the fund that got liquidated, OP was caught in the crossfire, but still got fucked at 1.7 leverage"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think where he is confused, as am I is that your shares for the covered calls are bought on margin? For us newbie option players when we here covered we assume you have the shares (cash) and your max ""loss"" would be the difference between the share price and your call when executed, but in this scenario all the shares were bought with margin?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Analysts are just retards in suits. They don’t know shit just like rest of us. But I like the stock because it’s on sale and I was born in Bulgaria as a cat.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dave Ramsey has a phrase he uses for this kind of decisionmaking: ""If you had X dollars lying on your kitchen table right now, would you throw it all on \[Discovery\] right now?""  ""By not selling that's the decision you're making""  


So yea, you're right, you're essentially buying in at that low price by not selling.  I think you should recover if a margin call doesn't fuck you first."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t another underlying cause that big HF getting liquidated?? I believed they had to close their positions
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, are we talking about investing in a legacy TV channel? I don't understand how they are even still alive. I know literally 1 person with a broadcast TV subscription and he gets it for free through work. I just don't get it. I'll take 100"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s still high"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it at this price too but tbh I don’t want to touch this stock rn bc of all these hedgies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling it will probably turn very red on GME also soon. All depending on what the long whales strategy is. I think there is a big war in GME right now that started with shorts vs longs on tesla where the long won. So i’m thinking they will never let this chance pass and do whatever it takes to take Citadel down badly. But in the mean time there is nothing to do about it for us retailers more than buy the dips and hold! We have them by the balls 💎👐🏻
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooof shit, I skim read so thought you had been selling for a while and hence covered your cost basis. That's gotta hurt.... On the other hand, I own a fuckton of clover health shares, for reasons I cannot figure out. Was a random stupid attempt to catch a knife- you should look at the chart now"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"covered calls are 'covered' by shares in the event that the stock goes up. When a stock goes up, the call makes money, so you sell your shares to cover the amount you owe the person who bought the call. You both make money if that happens. 

When the stock goes down by more than the intial price of the option, you both lose. The call buyer loses everything they paid for the option, and the seller loses from the decrease in the price of the underlying. The margin part is just part of why I lost bigly."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,😺
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It has a streaming service now and they license shows to other streaming sites. Discovery owns TLC/Food Network/HGTV and a bunch of other smaller networks too. Their content is cheap to make and they have a lot of it, and they are strong on unscripted/reality tv."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where would you recommend buying?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah I literally opened the position at the absolute top, thinking that even if it dropped 10-20% id be happy to hold and sell calls for a while. I'm still happy to do that, just need the broker to let me lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ribs are good

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea going heavy on margin while doing theta shit is kind of scary to me. You need to deposit and maybe buy a couple ITM puts or something.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a friend that works in reality TV. Does shows like highway thru hell and what not. Anyways, he says in 6 months most of the work is drying up. Apparently there a bit of a scare. Their isn't much production coming up for new seasons. Now this is just one person that works in western Canada. What does this mean. I don't fucken know."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t until low 20’s

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A little late to buy puts my friend. IV is through the roof. Better to either sell or just hold.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Discovery brand of shows are notably pretty cheap to make & a lot of them do extremely well overseas. Not at all saying you're incorrect, just noting that they have a very strong integration for a media company.

An episode of Chopped films in 12 hours on a set, there's over 500 of them, & the vast majority of the back catalogue is only streaming from Discovery itself or w/ cable sub. I have never had cable in my adult life & we watch a fair amount of food network content on Hulu. Their library is worth a fair amount - obviously it's not a tentpole show like seinfeld."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wont it hit low 20s this week or tomorrow?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,!guh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is gonna go higher when the bottom drops out. I don't own any so I can't sell or hold, lol."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s at $42 now. If it drops 50% in the next week...

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I get Viacom is like a huge & powerful company and stuff but it kind of feels like buying into a company that mines coal or something. It looks like a dying breed longterm. Is their something I’m missing? The stock is on major discount right now so I’m curious
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Brave. Stupid but brave.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You waited til tesla dropped under 600 to short? Breh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Peak retard lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol you’re assuming they’ve all been liquidated already...

Me thinks there’s more to come on the next margin call. 

No one said he closed out positions... just that they liquidated as part of margin call"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought about doing the same but decided it was too risky.  I wish you the best of luck in making me regret my decision.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,oh sick glad someone is doing this! keep us updated
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disc might earn you some. when it moves, it’s by increments of 10 $"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great way to burn your money in a bonfire of artificially propped up, over-leveraged stocks. Def a retarded retard move."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They was short Tesla lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Feels a little bit early. But I would do the same, if I had money to spare. (~100% Invested in Gme)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just looked at Viacom's chart and it's a fucking Javelin missile. I get paid in about 30 hoirs and I'm sure as shit gonna buy some of that tasty dip.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this from Bloomberg monitor?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I come here for! Thanks for making my day.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Strong move here. Like the thinking. With you on Viacom.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They get margin called for risky positions and your first thought is... hey I like risk :D Love it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You deserve that for having a short position on your book...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy bottom feeder...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying the dip doesnt work everytime... this trade is too good to be true and things that are too good to be true usually arent good. Too many apes just buying stocks just because they dip without doing ANY DD on them. I guarantee these stocks will be pummeled far much longer than your contracts will be open.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Disney’s stock has gone to the moon off of the success of Disney+. Viacom can offer a similar service with its catalog of content.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a bet not an investment play, ride the pump on the way up then dump"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they have made probably thousands of  food network & HGTV shows in the past. I guess Viacom ain’t dead & probably never will be
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,they also get paid by streaming platforms who carries their content.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the 6 month chart and then ask yourself again if the stock trades at a ""major discount"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing dumb about it. It's damn near free money. Nothing changed with the companies, but their price dropped 40-50% because of a short-term singular event. That is almost a guaranteed dip buy bounce, with the potential to squeeze anyone that was retarded enough to short it during the free fall and not exit yet."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of these are pretty smart... I mean... VIAC is a prime candidate for coming back.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not stupid at all...op might be a bit too smort for wsb
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"you can basically buy it at 40% discount. even if you dont want to keep it longterm, it is bound to come back over the next week or so..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Believe it or not, there is a super fine line, basically transparent that separates the two lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a gift that fell in our lap. If anyone has extra cash this is the move. Up a buck in after hours. Expecting institutions to be all over this tomorrow
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s IBKR"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just looked at Disney's market cap: 330B, VIAC: 40B. I see tech stocks with no hope of making a penny valued higher than VIAC... shit is insane."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you are right but is Viacom in talks to create a new streaming service? Or licensing out content? I just see so many streaming services out now and worry that even if they do release one no one will care. All these streaming services out remind me of paying for cable lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not at a discount from the 6 month point of view lol I don’t plan on buying any Viacom stock I was just interested in why someone would put 25k into it rn
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing? I mean yeah, that's one way it could play out. Another is that heights from which the price fell were inflated by insane leverage  that won't prop up the price again, while next waves of forced liquidations could be coming from other banks.  
   
Good luck to him, I hope it plays out great for him, but no, it's not free money, risk is big."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is pretty much how I look at this and why I did it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are paying a very high price for IV, which will be crushed after this week.

Being right about price and date means nothing, if you pay too much for IV."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand the reason they were up 150% this year was because of these highly leveraged funds?

Viacom is merely back to mid-January levels. Which is still high."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seen multiple DCF valuations with Viacom @ $60 per share. Institutions will see this as a buying opportunity, especially with all of that juicy funding for streaming content."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t the general sentiment that the run up due to the buying by archegos was unjustified? I don’t disagree with some rebound, but would be surprised for it to run up back to where it was."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How big does Viacom pop? It is surprising that it even is where it is now right?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It already exists as Paramount+. I subscribe because they locked champions league soccer behind that paywall. If you kids like Nickelodeon ( I know my kids love Paw Patrol), you are a subscription candidate."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Discover+ is their streaming and since they own HGTV and Food Network - they have a ton to pull from and to create crossover stuff from (which they are doing actively all this past year.)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aside from the April call, those are dated far enough out, and he's got shares too. If it's truly all of his account then he might see trouble. But if he can average down on further liquidations, seems like a good play."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,why did you buy the calls instead of selling them? the IV is through the roof. 200IV for a media company? thats crazy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,yep
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's surprisingly low for what transpired Friday. I believe the calls I picked up today were about 125% when I got them. 145% now.

Obviously risky still, and you can buy shares for a safer play. But this is wallstreetbets."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but if your thesis is that it won't go back with new leverage, then you should be short the entire market by 20-30%. Either leverage returns of the entire market will go through deleveraging."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,not sure to be honest. current PE is not implicative of an overvaluation at current price by any standard and the company has been hitting a solid net income margin of about 10% for the past 5 years. the book value is twice current market cap (22bn) and even equity + cash already amount to 18bn.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Champions league and spongebob fanatic, it’s the only no brainer service for me"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y'all are Missing the real reason to play viacom, mother fucking avatar. They are launching an avatar studio and all this shit all going on paramount+"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I purposefully don’t subscribe because they locked CL behind the paywall. It’s free on the Spanish language broadcasts and they are far more entertaining.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean Paramount+?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Never sell calls when a stock is this oversold. A bounce is coming and that will probably f over call sellers
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting to watch. I always viewed Viacom as an institution more than a company. The powers that be would never let the stock swing much in either direction. Vital to controlling news and information.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No  

[www.discoveryplus.com](https://www.discoveryplus.com/)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is VIAC oversold? People have said before and will say again that it was overextended. RSI/KDJ are lenses that provide insight, not the gospel."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have u looked at the 6 month or any chart at all for Viacom? It basically sky rocketed in the last 6 months, same with discovery. It was bound to burst"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sorry - I thought I was commenting on Discovery - I didn't follow we had moved to Viacom here.  ugh.  getting coffee now. lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets, Those numbers aren’t all that stellar considering  the fact that everybody was forced to stay at home during this period. A nice gain that is for sure.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,was waiting for this realization.
2021-03-29 19:19:12,wallstreetbets,Apes that missed getting into GME early 
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in early and then bought so much more that my average raised to the point where I feel like I just got in last week.

Need to buy the dips more and stop being such a retard."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's never too late
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean if everyone is so confident that GME will go to $400+, now is early too 🤷‍♂️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought two shares this morning. It aint much but I got in when I could.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Early?  The shit not even 200

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My average is 176. No such thing as too early.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything with 3 digits is early
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$200 is gonna seem pretty early once we’re hanging in the thousands... 😉
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's pretty much no excuse for Feb $38-55 range, it was trading side ways $50 for weeks. And it was in your radar cause it was all over the news and internet.

You didn't get in cause you didn't believe in it, and called people bag holders.

There is still time to make up your mind."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It‘s me. 🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 4 more today now my average 160 or maybe 22 or maybe 350 or what have you. LeVe them guessing gents and ladies.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My avg right now is $200. If this moons into 4 digits, the price right now is a steal"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What about the apes that bought in over 200.....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the low quality level we accept now?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Had 20 shares at $40 now 42 at $172 😂😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in November i bought a 100 shares of ford stock. I thought with the new F150, mach E and Bronco this year is going to be real good for them. Ive made some money but nothing to shit post about. Bought at 7.90 a share they’re around 12 now.

If i bought GME I could of paid off my student loans 😑"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't hate the gme Bros... I just wish they had a different subreddit so we could have discussions about something else, wall street bets existed before the GME chaos, and I made a lot more money before."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$200 *is* early for something that's heading for *at least* $10k
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean all you? You bought at 250+.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There's already a subreddit dedicated to GME stocks. Mods should move 90% of shit post there and keep a daily gme thread on here. That way we can resume high quality shit posts for a different diversity of stocks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we drop the price again so all us Late Bloomers can jump on this rocketship
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got in early at 80, got in early again up at 250, got in early again at 60, got in early again last week at 163. Tripled my account value. Still early and am now holding."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah 200 super cheap.  Buy Buy Buy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This post is dumb as shit. Doesn't matter how early you got in.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if I told you it's still ""early""?

I'm sure people saw it at $25 and thought ""damn, if only I got in at $5, I'd be doing really good now - but it's too late to profit, oh well"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in late and am averaging down.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been in since January 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some at 60, some at 117, some at 185, done for now."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought about £6500 worth at $205 seconds before the short attacks that nuked it to the point where I was down about £1200. Now its negative £560 hopefully I'll break even by tomorrow and get some money when GME finally moons
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also people that got in back in early January ,made bank and got out and are ready to make money on something else."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the rocket really takes off, it doesn't matter if your average was 5, 40 or 200 bucks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody who calls themselves an “ape” was in GME early lol. “Early” was before January, 90% of you missed the big one."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I love how all of the comments are just trying to convince people that this is a good price to buy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s still early.... even 500$ is going to be cheap when we reach millions
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,(Unzips pants) NO! my average is smaller!!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Instead they try and make BB a thing
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They’ll be extra salty when they realized they missed out *again*
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How bad its shorted even right now it's a steal. Read some DD and you can see this going past 100k even. Idiot Hedges keep digging hole deeper.🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, I talk about GME even on dates. Last time I even sang ""The Tendieman"" to her. I think I might have a problem."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except it still ain't gone nowhere. We could gotten in at 200 last month. And we could get in at 200 next month. 

I hope it moons and they turn off the sell button on you fucks just like they did the buy button back in Jan. Would be absolutely hilarious."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$3 is early.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What difference does it make when you buy when the price goes to 1M lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,To be honest the original quote itself works well without a caption changing sun to GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me who sold at 30
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Need more GME!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Never too late

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It hasn't happened yet
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I've accepted that I didn't get in on time. That doesn't stop me from cheering on those who did.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in, made money, got out.  It is the way of not bag holding a volatile stock."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"i don't get it.

what is early? there is almost no difference if you get in at 10$, 40$ or 200$ once this gets even only above 10k$.

So easy to just join now.Unless you are paperhanded and just wanted to go 40$ to 400$..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been nothing but a dip.  Im about to sell,  this is bs."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol and also can’t stop moaning about people talking about GME: like STFU about it yourselves then
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s to late your just going to be red lining forever, like me"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I joined late in the game (at least higher than most I hear about) but I've been working on averaging down and am still enjoying this wild ride

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say regardless of your avg price per share GME is quite the interesting phenomena. 

I hear ya tho, its kinda bonkers.

But for a bunch of retarded apes what do you expect?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ape wanted to, but was broke as hell at that time. Food and bills come first. I'm retarded, but not that retarded."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I attempted to buy $1000 worth of $35 call options before it spiked in January. They were like $100 each expiring on 26 Mar. I was too cheap and my orders didn’t get fulfilled. They were worth like 10-15k each. Now I’m stuck chasing that feeling that I could do it again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Still early.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was below 100 euros a few days ago, they could have easily gotten in"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you continue getting approval for your memes on r/wallstreetbets? i can't leave mine up for 4 seconds and they delete it. I've sent messages to the ModMail directly more than 20 times and they don't respond. EVeryone else seems to get theirs brought in but mine killed
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"People acting like averaging up is bad, by that logic you would never be allowed to buy more shares of a stock that runs well 😅🤷🏻‍♂️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in right at the start in January but i couldn't afford the call options so i barely made any money with shares

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummm it's still early.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Any price not in the thousands is worth it. The main thing is to boost your share count without selling any or fucking with options.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,1 Million a share is not a meme🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its still early if its a squeeze $1000000000000000000 🚀💎🙌

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not too late.
It goes on sale for as low as $150 all the time. I buy everytime it hits that low."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's still early tho
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s still early 👉😎👉
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got here a month ago.  No complaints.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Getting in today is still getting in early.

We’re going to the moon right? I can still see clouds in the window."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,As I see it people can still get in and make a lot of money - so dry your eyes and buy the dip 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought more today. So...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Naw def not to late to hop this 🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's OK because there is still AMC. So if the entry point is too high for some to get into gme. There is a choice.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 400 shares at 20 and somehow now i have 40 shares at 200. I’m an idiot
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"🤷‍♂️ I kinda feel like my cost per share barely matters, just the number of shares I have."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,my average was originally $44 and now its $137 lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only reason I'm not in yet is because I'm waiting for hte ATH to finally FOMO in
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"
>Need to buy the dips more and stop being such a retard.

I have bad news."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You bastard you ruined my back in the day
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,To what end? If you got in early and didn't sell at 350 then what's the goal
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I did buy in last week and I'm down 6% right now... It'll go back up soon I hope
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 150 at 30 and it was literally impossible for me to average down
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a steal
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering it's been trading above $100 for a month, anything below $100 is early now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,IPO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$20 or less
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$5000

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,March 10th was too late. January 29th was too late. There is always a too late.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be chaos of buy orders if it drops back around $100, I know im going to FOMO SO HARD, Only have 7 so far and would like to add another 0 to the end of it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Try 1k
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 5 premarket.  I’m also one of the jealous people
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Aint much but its honest work.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"getting in around $50 was the move. It’s current price doesn’t make sense based on the e-commerce/cohen thesis anymore, this price is people on board for the squeeze. Plus on this note, if you believe it’s gonna squeeze, why not buy last month? Everybody and their mother knew what GME was at that point, perfect chance."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBC talk right here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't buy it for $5 even
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, 🚀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,200 is a lot more dangerous though. If you got in at 40 you can be pretty certain you aren’t going to bag hold but at 200 it’s way riskier since squeeze aside it may take a while for GME to get to 200 naturally
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Delusional.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I couldn't get my allowance early so couldn't buy in then
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sort of legit, except I was already in from January. I held but I was too worried about them openly manipulating it at any sign of life after they killed the first squeeze with Peterffy that piece of shit bragging on live television about criminally manipulating the market, so I didn't double down.

And back then I was less certain GME would be worth that or more on fundamentals any time soon. The company value floor has gone up since then imo."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They hate us because they anus?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because we are fckng diamond hands
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the top, sell the bottom. This is the way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries, the shorts will buy the ATH in front of you this time :)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What if we kept averaging up?lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This pleases me and my $95 avg.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,90 shares @ 78$ here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shut up lmao
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm both of these.....few bananas and kicking myself many times a day that I wasn't able to get in early.

With any luck, there will be another GME in the near future that I can hop onto early and have bunches upon bunches of bananas."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,See!?! See!?!? Ladies and boyfriends. THIS IS BDE
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I have a few people who are waiting for a drop. They thought it was dead after the first squeeze but see it steady around 200 and hoping for a drop to buy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Once you crack double digits it’s hard not to hit the buy button
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And now you're on the rocket. Welcome aboard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">this price is people on board for the squeeze

Yes exactly you fucking jakanape. If you don't see the value in getting in on the biggest craziest squeeze we will ever see, why the fuck are you even in this sub??

After the dust settles, GME will be a good investment at the right price of course, but talking about the current price and ""actual value"" right now is some true retardation."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBC wants us to get in on GME at any price? That's awesome!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Found the guy who invests only in BECKY
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"With the figures floating around today I feel quite comfortable with an average at 160. I doubt it'll plummet below for anything but a dip. Time will tell, but the action going on I don't sweat it.
Told my kids they can sell at 800-1000 if they want to but I am keeping mine to see where this goes. Worst case I'll get 80-120% of my input, best case who knows..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At the end of the day I’m not betting against Ryan Cohen and a few million retards
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They hate us because they pay us
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,LOLOL
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a casino
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t go to school to words good.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao I see what you did there.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He probably went to school for an actually useful degree, not to be an English major."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Kud uv.....c'mon  now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably majored in Fine Auts 🖍️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,making small payments now but planning on making  a big one before everyone is off of deferment again. Right  now though  my goal is to be debt free outside of a possible car payments ( I like the cars)  and a mortgage.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s too early but you can still cover it timeframe.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that a bunch of OG users moved to another subreddit speaks volumes about the state of this sub.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao...well I haven't messed with the NOK crowd as much. I just keep seeing the BB boys being so emotional...ticker should be QQ
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buddy when you’ve mastered the fade to black transition, call me, then i know I’ll be dealing with a true hollywood elite. I’ll *hold* off from attacking you then."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Still gonna be rich tho
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This may be surprising, but 20 * 400 = 40 * 200"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah i sold my 400 shares at 150 or so during round1 drop then bought back in late during round2. Still up but obviously could be up a lot more
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. I’m not opposed to buying in at the current price point but I’ve only got so much money, and I want the most shares I can possibly get. I’m going insane hoping for both a dip and a spike here lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes of course that's correct... but at the same time... if I had gotten in at $40, I wouldn't be too sad about averaging up at this point."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Inversely related
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the sell. Top the bottom.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,then wait for the squeeze!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, my average is 89 and I like to think it wasnt terrible. I averaged up from 15 and the highest i paid for a share was like 350 but at least enough of them were early that my average isnt complete trash, just kind of ruined"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried to buy at 90$ at the end of the day when it started to rocket and my broker did not let me set a limited order higher than 30% of the previous day's price -_- Next day it opened at 160$ I believe.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Less than 10 dollars is more like it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I'm hoping for
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"relax ape, other people have opinions besides yours. In fact if you look around on this thread you’ll see people talking about the principles of cohen, irrelevant price movement, etc. - which is what my comment was referring to. Getting in at $50 allows you to consider both the squeeze and the fundamentals, which is my point. And yes it is early, in the sense i’m sure you knew about the “value” of the squeeze then. I’m sorry to have worked you up so much but I don’t think you understand what i’m saying. Also, your comment is worded in a way that makes it seem like buying this stock over $200 is a sure bet, when it’s not 100% guaranteed. A lot of people don’t have that risk appetite. Myself, and I assume you as well, are okay with putting money in based on the squeeze potential however."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub is not just for GME. This kinda comment is suitable for the other sub.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep agreed. I just mean there’s probably more people out there using money they can’t afford to lose so we can’t be surprised when people inevitably sell “early”
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Worst case 80-120%? Are you new to the stock market?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Yes, so uhh, how many times do I spin this machine until I hit that jackpot. Pls let me know, thx."""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"PhilmoreButtz, you one cool guy"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"i didn't even go to school, just took out student loans so i had some extra money!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad I didnt see it 😳
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to know words to go to college
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just over here buying JOAN dips.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"!remindyou24hours...wait, I’m on vacation.  !remindyou48hours"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Once you go full retard you can neva go back.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s wild. It’s almost like he took some profit on those initial 400 shares then bought back in later
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You're implying s/he sold original shares at 20 bucks. Pretty sure that didn't happen
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha! I feel you man. I made that mistake on another share, which was my first share. I thought I averaged down and had more shares than before, only to find out I had less shares and I didn't average down that much. It hurts. Since my funds got eaten, I ended up affording less GME.

I have less than 30 shares of GME. Hopefully this thing blows up to 800k - 1 million per share. Then I will be very happy!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Given my financial situation when it was at $40 (just started new job), I'd still have to buy in at this price to have more than a couple of shares."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This seems to contradict your previous comment.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inversely *proportional*

They just vaguely said ""related,"" meaning that the two items are related in a way where one directly affects the other. Put another way, they meant directly as opposed to ""indirectly,"" not opposed to ""inversely"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought more."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You fuckers have a $10 average ? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"And we can't judge them for it. Personally I'm not in gme to see a ""a nice buck or two"". I believe the narrative that we could make a difference and hence I'll keep my stocks 'till a big impact.
I stood with my eldest son at the computer when it was at 345 and we both stated ""this would be nice but won't change anything"".

Let's see where this takes us and hold tight until then! Best of luck!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hard to say. I'm holding 55 shares. I'm planning to go long on 22 of them I got @96. I can afford to lose it all. Will just be annoying lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, just my take in the matter. You carrying a crystal ball?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,... I'm pretty sure we are the ones getting beaten up lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you have the roles reversed. That’s what the market is doing to us! Beating us up and taking our money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do so many people already know what 14/88 is?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughing my ass off how I feel right now for holding $GME and $AMC Fuckkkkkk Youuuuuu hedge funds. Hurry up and cover them shorts.

2021-03-29 19:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Why Farfetch (FTCH) is actually a great buy following a blowup  Resubmitted as Discussion, not DD

&#x200B;

So, quick backstory, Tiger Asia Management had to sell 30B of equities to meet a margin call. As a result, Discovery, Farfetch, a bunch of Chinese stocks, etc, all fell stupid amounts on Friday. FTCH is down 6% today as well as the fallout continues, but it's not based on any fundamentals

Looking at Tipranks, FTCH has an average analyst price target of 67 dollars. It's not a Chinese stock and it's not media, but it does have exposure to the global remergence following Coronavirus recovery. I think it's a great play and makes a lot of sense. It's currently trading at 48 dollars now. It used to be 73 dollars.

TL:DR FTCH is underpriced following a major blow up in asset management"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a Farfetch once ...traded him for a Rattatta. So dumb, i kno."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's so fetch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"its not just any e-commerce platform. it’s the go-to luxury platform. has plans to tap on the chinese market, chinese has tons of wealthy kids waiting to go hypebeast... MS put out a report last friday with strong BUY call at 70$ TP if i recall correctly"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's also a strictly e-commerce site, the ones which thrive in COVID era when physical stores are closed and it traded at less than $10 pre-pandemic.

 edit: To add onto my point, let's compare it to ASOS for example. ASOS IMO is more popular, though Farfetch offers a lot more designer, expensive branding. However ASOS for example had about 4.4 billion USD revenue in 2020, while Farfetch had  3 billion USD. ASOS's market cap is less than 7.7 billion USD, while Farfetch's is over 17 billion as of this moment."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your daily P&L now?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"haha, the whole market is shaky, RKT is holding up better though, I'm not worried. Better to be sitting in RKT that in others TBH."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Such a bummer
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You nailed it .
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Never celebrate to early in this gay ass market

The fact that RKT didn't bomb to hell like Viacom and Discovery is good! Means institutions like the Stock!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No way man!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"👍👍Just make sure you do the research so you know what you're getting into and what your exit plan is. Don't just follow me, I'm a degenerate gambler. 
Here's a good analysis.

I also liked this interview with the founder

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehh... I'm not worried, they're just digging themselves a deeper hole and providing a better price for retail to get in."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, Ooph, buy shares man, I don't think WSB will ever go back. Too many eyes on, if people all buy options on something, I imagine you'd see a bunch of other stocks recommendations pop up until the options expire worthless. I've learned my lesson with Options.... well.. maybe not because I did buy some for this week too."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We're not there yet!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"GUH... it’s fine, Morgan Stanley threw 20m shares out there and it barely moved the stock, compare that to what happened to Viacom and Discovery. I take that as a good sign, institutions have a Hard on for RKT too."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, it's alright man, it's the whole market. RKT usually holds up better and that's a good sign. That's what makes RKT special, it will do well in a bull or bear market. Eventually, as more people realize that, it'll go up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it looked good there for a minute!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There was high volume Friday afternoon.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t think you’d hear me if I said it whilst you were blasting off in your 🚀 headed to planet tendie!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the info ! I appreciate !
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well yea but its clearly being manipulated and shorted to fuck.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit didn’t sell at $27 I’m in the red again
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude the bears entice us to jump in every time and we fall for it. Lol. It’s stupidity.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,With 32 mill shares rolling today and we didn’t break the $27 line it’s bad news. Doesn’t matter what the market is doing at a whole.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"👍👍No Problem, good luck!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's small fries my man, after you do research on RKT and realize it's potential! I'd rather sell my mother than my RKT for $27!💎🙌💎🙌"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"nahh, bears are just keeping the stock down to not pay out on calls. I haven't actually seen anyone make a bear case. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy options but it provides a great chance for people to buy shares."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"$27 was always going to be big resistance, that's the point that met huge resistance before. Somebody REALLY doesn't want it to cross that point. But also I'm sure people who bought during the gamma squeeze are trying to jump out too, also day traders looking to hop in and out, but as more people research the stock and see the potential, then $27 won't be a thing. Just don't be like me and buy short term calls. I have a gambling problem."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So true

RKT 🚀🚀🚀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well good luck. I know you have a lot of skin here so hopefully we killem.

2021-03-29 18:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is why. First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If PLTR makes anybody money, they better post it in here"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,it has no bottom or level of support which is an issue at this point
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Analytics is everything- corporate American loves looking at analytics and then asking for more analytics so they can make themselves looking like their smart, yet never actually make a decision.  Can data make companies more effective?  You can get a good look at a T-bone by sticking your head up a bulls ass or take the butchers word for it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to get too technical, but this stock is basically my hedge if we get into a cold war with China.

Now, I'm not saying that I'm actively rooting for a cold war with China, but...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: MagiKarp take us to the moon.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Minor nitpick--the ""covid model in january"" that Palantir had was through their contract with the Army to build the VANTAGE platform.  Palantir provides software for managing data and managing analytics models, and also sometimes contracts for analytics work specifically, but they aren't analysts per-se.  They sell tools to enable better data analytics and research.

Why do I know this?  Because I'm the mathematics SME from the team that designed the model in question.  Palantir leadership were just smarter less willing to take risks than the rest of our government, given the same data.

Hell yes I own stock, and keep buying more.  25 year minimum hold planned."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,you had me at  **studied the blade**
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If it's still low after GME squeezes I'm definitely dropping a slightly unwise part of my new wealth into it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To all of you who are having doubts, relax, it’s a long term hold. If you need the money now, it’s better to sell it all cos I think it go down even further before going up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unit 8200 is 100% NOT shin bet... two totally different units, one is part of the army the other one is absolutely not."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Peter Thiel also failed with a few companies. Just because some names are in it, there is no proof in success.
I believe in the company but not because Thiel is in.
Actually I personally dislike the guy, but who cares. That is just my opinion about the person, not about the company.
I am buy and hold Palantir, for loooong.

But I am just a guy with a phone, not a financial advisor."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The info is good and all but are there any sources you can link so I can read for myself? As much as I like the confirmation bias excuse me for not taking prettyboyv’s word as fact.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You just reminded me that I wanted to increase my holdings in defense sector companies.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,was this really needed ? i mean you could have summarise it in one line ... BUY AND HODL PLTR  4ever
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Alex Karp goes on the media and tell people to not get into PLTR and just buy something else, who does that ? His character reminds me of Elons. Is he that confident or just playing game with us ? After doing my dd I do believe in PLTR and there work, a company that can help others grow revenue multifold ? Government interest year after year ? Its hard to value this company but PLTR offers a lot of value nonetheless. Not worried about day to day activities, PLTR will  🚀  eventually. I rather be in now when the overall market is all over the place, then in a couple of weeks or month when we start seeing stabililty."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be smooth brained but I have concerns about PLTR, despite all the pretty words written about it.

The company is 17 years old and still doesn't make money. The CEO just warned off ""short term investors"". When these folks gonna be solvent, The heat death of the universe?

Something that's effectively a government subsidiary might be too important to fail. But that doesn't mean you're going to make money on the stock."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Counter argument is that they're one information breach away from certain death.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Bought 100 shares around $23. Definitely a long hold but I actually really like the CEO and his plans
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR is at a very attractive price point today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Trading at 28X sales. Has been in business for 17 years and still not profitable. How on earth can you justify paying 28X revenues for this company ?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr is trash. Nice write up tho!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR will 🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I just don't like the stock
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, commercial business generally do not look up to how well governments are managing their data. Also, their experience with the government does not translate well to commercial business, who does not have piles of rules and regulations."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"too long to read, i will just assume is good news about PLTR, I hold a ton of it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn. Started buying shares at 26, nice 20 percent loss. But I really like it long term. Just means I'll start averaging down, and increasing holding.
That said, I'm done with pltr options. Been burned every time i bought calls. Shares only. Hold til I'm retired or dead."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TOO BIG TO FAIL!!!! WE LIKE THE STOCK ! ! !
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 400 shares strong 🙏
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The also have contracts with Norwegian customs and police
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I sold my calls when PLTR skyrocketed...was up 200%. Now down 30%, in true wsb fashion"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My only consolation at this point is that also Cathie is big underwater too. So who the fuck am I to complain about being down $10k right? Jesus Christ this is getting annoying, but we hold."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It did about two months ago lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cofounder who sold off 97% of his shares needs to share his gain porn
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They haven’t been profitable for the last 15 years, what’s 16th going to change?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought $9
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know I keep looking at it and I shouldn't, but DAAAMN is it getting old seeing -2% every day."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Even as a current PLTR holder and long term believer this is absolutely true.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This needs more upvotes, it literally just broke support so I would chill and let TA show you a path first."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing reference - please take my up vote.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Also learning Mandarin so I'm fully hedged.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">Save

This is the way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dudes gonna evolve soon...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, 25 years? A quarter century?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,",t"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GME squeezed back in January. Are you expecting another one?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, Thiel is a douchebag but at least he’s a a douchebag that’s gonna make me money"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I spent a lot of time researching this company. If you want to check specific info from my DD, just tell me and I will provide the link.If you want to learn more about the company, just to go the investment relations  section of their website."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its weird how many DD's there are on PLTR.. The company looks great.. the company has a lot of future growth.. the stock is at a great price to buy and hold for 3-5 years.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theyve reported earnings beats on the only two calls they've had. 

Also I don't think they have any debts - or if they do they're tiny compared to the 1.8🅱️illy they have in cash.

Pretty sure their most recent earnings call announced that they were technically profitable for Q4 2020, but chose to do a huge SBC which made their GAAP earnings (which includes SBC) negative."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,scared money don't make money
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you think ARK is buying it? For shits and gigs?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Future cash flows
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Companies are prohibited from developing internal software while using Palantir. Once they sign, they are stuck with them."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying options is just gambling and its worse when the hedge funds manipulate the price to keep options OTM. Best thing you can do is sell options (half to all of your position) and collect premiums while you wait. If it gets called away then wait for a dip and buy back in and repeat.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you sell covered calls on it?
I have 200, looking to avg down and get 300 more and then sell CCs at high OTM prices and enjoy collecting small premiums"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You´re always smarter afterwards
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I knew it would dip after their rocket session, but I didn't know it would be a forever dip. I'm still buying and holding shares. I'm too emotional with PLTR to play options right now because I trust this company will do well, but they will do well in 2023"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Know that feeling all too well.  Hope you make it up elsewhere.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm $10k down
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm down 7k out of 30k, so almost 1/3 of my portfolio"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Put $2000 into 88 Energy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally bought a bunch at 28 like either the morning of or the day before that 45 spike. Should've sold but whatever. Added more around there thinking the rocket was taking off but here we are at 21.xx and I can barely make myself buy anything else. I'm out of lump sum money so I just keep adding a share or two every pay day. Way underwater but whatever. Alex Karps hair is easily worth 50/share.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Going tits up means the opposite of what you are saying...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If one more gme tard says this I'm going to punch my screen.  ""If i go to Valhalla I'm going to help you little guys stuck in reverse""  FU  just put some money in you bitches.  <not bitter>"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"22.50 seemed to be the unofficial level of support now I’m guessing it’s 20 but who are we kidding, this shit can go to 15$ if nothing positive"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,19.02
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What’s even better is he is one of the rare Golden Magikarp. 

When that shit evolves, record breaking tidal waves will crash across the oceans spurring monsoons of biblical proportions. 

💎Long PLTR💎"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  I'm a data analyst.  I know what direction the world is headed.  

I've seen the ""sausage making"" at Palantir first-hand via the Army VANTAGE contract/project.  Having seen what they can do with an enterprise as monolithically incompetent and willfully disruptive to its vendors as the US Army, I strongly believe that they're headed for becoming one of those quiet global monopolies that dominates a small, lucrative, and almost invisible-to-the-uninformed sector.

In 15-20 years I would be unsurprised to see them multiply their business 40x.  As long as my thesis that this growth is achievable seems realistic, I'm going to hold.  Where I don't want to be is the guy who sold amazon at 1000% returns and missed the 50,000% payday.

I have a few shares auto-buying every month."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you been hiding under a rock the last 3 months?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's a psycho that you wouldn't want to talk to or be friends with, but he makes money."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I would really love to read about the lvl 6 information you mentioned in the deal with DoD
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the play on PLTR is more boomer than wsb imo. I think it just gets memed on here because of Karp and the fact that its named after a LOTR reference.

I mean Karp has literally said fuck off with your short term plays on PLTR, long hodlers only."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,SBC?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hate to tell you this, just just because a fund buys something doesn’t mean it’s a good play. She bought 1M over $25 per share, Just last week.  Horrible entry."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every company has that. There’s nothing saying this company will grow their sales at any rapid pace. The market is too niche. They are making pennies compared to the likes of other defense companies like NOC , LMT, RTX , etc. 

Yet they are valued higher than some of them . It’s gonna be decades before they even come close to making 10b a year. It took em fucking 17 years just to get to 1b lmfao. That’s a joke."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s no way that’s true. That would be such a ridiculous contract requirement that no major defense company would ever use PLTR.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm still dumb tho :(
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a bloody expensive education though haha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to continue doing CSPs and CCs for the rest of the year. I believe in them longterm.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, me too lol. The ARK funds are hurting me a bit right now, and I'm not getting out of my NAT position it seems like (but I did make a good amount selling $4 May CCs, I have big doubt they will get there)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont have 10k to be down but I am down 35% on PLTR and Blackberry
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost same here :-/ 

I knew it was a long term play, but -28% is also a long way to go..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope it does.  I will yolo my whole ( modest) TFSA if it hits $15
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you post your thesis. It would be very insightful
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a fellow DoD data analyst, I couldn't agree more."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, most (if not all) people believing in an imminent squeeze denies that there was one in January. Few ppl seems to believe a second squeeze is likely. Do you?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a cult member would call someone a cry baby for stating facts.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have seen the lvl 6 info he referenced, will link the graphic if I find it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah he was pretty blunt.. but it’s a long term play so not wrong
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone says that until it reaches $200 a share. Then it’s like “Damn!”
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So why would anyone buy it? Surely you know enough about it to have a bull thesis
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm sure you selling your 50 shares at a 10% loss is gonna hurt them
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everybody investing in the stock market will learn those lessons the hard way  : /. My father sold Shopify at 150 because they didn´t do anything for a while and then they want up to 1k.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At work, so I don't have all my numbers handy, but broadly speaking: they've got a ton of revenue based off of relationships with the DoD, BP and Airbus.  What nobody wants to talk about is what Palantir is *actually* selling--and that's an infrastructure that's very tight, very carefully managed, and very, very, VERY intentionally engineered (from a systems perspective).

Their product keeps getting better.  Every time they take on a new client, they make improvements to their CORE PRODUCT.  All of those investments carry over to each new customer, for as long as they keep their focus on absolutely, carefully executing those changes.  

As industries become more and more data driven, the value they bring will increase.  Furthermore, as electric vehicles take off, more major structural networks (power grid, for example) are going to rise in importance and potential profitability.  What doesn't increase is Palantir's cost to develop business--their core team of experts has a finite capacity at any time to onboard new clients without compromising the product integrity, but I think it's unlikely that clients *leave*.  And so, the stage is set for a steamroll--learning-curve gains in new business as their product develops, revenues remaining relatively static after initial onboarding of new clients, and a competitive incentive for clients to retain Palantir vs in-housing the required talent.

For industries that are going to live-or-die by the kinds of analytics Palantir enables, their choices are to develop a strong in-house team, or pay palantir (or one of their competitors).  Unlike with the classic OR aspects of these network-problem centric industries, the real-time management with enhanced data analytics isn't something your small team of math PhD's can solve in six months--it's a continuous, real-time effort that requires computational resources and a data infrastructure that sandboxed academic cells can't really replicate in a competitive, cost-efficient manner."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short interest is not being reported correctly, and there is evidence of shorts being hidden in ETFs.

There's a lot of sketchy activity with the media as well trying to push a narrative that shorts covered but they obviously didn't.

It's clear when you see the spike from $40 in February and subsequent spikes in March that were obviously not fueled by retail that something extraordinary is happening.

Before you say those spikes were retail driven, they clearly were not. Volume normally stays low, the spikes come with sudden high volume buying seemingly randomly through the day. Retail doesn't coordinate buying like that. In my opinion, this is market makers hedging for changes in delta.

The sell offs are also most likely MMs hedging for changes in delta and flooding the market with additional shares that retail is slowly buying up and tightening supply. This is fueling the gamma squeeze everyone keeps talking about. Could also be naked short selling but I don't know why shorts would dig the hold deeper for themselves."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, but, the sQuEeZe!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no question that tinfoil hats has their uses..

But if we take them off we can see that shorting GME through ETFs makes no sense at all. See this post:

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/_/grpfor0/?context=1

And how do you explain that cost to borrow GME shares are at an all time low, more than 100x lower than during the squeeze back in January. It nicely corroborates the official short interest data. 

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of things that don't make sense. Like why the interest rate to short is so low, but there are still so few shares available to short. And why brokers have so many seemingly unnecessary restrictions on the ticker.

The biggest piece of evidence is the obvious non-retail driven spikes. This behaves like something with high short interest and low supply, yet the numbers don't add up.

Make your move accordingly, I already did."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say they make a lot of sense due to the whole market plummeting every time gme goes up
2021-03-29 18:45:34,wallstreetbets,"$YETI Trade Idea Trade: $YETI 7 MAY $67 Calls from present till 28 April

Thesis:$YETI bottomed out its Implied Volatility cycle and is running sideways on a rollercoaster. I'm 'Rooish on the stock. As implied volatility increases up to the peak of the cycle it will drive up the Extrinsic Value of the Calls. Meanwhile the Intrinsic Value of the calls will increase during the upswings of the rollercoaster

There is an opportunity to maximize profit by converging these two forces, selling on the upswing of intrinsic and extrinsic value which should occur roughly around 28 April.

Price target on 7 May (Strike): $70 but it doesnt matter

How did I arrive at this number? I drew lines on a chart with my fingers and guesstimated. So its fake and means nothing. It’s also the average price of the rollercoaster IMO, I think the coaster is shrinking but should at least average to $70.

Price target on 28 April (profit day): $67.27-73.86

Am I allowed to offer a range as a price target? I don’t know.

The $67.27 is where I believe the implied volatility cycle peaks and intersects with the bottoming out of the rollercoaster, which is the worst case outcome, low intrinsic as extrinsic maxes, but you take a profit mostly of the extrinsic and a very small gain in intrinsic.

The $73.86 is the peak of the coaster around the implied volatility and peak. intrinsic to the tits. extrinsic pretty damn high.

Why do I think it plays out this way? The Greeks and The Underlying -

Greeks: Delta 0.7 Theta (0.0544) Vega 0.0841 - I fully believe the implied volatility will increase from about .53 to .8 driving the extrinsic up by about $2 over the next 30 days, hedging the $1.63 theta decay.

Breakeven on implied volatility gains against the theta decay is an increase of implied volatility by .19 to .72. Also, I’m anticipating exiting the position early negating the last bit of Theta Decay. Basically, sell on the upswing closest to 28 APR.

The Underlying:

Earnings: projected earnings to occur 6 May, meaning I expect the implied volatility cycle to increase to peak or near-peak by 28 April, just a bit before earnings

Earnings outlook: $YETI is strapped with cash and just expanded further in the consumer space to bags. Anecdotally I feel its the case that YETI has an unusually high attach rate for the space its in. I think people will think YETI is reporting favorable earnings, driving the price up on its way to earnings.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They have beat earnings by an impressive amount the last several quarters. If you have ever been on ANY boat at a lake then it’s easy to see what a “status symbol” they are. I am just wondering how good they will continue to do after everyone goes back to work. They had a very good year last year because of the demand from so many people participating in outdoor activities. I hope you’re correct about them Any company that makes a quality product should be rewarded. Nice dd as well.  Thank you.

2021-03-29 18:16:12,wallstreetbets,"How to play BB earnings in a conservative WSB style So if you retards have made it past the wall of GME, I'm going to drop some knowledge of how to play BB and not bankrupt yourself.

The key here is that you believe BB will be going up in the next 6 months. If you don't think that and don't buy the other posted DD's then don't bother with my strategy.

My theory is that the stock will be back over 10$ a share in the next month or so. I'm willing to buy a 1000 shares at this price. Instead of just buying them for 9.6 this morning, I sold 10 CSP (Cash Secured Puts) for $950 that expire on 4/1. This means if the stock is less than 10$ at market close Thursday, I'll be buying 1000 shares for 10k.

If I wanted to be really safe, that'd put my cost basis at $9.05 a share. But this is WSB and I want to play earnings so fuck that. I immediately used my $950 cash to buy some FD's. 19x 4/1 10C.

TLDR: Read above to get free BB lottery tickets.

Positions: -10x CSP 4/1 10p

Free Lottery Tickets: 19x 4/1 10c

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 23$, the timing holy fuck"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought in awhile back at 26. Are we predicting something higher than it is now? Or sell out and take my small profit
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it’s Gonna be a good week
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got $25.21* for my 10 shares this morning.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I could've used this rally on Friday NGL. Big sad.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we thinking this is gonna continue to rise?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I finally did a day trade right. I sold the right when it was at its peak today and then brought back in at the low point

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS POST IS A DISTRACTION BY THE HEDGE FUNDS TO EAT YOUR TENDIES AND FUCK YOU GF'S BF'S GME SHARES IN THE BUTTHOLE
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s 20 thousand dollars a year before taxes at the last dividend payment rate
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I avoid anything that gets mentioned here. I like the lulz though, I'm here just for that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT made my dick limp today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your goal price here?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you do lol??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Up $10 from when I bought my mighty 4 shares :)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"yea, i've got 15 options left, but would have been nice last friday when the other 25 died otm."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term, yes. Short term, no."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,lol this guy!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Without fail the bastard always gets your hopes up only to fade by 11am.  1300 shares here, and really annoyed that this money maker flops around like a turd everyday."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$50+
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome aboard, please keep all appendages inside the RKT at all times. You are scheduled for a your destination of 'The light side of the moon'. Thank you for flying RKT."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubtful long term either. I just don’t see it being a long term stock especially since the market is teetering right now.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It wouldn’t be wsb without this guy.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's cool but I was asking that dude cuz he is a fucking WSB legend

$35k - $1.75million in a year via GME and CRSR, and now he thinks RKT is the big play"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh I mean with the absurd amount of revenue this company cranks out  and how quickly it's branching into other sectors, I do no see this Stock going down long but stranger things have happened I guess."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been following him for some time now as well!
2021-03-29 17:55:15,wallstreetbets,"RKT 🚀🚀🚀, Hedge Fund ARCHEGOES had 40B short exposure and the price action looks like RKT was in his short book and is being covered now!!!! 🚀🚀🚀 + MOAR &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bsszab850zp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba55d9db2b33a9f30163afa70f670c4867c4a48d

So if you were trading late Friday as I was, you noticed the crazy EOD upward action in the SPY **AND RKT** (pictured above)

We found out over the weekend that a major HF blew up on Friday. Archegoes had 15 Billion in capital that they used for 80 Billion in longs and **40 BILLION IN SHORT TRADES.**

Right now the long side of the book is making all news **BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT 40 BILLION SHORT BOOK????**

Notice how EOD Friday the SPY **AND RKT** shot straight up together? We know Archegoes was short the SPY and judging by the price action in RKT I would say they were also going short RKT (ie: long rates and short mortgage brokers)

**HOWEVER**

RKT is more of a fintech than a traditional mortgage broker **AND RKT PRINTS MONEY  \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\]**

Here are some fun RKT stats:

***RKT made 15 bill last year and 9 of that was NET income***

108 million share float

112 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders

BILLION $$$ Buy Back

Guided Q1 UUUPPPP 90%-99% YoY (I heard they are running +150% and **Q1 will BLOW OUT TO THE UPSIDE**)

Do what you will with this guessformation (RKT EOY EPS = $6 = ***RKT HUGELY UNDER VALUED CURRENTLY***)

&#x200B;

***EDIT #1 🚀🚀🚀 \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\] 🚀🚀🚀  169,000 CALLS vs. 64,000 puts 11:35am YEET THE PRICE IS NEGATIVE, SOMEONE BIG IS WORRIED ABOUT RKT 🛸🛸🛸*** 

Makes this 💎🦍💎 wonder how many 🍌🍌🍌 are in the tree? 

I am long 9,000 shrs, 6/18c $22.89, 9/17c $23.89

Just kidding!

*maniacal hedge fund laughter*"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not aging well midday, hopefully it turns around."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I bought a $4 contract. Already made $4 off it. That’s 2-1. This is my biggest win yet. Thanks wsb.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I missed the RKT train last time.  For $24, I'll sit on the launch pad."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Archegos* 

I bet their egos aren't so arch today."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So RKT is being squeezed? That’s the crayon flavor I get from this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy volume but this bitch stalled again. What’s going to push this past $30?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What dash is that for fellow young ape?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So... is this a buy and hold scenario?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 23$ babyyy, lets fucking get it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket will surprise 🥁
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost the timing, fucking meetings, cheers for all of you who made a quick 10% :)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"let's juice up some gamma here, the near TM calls aren't that bad rn"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ROCKETS DONT REFUEL SO WE HAD TO SEND ANOTHER ONE 🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And..... that was anticlimactic.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense with the dark pool bail out trade by MS at a markUP!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When your Robinhood brokerage transfer was put on hold last week due to expiring options and they start the transfer again today when your RKT options are finally green by 200%+. How gamer.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love rocket. Bought a nice big chunk last week when it was high $22 low $23 ish range, loved the discount. Not even caring about “squeezes” or anything else short term. I’ll see y’all in a decade or so when I’m buying a lambo with my rocket profits. I’m thinking black, nice and classy"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ok i'm in. Flying to $50 by EOW?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh good now I'm only down 10%
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT about to rekt again lmaoooo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It shot right back down wtf
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems to be taking a breather at 24.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao fuk
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I grabbed a share to hold. 🦍 help 🦍"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not falling for this one...again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol last ditch effort to dump the shares on you guys, look at that immediate price drop to normal 👀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have a link?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So  ow that's all over, does this mean IV goes up? That's how that works right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ELi5?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pain.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wondering what software you are using there.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's my problem. Look at the balance sheet

Rev is 9.8 billion but they pay 9.2 billion as an expense to rocket holdings if I am reading it right"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean... 377 million volume on the 2nd of March and another 148 million the next trading day.

It's entirely possible they covered a lot of their exposure. I don't expect any other movements until it's already being reported.

I believe there is more shirt interest but I also think they're closing out these hedges and resolving margin calls slowly, quietly, and orderly.

If you believe there are more entities at play here, shorting because the SEC has been turning a blind eye to things for another decade.... then you're probably on point."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot DISCLAIMER 3:  Bear in mind I am a autistic retard.

Mind you, that could be seen as bragging."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We're taking the alternate route I see...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,and ends the day in the red lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Less than 10 mentions on Friday, less than 20 mentions before opening bell. 80 right after opening bell. Yep, not going to burn me twice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Misleading title. The 40Bn short is not in RKT
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short ladder attacks...sorry, I forgot I'm not in the cult anymore, carry on with your tendies."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Aaand it’s down again
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in

Edit: nvm i noped it out after losing  -20% in 10 mins"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll pass..

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's crazy.  They close a million short shares,  then 5 minutes later someone shorts it another million shares. At least the fee went up .1% /s"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT's trying to moon from down deep in a silo.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to tip Uncle Sam $1
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,With how rkt ate uwmc I'm surprised your shares didn't convert.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,actually picked up a few shares of uwmc myself today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There he is
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The 🐐 himself
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My 1,500 were sitting pretty, too! I've made RKT my big bet after Palantir decided to be a bitch."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought too high as well and averaged down with the dips.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,21 and more than doubled at 37 to average at 31.. oops.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Detroit Power!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh this shit has a possibility of a squeeze, and a buyback. Actually makes money too."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's up a dollar so not yet lol

Literally I've never seen wsb be correct about anything, won't be surprised when none of these stocks squeeze. Gme included.

Edit: dawwww did I hit a nerve? You can be mad at this comment or you could cash in your gains. Your choice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"lot of shares shorted when it got to 27, just need volume to push it back up a bit and it'll fly."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No idea but look out when it finally breaks is my guess 💎🦍💎 🍌🍌🍌
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to ask the same.   I think it is ThinkOrSwim, but us monopoly money carrying Canadian apes do not have access to it so I cant confirm.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ThinkorSwim on TDA
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is RKT it'll be back at 22 by Wednesday and ready to do this again 2-3 times this month.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was holding a 4/1 c as well, just happened to check my app as the price was bouncing around 26.50,
Closed that sucker quick for a nice 115% gain"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I was like 50% in... but still heavily invested.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT explicitly uses SpaceX rockets in their fleet. 

Currently refueling"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Test flight of the Rocket Lab Electron rocket this morning for Rocket Company. Getting ready for the Rocket Lab Neutron launch this afternoon! 🚀🌕
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Between that and this DD, I may be tempted to buy my first ever FD on a call of RKT. I have a secure position to get some of the pie if it starts moving again, but a little extra never hurts!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuk no.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip and average down!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,😎 🍺
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha what a dumbass.  I sold at $26.19
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just watched it drop to mid 25. 
Seems not so stupid after all."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,#%#%# retard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought at an average of 23 first time around, made a hefty profit (sold all the way from 27 to mid 30s).

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I clearly said he had a 40B short book and the price action looks like RKT was in his short book.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we know what its in?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gotta look in daily thread for the real DD imo. I've been telling people $23 was a great entry for RKT, and I sold a bunch this morning around $27. I was also telling people to get in at $20 before it mooned to $45, where I sold my shares again."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of GME pre $20 🚀🤑🚀🤑 💦💦💦

At least with RKT it is printing $$$ and earnings will be YUGE"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the tip
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,rofl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold and u will be fine what sucks on days like this and wich is still a learning curve for me  i guess is that i could have sold at a profit and bought back for less like 10 times now from first peak. 
Averaging down is less profitable then above method. 
In other words i need to learn how to sell with a profit and buy back for less🤣"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Could have been me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly is your definition of 'right' then? Because I'd say going from a $10 dollar stock to $450 is definitely a squeeze.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re retarded if you think this is why people own rkt. Anyone that bought for a squeeze is retarded, but can hold long."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"don't know why you're being downvoted so hard, ur comment helped to make me realize my 100% gain on my 27.50c right before the tank lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I've already banked $30k in my Roth IRA.  I'll take WSB being wrong all day long if I get those results.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"A couple days ago, when nobody cared about this stock anymore"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, yeah pretty much!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"the only major move i see in RKT was back on 3/2 when it spiked to 41, i caught it on the downside from there, at 24.69.. has barely touched a little more than that in the days since, and barely touched a little less than that.  granted, that's a 20% bump since before the 3/2 rocket ride, so that's nice for people who missed the jump but are still long on it from before.

On the bright side anyone holding through that also picked up the $1.11 special dividend.. and it wouldn't surprise me if they started doing regular divvies again."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought way OTM a month ago. I’m still way down. Should’ve sold it today at the peak could’ve reduced my loss by half.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How does it land though?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah there was no people on this one... Just a test flight...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Srsly, maybe more like end of june."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but I also saw it rise to 27, which was my initial selling point at market open 😅"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmao down to 24 now, I feel a bit better"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good on you, sir, really good. Just don't get caught in the diamond hand gang on this one. The average comments and reactions skyrocketing at bell with no considerable DD beyond they ""MIGHT"" be in the Credit Suisse portfolio and that is the reason it has went up a couple dollars screams sus. 

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people sold some of their $GME and $AMC portfolio to get in the first time. I think they're trying to do it again to leverage the catalyst the Credit Suisse means for the other stocks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I know. Just saying the title might be a bit misleading
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He was long $gsx so likely short the other Chinese Edu stocks (which all jumped like crazy Friday). He didn’t have to declare so you just have to try and suss it out
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"i sold my rkt early end of day last friday. only 6 shares with marginal gain but i’m kicking myself just a lil. i’ll be back on that ride in 30 days tho better believe it, shit peaks like clockwork."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They just had earnings and rkt hasn’t printed anything
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's all he wants honestly. Just a little bit from everybody.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its hard to determine when to sell. I took today as an opportunity to sell a portion of my shares for a profit in order to hopefully buy again under my current average cost. I think this company is under valued and I like the stock.

If I hadn't bought the dips I would still be in the red."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then why yall still holding and posting every day about a play that's been dead for two months? Nostalgia?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Spikes on this one tend to die out the same day like this one has (so far). Day traders probably love this stock since it behaves more like a rock than a rocket anytime it goes up in the morning.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mine was just OTM when I bought it last week
Strike 24.89, if I would have held another 5 mins I could be up 200% so kind of kicking myself for that but I’m pretty happy and lucky with what I got."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"depends on how high it goes.  if it gets to orbit, it might be coming back in chunks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you see, Space X rockets use fuel to go up and also use fuel to land safely. Fuel can be translated to Volume for RKT stock. So therefore you will see a sharp increase in volume as the RKT stock launches and as RKT stock lands back to the earth around $24. 
 
 
Volume = 🚀 and Volume = ☄ thanks to the shorts"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess so...

Literally everyone who browsed here before Jan fuvking hates you idiots and wishes you could get a clue.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm sure yall will hold to the dirt just like you did when it hit 480

Diamond hands baby lol you're all retarded af"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I was planning on closing mine today as soon as it got close to my buy-in before theta gang got me.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rkt stock has shown high residence at 22. Ive already doubled my money and reinvested at a similar price point. Simply wall street values the company at 34$ per share. Most of us value the company at 40$+. Theres a variety of things they do that competitors don’t while talking great profits from other avenues. 

You just don’t know what you’re talking about. This is a real stock. 

& I believe gme will blow, but I don’t have anything invested. Rkt is my play, I understand the company to a t."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell for those 600% gains? Or did you hold? If you're still holding you're an idiot.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"DD means due diligence you absolute clown.

Exactly what I'm talking about, another ape without a brain. I'm sure you will give everything you make on gme back to the stock market."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this guys post history is literally just him tryna get ppl to sell, even made a post around March 4 calling ppl bagholders on gme when it’s $50 up since then.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom and Discovery hopefully hit bottom today. I opened up a 4/9 call position. Premiums in low 2s. Figuring it is a low risk. High reward opportunity.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone still recommend $ASS or $CUM?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So looking at viacom ($VIAC?) they crashed on the 22nd of march from 100.34$ to 46$ (at the time of this post) Do you guys think it's worth investing in?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market is flooded with shares at the end of a quarter on a day with uncertainty from the Suez Canal’s 6 day long shutdown ripple affect.  

Non-Indexed Funds - Mutual, Hedge, and ETF - are going to buy bonds and sit on cash to ride out.  Its been a rough month.  Very few will be buying stocks and risk a further plunge or margin call before the quarter ends screwing up their last placement.  Sit on cash and count your early quarter gains.

Not sure if it picks up on 4/1 either, since its before a long holiday which makes for 3 long days that news can bite you when you can’t move.

Short crap news from OPEC or the Bond market, next week will be better if no other big funds pop from over leverage.  If they do, good luck, cause no one will be safe until summer."

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw a hit peace that Morgan Stanley is selling a block order of 20 million shares, I smell horse shit concedering invesco holds the most and that position is just over 10 million shares. I think Morgan stanly is our big whale short thats been trashing rocket since IPO. This week is gonna be bloody hilarious"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It sure is. And Dearborn is part of the Metro Detroit area.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sold for a premium, $25.26+ ..... 

Everyone knows"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is a conspiracy, few things are in fact."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"True true, I guess I'm referring to downtown Detroit"
2021-03-29 17:00:01,wallstreetbets,"I was advised to post this here, did not know PLTR was a “meme stock”. I just like the stock, I guess I’ll have to buy some GME now as well 💎✋🚀. "
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Welcome to the kingdom of retards. We like the stock here too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rich retard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your avg is still fairly low bro. You’ll be fine

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Would highly recommend moving that out of Robinhood and to a better brokerage
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You go girl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,MagiKarp will take us to the moon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hold that shit. Slow cooked tendies will be yours. Aunt Cathie said so
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey our portfolio diversity is the same, you just have way more money than me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re gonna be in the two comma club in 2-3 years off this alone
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, one meme stock and you're obligated to purchase at least 1 share of GME. Those are the rules!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol.  I saw this post and remembered I own it!!!  Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How TF you have almost a million dollars invested but you're still using RH?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You will be a millionaire one day
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, now my 120 shares feel a bit inadequate 🙁"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I didn’t realize people were this dumb outside of this sub. Welcome brother
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You can make some good money selling calls on this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy moly
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why Aunt Kathy gotta come flex on us?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only PLTR memes I ever see are about how it's not doing very well.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Long on both. But there's no such thing as meme stocks... Just good companies that are over shorted. That's the deal here at WSB...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Andddd I’m still buying the dip
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robin hood christ almighty
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry you are a long term Investor anyway. 👍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR PLS FLY AGAIN!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, Palantir is a meme stock? How? Why?

Ive been holding since summer, but didnt even know"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn..multi millionaire with this soon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,you'll be fine in the long run
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a lowly 11 shares.  I have been dumping the less promising stonks.  PLTR to the moon!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You was better off buying gme!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a meme stock, good growth potential stock. Let’s see what happens in a few years"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Only up from here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck is PLTR shittin the bed?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Palantir is NOT a meme stock. Keep holding OP, this will be in the 100s in it next 2-5 years."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll never understand these half a million dollar retards that use Robinhood. I'd never let those fuckers near any significant amount of money. Maybe they're just rich AF and this IS pocket change for meme like my tiny positions but I wouldn't trust them with more than a grand of my money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t use RH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shouldve spent all that meme money on gme
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy one meme stock, you have to at least buy GME and AMC. It’s a package deal!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You idiot
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GME then PLTR...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their Csuite executives are selling their shares and the retards here are buying. Makes a ton of sense. 

This stock isn’t even shorted."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gnarly.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR trades at 28X forward sales estimates. Can anyone explain to me why this company would be worth buying. They hav even in business for 17 years and STILL LOSE money every year.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Eventually😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget to stop and get some gas station boner pills
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Any advice as to how? Maybe a suggestion of a brokerage that you like to use?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have multiple brokerage accounts, this is just where I make highly risky bets. I’m new to WSB, but I know RH is a horrible company... but I’ve also made a lot of tendies on RH, I have no allegiance to the company... but I’d like to keep my crayon eating yolo bets separate from my retirement accounts."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold my 3rd entry to GME up in the 200s a couple-few back. Couldnt stay away and bought back in at my highest cost basis yet, $196.

I also like PLTR."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie damn it! C A T H I E
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not going to argue against that, I’d definitely be in the green if I’d Bought GME. Though I’m long pltr, I will just buy more if it dips considerably."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m definitely long PLTR and will buy more of it dips below 17.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not my only brokerage account, the reason why I have a half million in here is because I made the vast majority of it on RobinHood. Sorry I’m new to WSB, was told by a friend that people would enjoy this here. I was not part of the GME(wish I was) stuff and RH has the lowest interest rates, if I ever need to use margin(margin saved my ass last March and allowed me to double down). Though I’m definitely a dyslexic retard when it comes to investing, by any classical risk diversification standard. If I like the stock I go all in and hold until it doubles and thankfully it’s always worked. Plus it helps with taxes to hold things for over a year... that’s my two cents/ investing thesis 🍌🦧"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TrashApp
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"people buying into a company that has 1% penetration in a potentially 100+ billion$ industry is why.  I'm not saying the fundamentals make sense, but it's pretty clear why some here value it highly long-term."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,you dont understand stocks nor how businesses grow apparently
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've tried Robinhood, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade. I would recommend Robinhood for pretty graphs and nothing else, Fidelity is alright but doesn't look very friendly and is difficult to see live adjustments to bids and asks prices. TD Ameritrade is my personal recommendation but I've heard that their support is pretty bad (Take that as you will). Currently I have 1 stock in Fidelity and the rest in TD Ameritrade. I should also add that TD Ameritrade takes about a week to register and 2-3 days before you can deposit your cash to actually use in stocks. It's always good to have cash in beforehand."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use think or swim to trade. I’d recommend Charles Schwab too but their app sucks if that’s something you care about. 

I still use Robinhood for the cute graphs and I keep a monthly dividend stock in there so they have to send me statements every month rather than quarter."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are in a hurry, make sure you no longer have any options open on RH, because it takes up to 5 business days to apply for options on a brokerage account and up to 7 business days for a transfer (your options will not transfer over otherwise). Turn off your gold account to turn off margin, because apparently if you don't, shares will transfer as shares bought on margin.

I would suggest Fidelity or Vanguard, Fidelity because they have a good interface and app; Vanguard is currently trying to catch up in the front end, but it is also a solid broker."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets, used TD Ameritrade
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried RH at first, but was underwhelmed with their speed of having funds available when I need them.  I just go with my bank, Chase.  So far they are very good at making the trades I want, and if I push money  to the account, it is available almost immediately.  Not a pro, hell, I am note even an ape.  Maybe a tiny marmoset or tamarind."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If „only“ your highly risky brokerage account is worth $650,000, you definitely fuck!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You actively get worse prices for buying/selling options on RH because of the way they play match maker to make money to create ""fee free investing""."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL I've bought ""dips"" that weren't real dips but it was how I justified buying more. I had PLTR and jumped out to buy more GME. Not much liquidity so I've kinda went all in for GME with a little BB waiting on 4Q earnings coming out this week."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Her too!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah nice. Thanks I appreciate your input! I've heard good things about Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, I also hear pretty good things about Vanguard. I'm thinking of trying them. 

I hear a lot of people who have left Robinhood just use it now to watch the live adjustments and that's about it lol! I plan on doing that also =P"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just want to say that I was approved for trading, with lvl2 options, in about 24 hours.  I had no issues depositing, and had access to the funds that day.  The only thing that I'm currently waiting on is approval for a checking account/cash account debit card.  I also don't use margin, cash account only, and only applied for lvl2 options."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am only holding shares at the moment, and im not really in a hurry I just don't want to loose out on my position. If I move brokerages don't I have to sell all my current positions then move funds then repurchase my positions? So I will loose out on my average price rite? Making my overall number of shares go down a lot?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, he fucked my wife"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"k then why are you asking me? Do whatever you want

I have made more $ on stocks than your net worth. But keep doing what you're doing then pal"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah Robinhood is admittedly nice looking and easy to buy at market price. But it is a bit uneasy to buy or sell in limits since they don't provide a number of how many bidders and askers there are. So you'd probably be paying a little bit extra per stock at market price. Never tried Vanguard but I may look into it. I'm also very into Penny Stocks that are on TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. It's like adding money for retirement if that Penny stock goes 400%+ over the next few months or years.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I moved from RH to Vanguard.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend them based on my experience.  First, they won't reimburse the $75 ACAT transfer fee, if this was my only issue then I wouldn't hold that against them. Two, it took a full week to do the transfer, and when it was completed, all my stocks appeared in my account as margin. This was a pain in the ass to get fixed (and was probably Robinhood's fault), the first time I called Vanguard, they told me the transfer should have never gone through the first time and that they were suggesting we reverse the transfer and do it again (I hung up once that was suggested as I didn't want to go another 7 days with my assets frozen).  

I called back later in the day, talked to a different rep, explained my issue and he was able to resolve it (took 24 hrs, finally resolved, no asset transferring needed to be done).

Throughout this process, I wired some money to my account so I could have some capital to trade with (as my previous assets were on hold during the transfer process).  Even though the money cleared my account, it was still put on hold for 7 full days before I could begin using it due to having a new account.

I'm not sure if Fidelity or other brokerages work like this, but it was a lot of work to do something simple.  If you're transferring from RH, please be careful if you're transferring any options."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you move assets as ""in-kind"" (which is a typical transfer), you get to keep the shares you bought at your cost basis. Bear in mind that your RH account will be locked for the duration (standard procedure), so you can only buy/sell in your new brokerage account. RH charges a $75 transfer fee, but Fidelity and Vanguard typically (I think) cover it on their end; either way make sure you have $75 ready in your bank account just in case.

The additional issue is that Robinhood is on a backlog of sending brokers your cost-basis (apparently too many people transferred out, so they are behind their work), so your cost basis will be wrong for a while. They are legally obliged to send your broker the correct cost basis in time (up to a month iirc), though.

I believe (someone correct me if I am wrong) however, that the information reported on your tax form 1099 should be correct in the end, but the information on your new brokerage account will be incorrect for a while until RH gets off their asses. It's a small downside for peace of mind though, I think.

You can manually request an update to your cost basis, but afaik you'll have to provide Fidelity and Vanguard with the exact cost of all the shares (each share has a unique ID)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screen shot account I bet mine is larger.

Btw I didn’t ask anything from you, you’re just upset your bag holding because you don’t understand stock valuations."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What I did was open a TD Ameritrade account and transfer my positions from robinhood. Than I made a new checking with my bank specifically for depositing money into TD because it take a week or so to fully transfer and my reoccurring transactions were killing me by taking the money out before TD can (I’m incredibly irresponsible with autopay.) Now I put a set amount in that account from my savings instead of my normal every day accounts and I just let it sit until TD pulls it out 1-2 weeks later
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang! I'm sorry to hear that it's been such a headache for you but I do appreciate your input! I will consider this when making my decision
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for your reply. I'm going to check into this today! I really appreciate your info!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard is best for buy and hold long terms or minimal trading. They charge $1/option contract (higher than traditional brokerage) and has the worst UI on both app and site. 

They do have great support though but this is expected of the big boys."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forgot to say that if you experience an issue with your transfer/account, call up a rep at Fidelity or Vanguard and speak directly. They'll usually get your issues resolved and answer all your questions. This is just a good thing to do in general, and a service you won't get with RH."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with Charles Schwab and the process is the same, also offers fee reimbursement.  It’s a boomer app like the others so the (mobile) UI is meh. Supposedly desktop is better."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,65-cent options at Fidelity.
2021-03-29 16:59:29,wallstreetbets,AMC YOLO - Another quarter million shares tied up for you guys!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"genuine question: If GME truly takes of in within a few weeks or months, and the entire market crashes around it... wouldn't politicians worldwide intervene to avoid a repeat with AMC 6 months later??"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf. Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone buy this ape a beer! 🦍🍺

These shares will be worth $2-4 after that is done.

Well done!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are aware that AMC is a distraction. They (AMC) are cashing out of the rise, selling you out for quick profits at the cost of the long game. GME is the real battle. You are getting played."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should have bought GME

Try again"

2021-03-29 16:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Alexion ($ALXN): Opportunity to buy AstraZeneca ($AZN) at a discount (quick & dirty DD) Alexion Pharmaceuticals ($ALXN) is being acquired by AstraZeneca ($AZN). The cash and stock deal was announced on December 12th, 2020 

(see AZN's release: [https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html)).

Here are the most important sections, about the price paid to ALXN shareholders and about the closing:

 *""****Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares*** *(ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.""*

*"" Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition,* ***the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.*** *""*

&#x200B;

Based on recent changes in relative prices, those who may be interested in buying AZN shares could acquire them at a discount via ALXN. 

Today's pre-market prices: AZN ADR $50,63 / ALXN $154,88

If the deal goes through (which is not a certainty at this stage; although I am no expert in regulatory aspects it seems unlikely to me that the deal might be blocked), the offer of AZN would value ALXN at $167.55/share ($60 + 2.1243 x $50.63), which is $12.67 (or 8.2%) above ALXN's current price. 

So, if you consider buying AZN, you may opt for the ALXN route which would give you a better entry price and some downside protection (discount + cash component of the offer). 

&#x200B;

Of course, this is also an opportunity for arbitrageurs (Buy ALXN, short AZN) for those who are into that kind of strategies. The exchange ratio would require to be rounded (e.g., at 2.124x, you could trade multiples of 250; at 2.125x multiples of 8). Do not forget to include transaction costs and borrow rates in the equation.

NB: I have no exposure to any of those company at the time I write this."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"***2.1243 ADS \* 0.5 = 1,06215 AZN***"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The calculation is somewhat confusing.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The gap is to compensate for the risk that the deal falls through. The bigger the gap, the bigger the risk. Contrary to popular belief there is no arbitrage in an M&A deal. Just people betting on a binary event. If you’re right you get paid, if you’re wrong, you typically lose your ass."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice post
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pry Stin.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically if their Q3 meets satisfaction 1 share of AXLN is equal to just a little over 2 shares of AZN plus 60 m dollars plus the share of ALXN you buy?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, let me rephrase: 

If the deal gets approved (which is targeted to happen before the end of Q3 2021),  for every share of ALXN that you own, you will receive 2.1243 shares of AZN + $60 in cash (but you would no longer hold any ALXN at this point, as the company would be part of AZN and be delisted).  

As of today's prices, ALXN trades at a discount to ""deal parity"", meaning that you can buy ALXN and wait to be converted into AZN (again, assuming the deal is successful). That would be a better entry price than buying AZN today in the market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I see thanks. That makes sense now

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets," Viacom was doing well due to fundamentals and a new streaming service. Asshole, previously convincted of insider trading, hedgefund manager forgets the ""hedge"" part and overleverages himself to the tits with other peoples money i.e. the publics money), mostly banks, and proceeds to not report his, legally obligated to report, <5% stake in various companies (mostly growth/chinese tech), which is illegal for a reason. Reasons like the possibility to cause a flash crash in certain stocks that he was heavy on when the banks find out about his shitfuckery & margin call his ass. He defaults, which causes the hedgefunds assets to be liquidated. $VIAC was one of the stocks liquidated. The position was so heavy it is caused a domino effect of selling. 

Side note:
The sell off was SUPPOSED to be gradual, and was agreed between banks to be as such, but from what I am reading Goldman Sachs just straight dumped their shares all at once in a package bundle, undercutting the previously, more slowly sold by other banks, stock. Fucking over other banks in the process while saving their own asses instead of spreading the hit out over everyone relatively evenly.

Even the ""police officer"" as we know it today was originally invented by wealthy merchants to protect their goods and recapture the people they enslaved. Then they got everyone else to pay for that service because policing served the ""common good"". 

Seriously. The US government is built on protecting the wealthy Americans.

The term ""Banana Republic"" comes in part from Eisenhower's ""Operation Success"". That's when the CIA deposed Guatamala's democratic government ~~to solidify Chiquita Banana's power in the country~~ because of communism or something.

Look at the formation of the FBI, the internment of Japanese people during ww2 (and what happened to their property), the US (and other western powers') overthrow of Iran's democracy for the sake of BP, the different treatment of weed vs. alcohol after the prohibition era, the displacement of American Indians, the basis of the Civil War, heck - even the basis of the Revolutionary War. In all of these situations you see mass military and/or police mobilization in the service of greed (and also bigotry, usually).

The whole system has the fundamental assumption of ""Might makes Right"" at its core. Given how the US system is descended from western common law, it would make sense that the issue is pervasive."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, these are basically similar to unlimited turbo warrants, but not for the *hoi polloi* (I believe retail investors are not allowed to buy turbo warrants in the U.S.). So basically you give the bank €10 and the bank lends you €90, so they can invest €100 in a stock. Stock goes up 1%, your contract goes up about 10%. This contract doesn't expire, but the bank gets paid interest for the €90 so that it's subtracted from the price of the contract (theta decay). This is risk-neutral for the bank because if this thing ever goes out of the money, they can ""knock out"" the contract (let it expire worthless). If I understand correctly, you could substitute that €10 with €10 worth of stock so it'd be a swap. Of course this is horribly susceptible to sudden drops in the price of the underlying stock."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are wrong, this is a family office, not a hedge fund.  Which I get is going to sound like a distinction without a difference but from a regulatory standpoint, there is a difference.  It manages no outside capital, because of this it is not an investment advisor that requires SEC registration.  It has no public reporting requirements when it buys 5% of a company because of this, it files the reports but only the SEC sees them.  

E:  The above should be changed, little loopholes like this are stupid.

They got overleveraged and margin called, this happens just usually not on this scale.  

Insofar as Goldman goes, they have a legal obligation to their shareholders to not take those losses if they can avoid them.  They have no obligation to Numera and Credit Suisse.  If I'm a Goldman shareholder and I find out that they slowly liquidated a margin call and took larger losses to avoid hurting other banks I'm going to be livid.


In the end here, the market has reacted exactly like it should and the players involved and the securities that were pumped full of capital they shouldnt have had are the ones who took the hit on the chin."

GS and MS may have no obligation vs. CS and Nomura to honor a deal, but it's a small family on these tables were deals are made, names of those making decisions are known and people of that seniority have options to rotate, or fewer options, if you know what I mean. Also Japanese business culture never forgets when you break a deal. CS being caught this way is surprising and not surprising, their house hasn't been in order for years now. Guess they opened their back to an attack of opportunity. Anyways delicious drama."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess is these family offices 100% manage dirty money from organized crime, dictators, and offshore accounts that finds it way into their bank accounts.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its part of how 2008 happened. You have an asset that has bets, side bets, side-side bets, side-side-side bets, all piled on top of a small underlying asset. None of the second, third, and fourth layer deep bets have any actual tangible value other than the assumption that the underlying asset beneath it all won't just disappear. If the underlying asset disappears or loses its value, a metric fuck-ton of money all riding on top of it just evaporates into thin air.

The next market collapse will be because of shit like this, over leveraged retard HFs where a ton of money is riding on what amounts to nothing at all when you pull the curtain back. Imaginary ""value"" with no substance."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I do both.  Moving the money inot my pocket has been much harder than giving society value with the goods I manufacture.

Firms with large naked short positions ie. Melvin, Citadel, and company knew they were screwed from the start, and have been doing everything they can to get out of it. I believe that they've been naked shorting since December to try and drive the price down, essentially digging a deeper hole in hopes of digging up a ladder they can use to climb out. There is no ladder and really they're screwed. The finra data is self reported and useless when it comes to GME. We dont really know what the true SI is, just hold and wait for it to runnup again."

Need GME to rocket and get me jacked to the tits again! I know I can trust you buddy!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am going to repeat this message from here to eternity: Dates & DD don't mean shit. This is not normal stock. It is being manipulated to the nth degree. But the good news is they can manipulate it for so long and so many methods before it gets critical. Doesn't matter if ""all hedgefunds"" get in on it. All. Shorts. Must. Cover. Remember that. I will just BUY, HODL and STAY patient and vigilant. Let the cucks wriggle and squirm as much as they want. £10,000,000 a share. I also treat everything until the squeeze as a distraction. Even the stonk itself. It is merely the vessel to Valhalla. May we all reach it's peaceful shores."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"*A poem for those who like the stock*

the stock goes up,
the stock goes down.
i do not care, 
i do not frown. 

i sit and wait, 
and do my work. 
i help my boss,
i scroll and lurk.

and when the rocket,
takes us past,
the moon & stars 
of burning gas

i’ll think of those
who took the time
to show me things 
and grow my mind.

i’ll think of those
who i can serve
i’ll make a list
of things to learn.

and so for now
i’ll sit and wait
because, my friend
the price is fake.

and if we hodl,
and trust our hands
i’ll meet you all 
in tendieland."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who doesn’t understand the technical aspect of this... that’s okay. 

Basically at this point the stock is way overvalued if we panic and sell our positions. It’s way undervalued if we hold and continue buying. 

Eventually hedgies will have to just say fuck it, enough with this stock. So ultimately, we need to stay stubborn longer than they can stay greedy. That’s essentially the battle we are fighting here.

Patience apes."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are trying a few things. Right now they seem to be trying to bore to sell, which is an actual trading tactic, so know that. **TIN FOIL HAT WARNING**
When it doesn’t work I expect a mock crash. They will try and tank literally the entire market. Blame retail investors on the way down and hope everyone jumps ship. I believe they will use “lose 90% to keep from losing 100%” and quite literally try and crash the entire stock market in hopes the gov’t or something will step in and change the rules so that they won’t have to cover and essentially bankrupt the entire economy. All the while media will be saying it’s Reddit’s fault and that we crashed the market.  I expect this will be their final Hail Mary. I’m not sure yet of what we can do to combat this, but I’m seriously expecting something of this scale."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're talking about a stock that was less than $3 a year ago and now stabilizing at $180. That's called huge change of sentiment. Manipulators no longer have control.

Funny thing: GME is not even valued as a tech company YET. Once it absorbs that tech multiple, $1500 ($100B market cap) per share easy. And this $1500 price does not even include the inevitable short squeeze"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget tomorrow we have the GME interview about the transformation and future.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's what is intentionally being omitted from these financial news reports.  Funds are buckling under their exhausted leverage, rising interest costs, and margin calls because of this stock.  The funds/investment companies can't openly say it, because it will prove the squeeze didn't squoze and validate our position in the open media.  Everything else is part of THEIR collective misinformation campaign to convince you to liquidate your shares in the belief it actually squoze, before they are forced to unload as we push their limits of solvency.

The short side is showing signs of unraveling.   I expect the brokers, dtcc, and government to be called in, when they realize shareholders ain't letting go of their shares at any price and a liquidation is imminent and they ultimately buyl at market ask on an endless software ""buying"" program to unload the short positions.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,As the price keeps on decreasing. I keep on growing more anxious about what is happening. I’m starting to contemplate if I should sell. As in sell I mean sell my body because I don’t think the prices will be on sale much longer. Selling my body $5 and you can do whatever you want. I just need some more of this good ole GME 💎💎💎🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a strange vibe going on right now. With those other hedgefunds going under (unrelated to GME), it seems like a fuse is being lit. Combined with the MSM narratives, FUD interns on this thread coincided with desperate short plays to tank the price, it feels like a pressure cooker is about to pop."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the volatility. I thrive on it. It makes my balls tingle and my head spin. BUT, if 180 is the new 40 then fuck it! If this means we'll eventually fly 8x the current price just like we did when we were at 40 without even getting the squeeze started, then i'm not complaining."

I owe $650. I only make about $400 every two weeks, so in literally any other circumstance I’d be panicking.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve noticed some of the ppl talking crap rn are ppl who lost a lot of money on gme options. It’s really not like we didn’t warn you that it was a stupid move and if u made that move it was because u knew it was stupid and were prepared to lose all your money. Should’ve used that precious money u weren’t willing to lose to buy the actual stock instead 🤷🏻‍♂️

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"see you tomorrow guys

time for some dinner"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I don't understand is how people can sell when they see a big loss.  Like a buddy of mine had his GME networth crash down to $7k and about same as me, I had it get down by $8k.  And I didn't sell, but he said he got depressed when he saw that and he sold.  I then told him ""When you were moving thousands of dollars into it, were you not expecting the possibility that it can go down big just like you were expecting it to go up big?  I told him even Robinhood asks you what will you do if you see your investment crash down big, because Robinhood wants people to understand stuff can go up and down a lot and people should not sell if they see it go down big, you essentially YOLO'd when you moved a lot of money into GME so don't get upset later.  Just hold and never sell at a loss."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, as I understand it, the Big Boys don’t have to PAY for shares - just the ‘borrow fee’. At 0.7% per annum \[is that right?\] it’s next to nothing. The actual share price is on ‘credit’ till returned. Sell shares in controlled batches - just enough to keep GME below 180. Return shares to lender. Cost is borrow fee plus bid / offer spread.   


BUT, it has to be done for millions of shares per day, and it doesn’t ‘cover’, so just kicks can down the road. 

Right?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did it. I managed to travel back in time. I'm here to tell you about the future.

The world is under the leadership of the ape nation, a group of gorillionairs. I'm part of that group but I'm only a small fish. I could only effort a fraction of 0.1 of a share so I only made about 10 million dollars.

We are experiencing peaceful times. GameStop managed to end world hunger by donating 5% of it's yearly revenue. Ryan Cohen invested in research and managed to cure 90% of all diseases. Retards are still around tho.

Most of our wifes broke up with their boyfriends. We shorted nearly all Hedge Funds into bankruptcy. Stock market prices are now determined by demand of bananas.

Our King is very kindhearted and loved by the people. He is our ruler but prefers to stay in the background. He occasionally posts a YOLO update which is celebrated around the world. You know who I’m talking about. I’m not saying his name because nowadays it’s disrespectful to mention him without roaring."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Upon deeper digging I could find no public record of the 21 Oct 2020 interview referenced in the WSB post about a new Third Bridge interview tomorrow**


The OP's claim (see WSB link at the bottom) that that Oct 21 interview was where the Microsoft partnership was announced was incorrect, [as Gamestop released a press release on Oct 8.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)
Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any information please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just here hoping the 6.5k I've got invested can turn into a down payment.  Hopefully we can kill a few hedgies along the way.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When i was a little boy in Bulgaria, maybe 6 or 7, two armed burglars broke into our house when i was home alone with my grandmother. She was in her 70s at the time, a frail old lady, who had spent her life herding and milking goats. 

One burglar grabbed her and in response she grabbed his balls with her left hand and squeezed hard. Instantly he started screaming, dropped his crowbar and tried to wrestle his balls free, but couldn't. The other man went to help his comrade, but she grabbed his balls with her right hand and with the strength, that can only come from 50+ years for milking goats, SQUEEZED, until both men passed out. 

She probably could have squeezed water out of crayons.

I always think of her when hugging my GME stonks and I HOLD, with strength, that can only come from decades of poverty."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"# Hope for the best, but brace for the worst

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be volatile. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*

- If you day-trade GME, your mom's a ho

Trading sideways: Something boring and pleasant that would be good background music

1 min frequency green dildos $1-2: Something a bit more peppy in a major key

Green dildos $2-$5: Something more intense in a major key that will definitely get my attention

Green dildos over $5: Starting to get euphoric

Green dildos over $10: Pure euphoria

I got into an argument with my wife because i threw away all of my shorts as well as hers. The kids are complaining because its 95 degrees out and they cant swim in jeans because “they chafe too much.” The mere sight of seeing peoples calves exposed below the godforsaken hem of shorts in public reminds me of hedgies and how much a hate them. Lately I was shopping at Target when the summer fashions appeared around the corner. Shorts. I went into a bloodrage, the fog only clearing when the screams of an elderly checkout clerk wearing a pair of jorts broke my rapture. 

Im afraid that people with dwarfism may be the unwilling victims of this chaotic tirade I find myself slipping into, their stature reminding me of SHORTS. Corgis with their stumpy little legs. SHORTS. My own small children. SHORTS. My temper around the word itself is waning... oh god... my temper... its... its...

SHORT.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did it. I managed to travel back in time. I'm here to tell you about the future.

The world is under the leadership of the ape nation, a group of gorillionairs. I'm part of that group but I'm only a small fish. I could only effort a fraction of 0.1 of a share so I only made about 10 million dollars.

We are experiencing peaceful times. GameStop managed to end world hunger by donating 5% of it's yearly revenue. Ryan Cohen invested in research and managed to cure 90% of all diseases. Retards are still around tho.

Our King is very kindhearted and loved by the people. He is our ruler but prefers to stay in the background. He occasionally posts a YOLO update which is celebrated around the world.

Long live the King! The legend! The RoaringKitty!

What I wanna say with this is that you should probably buy more GME."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh sweet we ended up finishing green. I love that the corrections to the final trade have been working in our favor recently. (Not that closing price *really* matters, other than on Friday’s)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if this forced margin call and liquidation in this odd hedge fund is a coordinated effort by relevant manipulating entities who want to provide the impression that hedge fund A can fall hard, liquidate but not cause contagion across the broader market. 

The attempt might be an effort to set a near term precedent when the inevitable GME short squeeze unravels. And maybe lessen the blow as media can cherry pick and compare numbers to a ""recent"" hedge fund liquidating. The manipulation has no bounds.

Either way, connected or not connected, GME is unique

Then I “say good morning” to my wife. Once we’re done I hop in the shower while she makes breakfast. 

Then I set up an iPad on GME and watch my options go crazy. Don’t worry I still own shares.

The OP's claim (see WSB link at the bottom) that that Oct 21 interview was where the Microsoft partnership was announced was incorrect, [as Gamestop released a press release on Oct 8.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)
Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any information please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"# Hope for the best, but brace for the worst

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be volatile. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*

- If you day-trade GME, your mom's a ho

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems channel bound with low volume.  This is not the natural price for GME, so this isn't the market talking about value, this is two army trenches staring at each other across a no-man's land.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I sit here long enough I can probably remember more, but there's one game that I remember loving as a kid that no one cares about today. The Megaman Battle Network Series!

This shit was the best, basically you get 9 tiles to move around on and your enemies get the same, every 10 seconds or so you can choose between a handful of ""chips"" to use (these can be attacks, heals, etc.), or you can say fuck the special attacks and just go to town with your buster.

MMBN3 White was my favorite (even though Blue got FoldrBak and was the clearly superior version...). You got elemental style upgrades that changed how your buster charged up (and some were extremely rare and hard to unlock, there was a ""Bug Style"" you could get by intentionally fighting battles with an incorrect perk layout, ie if you didn't follow the rules of equipping perks you were ""bugged"", half health, slow health drain, that sort of shit). That game had so many secrets... there was a side quest where at some random step you got a cipher that you simply turned in to progress, but if you for some reason visited a statue in your school and talked to it while having the cipher, the statue would drop like 300,000 zenny, just an absurd amount of money, and if you turned in the quest not knowing that there was never an opportunity to do that ever again. I loved that game, man... I still have it in and my game boy advanced sitting in the glove compartment of my car!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just averaged up to 5 whole shares!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This a day to just HODL..and watch things play out. One hedge fund has already gone belly up!  How much damage was done by the cascade of events is yet to be determined - but in my mind, the impact is significant. The people who have shorted GME have to be very concerned to the point of needing frequent diaper changes. I say we sit down, breakout the popcorn..and watch (and HODL) the show!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everybody just relax, today is unusual because of the Suez Canal Crisis, but we have had days like this before. We complain when it's down, we complain when it's up. Just sit back and enjoy the Cramer jokes today. We’ll moon soon, don't know when but it'll happen."

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- Buy the dips if you can, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

But the reality is there. Things are in the works. GME has that interview tomorrow. And then there’s the shareholder meeting coming up. Not to mention the DTCC and other stuff that kicks in at the end of the month. 

Just keep holding. We’ve come this far. We’ve survived the dips. Even when they hurt like hell. 

I really think this will blast off and at least hit 1k a share. But I honestly wouldn’t even be surprised if it’s 10s or 100s of thousands a share or more. We won’t know til we get there!

The Hedgies have plans, the media have plans, Cramer's got plans. You know, they’re schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I’m not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So when I say that your girlfriend and your girlfriend’s boyfriend was nothing personal, you know that I’m telling the truth. It’s the schemers that put us where we are. You weren’t a schemer but you had plans, and look where that got you. We just did what We do best. We took their little plan and We turned it on itself. Look what We did to this market with a few stocks and a couple of diamond hands. Hm? You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go “according to plan.” Even if the plan is horrifying. If tomorrow I tell the press that the hedgies will short a company, or they screw over the poor, nobody panics because it’s all “part of the plan.” But when I say that one little squeeze will happen, well then everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. We are an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos, it’s fair."

  - Many (e.g. Melvin and Citadel) are spending big on Puts
- It costs us Apes nothing to HODL, other than the opportunity cost.
- Long Whales are still in it
- Looks like Long Whales are keeping GME around the Max Pain threshold for Shorts/Puts (see Swaggy Stocks for GME)

Today could be a huge Green Day, it could also be a huge red day. Just because some random ape posts “350 EOD” does not mean that we will in fact see 350 EOD. We might, we might not. But don’t be disappointed if today we trade sideways or even go red, it doesn’t matter and doesn’t affect the squeeze. 

If it does happen that’s still not proof that it’s gonna moon tomorrow. It might, it might not. We’ll probably see more Green Day’s and more red days before the rocket launches.

Some look for small gains, while others don't

There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day

And ignore your ticker which I wish would go away, oh

Whoa

You're not financial advice, you're just a ringing in my ear

And if I heard you, which I won't, I'm spoken for I fear

Everyone I've ever loved is telling me to sell it all 

I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm not buying any calls

I've had my adventure, I don't need something new

I'm not afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

Into the GMEEEEEEEE

Into the GMEEEEEEEE

Into the GMEEEEEEEE

Doesn't the entirety of the squeeze require the lenders to call their shares due? Like, isn't the structure of this whole short arrangement that the lenders *can* call their stocks due whenever they feel like, once the contract expires, but are not *required* to?  


Isn't it a real possibility that the hedge funds just continue to pay whatever their interest rate is on the borrowed shares they have shorted? I imagine that's exponentially cheaper than paying market to buy all those shares back?  I'm sure that the hedge funds get a much more favorable rate than my margin rate in a retail account at ML.  


I guess, what I'm saying is, what is to stop the hedge fund execs from simply calling up the brokers lending out all these shares (or at least the ones with the largest contracts) and saying, ""Hey, don't call these in. Hold tight and I'll continue to pay interest until this shit dies down.""? I mean, I'm sure it's not ludicrous to think that these hedgies have a way to do a backdoor deal that keeps them going long enough not to lose to Reddit apes. Can someone tell me why I'm wrong?   


I mean I'm holding, When I bought GME, I just assigned the money in my brain to ""Gone"". there is no selling, I am just trying to learn how this actually happens."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This may seem backwards, but I think the most bullish sign for GME is institutions trimming their positions. I believe that the reason we saw a slow bleed last week was because large money managers in on the squeeze sold off some of their shares slowly. Does this help hedge funds? It probably does a bit, but the hole they've dug for themselves is too deep. I believe institutions in on the MOASS trimmed their positions in order to guarantee a profit and are now holding until Valhalla with us. I'm excited for what gonna happen in April."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The past few weeks I have only been around 40-50% of my portfolio in GME trying to be “safe” and not risk too much.

I’m not even worried if this shit moves a lot. The hedges are so fucked more than most people even realize here. This shit might get scary in the upcoming weeks/months.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Those shares never moved down from $190. Previously they would keep moving the walls down when they could. Similar bids would appear a few dollars down from where there was large asks. Behavior is changing.... Is this because they are going to change their attack strategy or because they literally have no strategies left besides cheating?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps the low volume is intentional and Citadel + other market makers executing their **payment for order flow** whenever they please - in any order that benefits them.

WHICH, btw they aren't required to execute in any particular order...  this is a fact. (unless proven otherwise.) 

Imagine someone gave you a grocery list (at a farmers market) to buy 100 bananas for $2 each and to sell 40 bananas for $2 each: 

* You **only sell** all 40 bananas first, flood the market with banana sales. 2 x $1.9999, 1x $1.998, 3 x $1,98, 1 x $1.9879, etc. lowering the price by decimals each sale.
* Which also causes others to sell their bananas cheaper -  out of fear their bananas will be worth less.
* **THEN buy** the 100 bananas on your original list for cheaper a little bit at a time. Maybe even buy them up after the farmers market is closed, and most customers went home.

So, technically - they could execute/process all of the sell orders into the market during normal trading hours and then send/process all of the Buy orders during AH/PM or at open (where we see the slight upticks at open consistently)"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you guys my story in our usual daily slow hour. With no bullshit.

I started buying calls the first time GME was mooning, made 35k in 2 days. When i saw i had more than 25k i started daytrading, and literally bought the calls at the highest point before it plummeted. I initally had 2k when i made 35k, and kept losing and losing. I kept putting all my savings in to try to at least make my money back. I was -15k at 1 point when it went down to 45, no bullshit. I put 2k on calls when it was 45, i was like -15 and -17 is the same. I got up to 53k in 3 days, withdrew the 50k and the 3k i turned to 8k the next day. Again i bought the calls for 8k 1 minute before we fucking dumped real bad, where we had multiple halts. Lost those calls last friday but do i give a fuck? I literally made a years worth of salary, so its only fair for me to buy shares now more than calls

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seeing quite a bit of upward movement, will be curious to see what the shares to borrow to short data shows at 9:45.  The day started with just 25,000 shares to borrow to short.  The interesting part to me about that though is that the interest has now stayed at 1%--things seem to happen when the interest rate rises (the last spike was when interest on shares to borrow to short was at 1.3%).

Edit: so super interesting. Just consistent volume, nothing wild, but the shares to borrow to short has actually dropped from 25k to 20k. Interest is still at 1%. I was wondering if some of this upward movement might be them cycling to get more shorts for a later drop.

Second edit (10:05 a.m.): small dip back down from a peak of $193. Still 20k shares to borrow to short on iBorrow but I don't think that accounts for any shares/shorts through ETFs."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is also the month within the 60 day window before GME could do a share recall which is likely why DFV's option calls expire on the 16th, a week after what is normally their Annual meeting which is normally held around June 10th 🥳"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But there are plenty of good reasons to buy a GME share.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that my man. Not many “real” comments in here these days. Salute
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha man I can’t even tell u how many times I’ve been rounding up I’ve lost track. Your 40 will turn in to 50, guarenfuckentee it. I keep trying to average down but after than $120 dip it’s been hard. I’m right around you though, we got this! 💎🤲"

2021-03-29 16:29:03,wallstreetbets,Ok. Ok. Inflation is caused by small traders. Ok. Well..... 
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Griffin eats all the snacks at a party and blames the kids.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What a clown. Makes me bullish on GME
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I swear these fuckers need to be in jail
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the face of a man whom enjoys sniffing farts.  A fart connoisseur so to speak.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,These journalists reporting pieces like these are also jerkoffs
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That face looks like a punching bag
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the look of a man about to lose his yacht club membership
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha can’t make this up!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heeeeeee, if apes put money in stocks instead of useless shit they don't really need, how can that cause price of useless shit to go up? 

Someone does not understand the whole process..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's very interesting how those HF always blame systemical issues when it's their own bankruptcy at risk but when the system gives them unfair advantages, then ""it's not a bug, it's a feature""."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"🤣 Retail traders are a corrective force on the Fed's inflationary market policy. The Fed is responsible for inflation in the markets since before 2010. They print into the market raising prices while controlling the CPI inflation at 2%, artificially creating wealth through the market. In fact, the rising prevalence of retail traders and the mania in the market is an effect of the policy, along with the COVID relief, both the stimulus and the aid given to companies and banks through lax Fed policies.    

Edit:    
Actually, this is quite similar to the situation in Japan. However, Japan has better tax policies in order to prevent the resulting inequality in addition to cultural differences that frown upon lavish displays of wealth. The US, however, is an independent, individualistic culture, meaning everyone strives for their own wealth... Meaning that equality will come from individuals being industrious and shifting to the market of their own volition in order to capitalize on the opportunity. However, that will see the inflation that's been happening in the market, the inflation the Fed controls and ensures is disconnected from the CPI, flowing into the CPI as retail trading gains more traction.    

In general, the USD is backed by the GDP of the US as opposed to gold and other hard currencies. Which means that every cent is worth a portion of what is produced in the United States, whether it be services (employees) or food made in a diner or exports like crops. Because the United States produces a shit-ton, the USD has become the reserve currency so it his intrinsic value as a means of trade as well. Well, when more money is issued the value of other money is diluted. Though, this can be controlled by various monetary policies that control who gets the money, etc., and generally a healthy rate of inflation (meaning that a part of the GDP, the CPI) of 2% is the target to meet. How does the Fed print and dilute the value of money without inflating the price of bread to thousands of times? They put it into the market instead of giving it to consumers, who would start buying things as they get more money, increasing demand and therefore cost. The market digests the money and ensures that consumers only get enough to keep inflation in check... trickle down economics (filtered down economics). The money goes into growing companies, the wealthy, and perhaps a bit back to the government. Then, the companies try to ensure maximum profit by increasing (or controlling) production to meet demand, ensuring that their work-force is of capable quality and quantity, and growth (which is reflected in the markets)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is for those people who have not realized MSM is manipulated by those with money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He looks like a piece of 💩!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What's that weird photo? Looks like an old 3D glasses picture from a magazine

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This guys face won most punchable all of high school
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate that guys face so much
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this make any sense... How could any news article even publish this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it me or does it look like he's about to cry?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They should’ve just replaced Godzilla with this piece of shit. I’d love to see Kong tear his stupid face off.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your title is completely misleading.  I don't know when this sub turned into this but so many people are just lying in their posts now.  The article doesn't say inflation boom is caused by retail traders it says its caused by huge amount of central bank bond buying and stimulus from the central bank.  There's so many things to shit on citadel for but just stop spewing bs this article doesn't say...  
Edit: I know I'm going to get a ton of hate for this since this is a HF hate fest, and believe me, there's plenty of good reasons to shit on the shady shit that happens, but can we at least not just spread wrong info that any person reading for 30 seconds could see.  It just makes this sub look even worse; when the fuck did politics and hatred start being so prevalent here.  We used to just show off our gambling addiction in the hopes we could all get rich (but more often than not straight GUH at our losses)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Scumbags saying stupid shit. Not really surprising
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m. Taurus ...... so that mean I’m very bullish 🙌🏽💎🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do he say it.... Or did someone type it for him and he read it off a screen?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Increases in kids born with Autism and Peanut Allergies are also caused by the retail trading boom.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya well. People not only putting stimmies they also putting down their life savings. While hedgefunds eat up peoples money they say inflation is caused and question people why did you put stimmi in stocks? Bullshit theories by hedgefund managers.. 

So don’t increase prices of real estate and homes provide affordable housing and we’ll return those  stimmies. Can you do better kenneth or whoever?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Inflation is happening because the value of the US dollar declines daily. Will continue to decline until the reset comes.. let’s just hope it’s the good guys resetting the system this time
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He might be an asshole but he isn’t wrong on inflation.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus Christ, that fucking face, I want to fucking break his orbital bones. He just has that fucking face."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,yeh my 58 shares are really moving the market today.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"something something FED: only inflation is wage inflation, btw. lets replace steak with a hamburger in consumer price index. year later, lets replace hamburger with tofu. year later, lets replace tofu with soy. tee hee"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He isn't wrong.  Monetary expansion leads to inflation...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you Ken, bought two more shares."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your title is a clear misinterpretation of the image you posted. 

I believe griffin would agree with you that inflation is not caused by small traders. 

Trillions of dollars being injected into the economy via stimulus doesnt place the blame on the retail trader using it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Regardless of Citadel, he's not wrong. There's so much fucking money on the sidelines from bozos that don't know what a stock is let alone how to place an order. 

That money flooding into the market will cause asset inflation, but personally I think it's a good thing. I just hope average joe's doesn't get burned and walk away for a generation. I have fun finally being able to have market convos with ransoms."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,All i see in this picture is a bag of shit.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"*It does*, though. Essentially, inflation isn't truly felt until it's turned into physical goods and services for all. Rich people don't get an extra $1400 and rush to buy a bunch of tvs, consoles, burgers and toothpaste, they've already got all the shit they need.  
  
  
Our financial system only functions as long as those on the bottom stay on the bottom and rich fucks get richer"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He looks like he’s trying to take a dump but it’s stuck there.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone ever saw him blink yet?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,sooo as soon as the money is in our hands it's called inflation?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m okay with that ken, see you at the country club!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the poor people with their vast fortunes!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking FT fucking c\*nts. Simping article with this POS to give him a platform to shit on retail. Trash talk.   


Then, as is my wont,  I submit a long comment saying why he is terrified, how ridiculous his take on retail and inflation is, and how GME was not moved by an ice cream cone tweet. Plus some stuff on T+2, opaque settlement system, illegal naked short selling.   


Comment ‘moderated‘ and not published. Which for FT is very rare.   


Total setup, and I wonder how much he paid them for this advertorial. It is tragic to see as FT used to be pretty ruthless, with free commentary on anything, as long as you didn’t use profanity, or insult religion, post racist memes.   


Total capture. Same for a recent article on the Cleveland Clinic group opening new private hospital in London, and planning on direct hire of doctors as employees. Straight up advertorial."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t destroying the value by way of the failure to pay shrink the money supply causing the # of dollars in circulation to shrink? This would cause a smaller number of dollars in existence and would reduce the amount of currency in circulation? This would cause deflation I think.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">**Stimulus** could jolt...

This is true. When you give money to people for things they need, the demand for those things goes up. Increase in demand leads to increase in prices for things in the CPI -> basically the definition of inflation

The relationship to retail markets is that retail investors will use their earnings for things in the CPI basket rather than recirculating all of it in the stock market

It is the opposite, If everyone starts spending the money on the 'real' market, that's when the inflation starts.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, stocks and assets tend to inflate in value in sync with the supply of money, right?So the rich will be OK with quite a lot of asset inflation.  But wages, pension payouts, and income tax receipts don't go up in value at the same rate.

If you add housing and stocks\* to the CPI, what would inflation look like then?  Not ""near-zero"", that's for sure!

'\*  I think that adjusting stock prices by the CPI doesn't go far enough.  Maybe a better way to do it would be to take a CPI basket and figure out how much it costs to buy a share that gives you enough income (from dividends and stock growth) to afford that basket.  With the way P/E ratios have gone through the roof, it seems super-obvious that asset inflation is a very real thing.  I guess this is tracked by the ""CAPE"" ratio?"

They wanted to take GameStop down because of traditional metrics, when passive funds are giving GameStop a way and fund to reinvent themselves and to keep people jobs alive.

2021-03-29 16:05:14,wallstreetbets,"Possible $GME Catalyst Incoming Tomorrow🚀 # October 2020 Catalyst

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Relevant tickers are likely due to those companies being direct GameStop competitors [https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop](https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop)

&#x200B;

While that is certainly a possibility, more likely is the fact that these are GameStop's four main competitors in the E-Commerce video game space. In order to talk about GameStop's success, they will need to talk about the plan to compete with these giants."

Don’t think there is any deal between the 4 to be announced.


Those are the companies they are trying to be competitive with and those that have a successful e-commerce in place. Best Buy, target, and Walmart obviously being physical business that have stayed around cause they followed the digital trend of those like amazon. Also all of them are directly related to digital/physical gaming."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Walmart, target, and best buy just signed a deal with amazon to use amazon warehouses to store product and fullfill their online orders (ex. sold through walmart.com shipped by Amazon in unbranded packaging) , because the overhead of setting up a system with similar delivery times was too much.

Wonder if gamestop is on a similar deal, could explain the promises of 2 day shipping, as well was why they'd be considered relevant tickers


Edit: confirmed Gamestop is part of the deal

Just speculation, not financial or investment advice"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do these companies want to go through (or make a deal) with gamestop? Distribution? Wouldn't these companies have enough clout to buy direct from Nintendo, Sony etc and broker their own deal? Or is that not how it works? Legit question."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy more shares at open tomorrow, got it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahah this will in no way create material change for gme when its announced so yeah this is just more of a circle jerk looking for confirmation bias.

A real catalyst is substantial material change, ie they become profitable again, large insider purchasing reducing the float substantially, sp500 inclusion, stock buy backs, reverse split etc. this is just a fucking PR event any volume will be short lived and not meaningful in terms of creating the cascading effect needed for gme to squoze.

Reeealllllyyyy tired of these bullshit GME posts these days they just dont offer anything substantive these days. Like post when their is DD on how a REAL catalyst may happen. 

If you want to do your homework and understand why the VW squeeze was possible it was due to a massive amount of the float being taken off the market overnight. If 75% of gme float became unavailable for trading obviously it would fucking moon. You need to elaborate on how GME gets to that kind of point when you talk about a “potential catalyst” 
One fucking PR event does not offer that IMO"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't say if anyone from GME will be attending it. Might be just analysts sharing their opinions.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They thought GameStop was going under 🤣🤣🤣 silly billies that was a big fat oopsie!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So your saying prepare to buy the dip tomorrow, got it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point I'm treating every ""Incoming Catalyst!!"" posts as FUD. Maybe the author has good intentions, maybe they don't, but regardless of intention these posts do nothing but build up hype for something that probably won't happen (soon).

Presuming a catalyst will have any effect on the actual price of a stock is meaningless in the current Clown Market, and it's infinitely more meaningless for a heavily manipulated stock like GME. No one is buying GME right now for its fundamentals and potential. They're buying it because it's poised for the MOASS. 

It's a good stock but that's not where we are currently at. After we bury the hedgies and they stop fucking with the stock THEN fundamentals will matter for GME. Until the squeeze has been squoze everything but Buy And Hold is pointless masturbation. 

Posts like these promising catalysts, or proclaiming lift off is right around the corner, or preemptively celebrating victory do nothing but get more naive and short term holders hyped up for something that could very well be months or years away. They hurt the cause more than help. Don't get me wrong, it's good news, but calling it a catalyst is dumb as hell. It'll have no affect on the stock. We know better by now...at least, we should."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe they sell their bricks and mortar stores and the in-store gaming sections of these retailers become rebranded as “GameStop”.

No financial advice, I use crayons as drumsticks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing will happen.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Catalyst don't matter, as the stock is already over valued. Everytime you guys post gme moon date posts nothing happens, people lose faith and sell. Here's the deal. Brokers can't margin call the hedges for gme because it's the brokers who will be stuck with the bill.   There's only one possibility for a rocket to the moon, ryan Cohen gets the board to recall the stock, forcing shorts to buy back.   Period."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and tmrw it will be another catalyst.

You've been waiting for catalysts for 3 months its time to accept your fates as bag holders."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol maybe I’m wrong but how is this not already priced in. Even after dropping the price is insane right now and only this high because of the possible short squeeze. I’m sorry but I don’t feel like any normal catalysts will have an effect at all. Typically stuff like this would draw in institutional investors but they aren’t touching it with a ten foot pole and are scared of what might happen if they do. If this were any other stock that would matter but GME is not any other stock. Don’t get me wrong I like the stock and I’m holding but I don’t get my hopes up over stuff like this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so retarded and still have no clue wtf is TL;DR.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe unpopular opinion: everytime somebody posts a ""catalyst"" here, it effectively ruins it.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What does iron have to do with nitrogen and hydrogen? Its been forever since high school chemistry and my brain didn't work good then and it doesn't work good now.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the smell of ammonia
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop is not directly involved with the interview. It’ll be a former employee or industry expert!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where would we be able to view this? Or would you need a Terminal to do so?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bridge Four. *taps a symbol on his arm*
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,More optimism! We need a daily dose of GME confirmation bias to help keep the weaker balls strong. Good post.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But but i want MOASS.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL the moon guys!!  I need my stimmy to land before we launch
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even an interview occurring to outline their plan should get us more volume. But, like the earnings report, probably not enough to account for a significant rise.

They’d have to drop a bomb to be a true catalyst"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to believe! But not holding my breath, just holding"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I sign up to watch this event live? This Ape can't find the link.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where does it say anyone from GME will be in attendance?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure Iron, Nitrogen and Hydrogen are listed as ingredients in this tasty play-dough I'm having for lunch."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No wonder today is low vol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks going up? I'm gonna sell to buy tomorrow then, Sell Low, buy High, that's the deal right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,oh yeahhh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You couldn’t be more wrong. 
Tomorrow after it happens people will start to mull it over.
Then Wednesday it moons because they will make the right choice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the relevant tickers are more about competitors than partnership announcements.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I can believe you thought I knew what hydrogen was
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So I may have held on long enough? Woo?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I imagine tomorrow will be an overview and general plan for the future but any big specifics will be witheld. Why? They are able to use these as independent press releases in the coming months to show that the plan they outline tomorrow is coming together. Also, I do not think anyone should expect RC to be leading the interview. Good chance he does not talk at all and we hear from the COO or another C level executive.

If I were going to speculate further, a short attack like we had with the earnings report would be a great buy opportunity."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, all the tickers you show listed are also where PS5 consoles are sold. It could simply be that. Don’t price targets and set dates. 👀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazon should buy GME. Then moon it’s stock vs hedgies

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Could this be why gme traded sideways they are loading up for tomorrow? 🤔🤔
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"they announced it in the earnings call, this isn't new news"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What's that? MOASS coming tomo!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do we know what happens in it

Is there a public call we listen to

Do they provide something after a slide show"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im guessing we just hold and buy the dip even if it takes 629153 Days

Edit: Thanks for your DD!!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How did the stock move the day of the interview in October? Also after hours or during the day?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not going to get to work up. Amazon, walmart and best buy included this to me seem more like the restock of ps5 with some resellers involved. Hate to be a downer but i will not get hyped up on speculation. I am just goin wait and see"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the interview?🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Compared to tomorrow’s moon, it’s currently a dip, so buy more and average up? I’m in 💎 🙌"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best buy loves store in a store concept. (Magnolia, geek squad, apple). Could Be a partnership!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,you are the iron of my suit
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What really matters is,, who actually from these companies listed will be in attendance. By that I mean, is the CEO or someone noteable going to be at the meeting? Or will it be someone's just hired assistant. I have been to enough of these events to understand the message that can be sent by who actually fills the companies spot.,,,, So focus on one thing only,, WHO will be there reprosenting these companies.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right but I highly doubt that will be a catalyst. Banks have been selling off their bonds for weeks now in anticipation of this. Bond prices seem to have bottomed as well
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He is describing how to make an Ammonium nitrate fertilizer explosion.  If I'm right.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock just went on Bloomberg and said they got cash Friday. Archegos never filled a thing with the SEC and was tied to Blackrock.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I figured it was a reference to the sun going kaboom...? Star blowing up once it starts producing iron?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a hell of a drink too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pffff - when iron mixes with hidrogen or nitrogen OR anything else for that matter - that matter becomes more irony - obviously.... duh....

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm -- you know, Apple has these mini-stores in BestBuy. BB gets a cut of the profit for allowing Apple to be Apple in the BestBuy space. 

I'm speculating ... but:

If I were BestBuy, I might entertain the notion of allowing GME to assume management of my vidyer game business a'la kiosk (they would be responsible for inventory, etc) in exchange for a cut of the profit for allowing them to use my logistics and sales infrastructure. That would cut down on GME's overhead, boost best buy's revenue, get BB in to a market they have no presence in without excessive exposure (used games and game equipment), and allow GME to benefit from the weight and brand cachet of Best Buy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don't think it will take much. I don't even know who buys at walmart, that's a nightmare if you just want a video game. Parents who are already there maybe? Amazon is just convenience/familiarity, but a lot of people are moving away from it because co-mingled inventory and non-curated listings are killing it. Target and Best Buy have good deals/sales, but don't offer any kind of trade in deal so they shouldn't be too hard to outcompete. At that point it becomes ""how do you get parents to stop buying their kids games at those other places and come to GameStop instead?"" I'm not sure how they will answer that but leaning into the ""tech experience focused"" aspect might be their plan."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooo I like this rebuttal 👍🏼 good point
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said ""Game space"". Gamestop starts with ""Game"", the moon is in space. GME to the moon confirmed?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Notice the Amazon ticker is listed on the right side with the rest. But under the agenda , it’s not listed as a competitor?? Walmart target and Best Buy are? Hm"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They could merge together to form the GME Megazord like the Power Rangers. The most powerful gaming e-commerce company in the world.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Edited. Thanks👍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that was my interpretation as well. This is cool, but it sounds like an info session of normal industry/business stuff - not some big announcement of a pivot/rebrand/merger."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It lists the rest of the tickers on the right under agenda as competitors, not Amazon though..?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it’s not a deal but a conference between the 4 companies lead by  host third bride. Whatever gme is discussing does involve other parties, I believe the need too so this in order too Jose national gaming events"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly! 💎🙌
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is in a lot more than games, even if GME takes all of their gaming business (completely unrealistic), it wouldn't make much of a dent"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would make a ton of sense and given GME already has multiple delivery options, this would be another option for their main products to get to the consumer faster."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,solid question brother ape

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm convinced tomorrow's actually going to be rough. We might see a power hour volume spike but I speculate a red day. Nonetheless, I will hold!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that your being downvoted is showing the level of delusion going on in this place right now. It’s completely fine to believe that plays with GameStop aren’t over at the moment and that the company can have a significantly better future than it has in the last year, but GameStop’s price isn’t related to the fundamentals of the company right now. This can certainly help its long term value, but its not going to make it inherently better right now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I too am a bit worn out by the constant ""it's happening ~~tomorrow~~   ~~friday~~  next week"" here, but in December 2020, before the influx of bullshit from both ends of the spectrum, my understanding of GME was a small squeeze would happen in January, then the main event would follow in April. A lot has changed since then of course, mostly because January was a lot bigger than anyone expected."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you saying there has been no movement in price in the last 3 months? You're loco
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been saying it for sometime, but these ""diamond hand"" true idiots have been playing an expensive version of musical chairs. Eventually someone's going go be left over holding bags. People can only bail you out so many times."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of that makes sense from a business perspective. All the shit you just described is the old business that GS (as well as Best Buy, Target, Walmart, et al) is transforming away from. Remember, RC is promising a transformation, not a double down on the old business model that was leading the company toward bankruptcy.
Apply Occam's Razor by favoring the solution that has the fewest assumptions, and we find that this meeting's agenda is how to address GS's competition in the new market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The meeting is about e-commerce
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been in Best Buy to get a video game somewhat recently (Hitman III deluxe edition, GameStop sold out). It was a HORRIBLE experience. HORRIBLE. No one around to ask questions. Video game section was highly unorganized. I eventually found the game no where near the video game section while I was roaming around trying to find someone to ask. My opinion is that an Apple-esque store inside BB would likely be a stellar move by GS. There were numerous other people looking around having no clue as well."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are my thoughts exactly. Having a game stop mini store in Walmart, best buy, target, would be huge benefit for both side. Rent would be cheaper then a stand alone, traffic would be way more. do you think the 50 year old cashier at Walmart cares about selling video games or pushes for the warranty or extra controller. Also partner with amazon to have prime shipping almost overnight anywhere in the country."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe what I read the GME had planned with MSFT was exactly what BBY is doing with AAPL. GME said they'll have like a Surface section where you could check out various MSFT products
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You basically are asking Best Buy to make itself into a mall.

Malls suck"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I won't set foot in a Walmart. The problem for GameStop is, they're in my top 4 E-retailers, based on who I can get the best price / fastest shipping from. The other 3? Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The point is, these Brick & Mortars (excepting Amazon) have already / are already making the transformation that GameStop is making.

MM hedging moves the price of the stock.  For way OTM calls/puts, it can move the stock greater than the cost of the option, so it's a net win even if they lose the premium on the contract."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"in regards to the last question: those far out options are not always a lottery. if you buy them 3 to 5 months out, you can profit quite substantially on reselling them/selling to close with two weeks left if the move goes in your direction.

who buys them as a fd however is beyond me"

I will hold, because I do fucking like the stock. But if you don't see this as a bet, check your sight. 

My mental endurance has reached nirvana levels since January, JUST. FROM. HOLDING."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"A month ago I would have agreed. But after weeks of options expiring, I think the market makers either have the stock to cover and/or see the options as a bluff to raise the stock price. It's going to take deep pockets to use options to light this rocket."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you can buy the stock @ $800, you can buy more now. How are you reducing risk with calls?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have profitable stock, you can sell the stock, realize your gain, and retain upside potential with a cheap call"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can buy the stock now at 1/4 of the price of the call.   
There's a reason the $800 calls are so cheap: the probability of them coming in the money is low.

What's the play here? Hope it doesn't expire before it goes up over $800? Do you have the money to exercise the call then? If not, is your hope the sell the option to somebody who can buy @ $800? Someone very desperate and dumb who didn't buy earlier?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please read in my previous comment ""if you have profitable stock"" 

The whole point of buying the call is an exit strategy if you have profitable stock.  There isn't heavy volume on these calls because a bunch of retards don't know what they're doing"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You keep answering with platitudes, which is way above us smoothies ability to comprehend.

Simply put, if the stock goes over $800 before the options expire, what are you going to do?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree I may not have explained myself well enough. You asked what is the point of an 800c, well here is the best use I have for an 800c. Say you bought in at 100 and the stock is sitting at 180, and you want to take profit but you think the squeeze will still happen. You could sell the stock, collect your gains, then buy an 800c for a fraction of the risk compared to your stock. This way you keep your gains and win if the squeeze happens. Of course this assumes your gains from stocks are more then the premium of an 800c. The stock doesn't have to reach 800 for the 800c to make profit, so how long you let the option ride is up to you"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, my plan was to hold (after the news came out) but I sold because of GME dropping to 120s, had to get in on that deep discount."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"you use daily short volume reports as an indicator for short interest, it isn't. the counter tracks every trade that isnt a 1:1, meaning that when you buy a share, and your broker doesn't find one at the time, but takes your money regardless, and a few minutes after closes the deal with a seller, the second part of that trade gets picked up as short volume even though the position has been closed out within seconds/minutes. High short volume can even be a bullish indicator as it indicates there are plenty of people looking to buy a certain stock. UWMC has a relatively high SI but their daily short volume is nothing but average, most popular stocks have it at 50%+ each day."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We are all retards drinking from the same poisoned well. There's definitely room for multiple companies originating mortgages. I personally feel that UWMC has the greater upside potential plus the dividend but Rocket has the better name for this sub by far.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I’ve seen the past few days, the consensus in the industry is that UWMC won’t win this fight. I’ve watched countless analysts go on talk shows and give countless reasons. This gives me hope for the same reason you have hope.

I personally think wholesale mortgage will become much more popular IF interest rates rise.

Trends in the industry are having people buy homes for way above asking price.
Supply is going to ramp up and prices will drop to match.
Meanwhile, interest rates may go up. Don’t forget there’s a lot of liquidity floating around ready to be pulled back by banks.

I think if interest rates go up along with supply, then homeowners will be more prone to look for cheaper rates and not be able to put down a lot of cash to get it... in comes wholesale lenders.

They’re also trying to corner the market and make it so that UWM will be the biggest and best wholesaler with strong negotiation power. Quicken is nice and easy but people prefer cheap over easy imo.

Frankly, I don’t think there will be a winner or a loser. Just a bigger gainer. 

Also, rocket is more than just a retail mortgage lender. So, sure, they may do well apart from quicken; but I’ve seen some DD suggesting quicken is their largest income stream (please verify) and if I think that’s where they’re going to get beat out then... 🤷‍♂️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about the daily short volume ratio. Also, you can't pull something out of your ass like that without providing a source."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think UWMC has better upside? Stock price? Haha

Market cap relative to revenue/earnings/forward looking is more important than stock price. This is how the smart people bought GME. This is why I'm in RKT and laughing at anyone who says UWMC is better. Stock price is meaningless unless you connect it to the other pieces of the puzzle my friend."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is smart to try and get some revenue streams outside of the legacy business. Rocket Homes and Rocket Auto will make a material difference in the future.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"[http://shortvolumes.com/](http://shortvolumes.com/)

I just did? go back to your website that shows uwmc's short volume ratio and give in any other stock you know in the search bar, they all have a 50%+ ratio, and if at that point you think that maybe every single stock is just shorted into oblivion every day i highly advise you to get out of the stock market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"More room for growth. The stock is almost trading at the price each shareholder would get if they just closed the company, sold the physical assets, and gave it to the shareholders. To that point, the 5% dividend could be paid for YEARS even if UWMC didn't make a single penny in that time. I'd expect an increase in the dividend by the end of the year because the company IS making money. Lots of it, in fact, as they are increasing revenue double digits each quarter as the operations are streamlined and Q12020 will be yuuuuuge. Even their ""lowered guidance"" of 20-30% revenue growth for Q2 based on rising rates isn't exactly bad news. They close mortgages in ONE THIRD the time that Rocket does in a market where houses are selling above asking price within days. And on top of that, they will be announced formally for Russell inclusion at the end of May for inclusion beginning in July. It'll be a modest bump, but it should also initiate more analyst coverage to provide more investor visibility."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I’m not saying it isn’t a good company with a slightly undervalued stock.

I just think saying uwm is weak is a lil misplaced. Like hekn frend... their book value per share is literally their current stock price... I’ve never in all my days seen this tbh.

They’ve got a healthy $400m and just got listed,albeit by dirty spacs.

So I think it’s a great long. I think I’ll double my return if I hold for 3 years or less."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Source the first part of your statement.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"f*ck yea it is

it’s gonna be yuuuuge"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You say room for growth and stock price is your main case for that. Need to focus on the business more. They are entirely levered to the broker business where RKT is growing share over the last few years, that is not good for long term growth."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I do think UWM will be fine in the short-mid term
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But they are not growing in market share (specifically in regard to brokers) nearly as fast as UWMC.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So what does 4000+ brokers leaving Rocket to go to UWMC say about their market share?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"

This is where I feel your logic is flawed. 

They close in 1/3 the time due to investing in themselves and their in house tech, (their buisness) opposed to focusing mainly on advertising. ( like rocket)    

Advertising will come in due time, but you have to set up your fundamentals and focus on your business being the most streamlined in the market first.  Which in my opinion uwmc is doing a better job at. It's why a lot of us see solid long term growth with uwmc over rkt. Also just really think home buying will stay hot longer than refinancing."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The broker share of the overall market will shrink big time in the next housing cycle, keep that in mind. UWMC is just in that area whereas RKT is in DTC origination where the growth will be in the next cycle as AI and usability along with demographic shifts in home buyers will reduce the need/desire for brokers. Markets are forward looking. If you are in long term, RKT is the play. For short term trading, UWMC should be fine"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is zero evidence of that until we get to the earnings for both companies later this year. Not this upcoming earnings, but the one after.

Additionally, why the fuck would Ishbia issue an ultimatum unless he was shaking in his boots about RKT pulling away his business? A healthy and confident UWMC wouldn't do that. It is a desperation move."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the measured response. I would look closer at the core differences between how each does business, yes UWMC might do better with streamlining in the broker space but that is their sole focus. The broker space will become less relevant 5-10 years from now so what are they going to do then? Whereas RKT plays in other areas and uses their platform to add new revenue streams (a la Rocket Auto, which should have a good quarter)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hold shares in both, but I really think you're right.  I felt that the ultimatum was petty and overplayed their hand.  I'm really going to be watching the earnings for both these companies, and hope UWMC doesn't end up fucking themselves long term to shut down a rising competitor short term."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When do brokers stop becoming as relevant as they are now does pose a solid question,  and honestly I'm not sure at all. For me uwmc is a hold till eoy, or at least through mid summer."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I would give much more attention to the earnings after the upcoming ones. I want to see the lingering effects over a full quarter.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking years into the future. As user-centric workflows improve, AI becomes better, and more young-tech savvy people buy homes, then the company that is preparing for that outcome will be looking golden and the companies stick in the past will run into headwinds. This is one of the reasons I am long RKT and not touching UWMC, in addition to RKT having much more diversity in the revenue streams as well."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but the upcoming earnings may shine more light onto why they went nuclear, and I may adjust my plan."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no, we will likely see why they did it (I have my thoughts) but we need time to see if the outcome matches their intentions"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, I agree.  I also think that RKT is the better long term play, mostly because I think that their model is more sustainable/adaptable long term, whereas UWMC has the short term if their ultimatum pays off."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC is a short term swing play at best imo

Plenty of countries had amazing music. It doesn't get talked about or marketed.

South Americans were doing drugs and making music since before any white people came to America. 

Look up Habibi Funk from that time.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I consulted my UNO cards whether I should buy some oil stocks a few days ago. First I got a 6 which is a low card but turning it upside down it becomes a 9 so 6 and 9 make 69 which is bullish. But the signal was mixed so I drew another card which was a 4. This was an even weaker card but if the next card was 2 that would make 42 which is super bullish. The next card was 5 so this was a clear sign to stay away and it turned out to be the correct call. DFV methods literally saving me from losses!

Yesterday there was that video when the ship was ""freed"" and all the tugboats were honking in victory.
I was excited. I told my wife.
Today, I had to listen to my wife say, ""I thought you said it was freed yesterday?""
You could hear the betrayal and disappointment in her voice. Then she went back to her bf."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ship is free and it's getting pulled north. But, if you look at the maritime traffic tracker, flow of traffic hasn't resumed, yet. Only tugs in the area. It's annoying that news sources report traffic has resumed."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,... with every box of cornflakes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So it begins........  Ever Given have to do the ~~walk~~ sail of shame leaving out of the canal while everyone gives you the stink eye.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The people who control it need to be imprisoned
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro smh, why don’t they use the worms of Arrakis."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We should give the Dutch control of the canal. They know a thing or two about great feats of hydrological engineering.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember that post
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad the ship didnt capsize 💀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"True that, probably some will still go and see the blessed  rains down in Africaaa"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,add to that the huge congestion that the ports will have to manage in the next 1-2 weeks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not a single file ship week, time to double up.  Find a partner, tie together like a hillbilly pontoon party, and get through the canal as quickly as possible."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem, they can just double-up on their way through!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then all those ships are going to descend on their ports of destination at once. It's going to be chaos at European ports for awhile.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Another issue is making sure its clear. Maybe that involves some sort of sonar scan of the sea floor? But I imagine that ship did damaged to the sea bottom and until they know for certain there isn't an issue I doubt they will send a ship thru.

This wasn't just a situation of getting it dislodged, they need to not have that fucking thing roll over or dump 10s of thousands of containers into the canal when they attempt to move it.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just calculated it to ~16 days with a Triple E Class (like the one being stuck) going max speed at 25knots. Question is if those ships have enough fuel for such a trip, especially with South Africa not being a main trade route that could take a massive amount of ships for refueling. Shipping companys going for [slow steaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_steaming) to reduce fuel consumption drastically, so it really depends on how much fuel those ships have. Also going the detour won't guarantee you good spot in the queue for the ports. You waste a ton of time while other ships take the normal route and be in front of you.

I'm no expert on this, but thats what I gathered from researching this a bit further."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,News just broke that the ever given is floating again... no joke... lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk it’s a boat, there’s too much float"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been crabbing for days. Awful DD, would not ape."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am proud and pissed at the same time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m glad to see this tweet. You guys always come through for us apes that don’t have Twitter! Too busy to have every app!! This is the way!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That ship is going to the moon.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,WE LIKE THE SHIP
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,""" As we said last night, while the turmoil has so far had only a limited  impact on broader financial markets, banks and people familiar with the  matter indicated the unwinding of Archegos-related bets may have further  to go. Credit Suisse and other lenders are still in the process of  exiting positions, the bank said in a statement on Monday that didn’t  mention Archegos by name. Morgan Stanley was shopping a large block of  ViacomCBS shares on Monday morning, with Bloomberg reporting that the  ViacomCBS Block of 45MM shares priced at $47 each, a small discount to  the premarket price of $48.23.

Ok got it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there tenndies on it?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey Katie....❤️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you want this ship on the moon?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's actually a great idea. Retards on here would charter a flight to get down there and tug it with their teeth to free it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its like everyone is misspelling ""shoring"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I will buy the ship thank you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE THE BOAT
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, so we are buying a ship now!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what's sad about this comment?  That's it's normal for a stock to have over 100% of their floats shorted.  Yah, it's ok for some douche nozzle to make fake shares.  Literal counterfeit shares.  Nothing wrong with counterfeiting... for fuck sakes wth hell is the purpose of SEC when anyone can counterfeit shares..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ship ran over a fairyba few years back, now they floated it, I'm going long it hits something else..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the MORAL... some of us needed to hear this..... specially fam that’s stuck in 3-400$ positions!! 💎🙌 we are bull bound to the moon!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It said terrible ideas only guys
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apes can bench between 1200-1800lbs, let’s assume each ape can average 1500lbs.  So 4 apes can bench 6000lbs or 3 tons.

Assume 1/3 of the ship has run aground and it weights approx. 200000 tons.  Given a friction coefficient of .5 to pull it free of the silt and sand. (200000 x .5)x.33 it would take approximately 33,000 tons of force to pull it free, it would only take 11,000 of us apes to yank on the beast.

How many million subscribe to this thread?  Let’s go...

I like the boat.  This is not financial advise."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever Given to the mooooon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape question. Does this mean there is 41% more stocks than float? Or straight 141% extra?

I have read the Volskwagen situation and it seems there was only 18% short interest?

I understand this is a boat joke but I would like to get some wrinkle."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,BUY THE SHIP

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no problem that can’t be solved by the suitable application of high explosives
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Only mentioning WSB and the ship is floating already haha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Here comes Jim Cramer saying that the boat has been dislodged days before and it’s already over! Buy train stock instead.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah we need the boat to go through the channel, not TO THE MOON!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said terrible ideas only, Katie...ffs"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL....and HODL some more...   waiting for liftoff
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No sooner was this posted that they freed the ship. Coincidence? I think not.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What has 141% short interest?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It worked!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A really big helicopter
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got diamond hand on this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,IM IN!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Send that ship *straight* to the moon!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So that's it we done with GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let’s be real we apes would dig a new trench and leaf the boat alone.
Maybe transformer it into a hotel."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I only see 27% on fintel where is she getting this number from?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,he said TERRIBLE IDEAS ONLY
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I parked my car on my street just like that boat.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol
Classic 🦍 call"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you my Apes...!!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"all you need is some rednecks, 4x4s, and some chains. 

you might need a lot, but they will get it done. 😂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What are we talking about here?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just need it unstuck, the goddamn thing isn't designed for space travel"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She gained a lot of followers really fast for that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok i’ve booked my plane ticket. Im thinking we meet up and do a tug of war type thing?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I know WKHS has been at 26% short float for months. How are you guys not discussing that?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nachos, lemon heads, my dad's boat, you

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We like the boat
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is awesome 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No no, we remove float, not add it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It worked!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the ship's free now. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon🚀 baby
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we do options trading on what day the boat will free up?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,lol she is a smart one
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, now it’s unstuck so.... coincidence? I think not!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deep Floating Value tells congress ""I am not a catamaran."""

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What's Evergreen's ticker symbol?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Now to figure out how to sell secured options on this play...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You heard 'em apes!

MOVE THAT BOAT!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Explosives deep underground. Or water in channels underneath. Could be assisted by electromagnets on the opposite side to pull.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The ship is freed. This probably worked.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Who is this female ape?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well since this is a speculative investing sub, I'm bullish on China's Belt and Road Initiative being pushed really hard now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And it was freed just like that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shut up and take my money!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i don't get it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"One day, Two day, Red day, Green Day,
Black day, Friday, Old day, New day.
This one has a note.
This one has a little float.
Say! What a lot of shorts they wrote."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ship would’ve been freed days ago

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d like to short against the Egyptian bunny futures

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just have to get the right apes working together to get things unstuck
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then apes proceed to buy and hold the boat exactly where it is.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I’m shorting the Suez Canal today.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kinda rude to imply we like terrible ideas, but ok...

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They just want to free it, not send it to the moon. 🛳️💎🙌🌝"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmm we could just forget the boat move the boxes and remove a section of the boat. While moving containers to smaller boats.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I creamed my pants
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wsb only interested if it's 169% shorted.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Came in here to look for a ticker to throw my life savings into. Was disappointed to find out there wasn’t any.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought it was 2000 percent SI? Lol now you want to admit the 140 because if the truth actually  got out it would end everything as we know it. Not so funny now is it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dredge the sand from below the ship
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This floats the Suez 🚢

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How would wsb doing anything free the boat lol?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It clearly worked, the ship is away."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know why they dont just blow it up. Attatch a bomb to front of the ship, blow it to pieces. Instant passage. The cost should be much less than the cost of having it there..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp, it worked"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let it stay stuck for as long as possible.  I'm sure there is gold and silver shipments trying to make their way to the refineries.  Let them all default.

next up - infrastructure"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not currently. It’s stuck for a reason bud.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wasn’t floating enough, so it needed more float."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But not if we made a hole in the hull though. If we made a hole in the hull like with chainsaws or somin the float would decrease, squeeze the fuk out of the 🌈🐻 and send it to the moon! Who’s in?

I’d go myself but I don’t have a chainsaw and can’t afford anything other than ramen until the next stimmie cheque"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Volkswagen was special because they owned the majority of the shares. It’s easier to initiate a short squeeze when you control the majority of the stock. As was the case for Martin Skreli who cornered the shorts with some failing biotech company back a few years ago.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They're talking about the ship stuck in the Suez canal. She said her idea for getting it unstuck is telling this sub that it has 141% short interest (like GME did at one point)

Now go!! The longer you wait, the longer she has to feel hurt and let down. 

People are more accepting than you may think, I’ve found moms to be almost always be. Now after you have that covered, do a self care day. And please, don’t take out the world’s problems on the only one who loves you enough to serve you chicken nuggets in your bedroom. You got this. No excuses."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When I commented they had managed to get the ship loose and 5 minutes after your comment the canal opened for trafic.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. It was an entirely different situation so in no way comparable. Pretty much every expert said that in worst case scenario the canal would be blocked for a couple of weeks, only in that ""DD"" did anyone claim it would be blocked for months."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Similar when Nasser tried something similar 11 years later by starting a war against Israel but forgetting to tell his own military so they ended up losing in less than a week lol. Classic Nasser.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"1967, at the beginning of the Six Days War. It was blocked for 8 years because Egypt blocked it *on purpose*

&#x200B;

* Musk sends a team with a tiny sub to help. Say what you want about the idea or his motivations, [he did actually send some engineers and a prototype ""sub"" (more of a sealed tube).](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/elon-musk-sends-kid-size-submarine-to-help-thai-cave-rescue-mission.html)
* Dude took to the internet and CNN to denounce the whole thing, and Musk, calling it a PR stunt and saying Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts"".
* Musk tweeted a bunch of things, including a single tweet *referring* to the dude as ""pedo guy"", then deleted (at least) the ""pedo guy"" tweet and apologized.
* Dude sues for $190 *million* dollars for ""defamation"".

&#x200B;

Musk did (or supposedly did) exacerbate situation in his typical fashion as the dude started yelling and screaming about a single fucking tweet, but really, dude saw an opportunity to get paid and took a shot.

I'm not really saying Musk was blameless in the whole thing, but half the media prints articles about ""Musk's new natural fuel production method"" while the other half prints articles about ""Musk launches chemical attack on minorities"" every time the man farts outside of a Mexican restaurant."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and if they hadn't managed to get the ship loose by today they were going to unload the containers so there was really no way for it to take months.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Musk double and tripled down on the pedo thing before the lawsuit, including telling everyone he must be right because he wasn't being sued, if I recall correctly.

When you have a billion people listening to you, how many times do you need to call someone a pedo before that person starts being harmed by it?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk was also anti-Covid and a huge piece of shit as a whole so ya know
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, there is a real chance of capsizing when they unload the containers. The fact that it was wedged on the banks adds huge unknowns to how the ship moves as the center of gravity changes.

&#x200B;

There was also a real chance of capsizing while they were dragging it sideways, too. Basically, any shifting weight could've done unknown things because of how it was balanced on the banks.

&#x200B;

On top of that, the damn thing could've cracked in half by being suspended by the bow and stern against the banks.

&#x200B;

I didn't buy into the guy's DD, but there was a real chance the floatation efforts led to further problems."

2021-03-29 14:40:06,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC - IT WILL RECOVER AND FLY AWAY 🚀 🌝 🚀 Note: this is my first DD so please don't eat me alive. But I would be grateful for any advice and suggestions on improvements.

[More than $11bn was wiped off the valuation of the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon](https://preview.redd.it/z4gusm603yp61.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba6f56d3fdc854f7268b713ed6ea098ed2879800)

**Who is $VIAC?**

ViacomCBS Inc. is a global media and entertainment company. It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market.

**Why the selloff?**

This is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock.

Why the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble.

""Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos’s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn’t returned."" -Someones in the shit in my opinion..

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-27/goldman-sold-10-5-billion-of-stocks-in-block-trade-spree](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-27/goldman-sold-10-5-billion-of-stocks-in-block-trade-spree)

[https://www.ft.com/content/1b9119b2-0d8b-4a9d-b0a2-d10a021cd71b](https://www.ft.com/content/1b9119b2-0d8b-4a9d-b0a2-d10a021cd71b)

**Fundamentals**

Their total revenue has declined the last two years from 2019 27.8B to 2020 25.2B, but shall spike up again to 27.79B this year. In comparisons to another media giant $DISCA which is trading at 41.9 right now, but only has a revenue estimate of 11.87B this year and didn't look too good in its past years of 2020 with 10.6B and 2019 with 11.1B. Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2.

I also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. 

**TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued. As some hedgie is in the shit we are offered a delicious stock on a silver platter.**

&#x200B;

I am most definitely not a financial advisor!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I suspect there will be more selling of VIAC today via margin calls. Will buy at $30
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone says ""buy fear, sell greed"" until it comes time to actually buy fear, sell greed.

All the comments here are peddling fear. I'm going in."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Th share price ranking is due solely to the fact that Comedy Central cancelled The Venture Bros. This has retaliation from The Guild of Calamitous Intent written all over it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It hovered around 50 for 4 years, crashed with covid, spiked to 100+, and is now to pre-pandemic price. Why is this a good buy right now?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That stock was overpriced since February.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Consider this shit radioactive.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't fucking buy Viacom lmfao 


It'll be sub-30 by Thursday"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The sell-off is not done yet. There is another huge block priced at $47 that will hit the market on Monday.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got 4/16 puts, so we'll see"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Great it’s back to its price 1 year ago
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long it.  Of course wish I had sold at $100.  Something could trigger this to gap back up, and I'm hoping some interest in someone buying the company.   Alternatively, Shari could come out and make some statement about the business being sound and growing.  Still, she is nothing but bad for shareholders over a long period."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be missing something, but it still looks pricey at 11x for a company experiencing revenue decline.  CF is only 2b and debt is 23b.....you do get 2%dividend, which is not as appealing as it would have been 18 mos ago.....
 Even at 40, this looks pricey to me, but I have been wildly wrong before, so who knows...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"apparently there is still 22-30 BLN left to close out of the defaulting institution.   Once that is done, will the low price cause others to be margin called?  It MIGHT be wise to take care not to jump totally in until this has played out more.  What do I know though, I'm an Ape."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re in this VIAC stock hold on tight it’s gonna get worse before it gets better.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the DD was unconvincing at $100 and is somehow even more unconvincing now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA has had better 3 month, 6 month, YTD, and 3 year performance when compared to VIAC.  VIAC did have a much higher 1 year price performance, however (by about 144%).  VIAC was negative for their 3 and 5 year performances. Lots of words, I know.

I think both of these are good plays, but I went with **DISCA** because they have a 64% profit margin (reality tv is much cheaper than scripted shows), they have less debt, and haven't stated that they are going to dilute their stock.

If I had super deep pockets, I would have played both."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Viac is over priced like DISCA lmao they both will drop
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Either VIAC trades at 80 *OR* DISCA trades at 20! XP
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Two plans of stock offering and the HF huge sell off. That's a big nope for me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"boomer territory, not stepping into that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That sell off will be over and done and share will start climbing back. I wouldn't be surprised 5hose same banks have calls ready to fire up....TO THE MOON!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve made a killing on puts this past week on Viacom 😅
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't it going down for weeks before this happened ? The reason Archegos got margin called is that their positions kept losing money ..

I understand you saw a sell off in the stock and thought it's a good idea to buy it, and maybe it is, but the company was going down hill for a while now .."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a candidate for a straddle or a strangle?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is fucking retarded. Stonk went down therefore completely undervalued.

???

Have fun losing money this week. Try FDs!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hate Silver

What is Platter?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If it gets below 31 my puts print and I make Lambo money
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love bloody red stonks, tempted to get some but I like your advice. Let's see it bleed a little more and revive it once it hits life support mode!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,if you think its going to bottom at 30$ it probably already bottomed out before that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If VIAC hits $30, I will cash out my dogs college fund and yolo it.  ~~Best of luck on your puts though.  Did you go far out with them?~~

Edit: I read the puts comment below yours and got stupid."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  Just bought the Jun $60C.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking oat eaters must think alike
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,its not op retarded
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the top comment for a reason. Half price if all time high does not mean undervalued if it was overvalued to begin with.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"And looks like it's snapped back to where it should be before... *eyeballs chart* gosh that looks like an artificial valuation rise almost like somebody majorly leveraged to the tits on going long and then manipulated the stock.

Seems to have worked really well right up until it stopped working."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets," Explain to me why NFLX is worth over $200B and ROKU is worth 38B yet VIAC is worth only 30B.  
Don’t say growth because NFLX profit is about = to VIAC yet is selling for almost 7 times."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The whole market is overpriced I hope this shit triggers tons of margin calls
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boy, no kidding. A lot of dust needs to settle before I would touch this, and then I still probably wouldn’t. Way too many variables for me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a single $30p 4/16 just for fun to see if I can make or lose 10's of dollars.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to learn what a PUT is on RH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who works there, I agree. They have a huge stake in legacy media and they were 3 years late to streaming. I'm sure you can get it for a cheap price and catch a nice profit on the rebound. I wouldn't touch it in the 40's, but hey, do you"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And sub-30 seems to be the fair value of this considering paramount + looks like it will bomb hard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, lend me that crystal ball. I only need to win the lottery once."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happened to ""buy fear, sell greed""?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which Monday?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s see them puts
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, show us."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. March 15 ath 101.15. back to 100.34 on march 22. 

Big dips all week from shorting after news of dilution.

Then margin call on archego.

I've lowered my limit buy to 30 for this week."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I wasn’t a boomer investor, I’d be right there with you. Bought a $50 put when VIAC was trading at $97"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a $30 4/23 put for giggles and within a minute the shares started to rise
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be our next GME. Fundamentals are there, it's a perfectly good company that's cornered a lot of its own exclusive, niche, cult content back into its own service. SpongeBob and Star Trek, what more could you apes want?

I think a lot of people have streaming service fatigue, and I have to imagine CBS were hoping for better response to launching Paramount+. There's no bullish forces right this moment to counter this weird external-factors sell-off, but I think it's being massively undervalued.

I just took a short term put, but I plan to buy in heavily at the bottom of the dip. I like the stock, and it's clearly undervalued.

E: But I'm not a ~~rapper~~ financial advisor"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with that line of logic is that VIAC simply isn’t a 1:1 competitor to NFLX. Their revenue models alone show this: VIAC’s revenue is 46% advertising, 35% affiliate. NFLX is almost entirely subscription based."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You could argue netflix is also overvalued. However both Netflix and roku have become the Kleenex or band-aid of content delivery. Netflix is synonymous with streaming and roku is synonymous with how you watch it on your tv. So there is quite a bit of intangible built in there. If viacom went bankrupt... nobody would really notice. Those shows/networks would get sold off to some other company.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your DD left out the fact that $VIAC just announced that they will be selling an additional $3 Billion in shares to help fund their streaming plans - thus diluting the value of existing shares for current shareholders.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Future growth prospects. Viacom doesn’t have the resources to compete in a post streaming world and their biggest money maker (traditional  tv revenues = advertising etc) are likely to decline (not grow) in the next decade. Paramount+ has no chance of replacing their declining cable revenues and they themselves know that they need to merge or be acquired to survive. 

On the other hand, Netflix is a growth company, well positioned to capitalise on the streaming boom, with an incredible competitive moat from their 10+ year dataset of customers viewing habits."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly same. I'd love to go long in a bunch of companies I like but not at these prices. Give me a nice correction
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was waiting for the u-turn on Friday.

Should've done short/put in the morning while I was waiting. fml"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 5 $35’s for 4/30 and the IV is fucking killing me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be wrong, 45 may be the floor! It's hard to say if any residual action will cause more volatility."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The pricing model is $5 dollars for with ads, and $10 dollars for without ads. Which is pretty fucking dumb tbh"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My lotto tickets may print with typos
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, I'm running a portfolio that's in the green."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Today. It’s done apparently
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh id rather be going long but everything is overvalued right now so I'm playing with options until a correction happens and then jumping in and holding
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Picked up 3 x $35 4/9, maybe I'll be able to afford a Lambo tire"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it keeps dipping I guess we can bet on major upside, it was down 8% or 9% at one point today (now down ""only"" 3% ish).
If it does go to 30 seems like a no brainer, as you said the people that watch these contents are not going away!! 

Too many competing streming services, but I bet Paramount+ can show some more (slow) growth over time.

Let's keep watching if it dips more or if the dip is already over (doubt it, this week will probably be crazy)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It dilutes a lot less at the $85 price tag...

I thought the deal closed already?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the rate it's going, maybe we'll be able to afford the air for the tire at least."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like they started unloading again, down 7% again...burning a few more shares b4 market closing?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It did (literally 2 days before the dump)

The NASDAQ was around 9,576 pre-COVID.  It went to 14,051 ATH.  It is presently 12,995.  The pain we have all felt happened with the NASDAQ not even going down by 10 percent. I personally lost 383,000 dollars of 813,000 dollars profit in the last two months with the NASDAQ declining only about 1000 points.  The NASDAQ could easily drop another 1000-2000 points with a market correction.  This is why I'm largely cash gang right now while the market has switched from easy mode to savage mode.  I have no idea where the lows are, but suffice it to say the market is still really frothy right now given the huge run-ups we have seen the last year."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"  **Volkswagen to kill Tesla with 'Voltswagen of America'** 

*Sounds like Volkswagen is fixated to put Tesla in its electric coffin. So much so they even changed their name to VOLTswagen!*

Volkswagen will reportedly rebrand its US operation to 'Voltswagen of America'

All signs point to Volkswagen changing the name of its stateside operation to ""Voltswagen of America,"" according to [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html). Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.

A Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source ""familiar with the company's plans"" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a ""public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility."" The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.

Traditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke ""the clean skies of a zero-emissions future."" The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.

*Ask Papi Elon to stop fucking around with his banana rocket, it's time to buckle up or Tesla will tank south to $69?*"

Valuations seem frothy by historical price-to-earnings ratio averages, and stocks have been highly sensitive to any suggestions of tapering from the Fed. A return to normal SLR requirements is coming April 1st. Increasing bond yields, combined with quarterly rebalancing of pension funds, should create downward pressure in the coming days. Widespread speculative rallies in various investments that have no inherent value backing them up, and very strong retail participation in the market as reflected in the rapid growth of subscribers to wsb, suggest this period of time is very late in the market cycle and will be looked at as a bubble in hindsight.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Things were a lot worse earlier in the overnight session, when Nomura and Credit Suisse cautioned of big losses tied to Archegos Capital, a hedge fund unwinding a series of block trades. Those concerns appear to have faded. The Nikkei, which was seeing most of the selling earlier, is actually positive for the day, up 0.7%.

I talk a lot about unexpected events that can upend the big picture. Covid was one such event. It appears unlikely at this point that this is another.

That leaves us with another slow week. The Suez situation appears to be headed to a resolution. It’s a holiday-shortened week due to Good Friday, though non-farm payrolls will be released on Friday anyway and the bond market is open for half of the day. But non-farms have been kind of meh lately and many investors say the weekly jobless claims are a better gauge of the employment picture.

One thing to look to is this Biden infrastructure plan and accompanying stimulus package (yes, another one). That will be announced on Wednesday. It will apparently be paid for by tax increases on businesses and the wealthy, which may not be greeted well by the market.

Other than that the constructive outlook for buying risk assets remains intact."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm constantly changing my investment strategies in this fucked up market.  For what it's worth my current strategy is:

1). Don't initiate a long position in anything right now.  Even at current prices the stocks have run up so much there is a lot more downside than there is upside.  Investing long at current prices is like bending down to pick up pennies in front of a moving freight train.

2). Leaps feel safe in a few stocks:

\-I like BA 255 call for one year out.  The stock was 350 pre-COVID, is a solid reopening play, and doesn't care about inflation or interest rates.

\-Potential airline or cruiseline plays for two years out, but even these don't feel all that solid.

3)  Options is pure gambling right now.  Nothing wrong with this, but you might as well throw a dart in the dark.

4). Day trading seems to be a reasonable way to gamble in this market.  Specifically, I have made big plays into stocks that I wouldn't hate holding at the price I jump in at, but I'm hoping will go up so I can jump back out.  In this Kangaroo market I'm not really going long on anything.

5). Stay largely cash gang and wait to pounce if there is a huge crash. The issue is my fucking FOMO and my degenerate nature.

6). Sell covered calls if you have the shares.  Just set your strike at a price you don't mind selling at.

Any thoughts are welcome.  Please share any winning strategies you may have.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I know which thread I'm on guys.  I'm all for option plays if you guys want to make them.  What I'm saying is there is nothing to go on in terms of making informed plays.  You can think you know what you're doing, but it's all luck at this point."

What's even more ironic is that to compound this problem, we have grabage mortgage backed CDO's on a massively overpriced housing market, right back in the mix again. If money printers ever turn off, boom, defaults and crash. If they don't, boom hyperinflation and crash. No winning scenario, this is a feature, not a bug.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I made this complicated spreadsheet to track projections on everyone's brackets so I could tell ppl how they could win or lose and amplify shit talk...and then I showed my husband because he was trying to figure out if he could win (no).

He announced on our team meeting that I made an ""autistic tracker"" and then said ""go ahead, screen share it - show your autistic spreadsheet."" I was like ""Oh I'd have to find it"" and he was lol ""nah, you're too autistic to close it"" and he was right.  Everyone shook their heads and were like ""of course you have this""

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The go to play for the past few weeks has been buying SPY and DIA calls on the morning dip, and then selling them before close. Best to not hold them overnight because you can just rebuy them on the next dip. Sure it can gap up but the chances of that happening are way less than having a dip the next day you can buy cheaper at, especially in the current market. Not holding them overnight also means way less stress.  


Edit: Also, if you guys are gonna do this too make sure not to buy stupid ass strikes so you don't get fucked by IV crushes and theta and what not. Option pricing in general has been way more in the favor of the seller (more so than usual) lately."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, I quit cold turkey back in April myself. The first week or two is always the hardest, the rest is easy compared to those. 

Except I never used to dream, and now occasionally I have dreams where I smoke and wake up wanting one. It's a little odd.

Edit:

The secret to quitting if you want to though: chill with a wife/gf/bf/parent for a week (beginning of covid was obviously ideal for that) and give them your keys. Obviously if you demand em you'll get them, but the hassle combined with the ""should I really do this?"" factor makes it a lot easier to stick with it.

Also, buy dum-dum sucker bags by the pound."

Imagine if people on WSB were risking other people's money and knew they had a bailout if they fucked up. The yolos would be next-level insane.

Not disagreeing with you though, the risk management on WSB is pretty pitiful at times."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if your at risk of not having a yaut, then yoloing is really the least risky investment strategy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">but here on WSB it seems risk management isn't people's forte either.

That's why you don't take financial advise from us, or pay us.

These massive banks and funds are being ***paid*** to properly manage people's funds, yet constantly ignore their risk management people. We're doing this shit because we're retarded ***yet still manage to have more listened to risk management***"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Even WSB has better risk management than that fund did. all in on like 5x leverage in growth stocks at the height of history’s most rapid bull run. fuckin a. even this sub would roast that portfolio to high hell if someone posted that as a yolo

I'm one of you and apply my own risk management which as you've said seems to be significantly more than what these firms seem to do.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking it is! What happens when the banks need to raise capital for there capital buffers?  If they properly start valuing all those potentially corporate bonds they have ( I feel some corporate bonds are completely worthless due to lack of cash flow from Covid and many firms must be basically on their knees by now) this could trigger a market decline similar to 2008.

The outlook for individual companies may not change but their pricing may be altered. Of course significant losses in the banking sector will obviously result in an additional real economic effect and perhaps less liquidity. Again i can not stress enough that nobody knows (if i did i wouldn't be discussing it on reddit), and how much impact this has remains to be seen."

Is Tesla really worth $600-800 a share?

I think with the HF’s over leveraging themselves, it’s spewing a ton of uncertainty into the market as to the value of a lot of these companies. The last month’s correction has exposed a lot of HF (and frankly WSB’s as well) who have been yoloing too hard during the insane bull market of the last year.

At some point the high net worth investors, like Jordan with his half a B GME loss, are going to take their toys and go home, triggering a bigger pull back than what we are seeing now."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There aren't two shares though, there is one share which has been bought, lent at interest and then sold, where someone else has bought it. There's only one share but it has passed through three hands. 

The IOU is between the broker and the fund and is not attached to the share itself. Their only claim is with the fund. If the fund goes bankrupt and is unable to return that share then the broker loses their money. That's the counterparty risk of lending out shares, just like any type of lending."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well first of all your broker shouldn't be able to lend out your shares (unless you're using margins).  But lets just assume they do anyway.

A has 1 share, B shorts said share and sells it on the market to C.

B has an open short position while C owns 1 share, so where leaves that A?

Well i believe the moment A's share gets shorted, his postition turns into a type of CFD where he just gets paid the price difference if he were to sell.

Now the broker transfered one share through 3 parties without duplication, there's 1 long position, 1 short position and one debt obligation from the broker to A.

this is how i believe the system should work, clearly with some SI we've seen this isn't always the case."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what *67 was for...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the neighbour. The company has no claim on the share itself, they have a lending relationship with the fund in question which, if they lack the funds to settle or purchase the share back, will lead to bankruptcy proceedings. 

When the company lends the share to the fund, they lose ownership of that share. It's replaced by an agree to give them back a share in the future. Then the fund sells the share, and loses ownership of the share. When your neighbour buys the share, he gains ownership of the share. That's how the system works."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, no such thing, hopefully you'd expect the lender to realise the risk and close the position out themselves before bankruptcy, or atleast ask for more collateral. if they go bankrupt i believe you just have to call dibs on whatever they have left and hope it covers what they owed you, but just incase that isn't sufficient i'd assume the lender(broker) will have to close the position themselves."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is absolutely not how the system works.

Your shares can be loaned out without your knowledge or permission. If your shares are loaned out, it changes nothing unless there's a vote or dividend."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so firstly, let's say I'm the broker and you're my customer, I'm not necessarily lending out your share. As the broker, I have my own inventory, I may be borrowing them from another party to sell to the fund, or yes, I may be borrowing it from your account. In the first case, I do not have to cover the shares, I have simply lost my money due to counterparty risk.

The situation you've just described now if different, now you're positing a situation where a broker has borrowed from a customer to lend to a now-bankrupt party. Running with this scenario, a broker will only lend out (i.e offer to short sell) your shares if your account is a \*margin account\*. This is important, because a margin account is a credit account and as a result you don't actually own the shares to begin with, you own the commitment from your broker that they owe you the share. As a result, it's more akin to a loan than actual ownership, it's the broker that owns the share.  Hence, Margin Accoutns are shitty and you should be using a cash account. Even so, because it is a margin account they don't have to cover the share immediately unless you transfer your account to a different non-margin brokerage account (and then they actually have to necessary amount of shares). Even if you sell, they can simply give you the amount of money you would've earned if you have sold the share.

It's kind of like fractional reserve banking, if you go and read the Chicago Plan: Revisited then you'll learn about how if you give the bank $10 at a 10% reserve ratio they can then lend out $90. Margin brokers are similar in many respects, of course not having the necessary amount of shares is far from ideal but it can give them leeway in certain circumstances. In the circumstance you've described there's still only one share, and there's an IOU (from your broker to you) that they can cover at their discretion. 

Secondly, no they cannot loan out your shares without your knowledge and permission. If they're doing that then either you didn't read the fine print on your contract with them (i.e you have a margin account) or what they're doing is highly illegal. If it's a margin account then it's a different story, but that again comes down to the fine print. Read your account and know what you're getting into, don't have a margin account."
2021-03-29 12:56:04,wallstreetbets,"TIGR Undervalued and crushing performance both at home and internationally. Currently sat at $14.47 I believe $TIGR is one of the most undervalued stonks around and is only being held down due to uncertainty in Chinese companies.

The earnings report recently contributed the following information. 

Operating and financial metrics saw a huge boost due to retention and expansion of clients. Total revenue increased by 2.4 x to 47.2m

Non-GAAP net income was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter, nearly 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter last year. 

Tigr added 44,000 new funded accounts this quarter nearly quadruple the number from the same period last year. 

Total funded accounts reached 259,000 by the end of 2020 more than double that of 2019. Growth in client assets was outstanding.

Total account balance reached $16 billion more than triple that of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 46.2% higher than the third quarter of 2020. 

Overall, for 2020, total revenue was $138 million more than double versus 2019. 

TIGR were profitable for the first time on a yearly basis.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $22.3 million in 2020, a big improvement from a non-GAAP loss of $1.8 million in 2019.

International clients represented 40% of newly funded accounts. TIGR expect that in 2021 to add more than 350,000 funded accounts. International clients will comprise more than 50% of the new funded accounts. 

The growth and adoption of TIGR's ESOP system accelerated as they added 35 clients in the fourth quarter for a cumulative total of 124 clients. 

It is expected their ESOP system will maintain its leading position and foresee further increases in market share

In July of 2019 TIGR  acquired Marsco, a U.S. broker dealer with over 30 years of self clearing experience. They also acquired their clearing licenses. 

The investment to transition to self-clearing remains a key milestone in the firm's development.

They now have the technological and operational prowess to control every aspect of the brokerage system from the front end to the back end.

The percentage of clients having their U.S. cash equities trades, self-cleared by Marsco, continued to increase and at the end of the fourth quarter reached over 20%.

In addition, Marsco is conducting clearing for all new clients on-boarding in the U.S. 

In February 2021, TIGR in total issued $65 million of convertible bonds. 

This capital will accelerate  international expansion, as well as support further investments in  research and development 

Total revenues were $47.2 million this quarter, increased 137% from the same quarter of last year. The increase was due to bigger user base 

Within the total revenue, commission increased 245% from last year to reach $25.2 million. Interest-related income, which combines financial service fee and interest income, was $13.3 million, an increase of 53% from last year.

Other revenue, mostly revenue from investment banking business, increased 118% from last year to $8.7 million.

Interest expense increased to $4.3 million from $1.5 million last year as we have more consolidated account customers. Net revenue after interest expense was $43 million, an increase of 135% from the same quarter last year. 

Non-GAAP net income, which excludes share-based compensation, was $10.3 million this quarter, 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter of last year. 

TLDR: TIGR crushed earnings crushed growth looks set to do it again next year and is seriously undervalued and even took a lovely dip down to 14.50 last week based on uncertainty in the market over Chinese companies listed on the NYSE.

I believe his company today should be worth between 22-24 and could easily grow to the 50's based on its international potential and expected future growth

Edit: I'm having some issues where I cant see some comment at all despite being notified of them and the comment  count ticking up so apologies if I dont respond to you."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PFOF?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thankyou kind sir most of the time I have a smooth brain but I found a wrinkle or two whilst looking at this company..  you may be right about april which is always kind to stonks..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not currently a user. And in the uk cant do options.

Can you tell the good people if it's a good brokerage and platform from your experience?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a user. How the fuck can you roll options to shares?! Fucking stinks me,"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct this has nothing to do with the hedge fund that got margin called.. the company is called up fintech it is a chinese brokerage and goes under the ticker symbol $TIGR
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,250 shares @ £10.57 fx rate 1.37 I think that works out to $14.48 ish
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me 3620 @$15.74 I'm thinking about selling 3000 of it whenever it hits $17..I'm not liking the volatility
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What about it?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pros
- has the best UI as compared to the rest of the brokerage in singapore
- fast deposit and withdrawal
- live prices
- relatively cheap comissioms with no monthly fees.

Cons
- does not support option strategies such as CC and CSP as of yet. Heard from the custom service officer they are implementing now.
- poor custom service availability. Hope they hire more CSO to work during US trading hours."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure what u mean dude smooth brain it for me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,do you mean exercising your options? rolling options is a totally different thing..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Most brokerages have a specific email address or phone number that you can use to get your options exercised. Depending on how far in the money they are they may automatically sell or exercise them at the end of expiration.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in 15 @$36.40 🤡
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome thanks.

Any concerns about the US aiming to kick off more chinese companies?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the insight.. it's one thing just knowing the fundamentals are good but when real users can back it up with positive experience then it helps to round out the picture of a growing company.. 

Let's hope they get even better and sort out the customer service side and add options trading which will undoubtedly attract even more users."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ibkr. forever and always
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes exercising. I’ve no option too. Even with funds to cover
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,In true style...hold!  I think it can get back there but maybe not for a while.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cant be certain obviously... this week may be a bit choppy but I believe it will blow over in the long term tigr may come down further which would be an even better entry point...in dont think this company will be kicked though.

A lot will depend on Bidens long term China outlook.. as I'm aware it's all about disclosure of political ties for board members and there is some difficulty in that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speaking of IBKR, Tiger Brokers uses IBKR for trade execution and clearing. IBKR also has a stake in Tiger"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,no clue about the platform - just wanted to point out rolling options is buying a further out expiry by closing the current option and using the premium of that to help pay for a longer expiry option.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m was contemplating to average down and after reading this post, my decision is reinforced. Let’s go TIGR 🐯"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's my biggest concern in general for chinese based companies.  Appreciate the responses!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Can’t do that either
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a good shout dude... it may dip even further so.look for a good entry.. the fundamentals are there..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No problem friend! It is also a possibility it was on the books of the hedge fund that got margin called recently... pop it on your watch list and see what it does up to mid april.. but can understand your wider based concern for china stonks

For VIAC, Goldman is still effectively the biggest net short since Kenny G crew's puts are offset by their calls, though still net short.

# No doubt Goldman Sachs impeccable timing and prescience could only have been due to their analysts diligence in crayon drawing on the charts."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't be surprised if Goldman also ran out and bought puts on Nomura, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, before breaking their gentlemen's agreement to not dump and fucking over all the other prime brokers. Just your classic Goldman Sachs move. Almost as classic as when they bet against their own clients in 2008 so they managed to make money on the meltdown while their clients got fucked."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,no insider trading or trading against clients here. nope. nothing to see here @ SEC
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like they hedged their clients margin exposure.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet GS also sold $GME puts to Melvin back in January lmao.

GS always seems to come on top, this time fucking the hedge funds"

Meanwhile, that bodega sending Western Union money home to families in Latin America or Asia is missing ONE thing on their ledger?  License gone.  Business fined almost out of existence.  Owner in legal trouble.

Why are those names familiar?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we get an update from the guy who went balls deep on vaic?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, they likely needed to have put positions so the trades would be price neutral for them. They likely won't cover the full leverage amount from the hedge fund if the stock price bottoms with the sale. I'd be willing to bet they made money on the trade overall, but not as much as everyone is thinking because the hedge fund can't pay back all of the money they used as leverage (5:1 leverage ratio from at least 2 banks \[so really 10:1 ratio\]). 

It was probably a free for all sale to see which bank could recover their money first and which bank would be holding the bag of dung  
 

Great buying op given these stocks are way oversold at this point."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct me if I am wrong but Susquehanna international group was started by Goldman Sachs and is still their offshore investment arm is it not?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it’s puts

The picture doesn’t say that

Also I’m retarded

Edit never mind I’m also blind

Edit 2 how much the first picture doesn’t say puts then?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny, Morgan Stanley is the biggest stockholder of those stocks mentioned out of those banks mentioned. Another funny is they didnt have any Puts on them in the Q4 filing. I'd feel bad to be in charge at Morgan Stanley now. Big Oof"

and those sort of lucky coincidences are just that.



yeah right.

and if i was born this morning, i'd believe that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So believe these stocks affected might recover 50% at least in the next few weeks ?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah that is criminal
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"surely a gentlemens agreement not to sell their stocks is market manipulation...

Or at least needs to be disclosed to the market as a single significant holding as the parties are effectively acting in a coordinated way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, they will get the usual tap on the wrist, maybe even get fined, and life continues ..

In the first hearings with DFV, some guy from Texas hit the nail in the coffin and asked ""is the punishement mild and not really a deterrent"" .. That was the highlight of the hearings for me ..

Long story short, big banks keep doing these things, pay the fine and move on having made money overall .. It's ""good"" business .."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you have a client that is buying billions in leveraged stock positions it would be moronic to not hedge against that as the prime broker. Not really seeing insider trading as much as just common sense here."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"they have always fucked hedge funds.

the reason, why hedge funds have turned so rife with insider trading, is that investment banks have automated and aced the shit out of market neutral and stat arb strats. only way is to do merger arb or straight up event driven or insider trading driven strats."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well money clearly isn't working, sooo..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like in 2008, only Goldman Sachs is allowed to trade against their clients, and it's been a winning strategy ever since."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Could it not just be them hedging against all their clients piling into the same stocks?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I still hold out that one day this sub will understand RENTD
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedging your liability makes perfect sense. Why would that be illegal?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,woosh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"of course it's insider knowledge, do you think GS is some sort of a fucking alien oracle? They are not even autistic enough to come close to Cassandra level (Dr Michael Burry)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the tl;dr on the crayon analysis. That or getting the joke is another thing you can add to the list of things you don't get like 1)profits 2) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fines were never a deterrent. Just part of doing business.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That sort of defines insider trading. They had information, not available to others,  and used that information to profit. The shitty thing is they fucked a huge client by actively betting against the clients position."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I wish I knew what you were saying
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, this is the right answer. ^^"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait can I trade against myself??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How does that work? How are investment companies allowed to bet against their clients and make money lol I’m lost. I get that they’re betting against their own customers and in hand turning a profit because they control their customers but I don’t see how you can have losing clients and still be winning lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So GME is a winning strategy?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,they’re the only bank allowed to trade against self?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to understand it but there is so much (intentional?) Verbosity, it gave off that it was risk limiting guidance.  That's about all I could ingest before I got too lazy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, hedging liability makes sense. The timing of their hedging on the client that they loaned all that margin too seems extremely fishy imo"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The racket can run, as long as they get their cut"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not what insider trading is. GS is literally an outsider in this scenario. Also, it's not wrong to ""bet"" against a client's position in the name of hedging. That hedging us why their shit's not on fire while other retards are losing their shirt."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"a hedge fund is a very specific type of investment firm, defined by it's structure (off shore on shore) and it's goal: it's trying to make money no matter what the market does, and then charge a two plus twenty fee that pays the bills. 

there have been a few different strategies that have been proven to work. the most common is long short, which means picking stocks for long and short positions. those funds usually mainly differentiate themselves (and their returns) with how they structure their risk they take on. Usually they are still market positive, because stonks only go up, at the cost of leaving some long risks unhedged.

Taking this to the extrem are market neutral strategies, where the net long exposure is zero, meaning the returns are only gained by selecting the basket of stocks and being right about it. this reduces the returns and the risks.


long short or market neutral makes up the vast majority of hedge funds, since their clients, usually very high net worth individuals, have more need for security than returns. They already have money, getting more is not worth as much as not losing it.


those strategies however have been declining, and prop trading has become less and less viable, since on short time horizons robots have taken over. and on medium time horizons, and complex risk hedging strategies, robots have taken over. 

have you seen margin call? [there are three ways to a living](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag14Ao_xO4c)

the financial services industry is in structural decline for about a decade now, and there is no going back.

With HFT it is impossible to be first.

With quant algos it's impossible to be smarter.

Leaves cheating. That is why more hedge funds than ever use shady practices, come in hot with insider information or fake info trying to get ahead. 

Those types of shops used to be one in a twenty in the 80s/90s. black sheep. now it's the only game left in town. Either be a crook or learn advanced maths, and most of those hedgies aren't smart enough for that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but your profits and losses from each of your selves cancel each other out and you're stuck holding the whole bag.

You can always inverse yourself and take the opposite position of whatever you're thinking about doing."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I do it every day.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And who is retarded enough to stay as a GS client after a stunt like that?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's very simple all it requires is moving bananas from the client's acount into the investment company's account.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"they are just hedging, tee hee"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats what I am wondering since I first read the things with the hedge funds liquitating :D what does it mean for us apes?!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17econ.html
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They've been hedging for months and building up that position.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except they more than likely had information that he held over 5% in some companies and wasn't disclosing that information, along with the fact that hedging against the client, who was max leveraged, isn't hedging its an attempt to artificially depress values in a clients position to double your chances of a positive return. If you think its ""ok"" for GS to pull this shit you are part of the problem. GS had no problem using insider information to profit at the expense of a client, and no cares in the negative impact as long as it turned a buck. You see this in the dump of stocks to protect their position. Its a slime ball move."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">In Washington, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., signaled strong support for the Fed’s role in supplying a lifeline to Bear Stearns during the crisis negotiations, saying that his priority was to stabilize the financial system and to worry less right now about the problem of avoiding a “moral hazard” by bailing out errant institutions.   
“We’re very aware of moral hazard,” Mr. Paulson said in a television interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC. “But our primary concern right now  my primary concern  is the stability of our financial system, the orderliness of the markets. And that’s where our focus is.”

lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,where did you find the info that they’ve been hedging for months?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, Insider trading has a very specific meaning. GS wasn't trading on Insider info on the holdings of their clients. They were hedging. It is important for financial institutions to hedge so their retarded clients losses aren't passed on to them. Every IB has a risk management desk. This isn't an issue. If GS count hedge the risk, their client wouldn't have been able to open the positions they had. It's a necessity."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously? Seperation of church and state.. but the stock market is closed on a Christian holiday..  thats some bullshit. 

If we're letting our govt halt everything for a religious holiday then let's stop the country for Hexennacht too.. unless they wanna admit their crusade for a Christian Sharia Law. Bad enough we already let Christianity influence some aspects like abortion and gay marriage. No wonder the US is so similar to the middle east from wealth gaps to still using the death penalty..

But sure let's stop the market for some dick that died 2000 years ago, disowned his biological family to make a point, killed a farmers fig tree bc it was out of season and threw a fit, said marriage isn't worth it bc getting a divorce is a sin that'll put you in hell for eternity, and even lustful thoughts will put you in hell for no chance of redemption, basically that it'll take existential Magic for most people to get to his heaven, and even then the majority of us still won't get in, tells people to gouge out eyes and limbs of anyone who disagrees with them, and advocates for genocides. 

Why not have holidays for Marshall applewhite or Jim Jones while we're at it. Without the religious indoctrination of Christianity in our system its just as plausible."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can almost taste the iron.  Blood in the water.  

One can only hope this cascades into a huge financial crash and a few bankers decide to jump from their hotel balconies."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooo. What to buy?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Floater gang!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,not yet
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait are they talking about archegos when they say ""A significant US-based hedge fund""? Because sounds like archegos triggered another one to blow up from how im reading this"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is a foolish thing to wish for. The bankers will be fine. They always are. The victims of such a crash will be the same as ever, those with no stake or understanding in the markets, already living at the brink of subsistence. 

Btw, the common image of stockbrokers throwing themselves out of windows during the 1929 crash is almost pure myth. It caught on with the press because the public desperately wanted to believe that there were real consequences for the men who had just drove the economy off a bridge. But it was just darkly wishful thinking."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We're out here in life vests and they drownin.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's Archegos. Not two hedge funds, just the one. From what I recall it's actually zero hedge funds. They margin called a family office that has hedge fund sized funds on extreme leverage.

Funny thing is, if they periodically took 10% profits over the last 8yrs, they'd be just fine today."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that mean?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The world is so interconnected at this point, a player as large as the US going down would be a massive disruption.

It tends to confirm that liquidation is not over yet, so brace for further impact in stocks like VIAC, DISCA... Forced liquidation is messy but can bring great buying opportunities, stay tuned."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So... does this mean I get my tendies this week? Or am I buying more happy meal vouchers this week?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Archegos force liquidated about $20B of positions last week. They had close to $80B in total exposure (5x leveraged, to the tits)

There is still around $60B left. I am buying puts on everyrhing they held. Especially on their shitty Chinese stocks. Buying $GME to hedge my portfolio too (aparently $GME is the new VIX)"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂 dam
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,U will have ur gains post 💰
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes dude CS puts immediately at open for me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So not off to a good start. Let me explain:
Put a limit order in. Realized I made a mistake (about 30 seconds till market open). 
Couldn’t change order fast enough and it filled. 
Why?
Cause the price I put for the put was 0.17, and it was at 0.07.  So I paid more than double like a true smooth brain, in a moment of stupidity so great that it should be an example of why we shouldn’t have hope for the human race. 

Thanks god this is only 100$ I had lying around in my brokerage acct or else idve been in some deep shit. 

However, it’s still going down so I’ll make money, just not as much as I wanted to. 

TLDR - cancel orders instead of editing them."

Coming off a great last year ASO is set to announce its earning report March 30th. Covid will likely have had an impact, but the word on the street is the stores have been packed busy since opening back up again. 

[Previous earning reports](https://preview.redd.it/s825pxkaxwp61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c8e9e0785bf85914370ba4bfee78c795e992ab8)

With strong financial performance, and a increase in net profits. It's likely the earning report will go well despite covid.

ASO is also sporting the 4th highest number of outstanding shorts on the NASDAQ.

Also with ASO selling AR's, next Zombie apocalypse, this store is going to be one of the most looted stores ever. Just saying :D

Meaning if you into this kind of investment strategy, the stock could do very well in the near future. 

I have 300 shares currently of ASO so I am of course a bit bias (for visibility sake)

Also there is no financial advice here, research the stock yourself and see if it fits your interests and risk tolerance.

Thanks for reading."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's also worth mentioning that the initial IPO lock-up period expires 3/31/21, the day after the earnings release.

This usually leads to a dump, but that is also often associated with a decline in the stock price starting several days before the lock-up expiry. ASO has been climbing the last 3 days, so if ER is strong, the price should climb instead.

2021-03-29 10:48:46,wallstreetbets,"Bill Hwang, Biggest 15B lost porn from a single investor + Billions from MM Bill Hwang the ultimate degen, retard who was guilty of insider trading more than 10 years ago blow up 15 Billion of his own money (some friends too) and 2 Billion dollars at Japanese broker Nomura (stock down 16 percent), unknown for Goldman and MS (they sold more than 10 billion in block trade last week in BIDU, TME, DISC etc) and many other MM because he was leveraged to the tits (3-4 times) and it went tits up.

Archegos (one of bill's fund) blow up first (Nomura was the broker for this fund) when 1. ViacomSBS announcing share dilution 2. China limiting tutoring classes and vape both of which our boi bill was big on. 3. Chinese companies delisting news

RLX (vape) down more than 70 percent

GSX (tutoring) down from 150 to 30 at the lowest on Friday.

BIDU, TME, DISC etc all down around 50 percent in 3 days

&#x200B;

Bill was also rumored to use an SEC loophole with equity swap to get around disclosing owning more than 5 percent of companies and he basically took loans from MM in NA, EU and japan.

He first started working for Julien Robertson who give him 25 million to start his own fund back in 2001, he averaged 40 percent return until 2008 and was charged with insider trading later. He then started he's own fund with his own money and quickly grow it to 15 billions and then --> GUH"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He yolo’d 15 billion.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not over yet. the dude leveraged his $15B about \~5x to get close to $80B of exposure.

They only sold $20B on Friday. There is still $60B to go LMAO

Buying puts on everything he touched at open"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"he's so fucking retarded he's literally a blackhole sucking all the tendies away.

&#x200B;

also did he found the infinite leverage glitch?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Some one make him a mod on this subreddit please
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was me thinking a billion was effectively infinite money and it would be impossible to lose it all, and this guy is like ""hold my beer, I'm gonna lose 15 of them"".

Edit: thanks for the silver kind stranger. Everyone else - don't waste money on awards, donate to a worthy cause, like more GME, or a hot drink and a sandwich for Hwang. Just kidding - fuck that guy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of us

One of us

One of us"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Show us your loss porn, Bill, become legend."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if he diversified with GME and AMC
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If only he invested in gme, he would of squeezed other hedge funds and made trillions. That would be an epic ape."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question... when you have $15B, why even bother anymore? Why not just count tendies while smoking cigars on a beach while large-breasted women in bikinis bring you fruit flavoured alcoholic beverages?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is wsb 🦍 and then there is Wall Street actual 🦍, how can he even get away with it, 15billions, he can even solve half the worlds hunger problem"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess that means stanks going up.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually a crazy story with most of the professional brokers dumping his collateral shares on the open market. MS sold his shit in baskets. GS and MS we’re out fucking each other trying to remove this exposure while burning their buyers because the prices in ViacomCBS etc just kept drilling
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The banks that lended to this boner are just as fucked.  Credit suisse reporting significant loses.  2007 vibes all over again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not too late to invest in GME and make your money back, Bill."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,death by GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He belongs here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the Far East traders really are the gambling degenerate GOATs - if you ever played poker in Macau you know what I mean - have we already forgotten gigaretardchad Masayoshi Son who day traded a couple billies in loss porn last year?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's find out which stocks are going to be dumped any more.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can our gay mods please get Bill in here for a AMA??? This dude is a WSB legend
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah it’s blackrock. They used this shell HF that’s tied to them and never filed anything with the SEC. BR just went on Bloomberg saying they got cash Friday.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i hope it triggers a chain reaction
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$ROPE futures spiking in pre market.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't he leveraged a bunch of times over, like dozens of billions more?

&#x200B;

What happens to that money? Like where does it go?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is insider trading such a common occurrence? Everyone from Citidel, etc has it on their record... It's almost as if they aren't wiser than anyone else. They just cheat and manipulate the markets..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,China limiting tutoring? What? That doesn't make sense.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,K.G will be the next B.H. again K.G do have $15 B net worth. Maybe $15B is a curse amount 🤔
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,AHAHAHA HA
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It said loss porn... I can read where r the pictures...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Any of the stuff he had to sell off worth buying? I love getting quality during fire sales

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question, why the fuck would you take that much risk when you have enough money for your grandchildrens grandchildren to be extremely rich? I'd retire if I had a million."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It is absolutely awesome to be able to pick 5 stocks and lose double digits on each of those picks while everything else goes up. That is some lotto picking right there.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guy is a hero, true wsb ape hahah"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine YOLOing 15B on GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know if he bought anything recently? Will buy some put options on it and use the profits to buy more GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ssj4 king retard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,my man hwang guhd hard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the whole fund was 15 billion leveraged to 80 billion. Should not be all his own money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t he real life dollar-bill stern? Good riddance!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We should give him a fking trophy, the biggest retarded of WSB. Long live the king"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH 😲
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope he doesn't hwang hwimself
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's understandable to hide position in building but why hide it when its built?

So many goes on TV to tell everybody that they bought this and that and expecting people to follow to make them float more."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At what point don't you liquidate, take at least 5 billion and go do blow off of Brazilian perfect 10's in some mansion somewhere until you're old as fuck.

These people are so boring with their money."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Honorary WSB member?  Maybe a statue?  Meme?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,After that text deduction they probably get five bucks back for that martini.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Poor guy, I hope he finds that lost porn."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s so weird that these dudes are guilty of stuff like insider trading and still run hedge funds. I’m sure there are a lot of other people not guilty of insider trading that would be happy to run a hedge fund.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure a big portion that $15 billion is somewhere untraceable that only he knows about.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't he lose 45 billion on margin?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,wow
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone slide into Billy H's DMs and ask him to post the loss porn
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hwang the degeneretard??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So why shouldn't I go all in on these stocks? They're only down because of this margin call. Nothing changed about their fundamentals that I know about.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$GUH $ROPE
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn... His wife's boyfriend is gonna be pissed!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Bill, we've got an honorary mod spot for you here, bb."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,is that 40 percent return each year for 7 years?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i guess from now on hwang is the sound vanishing money makes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How much of his personal wealth did he actually lose though?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,my brotha from anotha motha making us asians look bad with math
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think this guy stopped doing sketchy activities after getting caught insider trading? Na, I doubt it

Hard to kick old habits"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this mean that GME will squeeze
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,what’s mm?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you imagine if billionaires are WSB retards with usernames like 'GoldDaddy' and 'Tits_Jacked_Up', just yolo-ing shit along with the rest of us and then getting a little too deep into it on a friday afternoon, 5 corporate martinis in, and are like....'Dana, call up Melvin, we're going in big, puts on GME, calls on Tesla'."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I need his AMA. He could be king of the mods here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He didn't average down? 😭
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Too early for “Hwang was a patsy” posts??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont even know how many zero’s that is mate. 15B dude.. Iwould share that with everybody I know
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What a savage kinda respect it in a piece of shit degenerate kind of way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s the only real way to become a trillionaire I guess

Trillionaire is apparently not a word because nobody is one"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought its the opposite - $60B unloaded last week and $20B left for today and this week

The point still stands though, this may start a domino effect. Issue is, he shorted SPY heavy so we have no idea if the liquidation will trigger a move up or down. or sideways"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the related stocks are still gonna drop further in the next few days! 

To work out how much is left, did you just compare the value sold on all of the related tickers mentioned in articles/tweets? Or did you find that info elsewhere?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He definitely found the infinite retard glitch. But yes I wonder how he was able to lever to that extent.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Have him do DD so we can all get rich with puts
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong kind of retard. The kind that forces hospitals to sell the Nitendos that apes donated to the childrens ward.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hwang onto your seats fellas, going in deep . . ."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Ken Griffin “you guys are rookies! Don’t HODL anything sell sell sell”
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure he went above and beyond
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I though papa musk was a baller blowing up $250M rockets every other week
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gooble gobble gooble gobble
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe ask him to post a screen of his Robinhood account on WSB [bhwang@archegoscapital.com](mailto:bhwang@archegoscapital.com)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Technically we can’t be sure he wasn’t
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They haven't finished closing him out yet...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He could've bought 75 million or more bananas.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,would have
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he was shorting GME. He has been squozed.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally Cesar.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would have, not of"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Took $180B for Jeff Bezos to finally quit, 6 weeks ago. And Elon still isn't going anywhere with his $150B+ (except for maybe Mars)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it takes a special person to ever reach a million let alone a billion. At that level, you’re competing with other billionaires. “Oh look, it’s Bill with his 100ft yacht😭....hey Bill, those longs on Disc don’t seem to be printing”"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I have wide hipped women in bikinis? I'm less of a boob man.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is where I am at too man- these folks don't realize this isnt the fun part of the game- its the means to be able to play it-  living life.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely the adrenaline
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if he’s actually done anything illegal here this time. The only crime if not deleveraging tech stock 6 weeks ago when anyone with half a brain can see we have a sector rotation

I didn’t sell any of my tech stocks but I expect someone who turned 200 mil to 15 B to be a lot smarter then me and I also are not using a 5 times leverage"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,that's literally what half of wall street did in 2008 and guess how many of them went to jail for it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think MS and GS were coordinated and they were smart. Seems like they were the first to get out. They been dumping all last week trying to find any buyers. 

Question is how much of bills portfolio is left with other brokers"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember “the banks are too big to fail”

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure Bill Hwang is American though. He has a US education and a US career. He's also big into Christian foundations - you can still do it in Asia, just not as likely. I'm assuming Korean American."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">if you have ever played poker in Macau

Not yet, but maybe they have Macau on the moon?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It is because they have high ego and think they are geniuses. They surround themselves with yes men and will fire you on the spot if you dare even question them.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is not. Wtf. He is the kind of ppl WSB hate so much. He is the slimy wall street asshole that do shady shit, stock manipulation and insider trading. Wtf are u talking about"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Focus on the fucking family basically ruined my family. Fuck them. God fucking dammit of course he is connected to them. They are seriously the fucking worst.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You realize a chain reaction would result in an ending similar to 2008?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Disc and tencent
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally highway!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do corporate martinis taste different? I wonder what kind of gin they use
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You are joking but this absolutely happens.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Quite the reversal of fortune.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂 this is perfect
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine a smooth brained billionaire yoloing his fortune during the 50$ dip. Shit that guy would use Elon and bezzozz as pool bois when we go to the moon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That will be all of us in on GME next year. All be broke without a pot to piss in, sleeping in the cardboard box next to Shitadel's CEO, after having had $1bn available to us"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone reach out to him. 40k of us, someone must know someone. The loss porn would be epic. Like the Debbie Does Dallas of loss porn"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is why you would never become legendary like Bill. You are suppose to leverage that 15b by x5 to 80b and yolo it on puts.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO this is why Madoff just did a giant ponzi scheme, it's way easier and unless there's some black swan event like '08 you could just bullshit the returns. Just share the funds with folks and die before the shit hits the fan. 

&#x200B;

I also lowkey think that renaissance is a ponzi scheme. I don't get how the internal renaissance fund does like +17% last year and the public facing is down \~30%."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,it's all just one zero now.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,10B has more zeros
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol...no thanks. I'm not feeling that way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There are plenty of trillionairs my friend. Just because Forbes doesn’t list any doesn’t mean anything.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A massive movement sideways will not be bad given the volatility.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">The point still stands though, this may start a domino effect. Issue is, he shorted SPY heavy so we have no idea if the liquidation will trigger a move up or down. or sideways

Where's the source saying he shorted SPY? Everything I read just said he was long the stocks getting killed right now and was overleveraged, but I found nothing that went into what short positions Archegos had besides cash."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He uninstalled and started again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When you have lots of money people give you money just for having money

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have to imagine the dopamine receptors in these guys' brains are so numb they have to yolo billions to even feel any excitement anymore.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you tell me about this sector rotation six weeks ago???
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"How was allowed to leverage to such a extent, mind boggling"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,6 times
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gee, I’m shocked.
Goldman and Morgan, who’da thunk.

Really, who can ya trust."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They front-run Credit Suisse and Nomura lmao. GS and MS always come on top...they did the same in '08 selling all the CDOs shit before Lehman

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you owe the bank $1 million, you have a problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, the bank has a problem."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think Goldman is just executing the trades.  The banks that extended them the margin are the ones feeling the pain.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"GS is alright because they fucked the other banks over by frontrunning them and offloading the shit first.

But Credit Suisse is about to become Debit Suisse."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're here to make money, not fight the system. You're clearly new."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is literally the embodiment of WSB. We literally used to make Martin Skhreli mod. Read up on our history, man. We are here to get rich or go bankrupt trying.

Heck, before DFV posted his doctorate theses on GME, some of us were amongst the first who started shorting GME. Even when he posted his first YOLO, most of the comments were short in sentiment.

We don't hate wall street. They can be useful for our own self-interests, with or against."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol Martin Shkreli used to be a mod here. This sub has gone down hill from a place where people looked to make money no matter what to some fight against the system circlejerk.

According to Bloomberg, msot of the credit is from Credit Suisse and Nomura:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup?srnd=premium

>Much of the leverage used by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management was provided by banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG through swaps or so-called contracts-for-difference, according to people with direct knowledge of the deals. It means Archegos may never actually have owned most of the underlying securities -- if any at all."

Please note the article says:

> While Credit Suisse and Nomura didn't name the fund, it's been widely reported that Archegos Capital Management is the firm connected to the fire sale.

[Also note, Archegos' losses likely have nothing to do with GameStop](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup) but...

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This could start to get interesting. With the whole world based on credit a domino effect could be unleashed here. According to Yahoo Finance Morgan Stanley owns 43m shares of Viacom so the 45m offer of shares for sale rumour does have a degree of credibility.

It's funny reading that Goldman Sachs is selling a block trade on behalf of a client when they seem to own 10m shares of Viacom. I wonder if they have sold those already?

There could be a way to make some money here.

If Tencent have done a share buyback then they obviously know that their share price is undervalued after the plunge so if Viacom and others don't follow suit, then might be a good idea to short them as they obviously will be worth less.

This is a big deal.

The problem with this system is that there are too many parasites/middlemen, and everyone is incentivized to cheat or at least overextend themselves. It's never just two players, as we should have figured out in 2008. It's a domino effect through the whole system.

""Nomura cancelled plans to sell dollar-denominated bonds."" That is vague. Which bonds? Why? They're just a broker, right? Why would they not want to sell bonds and take their commission?

This is about Archegos Capital Management."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like they were trading on equity swaps - derivatives contracts where the bank actually buys shares to hedge the trade. So instead of Archegos buying GSX, they pay Credit Suisse to buy the shares. What you see in the GSX holders details would be Credit Suisse and you have no idea who is on the other side. Pretty common industry practice to hide ownership. Nothing necessary bad in this practice and it’s very legal and very cool."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So is credit Suisse hiring? Being an ape on CV  enough for analyst position?

Edit- lol downvoted for seeking employment, truly /r/WallStreetBets"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone know what trade went bad sparked all of this? I’m trying to find some information on the firm’s positions, but all I found were some articles stating the fund did not disclose positions like they were required."

Typically only 6-8 institutional participants per call.  I don’t know if there’s anything to read into this."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We will be laughing and smiling down at them from our balcony any day now.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What looks like happened is that Viacom decided to do 3bn rights issue with some merchant bank. That merchant bank obviously didn’t tell anyone that the rights issue was coming. Someone at a merchant bank - who wasn’t too tired of making slide decks for 140k a year - decided that Viacom was going to see its price come down. They may have mentioned it to a friend that Archegos would need cash to cover their long positions.  Every loser is making someone money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,to me that's bullish AF for the markets

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this have anything to do with amc or gme? Other than the fact it’s the second one in one week to have been bamboozled and there may be more to come?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No link, poorly cropped photo. Downvoted."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,DD on this author should tell you whether they might be for/against GME. Did they ever post articles about HF's or GME in the past? Were they positive or negative (truthful or bias)? There's always a clue to the future hidden in everyone's past.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Didnt he say to do that exact same thing specifically before 08 went nuclear? I could easily be wrong

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah like in 08 when he said BUY Lehman 2 days before they crashed. Fraudulent
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is counter indicator. General just do opposite what he telling and you be fine. I cannot find analysis anywhere but someone had actually backtested strategy taking opposite positions for his advice is actually long term profitable trading strategy.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Since (third time this being relevant and I dont know hownsince it was something I long wanted to do but didn't) watching the big short this means short the bank stocks !
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m more inclined to agree with Chamath @ 4:45 https://youtu.be/yrylFUbz7-M
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He said to buy banks that are sensitive to the yield curve since it’s going much higher. Bank of America and GS have nothing to do with this and might actually benefit with the sell off causing more buyers coming in from exiting this position come market open. They had a large position in Viacom and Discovery and got fucked. Banks still have more room to run but this is like saying if one bank made bad investments they all are. Look at JpM killer earnings.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget to buy silver too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone who still listens to that guy is a 100% certified ignorant.

The proper play is to look sad, very sad, request the bailout, look humbled, accept it, and start again. Oh and just say nothing, like the nameless faceless suits that are the spokespersons for the various big Wall Street firms.

Or you can go full Greece and argue, but still not do any reforms at all. But of course still accept the bailout. (Or like GM, Ford and various US companies.)"

Rumour is that bill used a loophole with equity swap to avoid disclosing leverage and positions to sec (5 percent rule), 15 billions leveraged at least 3-4 times

He first started working for Julien Robertson who gave him 25 million to start his own fund back in 2001, he averaged 40 percent return until 2008 and was charged with insider trading later. After awhile he started he's own fund with his own money and quickly grow it to 15 billion and then --> GUH"

The boomer stocks might very well go up a few percentages more still, sure. But is it worth risking a 50-80% nosedive in an eventual crash for those percentages of wins? I can't see it being worth it for anyone. 

You should take winnings after seeing double figures on any boomer stocks in a normal scenario, why wouldn't you when the entire market is almost at triple figures?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A long time ago someone did monkey vs Cramer. The monkey won but it was over 50% right and Cramer was right 50% of the time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Inverse Cramer for free money
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well he did buy a ton of ""digital gold"" back when it was worth 11,000. Surprised me to learn that"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They should make a subreddit just for opposite-of-cramer trading strategies and we can log every time he was wrong. Talk about job security btw, how many times can you be wrong at work and still have a job?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramers is the best contrarian strategy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Statistically I would not be surprised if betting against Cramer is better than betting with him.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The problem with Cramer is that he mixes truth and fiction to confuse people
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,im not sure if it has been done recently and documented but it has in the past and been successful [https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB123397107399659271?tesla=y](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB123397107399659271?tesla=y)

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He claims that was because the questioner was asking about cash deposits not stocks, and Cramer didn't want to cause a run on the bank. If we take him at his word he's right to have been worried about causing a run, and he's right that it would be silly to pull your cash out of your account because FDIC has your back. AND he was totally right that they were going to be taken over. I can't imagine anyone saying that an impending bailout/takeover would make the stock a good buy/hold, not even Cramer after a 3 day coke binge, so I'm inclined to believe him."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for young Erin Burnett.  She was such a smoke show back in the CNBC days.  Talk money to me young Erin you babe.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well someone's gotta be holding the bag when it all goes tits up and Cramer sure as hell doesn't want bagholders to be his banker buddies.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a week before they went bankrupt iirc
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe he knows. And is trying to say something?

>... a $1 investment in the low risk quintile portfolio in 1968 compounds to $81.66 by the end of 2012. A $1 investment in the high risk quintile compounds to only $9.76. Over the shorter history of the BMI data, a $1 investment in 1989 compounded to $7.23 in the low risk quintile and $1.20 in the 
high risk quintile.

Low risk = higher return over the long term"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much the only acceptable response to that fact
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beta = relation to the market 

A Beta that low is almost unheard of. When the market goes down GME goes to mars.."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"#Beta = 1

A symbol perfectly correlates to the market. If you took every single publicly traded stock in existence, and put them all together into a fund, it's beta should be pretty close to 1 (if not exactly at 1)

#Beta > 1

If the Beta is greater than 1, any motion in the market is exceed by the symbol with a beta larger than 1. Market goes up by a 10%, a stock with a beta greater than 1 goes up by more than 10%.

#Beta = 0

If the beta is exactly zero, it's the Joker of stocks. No predictions will ever hold true, and it will do whatever the fuck it wants. There is no correlation between a stock with a beta of 0, and the rest of the market

#Beta < 0

Until the pandemic, a sustained negative beta was only hypothetical. Basically, a negative beta means a stocks moves in the opposite direction of the market. If you have a stock with a beta of -0.5, then if the market goes up 10%, the stock can be expected to go down ~5%-ish. Zoom was the first real example of a negative beta stock. While the market crashed in March of 2020, it skyrocketed. 

#Extreme negative betas

In the case of GME and AMC, their motion is so strongly inversely correlated with the market, that a small loss in the market can usually be seen as significant gains in GME and AMC. And small gains can be seen as significant losses. Basically, if GME and AMC shoot off to the moon, it's likely that the rest of the market will be collapsing at the same time. Functionally, this week be because hedge funds will be forced to sell all their other positions to cover their shorts of GME, collapsing those position's value.

Now, I just want to remind all the apes reading this:

***CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION***

Beta is calculated via statistics. It is not set in stone that GME up = market down. It just means that this is what has *been* happening, not that it will definitely *continue to happen*. Just keep that in mind when GME returns to a normal beta in the future."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not the best person to explain this but from what I understand this is unheard of and means GME will react 36% opposite to market movement.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You liquidated every stock this weekend because you’re retarded. One private fund blowing up isn’t going to crash the market. CS and Nomura took a hit but that’s not going to cause a market-wide crash.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Credit Suisse has been diving in a sea of shit lately with various scandals and are desperately trying to get out of it. This is just the latest failure on their part. The new CEO probably regrets taking the position.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not much different in Europe. The measures are still in place and in many cases more severe than back when they were introduced. The question is whether it is actually enforced and whether European regulators are actually effective. Looking at the various screw ups lately, I have some doubts."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the apes too lazy to click the press release from Credit Suisse:

> A significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions. While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month. We intend to provide an update on this matter in due course"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh please, I hope GME goes down I need to buy more."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because of the beta opposite of the market?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously they're not all laughing now... The problem is what billion dollar hedge funds do with their inside advantages and exploiting everything they possibly can just for $. GME is a prime example as well as AMC. They were literally trying to destroy these companies just to profit from it. Any one that thinks crushing companies by shorting them into oblivion is smart is also ignorant. How many great companies have had this done to them in the last 20 years? likely 10s of thousands. All destroyed by greed driven hedge funds that have no consideration for what destroying all these did to likely millions of lives. I'd rather have a moral compass than be on your side of greed driven ignorance.

No ship goes out in the storm, even the unsinkable ones. Crashes are irrational and unpredictable and that's why most players liquidate everything just because sitting it out is safer. This creates a domino effect that just takes everything with it. Look at fantastic tickers during the march covid-19 crash. MICROSOFT crashed. A company that stood to gain everything, had great value and great over time prospects.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If memory serves me correct, there was some sort of closed door meeting with all the big players, JPM, Goldman etc. which Sterns usually would’ve been invited too but was left out days before the bear raid happened. And the craziest part of this meeting was that It was held by the federal reserve. Again, going off memory I think the federal reserve even lent JPM something like $20 billion for the acquisition. Then a day or two later the bear raid happens and JPM acquires Sterns for $2 a share. Fucking bananas. The entire bear sterns saga was infested with collusion at the highest levels. 

I am going off memory so if I’m wrong on something I’ll change it but I do remember the bear stern bear raid being real shady and we only learned about that closed door meeting like months or maybe a year+ after it happened."

But if he is trying to get boomers invested he is going to do it, because they “listen” to him. He knows where all of this is going he isn’t dumb. But if people buy into the stock (banks) it will have an artificial inflation of people buying into it, and people will think that the  stocks are going up and they are safe, even though people here know the banks are in trouble for allowing the HF’s go this far."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn't due to GME shorts. It was a combination of Viacom and Chinese tech

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not everything is gme related lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,His fund has no GME positions. What retard speculated that?!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't viacom and discovery tank BECAUSE of them liquidating their holdings and not what forced them to be margin called?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I’ve looked a bit further and think you’re right"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I hope it wasn't a multipla."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I have a Harvard education now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We can at least agree that GME is a good hedge, so remember to remove bonds from now on in 60/40 portfolio, its basically just 60% stonks and 40% GME"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but that's a little harder for the apes to remember than 'Red market = bananas' Even if its not guaranteed to fly everytime there's a red day its usually a good sign to keep your eyes on it.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have the R^2 of the beta fit?

(Edit: I have seen ~ 0.4 on one of the terminal screenshot, is that typical? / high enough to be trusted in that context?)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If it reacts opposite to the market that is good for gme
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah index funds. Guess I'm going to look into reinvesting that cash in something else then lol

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sadly I don’t think you get exclusivity on that one.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even at near zero, you have to look at the volume of money and how many ""loans"" they are carrying. When you have control of all money, meaning everyone come to you for it, it's a win win. Does not matter how low rates are. Think on what 0.1% of $100 is. Now think what 0.1% of a trillion is. Every loan ultimately starts at the Fed. As loans go down the chain the interest raises. The interest we pay the bank for our car is higher than what the bank pays. Thats how they make money in the deal. Without them there is no money. The Fed is the main mob boss. Any interest is still interest and when you are at the top playing with the amount of money they are, you have no choice but to make money. So many people think the majority of the US debt is to foreign countries (China), when in fact it is to the Federal Reserve. The money makers..."

Sort of amazed he didn’t just do a Chapter 11 to slither his way out of it all instead. He must have a large/influential pool of unsecured creditors who he knows will sue if he suggests Chp 11"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If so, then I am pretty sure I need to go long Viacom today, that's a pretty emotional trade.

But if it wasn't Viacom, what triggered the call?  They obviously were overleveraged and Viacom was the first of the assets to sink."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Historically*, index funds have followed crashes all the way down (they're an index, they will literally be at the bottom, where everything else is) but haven't been as quick to follow back up because a lot of companies  just doesn't come back as strong or at all. Crashes clear out bad businesses and there's a lot of those in a lot of indexes. 

If you instead hold stocks that will be guaranteed to be fundamentally unchanged by the reasons for the crash, it will logically be first to rise and actually take an even bigger gain because of it, because when the crash is over, the good businesses are the first to boom when capital comes back to market. 

Compare $msft or whatever with S&P500 coming back up from 08 and Covid. 

Also, don't just listen to people on r/wallstreetbets. Go look at the numbers from 08 and compare your tickers with the untouchables."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> People at the top knew it was coming.

Not just the top. Before 2008 I was (and still am) am German with only minor interest in business news. I occassionally read the business pages of a major German newspaper, not often. I remember reading about the upcomming financial problems in the US market on several occasions. 

The articles all described the underlying problems and pointed at the potential damage it would cause. 

Again, I'm not well informed about any of that stuff. But when the crash came I wasn't surprised. I certainly was surprised by the amount of damage it caused, but as it was my first financial crisis that was to be expected."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I owned a contracting business at the time. We always get real slow for Xmas then Jan and feb. except that year my phone didn’t ring. I had one contract that didn’t end and it paid 5k a month. I fired everyone but 1 guy who was my partner and we split the money on it. About 6 months passed like that. No work, just the one property management contract left. Couldn’t afford my bills, we had to sell everything and shut it down. Started working as an engineer for Hilton hotels after. (They call “maintenance” engineering) for damn near minimum wage, then got into the union working for the government. It was actually a good thing in the long run I guess. I own a few houses now, promoted a few times and am an upper level supervisor for a region of my state in healthcare now. Strange the paths life takes us on.

He was beating this drum til 2009 and blaming the government for all the pain of 2008 for not stopping it when they were warned. President bush knew and all he did was use it to push tax cuts that didn't help anyone but the big guy.

This was the clip that some historians blame for starting the bear market by scaring people by what he was hearing from others in the industry.

Him and Burry were gigantic bears and no one listened till it was too late."

So I really dont think it was any one stock he just got margin called because he was retarded and now all the stocks he was most invested in are tanking from his massive unreported positions.

Was also considering going long on viacom but it was up 400% since october and is still almost double that right now. So is it on discount or did a bubble just pop?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once the first big dip came in 2007 the CFO of the company came to me (I was his young protege at the time) and showed me at least 20 graphs and few very long reports and told me, that if I have any long positions on the market to liquidate all, if I have a mortgage to sell as fast as I can even at a loss and just spread between gold, hard cash pairs and get some tech company stocks if Im feeling lucky.

That would be impressively stupid.  Not unbelievable, mind you, just impressively stupid. 

>but it was up 400% since october and is still almost double that right now. So is it on discount or did a bubble just pop?

A *lot* of stocks are up 400% since October.  CBS sank from $40 to ~$10, 75% of its value during the pandemic fire sale.

It's roughly the same as it was in 2019.  If we're in the middle of a bubble popping, then it doesn't matter what equity I buy, *everything* will be tanking.

If on the other hand there's a ""good"" reason for prices to have skyrocketed above 2019 levels in the past 6 months for a whole host of stocks, then it's a steep discount brought on by an emotional trade.

Kinda sounds like the perfect reason to pay the premium to buy an option rather than tie up too much capital now."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think there aren’t any longs left? It’s a hedge fund, I’m sure their portfolio consisted of more than half a dozen tickers and highly doubt they played half in options or short positions. They were behind the GSX short squeeze so don’t think they threw themselves under the GME bus. 

BUT with the GSX position I could see them being long GME playing the squeeze. We have known that a HF was the real power behind it.

""based on market prices as of March 26.""

Why mention market price if it doesn't have to do with buying back shares?

And why give a date? That tells me the buyback is imminent.

Also: ""The estimate is subject to change depending on unwinding of the transactions and fluctuations in market prices.""

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,March 29th was already in the afternoon in Japan when it was posted tho.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably because Archegos was a family office not a hedge fund.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Private bank. They had extended margin.

There is several of these tiger cubs all running the same play. I wonder how many banks loans out to these ""tiger cubs"" and how many tiger cubs going go under."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm expecting there's going to be a lot of fear in the market. If big money rushes to cash, there may be a domino of margin calls that's going to tank the market. I was hearing that the fed not extending the SLR exception was going to make banks reduce margin across the board and maybe that's what sparked this. 

Either way, I went back to all cash on my 401K and picked up some VXX calls near the close friday. This week should be interesting to say the least as it's also a short week."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the price you pay for giving out risky loans
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re in for a proper squeeze play then GME. Plus a bright future even without squeezing.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Both
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And at the heart of it all is a Hedge fund that's 100% long on GME.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're liquidating assets (ie, margin call), so if the equities drop in price, it'll negatively impact what they can recouperate. 

The same is occurring with other banks/brokerages (eg, credit suisse), that lent to the hedge fund. They lent X amount on margin, and are unable to recover the full amounts."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it’s $2b loss. I think it’s a margin call, and there is $2b of equities they have in collateral to unwind. As the prices on those equities fall they get back less than $2b. So my guess is the loss will be less than $2b, if they unwind well hopefully a lot less."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">Why mention market price if it doesn't have to do with buying back shares?

Because it also has to do with selling shaes. They held the underlying shares that the swaps were based on. So now that they've issued a margin call on the swaps trades they have to unload the shares in addition to unwinding the swaps."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont' think the MOASS will be this predictable but then again, I'm currently on a diet entirely of crayons."

they were also short S&P boomer stocks during a huge sector rotation lmao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think the FUD is being way overplayed on this story...shocker. 

It was all family money, so, yeah it’s a lot of margin being defaulted on which sucks for the banks, but it’s not like it’s some massive fund with a ton of clout in the market going down. 

The dude had SEC charges against him, so, even if he wanted to manage big money from external parties, I doubt anyone would seriously trust him with any large sum of money."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it’s more than just Hwang this’ll be huge, each cub manages *billions*. 

What’s confusing me is what blew up Archego. Even on 5x margin, what’s even down that much?! I heard he was 80% long tech but most tech and even Chinese tech is up since just 3 months ago. Maybe his shorts blew him up... 🤔 might be an interesting week.

Edit: someone else on wsb did some digging and it seems RLX, GLX, and Viacom diluting shares were big parts of why he blew up"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,PB = Prime broker not private bank lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The banks held collateral of about 15-20% of the notional from what I understand. This is what is being unwound. Banks are taking an L because the positions suffered further losses between the margin call and actual liquidation. 

The banks may also be unwinding some hedges; if the positions were all equity swaps with GS/MS then they must have been buying up tons of the underlying (which makes sense when their most recent filings show them as top owners of some of the stocks along with holding companies like Blackrock, which is irregular. No other reason for a straight investment bank like MS to own 10% or whatever of Baidu)"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,and archegos defaulted so now credit suisse have a bag to fill
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,but they are exposed to losses because the liquidated assets are not enough to cover what was owed
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol no, they just gonna take few billies in loss and have another shitty EC."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not saying this isn’t awesome (it is), but it’s not three different entities collapsing. All three are referencing the same hedge fund (Archegos) that got margin called on Friday. It’s still (as of now) only one domino."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman likely didn't lose shit. They front run everyone else and dumped all the shit on Friday. CS and Nomura didn't
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the consensus that GS and Credit Suisse just margin called the same fund - Archegos?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t suppose us, WSB degens, can get the same treatment from these banks... you know like we get infinite leverage so we get all the upside when a bet go our way but get the banks to bag-hold for us if the bets do not work out? 🤷‍♂️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GSX
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are these really private family funds or is it a way for rich chinese nationals to invest in US equities on the low?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I suspect the book got leaked and some of the big players like GS had analysts downgrade VIAC/DISCA and at the same time fired up the China FUD. The made a concerted attack on the fund's positions and made a fuck ton of money on the way down and scooped them at the lows. No way this was all coincidence. 

Who knows when the positions were established. I suspect as the swaps went up in value Hwang was rolling them to increase exposure. 

Sure S&P500 is at highs but the growth tech he was invested in (while at the same time literally shorting SPX) is all down over 50% from the top."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't believe I said private bank lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When will then be now?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And today’s yesterday was yesterday.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but this could make all the other creditors suspicious of their hedge funds and could lead to them asking questions.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"SPY puts, but I'd buy em a ways out."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly yes. If those big funds keep deleveraging their longs it will ripple enough through the market that a shorter of GME may be margin called and forced to cover starting the squeeze. It’s also possible that people will see GME going up and FOMO right into the stock propelling it even further.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that’s true, but the idea is there will be a ripple effect because of the margin calls, and hopefully one of the shorters will be margin called being forced to cover their shorts. So really it indirectly has to do with GME, or really, any shorted stock."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that was just the first boom day, and an early one at that. That was the Bear Sterns collapse. The *big* boom day most people refer to with the 2008 crash was the one that followed the Lehman Brothers collapse on September 15"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t “retard” a compliment around here? 

This could just be the first domino. Who says I’m worried about my retirement fund? I’m perfectly comfortable with my portfolio - it consists only of GME and uranium miners - and will be hoovering up shares in a significant dip. I feel for those who will get caught unaware by the fallout of a market crash (not trying to jump the gun of course). Those who are retiring right now or soon could easily be impacted, and then they’ve saved their entire lives for what? Sweet fuck all. 

Hedge funds going tits up is a double edged sword."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Grandma on social security, Mom on disability after working 2 jobs that nearly killed her, and dad peaced out when I was young.

2021-03-29 09:03:21,wallstreetbets,"MRE may be an absolute bargain stock Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the information presented is accurate. I am not a professional or financial advisor of any form.

Martinrea International is a stock that designs, develops and manufactures automotive parts. With the pandemic unwinding, demand for vehicles is likely to go up in the future, and this could spur demand for automotive manufacturing. This is on top of the fact the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels.

The stock is a major bargain at the moment, trading at just $12.54CAD, while analysts give price targets of $17.00, an average of $18.94 and a high of $22.00. If any of the analysts currently looking at the stock are correct, the stock is poised for a gain of 35-76%. The stock recently suffered a poor Q4 result, which was followed by quite a large dip. They suffered a 12% decrease in profit even though their sales grew. However, it was noted that if you take adjusted profit that excludes most one time items, profits actually grew by 31%. Effectively the market may be underestimating the value of MRE.

In terms of statistics, the stock has a P/S ratio of 0.3 and a P/B ratio of 0.86. MRE is currently trading even below its book value. This compares favourably to competitors like Magna International, which has a P/S of 1.01 and a P/B of 2.89 or Linamar which has a P/S of 0.83 and a P/B of 1.12.

From a technical perspective, the stock is quite solid. The daily price has just formed a tweezer bottom pattern, suggesting the stock is likely to move upwards. Moreover, the stock is sitting right above a major trendline that has been touched 4-6 times in the past. Thus it could be predicted that the stock will bounce off this trendline once again. Third, the most recent peak sits at a price level of around $12.20, so if the other support levels were to fail, this would likely pose another support level for the stock. Finally, the 14 day RSI currently sits at 30.26. This is the lowest RSI since the start of the pandemic and could be indicative of an oversold condition. This could provide additional evidence for a reversal in trend in the near future. Each time when the stock moves from peak to trough it appears to take approximately 2-4 months. If this trend continues, this could potentially be the time horizon in which to anticipate the stock returning from a bottom to a top in the future, although this is an assumption that will not necessarily hold true.

&#x200B;

[Chart of MRE stock price. Recent peak that presents resistance is circled. RSI value that is the lowest since the pandemic start is circled in the purple pane. Tweezer bottom at current price is circled, although not readily visible unless you zoom in. Some projected trendlines are included.](https://preview.redd.it/zs09qrkpfwp61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=66fec66fdd354fa56fe7ffbf41eed1b957a17bf1)

A relatively safe play might be to wait for reasonable confirmation of a reversal in the stock price and to take a conservative sell target at the most recent high, which was at about 16.21. If one were to buy at the current closing price and sell at that high, this would represent a gain of about 29.3% with an expected time horizon of approximately 2-4 months. However, it is possible the stock will exceed that level based on analyst estimates.

TLDR; MRE appears to be an undervalued stock ripe for a reversal in the future. Potential gains may exceed 30% based on analyst estimates and technical analysis. The anticipated time horizon for the trade is approximately 2-4 months based on previous movements in the stock's price.

Just a repeated note: this is not financial advice. this DD is a work of fiction. none of the information provided is certified as accurate. The trade may not work out exactly as depicted, as it is mere speculation.

Edit: correcting wording"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember when this sub had a lot more posts like this. Solid work. Will continue to watch.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know people are expecting stocks going up across the board once things start opening up again, but as someone who works in automotive industry, I would be wary about it.

I don't know about this particular company, but consumer cars are the most vulnerable products, because the moment people don't have money, the first thing they stop is buying new cars. Automotive has been on decline already in 2019 before Corona, marking that a recession was about to begin. The pandemic just made it even worse.

Personally I think the automotive won't have big gains once things open up, at most they might stabilise their profits a little. I say this because I believe the economy will be still hit by inflation and other long term issues that were caused or masked by Corona. I also don't think people will decide to suddenly start buying new cars, I think most will be careful for now and buy a used one if needed.

So to analyse MRE, I would look if they have any work in commercial vehicles (trucks, vans, etc), these are more resilient to economy changes and might have even been on the rise throughout the pandemic, since companies needed to deliver more. Another point would be to look at the exact projects they work on and the parts they produce. See if their parts are used in EVs as well (so no combustion engine related). And the last point would be to see if they're working on some new useful technology, because that would make them an outlier from the rest of the industry.

Edit: autocorrect is bad"

2021-03-29 08:52:45,wallstreetbets,"Bill Hwang's firm just went tits up, prime brokers like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Nomura still have $22-30 Billion of his books to liquidate Backstory: 

Archegos Capital, a prop trading firm run by Bill Hwang (apparently not a smart man), managed to completely blow up his $80 billion portfolio in true WSB fashion, the sheer idiocy and magnitude of this blowup makes us all look like mormon choir boys. This fucking guy had 5:1 leverage on $16 billion of capital invested in china growth/tech *at the peak of the fucking tech surge*, and *didn't fucking de-leverage* during the most obvious sector rotation ever 6 weeks ago. It's all gone now. Liquidated. To zero. He was heavy into china tech / growth stocks on 5x margin, $80 billion portfolio. Poof. 

Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place. Rumor has it, all of the different PB's this guy borrowed margin from agreed to an orderly selloff during the forced liquidation, but some unknown PB front ran them like a total cocksucking wench and liquidated all at once, causing a violent crash in BIDU and Viacom.

imagine you're china.  you're kind of sick of everything being back by the dollar and by the US throwing it's tremendous weight around.  you've been buying up gold and working on your own commie-creeptoe which you'll eventually issue out to citizens (as long as they're loyal to the party).  What's stopping you doing things that are massively leveraged against US assets and either (a) profiting massively, or (b) *fucking* up the system?  what do you care if you make the wrong bet one day and end up owing $10tn when you then turn round and go ""lol sorry USA today is the day we rug-pull geopolitics.  we're the big dog now""

the dollar is fucked long term either way, so once you've got your replacement plan in place, why not do everything you can to either profit or tank the competitor?"

>“After the series of issues the group has faced in recent months, across Greensill, mortgage backed securities litigation and a hedge fund write-down, we believe its capital cushion has likely been reduced to the point where its buyback is directly affected,” they added.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investment bankers are drawn to quick easy money, and corrupt money is some of the easiest to make.

Hwang might have been caught the US Justice Department, but he is still a billion dollar whale waiting to be milked and Goldman is not afraid of a little dirt like insider trading, hell they have supported their fair share of outright national embezzlements like the 1MDB scandal.

Goldman has been the gold standard for corrupt and greedy practices among Investment bankers for decades, of course their names were going to appear among the list of PBs."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares about insider trading until you're pissing off a person richer than yourself
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"HSBC flew chartered airplanes to Mexico to meet owners of Drug Cartels, loaded up the planes with as much cash as they possibly could, snort some coke, fly back to the USA, deposit the money into the bank WITHOUT reporting it was over 10,000 and washed all that sweet drug money. Not a single person went to prison. Not a single felony. Why? Because Obama made a mistake and appointed Eric ""Banks over People"" Holder as the Attorney General.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what I was saying yesterday in another post, they have insider information and all, when we have to wait for it to make the news.

Then I was told that ""nope, it doesn't matter"" , ""it's not true, they didn't make money on it"" 

They knew shit, they bought puts on it, while retail was buying long.  
Sold the assets leading the price down, making money on puts.
Then they bought calls, continuing to make money as the market was recovering.

And it's exactly the same thing that happened to GME Thursday and Wednesday, I'm sure of it.  
But because it's GME, we will know only in weeks, because Market Makers + their media puppets

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,of course; this is why the shorter time horizon you try to trade as retail the lower your expected return will be
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about? Lol. The news was public pre-market. Goldman was offering the shares at $185. It didn’t cite that it was Bill Hwang’s fam office account, but there were rumors on the margin call."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s basically a WSB degen but with access to billions in credit. So the implosion is that much more spectacular.

I don’t even know how the hell he managed to get margin called when all his shit had run up this much in recent months so normally he’d be pretty safe from a margin call but he must have used the higher share values to continue borrowing and buying even more shares of ViacomCBS and stayed levered to the tits."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's 16B levered 5:1 to 80b
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He lost 16b, but the value of his holdings that he got on margin and that's now on banks books is (was) worth 80b, minus how much it went down to force liquidation, minus how much they are worth now after the crash."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost $80bn but he only had $16bn so we will see a fuck ton of an upstream shit show to follow.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they were stupid enough to believe all banks would exit orderly. They probably were the slowest to react.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">Why would a cock sucker be in the wrong here? The first to sell reduces liability and maximizes value before anyone else.

Because the brokerage game is a long game, and once you break the trust, you don't get to request others for orderly sell offs in the future. All other brokages will frontrun your brokage.

But its an asshole vs other assholes, so who cares."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Done.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno about VIAC tbh. It was looking tasty to me yesterday but looking deeper into it I think it was actually just overvalued. It seems undervalued when you compare it to Netflix but like Netflix is probably overvalued.

The chinese tech stocks getting dumped as part of this look the juiciest to me because tech has also been hammered and chinese stocks have also been hammered, plus this hedge fund supernova causing them to dump... major value from a trifecta of dumping these stocks that haven't really seen their solid fundamentals change.

Edit: I mean VIAC probably not a bad buy but comparing it to last Nov the current price doesn't seem that cheap"

Other banks MS caught on and only shitty CS and Nomura who had direct exposure got fucked. Other banks like Wells UBS were de grossing their balance sheets to names which were impacted by this margin call further putting selling pressure on the names. The real kicker is the trade was free money? Why? GS offered 15% discount and the market still was pricing the names in the original block above the sale price, anyone in their right mind would’ve short the living shit out of those names (which many did) make a quick buck and then buy those names at fire sale prices when CS Nomura Wells and UBS finally got their heads out of their asses and woke up to the 5 alarm fire."

The more liquidating they can do without much attention the less $$$ the brokers will stand lose. CS and Nomura were second or last after GS & MS.

There is no real difference between a family office and hedge fund in terms of investing style. It's a question of having outside money managed by the legal entity."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Also aren’t they a family office rather than a hedge fund (if there’s a difference?)

From what I've read, a Family Office has different, less stringent, reporting requirements than a standard hedge fund. Someone with more experience can probably speak to that, because I'm just a Chihuahua in front of a keyboard."

With that info you know the price is tanking because someone is liquidating, not because there is something wrong with the company.

I don't mind buying shares at a higher price than a fund, I don't expect otherwise due to scale, but having different info is what's crippling us, not the price itself."

What you can do is search for any other large institutional holders, if there are a couple, and those funds have not being performing well this year, or flat performance they will likely liquidate their holdings too, adding more selling pressure.

There's more downside, but how much and for how long is impossible to guess. There's some money to be grabbed, just ask yourself if the $ invested (x) will yield enough profit (y) during a certain amount of time (t) to make that Y?"

I’m not saying it’s certainly the case here, but for these business (or gangsters, though maybe that’s redundant in this case), the working relationships and ability to continue working together matter hugely.

you actually pay out everything you own. then if the judge believes you are stupid enough you would be put on a payment plan.  IF you fuck around in court or hide shit you will 100% go to jail plus forfeit whatever you were hiding. IF you don't pay out the bankruptcy statement in full then you go to jail. Alot of people don't get that bankruptcy is straight letting the courts take everything that you own of value like you literally have nothing even your underwear is fair game if its considered valuable enough.  In this case Hwang could be lucky if the bankruptcy is all under business rather than personal debt. Although its backed with his personal money so hes most likely completely fucked in court due to mix of personal funds.
Or even extremely unlucky depending on who he owed that money to i'm talking about people that like to break legs. 

Case in point: I hope to see Hwang at Wendy's now.

Edit: I just realized bankruptcy wouldnt scare most wsb because you guys literally already have nothing of value anyways if you go tits up . i guess this is only for people that have something to lose."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I bought puts last week. I sold the $225 Calls when it was at $225 and so my profit was only the $104 spread.  :(  Trader hindsight is painful.  Think I will sell more calls on this name this week as I have a pain parameter that it fits well into.  $138 is my target but don't have a date.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At least the contract writer made $165.00. And he gets to keep his shares!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who used/sold on etsy, it sucks. I hope it digs itself into a deep hole with its ridiculous seller fees and hidden fees"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason why is most oil tankers are too large for the Suez. Oil prices wouldn't be affected by it as much.

OK now he has corrected me and says it wasn't 10 minutes. There are... darn-it now he is looking up whether Morocco or Western Sahara was the northern half.... now he is listing them again... 

OK I have fallen asleep in the middle of my own joke Zzzzzzz"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The almighty Carthage was a pretty big threat to romans, had their asses kicked on their own soil even..sadly it ended in a tragic way for Hannibal..
There are Roman villas and also the Jem colosseum thing, I recommend visiting it pls don't do harm to tunisia it a toiny struggling country"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"And there is also this!

I'm drooling just remembering this!!! 😋"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"South Africa is of course a troubled country, can we short England and long Scotland and Wales instead?  Asking for a friend."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but spared from what though?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like buying the in the $2's or low $3 range. With this news I dont believe they have a great shot at shooting up high again and I would not recommend FOMO'ing at this point.

As many others have said. There are better tanker picks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the liquid side, no volumes to sustain any continued pressure.  Refinery throughputs still in the toilet, and still a huge amount of tonnage oversupply. 

&#x200B;

No clue about dry, but tankers will be 2022."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL tell him Morocco (maybe?), Algeria (I think), Tunisia for sure, Libya in particular (although I wouldn't advise a vacay there), and then the entire eastern Mediterranean.

The nice thing about Tunisia is the ruins are often far from the beaches so you can get the place to yourself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, friend, no harm will come to Tunisia.  We like blood oranges and lamb cous cous."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would you fly to Tunis direct?  I think I would fly to Nice, pick up a Citroën on the cheap but well maintained, and take the ferry to Corse and then onward."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, totally!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Another member of this sub proposed to bet against the entire country of South Africa in what appeared to some as a degree of seriousness.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. I was hoping they would have gone up higher due to that ""gas crisis"" at the beginning of the pandemic. But it just never happened despite many things seemingly going well for the business."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually if I'm being honest just go to Sardinia.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes me happy ngl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Darn! Can't answer your question because we stopped there via a cruise. 

But while in Senegal (different trip), we ran into a group of rallyers who had driven down from Amsterdam. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/B5IA-i0hRJU/

..... so this could be a group to look into that would have info on dealing with driving north Africa.

While you're in Tunis/Carthage (looking at the Roman ruins), try to check this out.  It was particularly meaningful to me being an American. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcksn-VhymQ/"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"NOT FIBANCIAL AMBICE!  I've done the DD, I'm pulling out of my South Africa short.  Going long on Scotland and Wales, shorting England!  Tea party all over again, Canada better get on board or I'm shorting my northern neighbors too."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL Well that conversation did not travel in a circle at all. Floating ships... shorting continents... just a country... ok some other countries too... look roman villas... topping at future travel plans.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rat Patrol baby!  Such an interesting country.

You can definitely catch a ferry, I flew to London then Tunis, then caught a ferry to Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and finally Nice.  Beautiful, but that time I was on a bicycle, next time I'd rather have a car the scirocco can basically stop you in your tracks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We should just short ourselves also and invest in the new Retard Island stock. I heard there's going to be lots of apes strong together on it, going to the moon!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"😀 Tunisia is a bit of an adventure and off the beaten path, Sardinia is the home of the Mediterranean diet where folks often live well into their 100s, and also a bit off the beaten path.  Oh and Sardinia has both Roman ruins of course and prehistoric dolmens- ancient, mysterious carved rocks.  Good times. 👍"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Christopher George! 😍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now I think you might have gone in the facetious direction.  But that's okay, I understand not everyone believes in my DD."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but I'm telling you, this island is a penny stock that nobody knows about. I saw it after I had a delicious meal of multicolored crayons."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"See that's the issue, you mixed the colors."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damnit! My wife told me that was ok before she went to her boyfriends house.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what my wife said too but I just kept them under my tongue until she left, and then I spit them out."
2021-03-29 05:09:25,wallstreetbets,AMC YOLO - Tired of trading. Me only buy now. 
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your name? Charles Schwabs? lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok first of all - FUCK YOU.  Second, congratulations!  My hero!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Story: I turned 70k into 4M over the last 18 months (without margin and without options) in an IRA. Quit my job. Threw half into AMC. LFG YOU RETARDS.

Edit: for those saying you can do options in an IRA, it was a 401k. I only converted it to an IRA this month. And yes, I am now enabled for selling covered calls in the account. Thanks for helping me keep a factual account of the events.

Edit2: yes, i trade options as well. Of course. 
https://ibb.co/MR1nj9H
Screenshot of RH before transferring to ameritrade last week. It all started with Luckin calls.

Edit3: yes, i get it, am a trading unicorn. Thank you for all the messages. I won't have time to reply to them all. This has been a lot of fun. I will definitely make an animated timeline of all my trades over the last few years and maybe some explanation of why I invested the way I did. I think that will probably answer most of everyones questions vs. replying directly."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll tell your wife to come home when AMC hits $1K
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,welcome to the AMC family. 💪🏻
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations; fuck you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"now THAT, is a YOLO"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally, a whale post on AMC!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes. Hope this is real. Any way to confirm?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What an aboslute retard, save some chromosomes for the rest of us"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The ape is strong in this one. To the 🌝. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit....  each of your testicles has to be the size of a full size SUV.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They should let you go into a closed down amc and play video games or watch porn on the big screen if you own that many shares
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This gives me hope. All my shit is in the red. I can only average down so much.

Could you share your basic dd strategy? Mine is simple, I don't know what I'm doing so just do what everyone else is doing.

Either way gl, would love to see some DFV level gains in the future from you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I should just give you my money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck AMC is the big talk this weekend on social media and on Webull. LFG to the fucking moon 🚀🚀🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have never seen the pre-loss porn part of the graph. Normally, you just see the end result from the ~5k to millions back down to a couple hundred dollars. I feel like this is seeing a unicorn in the wild."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think of the dilution? Serious question.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have DFV, now we got BDG over here about to make 8 figures too. See you on the moon."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey bro! How's mom and dad? Cool! Great catching up with you. Get back in touch after you pass, just let your lawyer know that you're leaving me with a majority in the will. K, later bro"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey you!!!🏃Listen here buddy🔪. I’m gonna send you some fuckin money. You’re gonna trade with it, keep some of the profits and then send it back alright?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Will send the finest ape nudes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You just made my dick hard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying more tomorrow because of this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is pretty damn impressive!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Enter the slow clap!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tard level turned up to 11.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya wanna kno something, I like the stock and I like movies too"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is fantastic. I turned 25k into 250 but since have dipped back into low 200’s. I need to get to those double commas but I’ve been making stupid decisions. Getting a little discouraged but I’m getting back to basics. Best of luck on the amc!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,just rented a whole amc theater for you
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit 😳😳
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like you, I like you a lot 🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🤲💎🤲💎"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn baby you single? 😍🤩🤑🤣🤣
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Adopt me plz
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you usually read about your next stocks and what do you have in mind next? Will risk it same level or do more covered calls and sell puts? Big fan. Fuck you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me looking at this while having only 1000$ invested.
Ok."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I fucked as much as you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,On a scale from 1 to 10 can i barrow 5 dollars?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have 1.7 million. Why not buy a high dividend stock and make $190k/yr doing nothing? I’m amazed that such degenerates have this kind of capital.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Goated
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,School is in session!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quit your job nice 

How old are you?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost sold AMC but ya know what fuck that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't think WSB was big on AMC.... shit ton of AMC people here, apparently."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy mother of God you’re u/DeepFuckingAmc
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m new af, I guess I buy AMC when I get my brokerage confirmed? Yes that’s how new I am"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Please post loss porn at the end of the week!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You glorious son of a bitch you. I have one question for you, how do you know when it's time to sell and realize gains? Every time I look at a chart in hindsight, I always look at the bottom vs the top and think ""I could have made this much!"" But in reality I would have sold at the first small peak. Is it just luck or is it DD giving you confidence that those initial peaks aren't the limit?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why aren't you just selling 1600 covered calls at a really high strike price and just living off of that for the rest of your life. Like you should have been doing that from the start.

Like literally sell the 20 strike covered call for 0.09 in premium, instantly you're making $16,000 a week in that will probably never get touched. ""Worst"" case scenario is you literally double your money to $3.4 million. If you're one of those apes who thinks that's not enough for some reason then you're probably bound to lose all of this money anyways because you're so blinded by impotent rage to realize that you basically are set for the rest of your life.

You won the lottery and you've got a free $40,000 a month stipend for the rest of your life, just do that now and go live your life doing whatever the fuck you want for the rest of time. Travel, sit around eating pints of ice cream and playing ben and jerry's, fuck escorts, whatever.

What is wrong with you dude lmao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you find companies and what do you look for In them when making your decisions to invest in them or not?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wishing the AMC crowd good luck and god speed on their trip to the moon but as someone who works in the film industry, I don’t get it. The major studios are all slowly shifting away from conventional theatrical releases."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question: Early on when GME was taking off, people said AMC was a distraction by the hedgefunds. Is this no longer the case?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You sir have Tiger blood
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Help us all
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to retire, too.

Time to start trading pennies, I guess.

u/BunDogGrillionaire Congratulations and Fuck You."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking 🌙
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Another legend
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hold my AMC 90@13.30$
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I don't understand but if you have millions of dollars to be Yolo-ing into the market what are you trying to achieve? I mean you already got money. Is this something you're just are doing for fun?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys realise this is 99% likely to be a simulated holding right? 🙃 You can do this on most platforms.. check the karma farmers post history before showering him with awards and praise 🧐
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,1.75 million fucking dollars?   In shares?  This sub was loads more fun when whole Wendy's paychecks were being bet on 0DTE OTM calls.  DD was a shrimp toss.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does your wife need a new boyfriend?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to see a therapist
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You put millions, on AMC?

You belong here.

I like you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curious as to why the play? 

I bought in at $20 + and dumped out at $6. Where do you place a PT EOY?

You have the single biggest position I have seen from an individual."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why AMC over GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit buying in at those prices😱
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC too liquid imho
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless you have like $10M in the bank please cash out some decent portion of this, enough to buy a home free and clear and some vehicles. Then yolo the other $1M or whatever and post the loss porn.

Edit: congrats, fuck you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done my good man. I hope you will be joining us on the GME rocket as well. I hear they have moist towels that are served by apes and an endless supply of bananas.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you vote on the recent AMC shareholders items? I voted no down the line lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Should’ve get GME.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC could be a convenient HF diversion. Don't fall for it. GME is the play of a lifetime. I will wait for GME to play out and then look into AMC.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"On one hand, it's great to be able to hold. On the other hand, AMC has done absolutely nowhere. The 52 week high remains 20. It's not going anywhere. It struggles to even be 12 now. 

I sold that position and moved to GME. It's the place to be."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I could see doing this with GME, but AMC... That one would have me shitting bricks.. they're not even trying to save the company. Sold @13 to double my position in GME and haven't looked back. 

Hope you have the last laugh tho, good luck , I'll even sprinkle some 🚀🚀 dust  so u know I mean it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why amc and not gme?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you holding till is my question 😅🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it say “Short” next to all of your holdings?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda bought gme sir
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh, I hope you lose all of your money."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've done nicely, but why AMC and why now?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a funny looking GME
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion with it looking likely that the board are going to create a lot more shares, it may be time to sell AMC. It’s gonna take a big hit if the vote passes, which it probably will."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Call it a day Bill Hwang, your family miss you"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda wish you were out here buying GME..godspeed
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its really bad for our movement if you day trade with this amount of stock. So just buy the dip and hold and it will pay off 🙌🏾💎🚀

(Not financial advise)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,if you can affort to lose it than why not but be careful
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not GameStop?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not GME
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could sell your AMC and YOLO in GME, but I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice. I recommend Googling Tiger Asia...the first of many HFs to fall."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not throw that in GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Objectively terrible play, but good luck."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro this sounds lame af but just sell options. Make like 1% every month. That’s the very floor too. 200k a year ain’t bad lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m wayyy more interested in GameStop man
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why I.love this guy? Simple

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Was the original 401k through an employer or did you set it up yourself? I have a 401k from a previous employer I’d love to trade with or convert to an ira but I didn’t even know it was possible
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"- Past 6 months my 70k became 120k. I'm just not penny'ing hard enough, apparently.

- Also, I'm not even mad. Fuck you, ape! Pull up a chair :)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,that's a lot of shares.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Spend it all making a biopic about your life. Lie about everything. Bring it out on AMC streaming. You’ll either make more or you’ll spend it all in a grand fashion.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What about butt stuff?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Nice Going! Wow. So you don't pay any capital gains trading in your IRA correct? Just have to pay like 37% in taxes if you withdraw? I'm in a quite similar situation as you - I got laid off though. I had 77K in my IRA when I got let go, after 12 years of work. Decided dump the mutual fund the money was in and trade. Turned the 77K into just over 300K now in the past 4 months. Have had to take out some money to live and been paying 37% taxes when I do. Whew... Any suggestions?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Today was boring AF
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You are the deepest f**** value
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The silent truth is that there is only two non meme stocks and they are GameStop and Tesla. I apologize for however you were mislead but DFV never said anything good about any other two stocks than these two.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Folks.  Do google image search for this.  This guy stole from someone else who stole from other.  Boggles my mind that this group accepts screen caps that are easy to steal and make in photo shop and use as proof that they actually own an account with $1 million.  Stop being suckers people.  Those who believe bull shit posts like this are the true retards.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone who buys amc is spitting on DFV. This is obv fake no one is dumb enough to buy a real meme stock. There are only two non meme stocks and they are GME and TSLA.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Something just seems off with this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wealth turns people dumb?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck you are retarded. Enjoy going back to work
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumb! lmao

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your a cool guy. Can you get a girl now??


HOW tacky to post a real pic of my account statement."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost roughly 25k on GME last January, rode the wave 🌊 ⬆️ and held through the massive dip afterwards. But, as stupid as I was chickened out and sold off to cut losses with only 5k left in my trading account. It sucks, but a lesson learned idk, I’m impatient - only been trading for a few months or so, no options atm. 

I’m still willing to put my last 5k into GME or AMC because I want to fight my way back on track. If I may ask... would you yolo it all on lets say some  amc calls or 50/50 GME AMC stocks or full amc?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me and Charlie Schwab used to party all the time
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to smoke pot with Charlie Schwabs
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Charles Schwab ova’here hehehehe

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the 70k into 4m over 18months... in an IRA?? this is possible?? this should be the post.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You and u/deepfuckingvalue should start a meme hedge fund and help us all reach the moon with a diamond-handed ape rocket.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,BIG DICK ENERGY HERE
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What was your strategy

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way to go, that's simply awesome."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,how did you turn 70K into 4MM in 18 months with your 401K? All the 401Ks I have been a part of never game me any control over where my money was invested.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish my 401k allowed me to pick stocks. My 401k in the past year has been shitty while I've been killing it in the IRA.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats amazing. Can you teach a fellow ape? Or better yet can you adopt me? I want to have 4 million bananas too 🦍🍌
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you topped me by a lot. AMC let's fucking goooooooo!!!!!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Half of 4M ?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What does LFG stand for?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets, Honest question: That’s 5600%+ in 18 months are you man or god?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What did your wife’s bf say?!?! After you quit your job!?! Congrats on getting out of the rat race!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This man single handedly funded the IRA

Make Ireland United Again"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, that’s the dream"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you looking to adopt?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So wait, is all this in an IRA account currently? How does that work with withdrawing cash for when you need to pay rent/buy food etc."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you realistically see amc going to.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you are saying is that you make your own coffee at home?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow teach me? 70k into 4M in 18 months!!! 

How did you generate your strategy? 

I want that sorta mastery and proficiency in the financial markets. Wow. Impressive. 

An animated walkthrough of your journey/endeavor with explanations would be awesome! 

Can you teach me? Plz?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Advice for a 27 year old with little too put in?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I’ve tried messing around with my 401 on Fidelity. I can only seem to find like being about to buy like growth funds and groupings of stocks and not individuals. Is there something I am missing there?

I’ve tried searching online to get more info but have come up short. If it is something I can do (since seems what you were able to do) know what I should be looking for or a site explaining by any chance?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"millionaire, kindly advice if I should exit GME with my $6k in loss and move my remaining $15k into AMC because clearly a guy like you who turned 70k into 4Mil I would listen to in a jiffy and Yolo into anything.  Let me know please thanks.  And btw you're a legend, you're only person after DFV that I know to turn thousands into milllions."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey. MAn, if you can spare one of those millions, I could give you some beans and say that they’re magic or something.  Oh! Or I could give you my secret pickle recipe."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What app do you use? And is there any tips you could give a trade newbie?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you invest in? I invested $90K turned that into 170K....still looking for other investment opportunities...i wanna be a millionaire 🤦🏻‍♂️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Please don't.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I joined the A-list membership to support them.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t have many stock in it but I’m here to fight!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"He could make $28,400 per week selling $15 covered calls

Straight bonkers"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://ibb.co/YhNqM4f

Note: the $0 value was while converting 401K to IRA."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,...that would make us...never mind. We all belong here
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They are slightly above average. They make the dick look even smaller than it is. Life's hard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be sweet. I think $25/mo to see 3 movies a week for free is plenty though.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This actually doesn't cost that much. You just need to know the right people. 
Source: I did it (minus the porn part) with 3 people in a completely virgin cinema 2 days before first opening. I also saw Ex Machina on opening day and it was pretty intense having just 2 people in a 300-seater.

It was awesome, btw."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"GL to you man, i know im not OP, but we are all in this together! Let's go green this week!!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just highlighted why all of you are going to lose money. You can only average down so much. The rampant greed has a limit, and once people realize this it becomes a rush for the exit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,where are you getting that info? i need some confirmation bias im not fucked on my 4/1 calls :-(
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I had loss porn from 350k to 70k a couple years ago. Thanks LJPC.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guarantee this fucker is up to 7 million in a month.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I voted against it only due to the timing. I would love to see a re-vote, leading to a post March 3rd (the original share count date) count. 

I firmly believe that the shorting is now at an astronomical level and that hedges used the March 3rd date as their start date to begin massive manipulation and shorting, knowing the hard cutoff for the count. If AMC would just put out a PR that the share count will be recounted next month, I believe we would see an ungodly amount of short covering to fix the bullshit they've done. 

I know so many people who have doubled, tripled, etc. their position here since March 3rd. I honestly wonder how many public shares we really hold right now. I think it is way, way, way over 100%."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which stock yields 11%?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,39
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don't have the funds to buy into GME sure... No other reasons to go for AMC instead.

Edit: Oh, got downvoted by the AMC crowd... Here's the long version then. 

AMC has diluted its shares by more than 400% since the begining of the pandemic, they are holding a vote to more than double it again, so let me ask you guys this question, what is a safer bet long term if the hedge funds find a way to prevent a squeeze, GME or AMC? The company that hasn't diluted its shares at all during the pandemic or the one that keeps diluting it to stay afloat when there's a third wave of covid coming with younger people being affected more than ever by the variants? Which of the two has the most potential to renew itself as a business?

Let's take Cinemark for a comparison, it's share price was fairly stable before the pandemic when looking at the 5 years chart, right now they trade at 20$ which is about half its pre-pandemic value. They have a market cap of 2.4B and have 4566 screens to make money from. In comparison AMC has 8218 screens so to keep things proportional that's a 4.3B market cap, they're at 5.1B at the moment, fair enough there's hype around the stock compared to CNK. People are suggeting they should be valued at 20$ or more under normal circumstances, this would double their market cap but it fits with CNK going back to its pre-pandemic value too (let's ignore the fact that AMC's stock was going down in price since January 2017). The elephant in the room? They're most likely going to double the number of shares they have on the market with a vote taking place to issue 500M shares! That's enough to save hedge funds if they shorted the stock over 100% and that's enough to make sure the stock price comes crashing down to recover at the level it's at at the moment... And that's without having done anything to change the business itself to increase it's revenues!

And the CEO had the audacity of taking home a 3.75M bonus when it's retail investors that saved the business..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you wanna gamble, yes.
If you wanna invest for the future, no."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because no one is buying 1600 4/1 covered calls with a $19 strike. Literally just look at the volumes and you’ve answered your own question.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls on a volatile stock you expect to moon is a stupid play.

$16,000 on $1,700,000 is < 1% while taking massive downside risk that AMC collapses (which it likely will)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to know too
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like something a short hedge fund would say.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Still the case.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You really need a good 10 million pre-tax to live successfully in LA. Plus, I want to retire my immediate family as they don't have the ability to do something like this and don't have any retirement savings."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No exit strategy. I am playing this by ear as I do all plays. As the story develops so will my plan. I really want to see what happens with the 500m share vote and the coming weeks. 

The amount of manipulation seen on L2 has been increasing. The only explanation for the rise Thursday is that they indeed wanted apes to sell at the more favorable price. They could have held this thing down all week last week if they wanted to. That was their gift of ""crumbs"". No sale."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like both. I suppose it's because I started adding AMC under $5, and I believe it is yet to squeeze. I don't think AMC will go to $100 if I'm being honest. $40 would put the market cap about comparable to GME @ $250 or so I think?

Would be pleasantly surprised though if there's more in it. DFV never thought GME would go over $40 and look at it now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,50k shares are under $5.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm willing to be wrong
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Scared money makes no money
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whered you hear that the apes are the servers? We're the ones *being* served, my DD speculates a high probability that hedgies will be the servers once they lose their job and every penny to their name, so being an ape server on a rocketship will be a very attractive alternative to men who have no other useful skills for our society lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he voted no to dilution
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think I'm not in GME? (i have 30 shares). Haha. 

I found GME very late. I don't really read WSB for DD so I totally misses the play. I bought in around 50 though."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Why put your money into a business with a solid model, strong demand, and a massively undervalued stock instead of a failed business model that will likely be bankrupt this time next year and has already popped and dropped twice due to hedgie shenanigans?”

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,1% per month is the floor? Oh you’re new here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made 450% on the RMO warrants this month and gtfo. I have been doing less spac warrants lately. They were on sale for a little while though in the last correction. I made a spac tracking spreadsheet that updates via python and barchart API to find the lowest premiums to the underlying and try to get them when they cross below $1.50. There's obviously a lot more to it, but when EVs were trending it was a no brainer to pick up all EV warrants. Just look for the next trend. It's probably commodities."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It was through my employer. Luckily they switched to Fidelity which made brokeraglink account possible.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I sell options with ameritrade frequently. I am choosing not to sell amc calls at this time. If IV shoots up I may.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, it's not going to moon, and doubling from 1.7 million to 3.4 million isn't exactly anything to cry about in the freakishly small chance that it did. The stupid thing isn't selling covered calls on AMC, it's expecting it to moon for literally no reason.

The other option is to cash out and simply sell puts on a multitude of stocks with similar premium profiles to AMC."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I’ve put all my money in GME. Lots more DD showing that it will absolutely take off to the cosmos. I guess I’m wondering why you chose AMC instead."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"A solid model? AMC was in a freefall since 2017 and you can't transform the theater business.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what you mean. Like, is it an animated gif? No."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 10"" erect and -2"" flaccid."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then my brain looks just like my scrotum.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's obviously not good, but I have a somewhat different view on the market than most. I do not believe that a company is valued on fundamentals, but moreso that the market sets the value based on its desires, moreso now than ever. Tesla is the shining example of this, but there are many others. We place our money and trust with the change we want to see in the world, from that money the company can pull from to achieve their (our) goals. 

Although it seems we've already given AMC an endless supply of money from which they have not served us well with over the years, we are now at the crossroads. More often than not I enter trades at crossroads. It's where I'm most comfortable that exponential gains will happen.

So, it's very much just a race between the shorts, the shareholders, and theatre reopenings and the plethora of blockbuster movies coming out this year (and the enthusiasm related to the stock because of those factors) that I feel this is still a sound investment.

There's just too many moving parts in the finance infrastructure and hedge fund world right now to not be balls deep in AMC, GME, or both. If you want to hedge, UVXY is all but useless. My market hedge is AMC."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sir, are a moron. I'd love to see how red your portfolio is."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I regret not throwing half of the AMC money into GME on that last dip. I guess because I'm stubborn like my mother.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it’s WSB. Yolos of $1M and not $1.7M are still acceptable while not being full retard. DFV made sure his gains resulted in a positive cash position. That all being said, yea do some crazy shit, or continue to."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you not see all the transformation changes that will happen they talked about at earnings? Ryan Cohen?

You're an idiot."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"These issues have been addressed countless times. 
 
Aside from one or two Marvel movies, there hasn’t been enough AAA product on screen since 2017 to bring people to the theater. Do you go to a steakhouse that has no steak to serve? 

Filming on AAA titles has resumed and the moment theaters are allowed to be near their normal capacity, you’ll see people filling seats to view said product. 

As for transforming the theater business? Bullshit you can’t. There are as many different models as there are genres of film. Have you seen what GameStop is doing to “renew itself”? Have you actually been in one of their remodeled stores with their laughable Central Perk style vibe? 

That’ll work...if there’s anything gamers are known for its waking up, showering, and driving to their local GameStop to see if anyone wants to play with them. 😂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it's an unfortunate feature of Fidelity to show long/short HOLDING TIME on that screen. It's often confusing for anyone who doesn't have experience using them as their broker."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There's always a next time. Most people quit far too soon.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I'll be okay with 2M vs 4M.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I understand how dilution works. I’ll be watching for the proportionate drop you’ve predicted.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Somebody likes to make vague statements that allude to higher knowledge without risking that illusion by detailing their narrative.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tsnp became hmbl. It already like 5000x this year. Just be careful. And yea, i'm serious."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You must have been dropped on your head. Many times.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Provide proof. Haha. They may be my screenshots from my Stocktwits profile.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your right, it was a low blow. I couldn’t resist, as I truly believe the man is partially retarded. You love who you love.  Personally, I don’t see the real value of boasting about your position...good for you if you made millions, we don’t need your life story or how successful YOU’VE been.  Seems a little sus."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sayin it’ll only go to $40, using GME as the scale. I don’t think that’s the case at all. I’m new to this, but I’d like to believe weve attracted a lot of attention and at much lower price per share.  NOT knocking GME, but I’d rather buy 20 AMC shares over 1 GME right now. I think there’s a lot of people that will hop on board to ride it up once there’s a little more price action or some form of catalyst."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,K
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you find more information about pennies?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't do WSB, wish I had. I missed the GME thing entirely. I just use stocktwits mostly and have a pretty good bullshit sensor and have been trading since 2017 so i can read a chart."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless you! Financial advisor told me the same thing.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I'm doing pretty okay.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh so your portfolio must be a lot more successful, since you are giving advice. Do tell."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you look for when you DD pennies?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just starting out with pennies and got into IQST at a similar price, and it's been all over the place.  I kinda feel like it's gonna keep going up at some point, so every time I get a paycheck I average up by putting 30-40 dollars into it.  Hopefully this is the beginning of me turning into you.   XD"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of questions you ask yourself to get started when you dd pennies you got some bread crumbs to leave us?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, tell me your next penny play."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a Roth and a Rollover IRA.  Trade options in both.  Just need to up you options level.  Can sell CC, long calls and puts along with CSP and spreads no problem."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your number one source for researching / DD for penny stocks?  Thanks!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean about BNGO?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have a post of how you started out; background; and what you used to learn?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I was asking if it was a video or
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with being a grower
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Both of mine are smooth and hairless.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok makes sense, a trades a trade. Thanks for the reply."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have any feelings about my true love, BB?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re like Charlie Day in the episode where the scientists convince him he is smart. Random luck in the market has puffed your sails, but reality is going to crush you.

4 times more shares? That’s a death sentence for your position. Preach about new paradigms all you want but when supply is made much greater the price falls."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why AMC and not GME?  I'm looking to put a lot of money into GME tomorrow or Tuesday, but your post gave me pause.  I already have some money in AMC.."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company. The company issued shares to the market and converted debt to shares, taking the shares from 100million to 400million. The ceo then paid himself a nice bonus for saving the company.. when it was wall st bets that saved them.

I’m not trying to spread FUD, I was looking at this thing to invest and. I can’t find a reason, so I check these threads to see if someone found something I missed."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey i mean it’s still worth getting into GME, maybe wait for them to do another short attack"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine calling someone an idiot because he doesn't spend HIS money the way you want him to. H.i.s. money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously. Who else yolos 2m? This is WSB.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, you so salty.  You need to remove salt from your diet, or you'll be bloated and cranky all the time.

Just chill.  AMC is not gonna crash this year, the year when the pandemic is theoretically on its heels.  It'll open back up and its value will go up. Will it squeeze the way GME will?  Who knows?  But it's a fair play for someone to make, and only time will tell."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop is now focusing on online sales and using their stores as fulfillment centers so people get their items delivered on the same day they ordered, they're opening a digital game store in partnership with the big platforms (Steam, Origin, Uplay...) that's what they're doing.

Cinemark had a stock price trading sideways until the pandemic, how can you blame AAA movies for AMC going down when it seems it didn't affect one of their main competitors?

The pandemic is entering a third wave with even more contagious variants that affect younger people more than before.

They diluted their shares by 460% in a year and are asking to dilute them even more and to give bonuses to board members.

Good luck with that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just moved over to them this month, but still suck with the app. All I’m holding right now is AMD, “short” but not short."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you do, but good luck. You'll need it"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Um AMC share count has gone from 100M last year to 440M this year meaning $10 in the stock now is the same as $44 in the stock last year. Meaning it’s trading above its *all time high* market cap. And still has $5.7B in debt.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you consume even 1 hour of Keith gills live stream you will know which stocks are good and which ones aren’t. If you’re here to lose money then why not piss it away somewhere else? Yes amc is cheap but does it have years of heavy investors like Tesla and GameStop? I’m sorry you fell into this lie that the media and hedge funds fed you but there is not another short squeeze in the past 100 years other than VW (30b naked shorts dead), GME(100B naked shorts dead so far), Tesla (1/2 trillion naked shorts dead so far)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a pennystocks sub on reddit that's usually decent for some ideas. I never base any pick solely off of there though.  Twitter/Stocktwits/Yahoo Finance, there's a couple of different places I usually look for info before I buy and I usually only buy 1k blocks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you think GME will still squeeze? I bought into both after the initial squeeze and have made gains, but i was curious what you thought. Not looking for financial advice btw."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Robert better not get in my face. I’ll drop that mother fucker
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how I got downvoted for my you sound demented comment because these idiots dont understand what we are doing

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say 70k-140k is okay, 4 mil holy shit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy QYLD and live of the 10% monthly dividends. Done.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hahahahaha 👑
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt you’re doing okay but you have objectively hit the lottery bro. With 4 mil, you should switch to passive strategies such as dividends or selling options to make a very solid income. No doubt you trust in yourself to make the right picks but step away from the retardation for a moment and think what would happen if you went all the way back down. Unless you’re just rich af aside from this 4M then you can just do whatever the fuck you want."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me everytime. 2 sweet n sours plz
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,money makes people do weird things...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We got a regular Dog: the bounty hunter over here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This could work.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,can i be in the movie too?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And ZOM at .17.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fear.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I was also in ZOM at .17 brother. And MVIS. And VISL. And plenty others. I appreciate that you're crushing it as well.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm -40% on BLPG right now. The Hypur RM may never happen and be all bullshit, but it's enough to keep me in. If it does come to fruition it will be an easy 20x. I'm not too bullish on it, but I'm also not selling."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was originally a 401k. Hence, no options. Just rolled it over this month to IRA."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm looking to start a roth that allows option trades.  do you mind naming a few that do? i.e. does Fidelity?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubled down on BNGO at .40. It was my first $1M trade.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He hit a Bingo with BNGO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Or what? A video or what?!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,his portfolio definitely is a grower
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We call it blood dick and sausage dick in Germany.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I went about 14k negative in BB but I still allocate my paycheck to bb after bills and live in ramen while my wife hates my life choices but I wake up everyday hoping it goes up just a crumb over what I invested so I can finally jerk off without using a noose
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No position. I traded it and made some money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you owned me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you invest? I don't, well at least not yet. Tell me what stocks you actually feel positive about or where you'd put your money. Genuinely asking because while everybody is congratulating this guy, you seem to be the exception, so just wanted to get your insight. Cheers."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which one of the two do you trust to renew its business if somehow the squeeze doesn't happen? Which one of the two do you trust to not dilute its shares after that we've seen in the last year and considering there's a third wave of Covid hitting the world with variants that infect younger people and forcing things to close once again?

I think the question answers itself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only real reason to invest in amc right now is if you believe the squeeze on amc is not sqoze.  

Fundamentally there has been nothing but bad/negative news. However as we are all aware by now fundamentals are also out the window. 

On the flip there's a case to be made about longing amc after the squeeze and after they dilute the shares more (if the vote passes and they dilute)."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no reason. It’s a bunch of idiots convinced GME is going to squeeze and thus AMC will follow suit. No further thought beyond that.

They are going to lose life savings and then cry and cry about how it is rigged. Idiots. The reason it is called “dumb retail”."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, not the WSB kind."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Online sales? Who are they going to beat on price? Who buys physical copies of games these days? It’s like you’re regurgitating talking points made by a 50 year old who thinks gaming still means pinball and Atari 2600s. 

How is this “digital partnership” going to work? Why would Steam give GameStop a cut of their sales? What does GameStop bring to the table besides a business model that had locations closing left and right well before Covid? 

...and there won’t be a Covid “third wave”. Biden can’t afford it so Biden won’t allow it. The MSM will march in lockstep and find other things to report on than a nasty flu bug that got mislabeled as a pandemic. Trump is out. The virus did the job they needed it to. 

Finally, Cinemark showed better profitability but also caught a decline. Saying that the stock price remained stable is utter horseshit. 

Good luck with your GME. I hope it has another squeeze left in it and you exit afterwards. This time next year you’ll most likely be holding nothing but screenshots when they go under."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney is now bypassing theatres all together. 

AMC is headed for oblivion IMO.  Dying business model, massive outgoings, and a business model that relies on packing a room full of people, during a pandemic. I can't think of a worse play?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So it’s trading above it’s all time high while most locations were shuttered due to Covid?

...and those theaters are now opening with filming of AAA, theater-only titles resuming? 

Shall we compare apples to apples with GameStop...? 😉"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't need youtubers to tell me which stocks to buy. I guess that's where we differ.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Followed? I hired an FA for 4 hours consult time to try to get a life plan together to best avoid taxes. He happened to also run a large hedge fund. We have become good friends since.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been hearing that since 500k. If i listened to anyone else I would never be here to begin with. I am my own person with my own strategies. You have to believe in yourself and do what feels right to you. If you live someone else's life you will never know what you could have had.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So what sub reddit do you run with your penny dd?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you do dd for pennies? Or how do you even find a list of pennies to know what exists in order to do search the dd for them?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome answer!!
Fear is.for the weak!!! Brother- Never change!! Fuck the noise!! Keepn.doing what  ypu do and write your own song!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,lol you should check out TBP then.  No just kidding as I don't want to see someone lose money.  Anyway do have any particular sectors of penny stocks you like to play or avoid? eg. avoid pharma penny play.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You fucking terrify me,  I have a raging fear boner"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really an answer but ok

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,thats too risky for me but now i can see how some people get filthy rich.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which brokerage do you prefer for penny and warrant trading?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"this stock was almost $2 back about 7 years ago, and has been trading for nearly as close to 0 as you can get for the last several years.  What about it makes you think it's going to rise again?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity indeed does
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! Well done! 

I got into BNGO much later but really like the product so I’ll be holding a while longer 😁"

If you want actual investment advice, stick to index funds, consider picking industries you feel strongly about (like tech, check out the “FAANG” stocks) and have an overall diversified stock ownership. Also don’t expect to make much more than 8-12% in a year. More can happen, but don’t expect it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze will never sqoze if AMC is increasing share count 4x.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you haven't been here long enough.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">Online sales? Who are they going to beat on price?

They just have to offer the same price with better service than their competitor. Just having the possibility of exchanging a product with a defect at a local store instead of having to ship it back can make the difference. You sound like all the banks that didn't want to finance Cohen for Chewy because ""Who is going to beat Amazon at that game? Get real!""

>Who buys physical copies of games these days?

Physical sales still represent 40%+ for consoles and as far as I know Sony hasn't started selling digital copies of their consoles and controllers yet. They're also entering the PC parts and accessory market which is in dire need of a serious big online and physical retailer.

>How is this “digital partnership” going to work?

I don't know, go ask Green Man Gaming, Fanatical and Humble Store? But I'm the one who has no idea what he's talking about here?

>What does GameStop bring to the table besides a business model that had locations closing left and right well before Covid?

Well well well, will you look at that, 20 stores located in a 35 miles radius isn't useful and forced closures because of Covid meant they started permanently closing unnecessary ones? Sounds like good we're finally seeing good management to me. And that's still ignoring the new focus on online sales. You prefer AMC's solution of diluting shares until people who bought before the pandemic have 10% of the voting power they had?

What they bring to the table is tons of physical locations in a market where they pretty much have a monopoly, diversificatioin into new markets where their physical presence will help them, a new online presence with a team that beat Amazon at this game in the past... What does AMC bring to the table besides a business model that had their share price go down since 2017?

>a nasty flu bug that got mislabeled as a pandemic

I'm not even going to answer to that insult to the 550k people who died of it in the USA and the other 2.5 millions who died of it worldwide.

>Finally, Cinemark showed better profitability but also caught a decline. Saying that the stock price remained stable is utter horseshit.

CNK: https://i.imgur.com/bgnMAyM.png

They caught their decline in January 2020, right as people were starting to understand that spending time in cinemas might not be a good idea at the inception of a pandemic

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/dhqbMAJ.png

They caught their decline in April 2017. What explains that difference except for a failed business model? How come we're not hyping CNK right now, I mean, they should be shorted just as much as AMC if there's no difference between the two, right?

To have a proportional market cap based on the number of screens both chains have (you know, the stuff that makes them money) and for AMC to go back to 20$ and stay there and keep that proportion, you would need CNK to go back to 40$/share and for AMC to not dilute the shares anymore, after the 500 millions shares dilution their fair price if their main publicly traded competitor went back to pre-pandemic price would be... 10$/share! Good, that's where we're at right now, won't make much of a change to you and the HF will have been saved from the squeeze, everyone will be happy!

Good luck with your AMC, with the management in place you'll need it, especially if they end up with 960 millions shares in the market like they're trying to make happen! Good thing for them they're getting a nice bonus to go with that!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney is absolutely not “bypassing theaters altogether”. Many AA films are being released to streaming due to locked down theaters. Now that restrictions are easing, films are already being marketed as Theater Only. 

Spider-Man: Far From Home, possibly as big of a hit as End Game considering it’ll delve into the Spiderverse, has already been slotted as Theater Only. 

Who owns Marvel again...? 😂

Your DD powers are weak. Join AMC and together we shall rule the tendies as Ape and Monke!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"All u/verb0182 is saying is that the stock which is what you’re buying and selling has been diluted 4 times over. Management sold you those shares to the open market.

As for theaters, read the 10-k they make a statement that they need stock and debt to support the theaters, this was before covid. That is why the stock was floating down. Even if theaters reopen 💯 they can’t get enough seats filled this year alone to float the stock due to social distancing."

2. That number is horseshit. Physical copies of games represent 13% of sales and dropping. There’s a reason the new generation of consoles offer Digital Only models and it isn’t because physical copies are making a comeback in this new green era. 

3. You didn’t answer me on the digital partnership. You made the claim. I’m asking you to explain it. Is that too difficult? Is it bullshit just like your other statistics?

4. GameStop was hemorrhaging cash and closing locations well before Covid. 

5. How many people die from the flu again? Remember how those Covid numbers got skewed? Why is it that the testing protocol for a positive hit changed under Biden and suddenly the infection rate plummeted? I’d tell you to think critically but you seem to be incapable. 

6. CNK has traditionally shown older films in older theaters for a lower price point. It’s a different market than AMC, at least in my area. 

That being said, you’ve got me looking at Cinemark now, as well. 

As for the 960 million shares, that hasn’t happened and everyone I’ve come across is voting against it. Funny how that works..."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,250 is not a storm. More like a good day and that's it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like the stock, buy the stock."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Calling $2k then a small drop to $800
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We need a BIG catalyst to gain momentum and push us past the point of no return. If GME announces anything worth a damn, I feel we are going to be in a good spot. 

Looks like we had news of a hedgie get margin called last week, so we know it does happen to these fuks. As soon as a big enough domino gets margin called, they will all fall down one by one..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you by weekly calls u retard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop buying options
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember when buying shares was for r/investing and options plays were for wsb
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$267.54!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"-28% = ""calm before the storm""

🤔"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got a gut feeling that the storm is going to start when DFV exercises his April 16 calls. I think he’s actually buying and not selling his contracts. That’s 50,000 shares on 1 trade and that’s why I think he’s holding the $11M in his cash out. That’s only a drop in the bucket for the strike price he purchased."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t it normally drop before it skyrockets so they can purchase shares back at the best value?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see your $250 and I raise you $2,000,000"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope the sky tomorrow will be like the starry award. Such a beautiful sight to see. Can you imagine it in real life?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fingers crossed 🤞🏽
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed brother
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"$250, easy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why. Are. You. Still. Using. Robinhood?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"""History will be written by the victors"" 

And it's gonna be us! So your sharpen your pencils boys and girls, this is gonna be a WW2-storming the normandy type sh!t to be written. The fate of the world economy hangs in the balance."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, Calls are absolutely the way to make money on this stock. But you gotta wait till it goes down, knowing we'll drive it back up. Last week it went down 60 and options hit rock bottom, then went up nearly ONE THOUSAND PERCENT when the price suddenly jumped back. Which at that point was a 60 percent increase. 

Buy Calls, sure. Always bet on GME. But timing is crucial. You need the runway."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hope we get some april tendie showers
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You're a moron. Buy shares. Options only help the hedgies and you're just gonna end up paying shitadel
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I would love to see this happen! GME gonna rocket like its October Sky🚀 😎
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Suck my nips and call my Ricky.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget these forums are watched carefully your options will be eaten! I just like the stock a lot and hope it goes on sale one more time ;) 💎🦍💎🦍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's going to go down because hedgies want to scare retail investors. I'm thinking it hits 135 this week before it really goes to the moon. I'm sure Cohen would love the stock to plummet to low 50's as would every ape including myself.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE THE STOCK
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on what?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m hoping $105 or under so I can get back in
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me 1 week
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope these work out for you! Mostly because I have 4 4/09 $300s!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have my 10 shares.  And my axe!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,IDK 🤷🏾 meh 😑 but possible
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t sleep, I’m too excited, I’m just gonna stare at my phone till premarket, maybe play some Roblox 😂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like every week, buying and holding $GME this week.

💎🙌"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets, Made me feel better about my calls getting fucked on Friday
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Considering my $300c expired worthless Friday GME will definitely go above $300 this week as a fuck you to me and my portfolio.

4/23’s 👍 and will make up for selling the 150 strike"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For my portfolio’s sake and for yours, I hope you’re right !"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's go
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your nuts
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you ahve enough to exercise at 250 just buy shares. It's the best bet.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme shares are like bananas 🍌
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls are bad big L
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I only bought options in GME lately because my shares were being transferred out of RH and I didn't know how long it would take. Wanted to have a slight safety net if it took 2 weeks and shit hit the fan. RH to Fidelity took 2 days lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m looking at the week of the 11th. A lot of craziness that day I expect
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m buying calls after the afternoon dip tomorrow. I think it’s going to be a big week too.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $150 calls seem safe, the $350 not so much..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looking at previous trends, I'm bullish on a huge run on Wednesday."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker doesn't even allow for option trading, but I'd like to understand them. Can someone explain the workings behind a $350 call with 4/23 expiry, 3 buys @ $17.53 as in this post? I assume that if the value of GME goes above $350 at any point between now and 4/23 you get 300 (3\*100) shares for a price of 3\*100\*$17.53? Is there any benefit in it going further up in value, or would you exercise the second it hits that price or above? 

Next, let's say it never hits that price. I guess you still have to pay 3\*100\*$17.53, but you don't get any shares. 

I hear people saying there is no limit on your loss, so please explain to this smooth brained ape where the infinite loss comes from! Ty"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I'm gonna call Reggie and tell him to set the stock price at $420 on his way out
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys!  He's calling it guys! GUYS!  He's calling it.  Nobody has ever called it before, and now it's finally being called."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So are we gonna just ""call it"" every week and pretend or are we gonna actually do the damn thing"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$300
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys can buy options?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck my friend. I really hope you get those tendies. The past weeks the price seems to settle near max pain. Does look like it was manipulated, my theory by the option writers to expire worthless."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares retard
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tough calls my dude. Best case you’re looking at a double on those 150’s (intrinsically). Shares would post half that but waaaay less risk.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pls be generous! Watching GME this week!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I buy call? I'm in europe

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,More like GME to $950
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I also predict that Ken Griffin will upgrade his title from cunt to super cunt.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no doubt that GME this week will present many highly profitable trading opportunities, but my expectation is that those gains will come from continued intense volatility with unexpected movements due to a plethora of dip buying options across all sectors. If you are a yolo GME trader you will do fine, I'm sure, but prepare for a rollercoaster ride as GME holders shifts at a rate you haven't seen recently."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"stop gambling with this stock, it's not what it's all about. Buy shares and hold shares, that's the plan, that's the sole strategy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where are you fucking shares. 

Options are nice to make higher roi if it goes the way you want, but without buying shares and holding we go nowhere.

You had at least 80 shares with that money. Now these 80 shares are in the hand of the hedge fund and market makers. You bet that the price will go up without buying shares and holding. 

If i don't buy, he doesn't buy and you don't buy your options are worthless."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,U r fuk
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Short weeks are historically bearish weeks. I see a lot of red this week and the next.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could've bought shares, or just donated the money. It would've been a bettee investment than pissing it away, but who am I to tell people how they should piss their money away."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,STOP. BUYING. GME. OPTIONS.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"After spending $5k on those $350c, you better hope GME goes $367+ not $250"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll keep selling you retards calls. Thanks for putting my kid through college.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people post their positions? Not a bright idea
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to fuck someone's wife. I can't hold my load forever for tendies that seem to be a hedges dream and retailers nightmare

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,U mean 250k per share ?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost 80k in GME options. So new strategy is to sell OTM covered calls on my 500 shares weekly at a price I'm ok with, recoup a little bit and use the premium to buy more shares. I have 50 on the side, if I can get another 50 that's another contract. Rinse/Repeat til daddy Cohen is CEO and we moon."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why this week? What's changed?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,some people never learn
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re the reason we’re still refueling

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you have more shares than this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to hand money over to the hedge funds u smooth brain.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m glad I don’t know options

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Folks sell or short gme now.  It will get crushed down today.  Futures tanking hard.   Take your profits and run (and buy puts and short and make more $!) I’m short at $220.  Hang on!0
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, GME to $50?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna pity you when you lose it all. This is a game of shares, and holding. Yikes from me dawg!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to be included!, how do I do a call 🥺"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd sell those 4/9's if I were you and roll them out into 4/16's or 4/23's if you insist in playing options. Be smart while you're ahead and build a nice comfy theta cushion for yourself.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares that is all
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm stupid. I'd I bought a call option to $250 a share ( 100x for 650ish) , my breakeven would be about $258 or so. Say April 1st it reaches $260, does this mean I make like $10 per share for a total of a couple thousand in profit?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,oh geeez
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,From your mouth to God's dick 🤞.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares, not options. The premium you pay is going to the pockets of those whom you bet against and it allows them to drag out the fight.

Not financial advice. Just my two cents."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yall always calling shit and nothing happens lmao. We know where this is going, and $250 doesn't have fuck all to do with that. Yall need to relax until you see 25k a share, then relax some more until you see 2 mil."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,crazy? What sub do you think this is?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain in a bit more detaili why everyone is saying ""buy shares, not options"", when the ""gamma squeeze"" everyone is talking about is directly related to MM having to hedge options with actual shares?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy profitable!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are legendary mode 
Only the most autistic of monkeys can do that"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares and sell options. Use premiums to buy more shares.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh you seem to have missed the 150bagger options from 2 weeks ago. Options are awesome lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Show me da way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,True WSB play options.  OP is an Autist Ape
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed....I've lost over $10k in options, I've only gained when I bought $20k in shares. Buy and hodl! This is the way! 💎💎🙌🏻💎💎"

Enjoy your profits ape"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think the last time options were relatively viable were before super MAR10 day. Sub 200 shares is da game now

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I misread this and bought financial advice.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Do this.

This is not financial advice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to make money over years (in any stock) buy shares. If you want to make money i months or less buy options.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a double negative. Are we buying shares or financial advice.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I could afford that. Also wish I could get approved for options but I was denied. Apparently I either dont have enough money or experience trading or both.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Either way the IV is insane, wrote another comment in [laymen terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfdqil/comment/gso1rw9) that past weeks was highly likely options expired worthless for a lot of buyers hitting the 'Max Pain', can find DD posts on why this has been so far profitable mostly for the side selling the options [/search?q=gme max pain flair:DD&sort=top&t=week](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=gme%20max%20pain%20flair%3ADD&sort=top&t=week)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I have to get out of my robinhood account unfortunately
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy cow. I bought in at $320 and was able to average down too $170 before going full retard and averaging back up too $230..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Guessing you also had no money to avg down at the 50's? I couldn't convince the wife that I was truly retarded and wanted to buy more when I was already negative. Now I must ask her bf for financial advice.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Had a lot of opportunities to lower your average the last couple weeks....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,320 average here and unable to average down. We will be reunited without Tendies. Have hope.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just do the opposite of what you think is a good idea. Don't wait until $340, buy more now, because you think it is a bad idea."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d appreciate a heads up when you buy more GME, I’ll wait for the dip and buy more lol"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too man
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in around $317 but averaged down to $170 over the last month and a half. I like the stock so I keep buying more whenever it goes on sale :)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Average down now, you still have time!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"With a stock like GME, I wouldn't fuck with options. It could be 100 tomorrow, or it could be 300. Yea if you pick the right direction it's good money, but that's not the kind of volatility you want to fuck with for your first options plays










Then again, if you want to learn a good lesson about options - it's a good place to start. You'll get hit in the face with how options can make you or break you realllll quick"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You could shove a random crayon up your poop shoot and leave it there til Friday and you got better odds of enjoying your week than this guy ☝️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"1: choose a number between what the price is now and infinity.
2: buy option with said strike price for friday
3:wait
4. Profit?

The further out of the money the better cause they are cheap."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt the same and then I thought I was buying some tech dips and then averaging down some ATM/ITM calls and I ended up blowing like 11 grand in a few weeks so now I’ve learned a painful ass lesson that’s staying with me cause I keep reliving the loss and all the things I did perfectly wrong along the way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying options gives hedgies premiums so they can reload for more short ladder attacks

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Please leave Boomer!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? Getting tired of these.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets," When you buy a call option, someone has to sell it to you. The option only makes money if the stock goes up enough. HF can sell the option to you, manipulate the price so they don't have to provide the shares that the contract would gurantee (if the price went up enough). Then they take the money you gave them to prolong their shorting shenanigans, delaying the squeeze, buying them time to find a new way to cheat. 

If you buy a share, you are basically getting in the ""rob this institution legally"" line and waiting for them to die so you can sell at whatever price you feel like. ."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The hedgefunds are making money on the options. Giving the enemy amo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are using options to hide their FTD, just delaying the squeeze and helping the Hedge Funds"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My brain is pretty smooth, I only really understand direct shares. A share is a tangible piece, all these other options are smarter orangutans playing with each other, and I want no part of that confusion.  Ridiculous explanation, but it's honest work."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares are better to have you can actually hold them when options are just hoping that the price basically goes up
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hedgies are max painal'ing FD's.  Made +15k two weeks ago and lost 11k this week cause of max pain entries. (ie $28+ premiums).  Could of bought shares and profited
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The gamma squeeze is irrelevant to the short squeeze
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,because a lot of people buy some really dumb options like 800 7dte and also because the iv is crazy high.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can't stop playing their favorite game.
It's down to being shorted only by around 24 percent. This has already gone to the moon, a couple times actually. I think we'll continue to see major price fluctuations on big news but besides that, it's over. They just like to dream.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm I'm doing options and idk what's going on
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on what strategy you're taking into GME. You run the risk of missing the squeeze unless you believe it's not going to happen.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's true. My name is April

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this continue to get financed? Are they wasting away? Getting help from cronies? I don’t understand. Holding regardless because emotional connection and I like the stock but don’t get what’s happening.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 3 calls expiring this week that I bought awhile back. So 🤞🤞🤞 with you that I can atleast exit those with a profit and reroll them 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,After the last earnings and the rise on Thursday I'm sure the retards will hold. But we have to hope smart money jumps on now that the momentum has switched for it to go up that much in the next few weeks.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean if you are the casino?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad market is still closed - otherwise you would have bought more 😱

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only money I have lost on GME was options 5k I could have put in to stocks don’t do it *not financial advice*
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But here it is cruical to buy shares, since they trigger the squeeze - sure gamma squeezes are possible but the shares are not hedged when the calls are set to a crazy amount and they won't be itm anyways."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It sounds like you didn't answer the questions correctly. I got approved for options immediately upon opening my first brokerage account. Just read about them first and then answered.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Try again
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your risk tolerance was likely the issue. If you didn't select considerable or high you won't get anything over level 1. If you didn't select moderate you will probably be declined outright.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just fucking lie on those forms. They don’t care about your livelihood, it’s just there to protect them from liability."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You went full retard, never go full retard man"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not that I had no money. I had no confidence it would go back up any higher than $200ish.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged down from $404 to $340...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh he gon learn today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it’s so volatile couldn’t you buy a call and a put? If it goes so far one way it would outweigh the lose of the other? Idk, I’m retarded"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought two options last week on NLY and they expire worthless but I only lost 20 bucks so it was worth learning
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea man I like learning the hard way.  What would I make if I bet $500 on it hitting 220 tomorrow.  That's what I want to do because it feels right.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"not only that, the spreads are fucking insane on GME"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Made $3k, lost $1.5k trading these last week. Lesson learned. 😂"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thursday. Market closed this Friday. Only 4 days of trading this week sadly.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"no lol. for the sake of actually pushing GME, don't buy way OTM calls/FDs. Buy share/ITM calls and hold. thanks"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Archegos
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s funny when I first started seeing the shift to shares on this sub. I was so confused. Shares used to be laughed out of this sub.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So is this sub about trying to make money or is it about posting loss porn? Because buying options because the “sub was built on options” is absolutely fucking retarded and not in the “haha we are WSB” funny way. It has been detailed many times why options for GME are more than likely a waste of money and it just hurts everyone else.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen lots of DD posts that buying stocks is better for the GME squeeze, don't remember the details. u/BVdubs and the people upvoting may be doing so because of that.

Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfdqil/the_calm_before_the_storm_gme_to_250_this_week/gsn2fyp/"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the reply that brings me back to old WSB
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me. I have some long calls along with 500 shares
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just seems like it hits a floor before it shoots way up.  Unless it’s a gradual climb like Tesla that took a year, but the GME chart looks nothing like that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be retarded, but I hate seeing you guys lose 70% on options that expire in a week"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I‘m going to sell half of my shares today lolz
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello other moron, shitadel writes many of these call options and cashes out when they expire OTM"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry f4gg3 t
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice NPC response!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. A poster was bragging last week about how he knew he would make money on his call options expiring on Friday. I explained to him that the time has passed for options for GME and if he took the 1200 he paid for the option, he would have several tickets to the moon, help the MOASS , and not give money to Hedgie fukers. We know we didn’t reach 250 Friday and now we have a ape holding his hand on his ass out his money. Buy and Hodl is my way. By the way I did buy call options after the dip in Fenbuary with a strike at 47. I paid 1200 for April 16 calls, with plenty of intrinsic and extrinsic value, which I executed already, but the time for those deals have passed. Buy your tickets and Hodl."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB is predicated on buying OTM short dates calls
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ergo buy and HODL.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nooby question and im in no way gonna hold this against you or anyone that answers.

What price do we think the stocks gonna go to eventually? I mean I've watched the first bubble, then the second and bought in at 280$ like an idiot. Now what?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This might be correct but not exactly most relevant to reason why people currently say not to buy options. I think the most relevant here is the price being pushed to hit exactly [Max Pain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp) for all call/buy options. For reference if you search for DD posts for GME and 'max pain' there's several posts that have looked into the daily and weekly closing prices of GME, and that there appears to be a big load of volume used to push price exactly to point where as many buy/call options as possible expire completely worthless (inflicting 'Max Pain' where the seller makes bank on collecting premiums but for the person buying option worthless expiring '[out of the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)'). [/search?q=gme max pain flair:DD&sort=top&t=week](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=gme%20max%20pain%20flair%3ADD&sort=top&t=week)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Orangutans are not actually classified as Ape's... thats why..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But aren't we all expecting the price to go up? Like thats our whole thing....

I think its more of buy actually shares so we have them and the hedge funds have to actually buy them from us not .... no?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this /r/inveseting or something?  Also, are you not hoping that the price goes up if you hold shares?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Also could be the hedgies were the ones who bought all the calls back in jan and when the market makers realized they were trying to fuck them they decided nah we don't want to get fucked let's max pain all these contracts and up the call premiums to ridiculous levels.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, max pain last week was 160 and it closed at 180. The week before that, max pain was 150 and it closed at 202."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if a gamma squeeze calls a margin call?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Elaborate!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the opinion, but that's not at all what I'm questioning."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You can absolutely hedge yourself and still have a position to capitalize on any squeeze if it comes.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I suppose if you're not good at it statistics. 0 and 00 throw it off in favor of the casino but you still have good odds betting on black or red or odd or even if it's hitting 60% plus. There are strategies you can play. Im up way more at the casino than I am in my portfolio
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, but you giving financial advice “Don’t do this.” Isn’t cancelled out by saying “not financial advice”

It literally is."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There may be more squeeze to happen but it’s gone from $10 ish to $200 ish + twice now. I’m all about more of a squeeze but acting like no squeeze has happened for a second time just not to the magnitude hoped for is silly
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep all or buy more mothafucka
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I've tried three times with Merril. What answers are they looking for ffs?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you thought that, averaging down would've meant making a profit...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah. Good ape.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you have to sell to afford that?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got learnt. My one and only options trade was a 400c on GME that expired worthless. Paid $3.1k donation to Shitadel.

Don't learn about options with GME. You're not DFV, you're late to the Game. It is literally roulette right now. 200c right at the time GME tanked to $113 would've made money within a day or two, but that would've been a lucky gamble."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried this and it went sideways haha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also IV is so high that even if it moves in the right direction, you lose a ton of value if you hold for too long. I know nothing about option but learned this the hard way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's when it trades sideways lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can that's called a straddle or saddle depending on the strikes but the point is that IV is so high right now that that play is going to be expensive as fuck.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To put numbers to this:  


Right now as I type this, GME is at 180. You could buy a call and a put like you suggested, at the money, which is called a straddle. If it goes up your call gains value while your put loses value, and if it goes down the opposite happens.

The thing is, options are so expensive on GME right now that you can be right about the direction it moves and still lose money.

As I write this, a 180 call and 180 put, expiring 4/1, are each about $20. That's the price per share, and since the contract is for 100 shares, that means buying this straddle will cost you $4k. That means at expiry, you need it to close below 140 or above 220 just to break even. Granted, you could potentially sell one or the other during the week because the prices for your options will change as the stock price moves. But if you're just wanting to buy a straddle and let it sit without staring at charts all day, you need the stock to move by 22% in either direction, in 3 days, just to break even."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$220 strike price for April 1st is $1100 but you'd make around $1600 with 330% IV and all that if it hits $220. Obviously there's lot of things that affect the price of an option. I use [this website](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/) to mess around with and [this website](https://optionstrat.com/) for more information. Although I got burnt pretty hard on the recent tech sell off lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it just be rdy to flip it if it flies. I had a call that went from even to up 500 to up 1600 and them back down in the blink of an eye on the day GMe went to 350.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You are actually retarded
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll need a lot more than $500 for $220 calls haha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,marry me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to check out the actual option chain. You are saying you’d basically want to bet 5.00 on a 220 contract. They’re going for 10.00+ right now. So you literally could not make that bet right now, probably because almost everyone would if they could lol. I’d honestly recommend buying a few shares, then learning options with less pricey and risky options. You can still decent money off other volatile stocks and their options right now, I just think GME is a brutal learning ground when it’s being so manipulated and swings so much. You would most likely watch it expire at zero. Get shares, you’ll benefit from share price increase, and learn options on other stocks right now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TIL 🙏

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, you don't understand the mechanics of a gamma squeeze do you?  If everyone dumps their wad on far OTM options they don't have to delta hedge, which means no catalyst, which means no MOASS.  Buying Near the money options is a great way to potentially work towards a gamma squeeze, although IV is so high right now it's going to be hard."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t change the fact that it’s only based on want. And it’s happened twice in how many months?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"See how little I know?  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm) I'll have to re-review my taxonomies now, I'll thank you later because I like doing that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But aren’t orangutans part of Homonidae (the great apes) group, which also includes our brothers gorillas and our cousins panins (bonobos and chimpanzees)? Just curious as this is what I was taught at our ape school. Maybe it was apeaganda, but I felt happy knowing that orangutans are my cousins as well."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It went down to 118 and I got shares one day like last week, It is too volatile for calls and such."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't know when it will go up. So you can lose significantly before it does.

And:

&#x200B;

1. You help them out because they can continue to short and take your premiums.
2. If you don't own the stock then you are not screwing them.

It's not that options are bad but are risky. I lost money each time I did it. They would go up and I'd be in significantly but I got greedy and then they went down and never got ITM. Well, I made some money on them a few times but it doesn't seem like it is worth it. They fuck around with them too much. I think when a lot of people buy options and could win major gains the MM and HF's manipulate the stock to keep those options OTM.

&#x200B;

If you don't know much about how they work it is a huge gamble and you are better off just buying the stock and riding it out.

I'd buy an options and then the volatility would drop to nothing and I'd lose. Even when the price went up and there was a lot of volatility the premium never would return. How people are betting on them defies logic. I think people are just trying to gamble them on both sides and it's very chaotic. If you just buy and hold you will probably end up with more money in the long run unless you get really lucky and it's just a lot easier to hold than try to time the options. You can't predict when it is going to spike and so you might hold to maximize profits then they short attack the stock and it's game over. By the time the stock gets back to the same price you've lost all your gains from theta(time decay).

&#x200B;

Now, if you want to buy an option you can, but you should at least have some idea how they work and to realize you are risking 100% of the premium...

If they tank the stock then you could buy some cheap long OTM calls in hopes that it will moon and you'll make a fortune... but it's risky."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares; win!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude. I shouldn't have to explain to you how 47 percent isnt profitable if you bet ANY of the time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividends?? What you on about?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its gambling. House always win. Strategies exist to give the player a slight edge. Roulette is never more than the house but to act like it's a crap shot in the dark is laughable.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Enter with 20 leave with 200 Iv done it way more than I haven't. Maybe I'm just that substantially lucky...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As somebody who spends a lot of time at casinos, you're either full of shit, only been to the casino a few times, or lucky. Either way you are a gambler who makes losing decisions."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"150% I'm a gambling degenerate. Iv been to the casino about 15 times. Slots suck, but roulette and blackjack I win at, roulette more than blackjack. I definitely can't count cards. Maybe it's delusional but my strategy works."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Counting cards doesn't exist anymore. Blackjack and poker in every non-native casino (and most natives) use deck shuffling/swapping tables. The whole reason casino decks get that hole through them is because they've run through a table before. Even the ones that don't use the table shuffler usually have a several deck box on the top that makes counting impossible. 

15 times is most definitely *nowhere near* enough to know that your strategy is working. Unless you just turned old enough to gamble like.. 3 weeks ago, you arent a degenerate yet. Your luck can absolutely hold over a few dozen trips if you've spiked at some point. Start keeping track of wins and losses over time and you'll see the curve fall off. 

I used to spend 60+ hours a week in a casino grinding poker and I can confidently say that if you arent a grinder then you're losing to the house. Only poker is fair and even that has a rake."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's definitely delusional.  I'd bet my house on it. You are a total dingdong.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Total dingdong? Yes. Have won consistently playing my roulette strategy? Yes. I'd happily wager your house.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine being retarded enough to lose money on SPY and SQQQ simultaneously
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll get the paperwork. I think it’s about time you legally change your name to Yuri Tarded.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It wouldn't be so bad if they changed the loss from red to green.  At least it would feel better.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see from the arrow, that your gains are going up. Nice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No $CUM?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I get a copy of the trades your thinking of making, so I can do the complete opposite?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"193 trades to lose 14k, that's a lot of hard work."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spy isn’t a meme stock, it’s actual responsible investing. You are either looking at a small window or just put all your money in recently (or you’re buying options.)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya what happened to FUBO this week?! It tanked. I was up 400% in shares now 20%
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a loss unless you sell.
And the entire market has been shitting the bed"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only 1 on there i would buy and have bought is GME because i like the stock. I wouldn't have chased any of the others at all but thats just me

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The world is right again and wsb is back to normal.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ve got to know when to hodl em, know when to buy em, know when to sell em"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are those stocks you're holding or actual realized losses?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,-800% on a fucking index. Outstanding.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of backwards ass math is it doing to say you suffered greater than 100% losses? Or were you short shares?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,FUUBUU FUCK U BUY US
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the biggest meme of all: the S&P 500
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is that?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job mate. Definitely belongs with us 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you bought SQQQ to inverse your SPY. 🤣 retard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah with SPY hitting a record high, all you had to do was HODL."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,those are rookie numbers
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$SPY the biggest meme of them all
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Steel gang was so long ago it doesn't even make the meme stock list anymore :(
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny Im up 159% on $GME... gotta love the avg down...

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ain't a realized loss if you don't sell! 
💎💎💎😅 👏👏"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This will continue for the next three years. Buy gold & silver!

This is not investment advice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You buy FDs?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me know when you plan on switching strategies so I can do the opposite of that.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,to be fair fubo tv been a hodl for a lil minute
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait you managed to get it wrong in _both_ directions. SQQQ and SPY

Can we have an inverse etf"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you lose more than a 100%
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"SQQQ, you're not a retard after all."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dips not the peaks.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been recieving this advise a lot, shorting a bull market has proven hazardous. 0DTE spy YoLos did not help either"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tf? He's doing exactly the right thing. Buy high sell low.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the opposite here would be a responsible portfolio of blue chips, ETFs, and fixed income. 

That would take years to regain these losses, so clearly the correct answer is to double down by going all in on weekly calls."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"See, that's exactly what *THEY* want you to think."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But then you’d be telling him to short GME which is punishable by death here

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, but if his 0DTE options paid off, you'd think he was a genius eh?

This is like walking up to some dude at a roulette table, and saying ""Ya, ya must not understand roulette, you're losing a lot""

This is such a stupid take. It's about risk management, not about understanding the stock market or being smart. Lots of us just make dumbass bets because high risk/high reward, not because we don't understand what we're doing. It's fuckin gambling."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ape not kill ape!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok. How is your portfolio doing?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about im a savant at losing money....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe its just the sum of percent loss on all trades.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I was inspired by the countless degenerates before me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It does feel like I'm getting a lot of ATM from the market and im not talking in the money....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunatly I paperhanded the GME at 50$ and the Spy Options all expired. Thats realized loss.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What need more loss?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I just looked this up on Urban dictionary and I'm calling the police
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. and the FD's
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, I can't even pullout of my own driveway..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,and HODL till the bottom then paperhands out of boredom because i'm not losing money fast enough
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heck ya! the only way to make back money after losing it to buying options on random tickers, is to buy more random tickers from WSB duh!!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm ready to short it at this point to get back some tendies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you sir, unfortunatly I will not be able to pay my medical bills so, maybe short lived... xD"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My man!! Thats what I'm talking about. I've learned a lot since buying GME at $350 a couple months ago, now im doing theta plays of 3x ETF's. Much progress has been made in a few months. I only learn the hard way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,who is us
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe that is the total negative percent on the trades, so I am averaging about 30% loss per trade on spy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,thats what i was told
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its further down, I only lost a couple hundred bucks on $NOK"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm talking about
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually made money on $PLTR
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,\*SALUTES\* I've been having a blast. just need to refrain from buying 100 at a time
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$BB is close I lost about 500$ there
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It takes a village to raise this idiot. That was you guys!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"usually ATM puts right before I shot up or flat lined. Never selling when I should, lots of N00b mistakes learning. Probably all the n00b mistakes and some new ones."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I only short. Except for Gamestonks.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO Take that rookie numbers!! get yo weighted Loss % up daddy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,One day these puts will print godly #'s
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't short the SPY under any circumstances.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Never sell Yolo options. It's 100% loss or gain nothing inbetween.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine comes only with a double down button
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I can flip the chart around and only look at my winners too. But I needed to bathe in the shame
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well tbh i lost most of that 14k in three trades. I was doing decent before I went full retard.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,\*Yoloing Options
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's inversed to start with biggest losses
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must short it, and then don't sell them when they are up, hold them till they're worth nothing becuase you're stupid and greedy. This is the way."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you i hand picked them from this sub
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubled down, it's only right you should too,"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the yolo effect
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure does feel like it when it jumps 5 points in 1 hour for no reason.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The gayest bear in the woods, how could you tell? xD"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so I got about 30 contracts on $AAL and $CCL that will save me from these L's
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought meme stocks at highs. shorted spy at all the wrong times. I sold my meme stocks low and watched in horor as they came flying back a few weeks later. It's been a rough time for gambling.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember when It went from 400 to 40$?  I didn't know how to sell covered calls at the time.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,WAIT I THOUGHT THAT WAS FUBU TF?!?!?!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had some really poor timing/ lack of understanding on my first few SQQQ calls, should have been shorting it at highs. Now I know"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought high sold low. Bought lots of dips
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Short the living hell out of it and hope JPOWELL turns the printer off.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"But if I decide doing the opposite is the right idea, then it will become the wrong idea again."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Right lmao where my YOLO FD gang at. I came here to fuck and get fucked.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a know when the gangs resurrecting dead stonks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Could not even save me at this point. Only Bill Ackman can.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I aim to exceed expectations
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe that is my total loss% across all trades.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Siri, make this the new national anthem."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lose 30- 100% every time
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once you do the opposite, so too will the market. Speaking from experience."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well there is your problem. Don’t buy weeklies, doesn’t end well 99% of the time. I get it though dude, I used to buy weeklies because I believed in my idea and didn’t want to pay the premium. Thing is though, most of the time my idea was correct, but a week after my options expired. Buy at least 30+ days to expiry. Every day closer to expiry theta increases exponentially."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is this? Looks nice and neat
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,pretty sure everyone has loss porn right now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe Archegos $30 billion margin call will help you today.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Timing
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You gotta sell 0DTE spy options if you wanna make money instead of buying them
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, once you get enough red it turns into upvote gains. Money is for the weak, karma is for the soul."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy low sell lower, thank me later"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason SPY is called the Standard & Poor, because that's how it will leave you if you keep buying puts."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, hell I even use TA some times, but ya do you guys remeber the market for the last few weeks? not been easy to play."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh sorry, im -70%. But it was just a learning / gambling account. so the fact im still afloat at all is promising if you think about it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Strong to quite strong
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my bad but still.  jeeeez
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I applaud you. 

I’m standing side by side with ya on GME, good luck with the rest of your investments partner ⚔️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you'll be in the green shorty
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,God tier
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Neither can I, but you can’t fail if you never try... want a banana bro?

But seriously, shit might suck for now, but I hope you’ll be doing better soon"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually think they have May options at around $4 if you wanted to go that road. $3.25 premium too I think.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Natural selection doing its thing.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">now im doing theta plays of 3x ETF's

Are those the -221% from SQQQs I am looking at, because your confident phrasing made me assume you have learned your lesson and are making money now, but your portfolio says otherwise."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good, I was afraid I was going something wrong"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, there you go"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Smash that double down button until no one will sell you options anymore.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that makes it worse.  Hope you can grind out some wins. I think next week is going to be volatile.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,*showing up to the 5 year olds party with a bag of coke
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I say fuck it and buy spy instead of buying contracts
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"And dont invest to much in the meme stocks, its fun but it can fuvk you real hard, reseach for the long term and it will come back soon, i feel it so best wishes for you man"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah well, live and learn. I just comfortable with it a few weeks ago too. Premiums are still pretty wild."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"hehe, so you fomo'ed both the buy and the sell"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought buying dips was the point lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea but how could it be less than -100%? If I'm doing the math right.. for you to have losses of $14,263 on SPY you would have had to invest only $1847.49099. Does that sound right? That's the only way you could lose 7.7202 times your initial investment."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"try buying shares, gonna be a transformative experience"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How did SQQQ calls not print?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He bought? Dump eet.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to inverse the inverse inception style.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There was much Yolo and very little consideration involved in these trades. I have learned the hard way to hold good stocks and sell covered calls. No more options period unless im scalping day trades or writting them.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud! This is great advice for a fresh wrinkle like me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhh I’m selling this guy his weeklies
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Iris Stock App, come join the fun you can follow my trades and watch me lose money live."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing stops this market from going up 😭
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I wish I had realized this BEFORE I blew the money needed to buy 100 spy shares.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My soul has been healed by the generous WSB community karma ty all. I'd been working hard every day to yolo hard enough to make a place for myself here.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TA is completely useless. It's only pretending to know something you simply don't. The sooner to accept that the better for your balances.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,cheaper than college
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lolllll
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to trade the SPY, use the NOPE and use 2month out options. Most bullish or bearish signals on NOPE are profitable."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That spy is a cruel mistress.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya in hindsight if I had held them I could have made insane amounts off premiums, next time 😂😭"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucked up every way possible!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the math is I lost an average of 30% per trade over 198 trades
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"really poor timing, usually Buying too high or buying before price flat lines and theta decay"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The dustin dafford videos stay on repeat around here!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin Bogged again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls is considerably less risky than buying them, so good on you. Also cool photos of the sky. Thanks for sharing them!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why cant you just donate it to charity then if its so important?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes TA is totally useless, thats why 60% of the market is traded by algos using TA?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"With returns like this, you think I have a chance at college!?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet you keep going back. Makes me think you’re into that sort of thing lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn we should, I'm gonna call up Goldman"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this subreddit? Both. Investing in SPY is very responsible and low risk, but then people say, what if I leverage that 5x and buy OTM options expiring last Friday?

It’s the equivalent of doing coke off that kid’s small plastic table at the family party. If we’re going to pretend that people on this subreddit aren’t doing that, then I’m 100% ready to close my eyes. I’m just saying be an adult and lock the door in the bathroom when you do it."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What brokerage is this? I like the design.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely more than 1000, Don't listen to me though I've only got 20."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go for 1000 when the price is 1000..

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,1k and 999.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say 1001 shares. Sell 1000 when you hit the tendie planet and save one to buy a physical stock certificate of when everything is said and done to immortalize and save as a display piece.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just make sure your broker isn’t giving you synthetic shares. Straight cash trading baby!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Misread the number and thought you had nearly a million shares!

2021-03-29 03:43:24,wallstreetbets,"Suez Newbie DD #2 So, imagine you are the world. The Suez Canal is your asshole. This ship the Ever Given is the 4th largest dildo man kind has ever created.  This dildo is now in your asshole. You’ve been eating lots of tendies recently and you need to take an epic shit.  If you don’t do something about this Empire State Building size dildo in your ass you might have problems.

https://istheshipstillstuck.com

Never mind it’s free!!! Go to edits unless you want some funny 

1. The media story of a gust of wind is a factor but something f'd up big. 

2. Ship was going 13 knots, when usually ships go around 8 knots. Whatever happened, happened quick and hard.

3. Look at the red paint at the bottom of the ship at the bow- that should be underwater. Just think about how much weight just was raised by about a one story house. There are 20,000 of those big containers on the ship. 

4. Let’s talk about tides, for the apes who live in trees.  This planet we live on has “tides”, because it spins commonly called day and night. Tides are caused by the moon. The moon is one out of two really big things we see in the sky. It’s also where rocket ships live. 

Everyday the tide goes up and down, twice to be exact. but if you look day to day, high tides get higher, then peak, then come back down again, just like your bank account. The peak happens on March 31 and again two weeks later.  This peak is also special( but not like you), it’s called a spring tide. The water level will be the highest it will be until April 25th. The 31st is the best chance of getting her off. (That’s what she said)

https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest

5. Potential for an even bigger fuck up is not unthinkable.  To build these huge ships they make them just able the handle rough seas. Since the ship is aground front and back though they are going to need to pull one or both ends out kinda sideways. It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.  

So, you’ve eaten at Taco Bell, you understand.  This is a problem, you are starting to sweat, but it’s not a disaster yet. How do we fix this ass problem: Dig her out, pull her out, or float her.

I think we’ve all seen that poor crane, one bulldozer and 4 dudes trying their best, but something tells me this might not be the answer.  It can help, and what I hope happens is that dredging can help, but I know nothing on the topic.

Some basic maths: let’s say one third of the ship is aground. The Least Fucks Ever Given weighs about 200,000 metric tons.  This is a friction problem.  You need 50% of the weight that is aground to pull her off, that’s around 30,000 tons of force. Another ship, the Far Samson, is the most powerful tug boat in the world and can pull 420(woot woot) tons.   You would need more than 15 of these but there is only one. 

Siapem 3000 to the rescue?  Another way to fix this is to make the ship lighter, they are already doing this, ballast is being removed and fuel is being taken out, but the best way to make her float is to take off the containers.  This is not easy to do, because the ship is so tall. There are only a few crane ships that can off load containers 40 meters up.  One of these the Saipem 3000 is in the Red Sea and in transit. Shout out: u/parsimonyBase

So Saipem 3000, I hope you get the Ever Given so high that you literally save the global economy. 

Cheers to all of those working the problem! Thanks to all the merchant sailors out there, you are our only hope!

P.S. hope you are having a good day!

Edit: so the DD play here is, if it’s not out by the 31st buy gold and oil, and short everything, because if its there for a few weeks, it’s going to be real bad for global trade. Chip shortage, you can’t get a 2021 car right now, metals, vaccines, ppe, etc.  anything that goes between Asia and the EU.  The US won’t feel it at first bc not a lot of our trade goes through Suez but we’ll feel the hit eventually.

Edit 2: if you look at my name I usually go by Nat. One of you kind folks brought to my attention NAT. They ship oil. Are the stars aligning?

Edit 3: THEY MOVED IT 30 YARDS! YAY! Just to be clear I’m kinda rooting for the “they get it out” and we all don’t have a global crisis scenario. So DD might not apply.

Edit 4: Just as I’m going to sleep, I hear that Ever Given has been refloated! The dildo isn’t out yet, but we’re good and lubed.  Fuck that Taco Bell we’re going to have some fun! Tomorrow might be messy but I’m taking this as a good sign. May the tendies flow. Have a good night!

Edit 5: Well if you are still here, thanks, The story so far is this. I(the world) went to sleep last night with a mammoth dildo In my ass.  As I wake up, I find some mysterious hero has jiggled it out as I was sleep.   Whoever you are I want to thank you!

Edit 6: if you know anyone who helped or know how to get in touch with one m, please send this song to them from me! [Whoever You Are, Geggy Tah](https://luakabop.bandcamp.com/track/whoever-you-are) It’s an early 2000’s song. For those of you too young to understand all this butt talk it’s a pretty cool song. For those older, remember when car commercials didn’t suck so bad?

So, this girl was absolutely crazy (more bad than good). She liked it anyway she could take it and we had all kinds of fun. She would even pop it in the pooper no lube and ride it out like there was no tomorrow. 

On a typical day when we were going off to poundtown, she popped it in her poopchute and all was good in the world. She was a hoot'n and a holler'n while I was kicking it back in paradise. Things were going great. Well, as she was bucking around I noticed things started to feel a little soupy up in her rectum. That's when we both kind of stopped and she was like ""oh no 😱"" So, as she stands up, and I slip ol Jimmy out of her, I look down and there was this a big ol glob of shit right there on the hilt. Not talking just a little bit, I'm talking about half a handful of straight scat right there fumigating the entire house with its aroma. She runs off embarrassed, and a ran off to the bathroom to stick ol Jimmy right there under the bathtub faucet.

After we got things cleaned up, and simmered down a little bit, we decided never to do butt stuff after eating taco bell again.

Commodity ETFs that are futures-based have to sell the current month contracts and buy the next months contract in order to avoid having to hold the actual commodity, in essence they're selling low and buying high. So, for the most part, avoid long term holds in commodity ETFs as they will have a steady down trend overall.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I also have PLTR but shares. What is the reason for the April 30 calls? Is there anything I'm not seeing? My average cost is 24$ so I'd be happy with that >20% profit but there's no reason for it to grow 50% in a month...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol someone still believes in pltr
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Only way to play PLTR is to buy and hold. Maybe some sell some 65 CC's to retards like OP along the way.

**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**

Huge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**

**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages

$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure their technology is using bacteria to create molecules / compounds that are otherwise more difficult or expensive to make. Cost effective and environmentally friendly. I have read about using bacteria to create opiates for example (modifying them so the bi-product of fermentation is opiates). This is unrelated to AMRS, but the fact that they have implemented this tech already and at scale is nothing short of incredible. So they can skip the incredibly expensive process of growing / processing poppies to harvest thebaine (used for pharmaceutical opiates) and cut straight to the desired outcome (I am over simplifying a little). They use AI to determine how to make the necessary modifications to get the desired outputs, and are constantly working to discover new ‘recipes’ to do so. This company is so early and already executing on things that were just barely being proven as possible in studies not long ago. Saw someone post about this company in another investing sub a few days ago and after reading more put in all the free capital I had in all of my investment accounts (only about $3000 total as of right now), and have another $4k being transferred to buy more, hopefully by tomorrow or Wednesday. I think the worst case scenario here is the best case scenario for some of my other investments. I haven’t been excited to throw some money at something like I have with this in a while."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 30 shares back on Feb 10 while everyone else was fixated on some other dank stonks. Being able to create some of those compounds from yeast is huge because those plants are very high maintenance. Lots of water and light needed. It's causing environmental issues in states that have legalized. Very bullish.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so... no source on these strategic transaction though?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Since this is was noted in the earnings call don't you think this is priced in?  Price is 10X since decemeber
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape is in. First call option ever. I hope I'm doing this shit right. I bought 1 contract for the April 16 $20 strike for $175. Worst case scenario it does not hit $20 and I lose my $175 right? If it hits $20 I break even? Any gains over $20 are X 100 right? Gotta get my feet wet sometime. Let's go AMRS!! 🤑

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like I’m gonna like this stock.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Trading low... but we maybe missed the bot. It was $6 a share three months ago and now it’s $20 a share
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just off it's ATH... I'll wait for the bounce.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its only up 1k% since november. Sure is underpriced!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,where do we have these numbers from ? $50 and $96
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"nope, can't possibly go tits up...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,it’s a turnaround story. they’d been closing the gap for quite a while until they finally posted a beat last quarter.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair observations. The company didn't really turn around until 3Q 2020 - November of last year was the inflection point. 4Q 2020 earnings were an absolute blowout - look at the market reaction. Earnings call transcripts are very telling, I recommend reading them if you have time. They also don't have much in the way of real equity research coverage, so the quality of the estimates is suspect. More to the point - this isn't a business that can be benchmarked on EPS (yet) - it's still an early stage growth company and earnings predictability is challenging, which the company fully acknowledges. I'd personally pay more attention to revenue and EBITDA estimates through 2021 (I expect the company to be EBITDA positive by YE 2021 and EPS positive by YE 2022, but these are just educated guesses)

On my April calls - been accumulating them over the past two weeks or so, and they've been all over the place which is par for the course with this name. AMRS trades are not well-suited for paperhands - the stock is volatile (typical for an early stage growth company)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it? They're pretty cheap for $20 calls.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How tf u buyin on a sunday
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck me i mean everything is up 1000% percent from its march low
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at my holdings. Yes I believe it has room to run.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,buy 1 or 2 puts as well in case
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the additional color, definitely one of the most informative replies I've seen so far. I'm totally with you on the excitement around being invested in this company. What they are doing is so cool / interesting it just makes being invested so rewarding. Throw in the high volatility profile to boot and potential for huge returns, man is this a fun company to be involved with"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very early if you are looking at a 5 year time horizon..  


I think it is a minimum 5-10x returns in the next 5 years. Great for a long term hold and also great for options/swing trades because of volatility right now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pivoted out of oil
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a good sign.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Company has split many times. As I said in the post, it didn’t turn the corner until last November. Prior to these strategic transactions which give large amounts of cash to the company, AMRS’s only funding mechanism was raising dilutive equity or expensive (and often convertible debt). This is why the deals are so important - with cash coming in the door from their operating business, they are on the path to becoming self-funding instead of constantly going to the equity market and diluting existing investors"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO, any short squeeze is just gravy, this is a deep value play"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,to be fair EVERYTHING is up 700% YoY
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The first one is total bullshit and extremely dated. The company missed earnings in 2018 an ambulance chasing law firm took up a shareholder lawsuit - happens all the time and never goes anywhere.

The second one (Lavaan lawsuit) is real, but only impacts the cannabis business, which is immaterial at this stage. I expect this will be settled out of court for a small fraction of the headline amount - though impossible to say for sure"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think because of the biotech hype at the time of IPO as well as a change in business model from bio fuel towards genetic engineering of molecules for consumer products. The bio fuel never really took off and a lot of people got out. Also, few dillutions along the way. 

Current strategy looks promising though."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Support. This stock moves all over the place, very volatile. AMRS press releases typically come out at 8:00 am - in my opinion, the key is getting in front of that. If they don't report the news in the morning, you might be able to time to market and get the stock at a discount during the trading day"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"On at least three separate occasions (the latest being 3/25), management has confirmed the deals are happening by the end of March. Of course, there is a chance they don't follow through, but obviously I think that is unlikely given the number of reassurances they have provided. It is going to be extremely exciting when the announcements come out, I can't wait to the details and the stock market reaction"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Partially answered in other responses, but quick summary - the share price was never $500 - the company had to do reverse stock splits. Prior to 3Q 2020, this company had incredibly valuable technology but no sustainable business model. Think of it as a science project but without a real business. This is very common for early stage companies, particularly in frontier technology. Developing new technologies is expensive, and there isn't always an immediately obvious business application. Trial and error has led AMRS to where it is today.

When a company doesn't generate sufficient cash flow to cover its operations, the only way to stay alive is raise new money, diluting existing shareholders. The strategic transactions they will announcing this week validate that they've finally found a business model that is sustainable and generates enough cash that they can operate their business without issuing significant dilutive equity. This is so important. Sure, it is possible, even likely that they will raise some new equity going forwards, many companies do this, but management has confirmed that the days of significant dilution are over thanks to the new transactions (as well as the cash generated from their high-margin consumer brand portfolio)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price targets are complete bs for early stage growth companies, anyone who tells you different is not being truthful. My gut says above $50 by YE 2021 and above $30 by the summer but that is hardly scientific. The applications for the tech are endless and it could be worth far more than either of those guesses far more quickly - it is impossible to say

Second question answered in the post - was looking for businesses with similar turnaround profile to $ENPH and came across significant overlap in shareholder base / other investors I talk to. Went down the rabbit hole from there"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"do you think the recent hedge fund wipeout will affect this? on fintel.io it says that like 50% of the float is owned by institutions, and if they are all shittin themselves rn wouldnt that affect it's valuation over the next couple of days as shares are dumped left and right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha thank you, I have been seeing studies / experiments about this type of production (modifying bacteria to produce compounds as bi products of fermentation) and was shocked when I saw this company already executing on this. These are unrelated, but ultimately what  AMRS is doing with cannabis compounds already they can do with almost anything, and for a low cost. Once they develop the bacteria ‘recipies’, all they need is sugarcane - sugar is the main component in fermentation other than the bacteria itself. Here psychedelics are created using a similar process:

Here similar is accomplished with opiates: 

https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10390

Knowing the potential impact this could have checks all the right boxes for me like you had said. I think they are doing the right thing by starting with the low hanging fruit to bring in $. Then they can further develop the more complex stuff that has more capital intensive R&D, but will have fat margins and a lot of applications once they do.  Then they can even just license their process to become more passive as they move on to other areas. That doesn’t even touch on how much more ethical / environmentally friendly it is over current methods, which companies have been sacrificing profit margin over due to a change in consumer trends in the last decade or so."

jeez lmfao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Extremely dated? That article is from about 2 weeks ago and it's not because they missed earnings it's because they incorrectly reported $12 million more in revenue and $7 million less in losses than actually occurred or about a $20 million swing for a company that was barely pulling in $25 million in revenue last year. Also $880 million is VERY material to a company with this kind of revenue
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, thanks! First two are locked access.  But the third seems to refer to what you mentioned."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to claim something is worthless that counters your points, it helps to say why. Seeing that they're mainly using data, can you make an argument on how it's worthless using objective evidence?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can’t say hardly any debt it is 2.1 billion dollars. Direct quote from latest 10k

>The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations over the course of at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of $16.5 million (compared to negative working capital of $87.5 million as of December 31, 2019), and an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion.

The report then goes on and says that they have $56 million due this year and if they fail to pay that there will likely be a chain reaction of defaults resulting in liquidation of the company. Read the 10 k if you don’t believe me. 

Not tryna spread FUD or anything I was just thinking of buying in and did a little DD. Still might buy cuz I like the tech and the fact that they have revenue is big but it’s still risky af. 

But hey it’s wsb so let’s hammer OTM calls🚀🚀🚀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you looking at? I’m seeing an accumulated deficit of $2,086,692,000 on latest 10-k.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes just enough “hoodlum” to make you seem like you’re not paid to write
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Op why did you delete your comments? Why is your account missing a year worth of history especially during the height of GME?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that's buying high selling higher. This is clearly overvalued."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's an early stage growth company. Losses are extremely common. Look to my other responses for the relevant context

Uber is a fun example - they currently have accumulated losses of **$23,000,000,000.** If you stopped your analysis with negative earnings and share price gains for every growth stage company, you'd have missed out on Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, Uber and thousands of other huge winners

No doubt companies at this stage are speculative, but the the high risk profile is the reason the returns can be so high. You just have to decide if you believe in the business long term"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it is currently 5:30AM and I have already looked up like 5 different potential plays on this stock, haven't even been to the bathroom yet."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Btw whats your take on todays dip? Seems quite harsh. And now that i think about it how are the deals not priced in when we consider the huge runup in the last months
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the response! I've been burned hard bu Biotech before so I'm always a little cautious to jump into the fray. I'll probably pick up some shares when my transfers go through!

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, this DD actually has a bear case (a history of being in shakey financial ground). That already makes it way more credible than half the DD I see on reddit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that affects the entire market including AMRS, but not specifically AMRS. In my experience, usually these hedge fund driven selloffs have a temporary impact on the whole market, which then snap back pretty quickly. There is always a tiny risk of contagion (one fund collapsing brings down another fund, which brings down another, etc) but I view that as pretty remote. Fundamentals in the economy are improving, interest rates have stabilized for now and remain historically low , and I continue to have a bullish outlook on markets while expecting some inevitable volatility"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment of the whole thread
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude it is an old shareholder lawsuit released to financial statements from 2018. How much experience do you have with class action shareholder lawsuits? Anytime there is a reporting mistake or an earnings miss, sleazy firms take up the case and use paid press release to create attention. It is going nowhere.

As I said, the Lavvan lawsuit is real, but it’s claims are specific to cannabis, which so far has generated almost zero revenue for AMRS. The chances of AMRS being found liable and paying an $880 million judgement are ZERO. It will likely be settled out of court for a tiny fraction of that amount

Not sure where you are getting your revenue stats - AMRS had product revenues of $173 million in 2020 and the numbers will be massively higher in 2021 - likely closer to $400 million"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad - thought those were open links. They are just links to the earnings call and investor conference transcripts. KoyFin has this feature now - you can track the info down there for free if you want
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude you are clearly retarded. That’s okay. An accumulated deficit is absolutely not debt. You might want to learn the difference because they are nothing alike. It’s an accumulation of prior losses (much of which can be credited against future owed taxes on actual earnings). This is an early stage growth company that has incurred losses as it is in its early years - this is true for almost all growth companies, including Facebook, Uber, Tesla, etc. It takes many years to get to profitability. The point of these strategic transaction is that they are taking a massive step forward to getting there."

Further you are forgetting the short squeeze... 🤷🏻‍♂️"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gave you a thoughtful response, but it seems that you are too retarded for your own good. I now regret wasting my time

I haven't sold a fucking share. The stock is volatile and regularly swings +/- 8% in a trading session

Before you go patting yourself on the back for spotting the ""dump"", maybe you should spend 8 seconds looking at the AMRS's trading history and you'd see that is regular price action. Volatility is the price of a shot at high returns

You might also question whether or not me selling my whole 1,000 shares (when AMRS has a float of over 239,000,000) would actually move the market...for fuck's sake"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wish I did, but I did not. Calls I bought were maybe 6-9 months out, mostly after stupid short reports caused the share price to drop. Bought LEAPs on AMRS and will continue to do so when the 2024s get listed in September"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dissect the filings and see how much of that earnings came from non-cash charges. More to the point - this is an EARLY STAGE GROWTH COMPANY. If earnings are a requirement, this is obviously not the name for you..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The latter my ape friend. It’s just a running total amount of historical losses. It never has to be repaid. Only debt on the balance sheet has to be repaid (unless it’s convertible debt which could be turned into equity). The company is trying to get below $100 million of debt by the 2nd quarter I believe which is totally healthy IMO. No doubt this is a high risk / high reward stock that is crazy volatile, but not because of the balance sheet at the moment. It ain’t for everyone, but this is WSB"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another complete retard. It’s okay. This company has never traded “much higher in the past”. Prior to these deals being announced, their business didn’t generate enough earnings to fund their operations, so they had to raise dilutive equity to continue running the business. The technology had not aligned with a sustainable business model yet. This is extremely common with early stage growth companies. The reason the share price looks higher previously is because of reverse share splits - at no point was the stock at $500. 

This company has gone through several iterations of its model before finally finding what I believe is a genius solution - developing high-margin, high-growth consumer brands to create cash flow in the intermediate term while scaling up industrial production and developing new ingredients which are monetizing is large, bulky strategic transactions such as those that will be announced this week. 

Extremely blatantly sus? If you’re going to throw shade, at least show some basic understanding of the facts you fucking smooth brained ape"

Only this time, John Chen is working very closely with Andy Jassy CEO of Amazon who happened to be a huge Blackberry fan. Blackberry today launched advertising campaign in the Sundy New York Times. Why would Blackberry launch an ad on Sunday only to badly miss earnings two days later on Tuesday. I strongly believe that BB turnaround is complete. The turnaround story is about to become a remarkable growth and a big comeback story. Blackberry is an innovation Icon.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,earnings? I'm a long term BB bull myself but what earnings are we expecting right now? AFAIK this one is about the future
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I need this my avg on this is like at $18.08 😢
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I could taste black berry in my mouth looking that this pic
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope the conference call elaborates on the new partnerships, and how they will $$BANK$$ off them!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about this, but I moved some cash at BB this morning and at this time I am down $1500. One of those bad decisions. Too many lately."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 200 shares looking for any sort of salvation lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought 524@$9.45.....immediate drop after that.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still stand by many statements that BB is trash.

Also funny how there is such a huge split in here regarding earnings.

When earnings is upcoming many people are excited.

After earnings there is a lot of silence...and if you mention the earnings, people will say ""that is backwards looking...earnings means nothing reeeeee!""

EDIT: ahh,the classic ""im emotional about X stock, time to downvote a naysayer""

You guys haven't even given good reasons for liking BB. Just had the one idiot with his nonsensical statement that contradicted itself."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll only buy bb again if it goes to 6$ they have a shit load of work to do still.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding a lot of shares @ $11ish. Didn’t sell when it reached $20.
I would sell my BB once I make some profit. I rather put it in MSFT stock. Almost guaranteed profit if you buy at support level and sell close to the top."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at around 7$, sold them at ~20 to get more GME lol"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you for your sacrifice
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope this is true. I’m down 60% I blame myself for the initial drop
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damnit I sold my 200+ last week too. We really should have called each other. Can't both wear stripped shirts on Monday.

Speaking of countries there are 7 governments from the G7 and 18 from the G20 that are backed by Blackberry. This is the level of security everybody wants. BB's QNX powers 175 million cars today, from 14 automakers Audi, BMW,  Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota and Volkswagen. Now with Amazon we are talking about a future with innovation, not only for its electric cars (Rivian) but for Amazon's Prime Air delivery services. BB's intelligent vehicle data platform (IVY) will be integrated in every drone Amazon is gonna use in its delivery service. Not to mention the United States Air Force is already into Blackberry's Unified Endpoint Management and Security since September 2020. I'm talking about military and civilian applications with a great projection for massive revenues. I'm very confident BB is gonna hit big time this year and incoming years."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are in execution phase. Product suite is ironed out and enterprise cross platform ready.

They are doing Go-To-Market now meaning they spend on awareness and go in heavy on sales for revenue growth in the enterprise security market. They will take some of crowdstrikes cake in the process. EV/IVY is the future, enterprise security is the play for this year.

They are directly calling out Crowdstrike, marketing heavily & hiring in all areas. Not the sign of weak earnings or outlook"

People like to say variations of this, but BB was sitting at mid 8 dollars before the Q3 earnings bent it over. With the new developments since then, mid 9 dollars seems to be in the same spot it was before and not priced in. This is also not even considering that we tanked from 12.5 in mid March to now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many bag holders from when it hit $20+ aren’t going to realize that the shares are [still] already up 50% in 2021

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not worried about it with Blackberry. Future looks very bright.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not about the earnings, it’s the forecast moving forward. The rebranding and the NYT ad are good signs.

I’m holding through regardless."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to BB
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What’s your bear argument? Also, we’re looking at the forecast and details regarding IVY more than earnings. It will tank if there aren’t positive details given.

The rebranding and NYT ad give me a bullish outlook. They aren’t basing their future on Cylance sales. I’m expecting something, and I’m young enough to recover if I’m wrong."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol earnings usually mean less than the outlook. Missing earnings hurts a little but can always be saved with a good outlook and talking about revenue streams and such in the pipeline. BB is not a trash company. The stock price has been frustrating since the great trading halt on 1/27. GameStop for example, is a garbage company with no competitive advantages and an outdated business model like Blockbuster, buuut that doesn’t matter at the casino apparently."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we name this guy ""clueless""?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What did I read?

In addition non-gaap is happens a lot in tech, Crowdstrike even used non-gaap earnings. I'm not worried at all. If BB is guaranteed to tank after earnings as a prophecy, it would eventually get priced in and I think we're at that point."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You can “average down” on stocks you think will actually go up.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Same reason the morons held at $20 a share instead of realizing they bought the peak.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Similar, was in at $20, bought a lot more at $13 and $14, more at $9 the other week and 100 more back on Friday’s dip. Average cost is under $16 which is fine. I think if you didn’t average down yet, tomorrow morning might be the last chance (hopefully) because earnings and outlook will hopefully be pretty juicy. Good luck fellas, see you on the other side!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yea idk why I thought you could do it directly to the Roth. I’m just learning this cut me some slack lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He obviously doesn’t like the stock

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, they're likely to report another lose this quarter so I could see the stock price fall some more. Good opportunity to average down though"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a slightly more retarded version of me.

... dad?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Currently avg at $12.70.  If it goes up I'll sell half, if it drops I buy x2

Best to hold long term in TFSA

After they will stop using non-GAAP numbers, they won't beat expectations as easily so I'd say expect some drops.  Average down, people!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? Great news makes the stock fall. Bad news will make it moon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope in an interview John Chen already let loose that they are up on earnings
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you selling weekly calls on your PLTR shares? It’s the only way I’ve stopped the bleeding...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wondered about that and took a really quick, informal tally of their record at beating the estimate and arrived at something like 24-5-2 since 2013ish.
Meant to look how that translated to price movement, but got bored with the idea and came here instead.
Imma just gonna go with your take."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't do that. I'll fudge up and be broke in a week.

Also need to change plattform. 
Been doing my best not to tempt myself... how much of the loss are you able to recoup with calls? Asking for a friend"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"About $50 a week/$200 a month per contract for OTM calls as the price has steadily shit the bed since February.

Nice thing about it is I still own the stock and I still actually believe in its long-term value. I was definitely caught up in the hype when I bought it, but my fluffiest comfort pillow is their government contracts. Shit literally can’t go tits up. So I’m holding the stock long and selling the calls short.

Say you own exactly 100 at $28. You spent $2,800. 

You sell a weekly for .50 X 100 ($50)

Contract expires, you win $50. You technically averaged down almost 2 shares of cost in one week. 

Keep winning on the weeklies and it keeps lowering your cost basis."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Need to change plattform or cough up $100 a month for access to these types of options (it's borderline criminal!), but even if i do cough dough this is still too profitable not to do. 

You sir or madam, have just chamged a mans life. I'll see you in the dumpster when indeed it goes tits up! 

(For europeans who take pity on me, i'm open for suggestions on brokers)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> $100 a month

You gotta cough up a $100/month premium just to trade options? Jesus. Here in Amerikee Robinhood just gives you a margin account and 12 feet of rope with which to hang yourself when you go in the red $100,000."

[https://www.boxofficepro.com/weekend-box-office-nobody-godzilla-vs-kong/](https://www.boxofficepro.com/weekend-box-office-nobody-godzilla-vs-kong/)

With the rollout of vaccines continuing at a robust pace across the U.S.  and more and more theaters opening their doors to the public, this  weekend was one of the most robust of the pandemic to date. But perhaps the real story of the weekend happened overseas, where  ""Godzilla vs. Kong""  exploded onto the scene with a  terrific $121.8 million debut BEFORE  North America release this Wednesday night 3/31

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Early July will hopefully send cnk up with top gun and black widow
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Da fuq? This is top level delusion. I am more interested in the numbers from HBO Max considering that those are the lost potential customers moving forward as innovation takes over a dying industry.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean the bonuses in their own stock? The class B shares that can't be traded? I love how this ""millions in bonuses"" keep coming up based on a Motley Fool article, lol. Aron actually received a liquid bonus 2/3rds of what he received in 2019, the rest was $15 million in his own stock, which was valued at the time of issuance, the value of that stock fluctuates based on what it is at market. 

&#x200B;

$GME was struggling just as bad during the pandemic and they didn't have to close business. They still had to end up closing almost 700 stores. Look at the $GME price last year, and then look again at the price of $AMC this year.  Here, I'll even link it for you. Look at March 2020.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The day/date offerings of Warner Bros will be just a 2021 (and maybe not the whole Year) experience. When more studio offerings of blockbusters hold their date rather than be deferred, the demand for screens will return the balance of negotiating exhibition terms back from studios to where the exclusivity window of 30-45 days will return. If you want to see a film before everyone else is a spoiler on the internet you will need to go enjoy the shared immersive experience in front of the big screen with big sound."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn! AMC A-list member???
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the quote from the movie ""we need kong, the world needs him"" but yeah movie theatres aren't going anywhere. They give an experience you just can't get watching from home."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They've got money on AMC tanking + AMC workers rising the number of weekly jobless claims... they lost :)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Heggies don’t need to as AMC can never repay their debt. The company is insolvent now with 13B in long term debt and 3 billion in negative shareholder equity.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you missed the part where it says over $120m overseas

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My lungs got chewed up pretty badly when I was in the Army, COVID would be a death sentence for me, so I've been trapped in the house for the last year.  Once I hit immunity in two weeks I can go out and do stuff again.  Lot of people are getting shots right now.  It's going to be wild once everyone gets immunity and things fully reopen.

It's not in the news yet, but crime is already spiking - source, old army buddies that are senior level cops now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Prob wants to not risk getting covid....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They paid off the short term debt that was about to bankrupt them. They still hold significantly more debt than assets. Book value is negative
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No they took out a loan shark loan of like 200m at 10% interest (lol) and then issued a bunch of stock to make up the difference. Will last them through the end of the year IF business goes back to pre-covid levels soon. But will be years before they can repay and get ahead.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some AMC puts but really long term 1/2022 lol. I expect the bottom to fall out for them later this year when they can't make their debt payments and have to issue more shares. So make your money and get out by then! :)
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The management share sales tell us something about their internal view of the companies long term prospects, IMHO. 

No doubt GME had a huge run up. $5 was too cheap given their relatively healthy balance sheet. $200 is way too expensive. Fundamentals put it around $30-40 most likely. It's on a sustainable path to survival even with no dramatic changes. 

Meanwhile the same can't be said about AMC. If you like the stock hold the stock but according to my DD it's a slowly sinking ship. Make your money and jump off before it goes under."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,People didn't believe in netflix and thought video conferencing wouldn't take off either and here we are regardless of the stocks you hold so...

Also free refills on large popcorn which I haven’t utilized yet but I will soon haha. I just already made a lot of profit on calls I got back in November and sold after the first squeeze in January so I’m spending profits at the theater to help the stock :)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't know why you're being down voted... They literally put out a vote whether to dilute stock or not. They are bleeding and need a cash infusion.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope $350 for endgame was the domestic number, so the relevant comp"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad you’ll be able to get out and about. Semper 🤙... be safe out there, momentum is not on law abiding citizens’ side currently."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The short interest on AMC is also >100% based on recent FINRA dark pool revelations. It has a much higher float than GME but if people hold like they have been it will have a NASTY squeeze. Screw you and your puts. Stop spreading FUD. You're obviously biased and want it to fail. Prepandemic pricing is irrelevant. There is a lot of pent up demand and going to the movies is America's #2 pastime after eating out.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any sales by insiders had to be initiated months ago. You cannot just actively sell of positions in the ownership stake, you have to file with the SEC. So these sell offs would most likely have been initiated prior to retail involvement in January. What else was still on the table in January? The bankruptcy talks. It is natural that some only saw doom.

&#x200B;

Additionally, once an insider trade is initiated, they cannot be cancelled. Well, they can, but the SEC then audits for insider info.

&#x200B;

I think the issue currently is people want investors to ignore fundamentals when looking at $GME, but get a magnifying glass when looking at them for $AMC. Where $GME is now has absolutely nothing to do with fundamentals, they have to date closed over 700 locations, had a terrible earnings report, etc... The kicker is, Gamestop wasn't greatly affected by the pandemic, meaning few stores were closed for business during, foot traffic was still allowed. $AMC on the other hand was incredibly affected by the pandemic, the doors were mostly not open, and sitting for 2 hours worrying about a virus doesn't seem like a fun time."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets," Not a question of belief.  it’s the Studio theatrical Eco system that involves an exclusivity window at the exhibition box office stage in order for the studios to recoup the bulk of, if not more than, the substantial production cost and promotion of a blockbuster. With theaters closed or capacity constrained, day & date release is an aberration of this window that is temporary.  Studio IP too costly and valuable to immediately make it pirate bait by going direct to streaming."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! Some good movies coming this summer, enjoy!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> The short interest on AMC is also >100%

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$AMZN may buy a chain but I don't think it will be $AMC nor ought it be. More likely smaller one that provides Academy Award qualification (in a non-covid year) screenings in NY City and LA and SF area markets and that's all.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not saying you're entirely wrong on GME's valuation. Only that AMC is a much greater risk. This article more or less sums up my read of the situation.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no source other than ortex saying it was 80% all month and citadel trading 2 billion shares over the same period. Fintel data is complete bs that doesn't report dark pools. Ortex I'm not sure but doubt it takes into account dark pool data.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, the Motley Fool is garbage, I appreciate the effort and I'm not entirely shrugging off the findings, but Motley Fool is wrong more than it is right and has cost more people more money than the hedge funds. They will write up anything for clicks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt about that. That specific article just highlighted what I was already thinking on AMC and their recent debt situation. If companies are taking on debt at 10%+ it usually means banks deem it fairly high risk. 

Anyway we can agree to disagree on AMC's long term prospects."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely! I also appreciate the pleasant debate, there isn't a lot of that going around these days.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which broker app is this
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the pure confirmation bias and it's going to ruin people! The initial squeeze caught the institutions off guard, but that hasn't happened since and has only had increasingly smaller gamma squeezes as retail investors wise up to these BS Qmeme stocks that have burned so many emotional investors by talking about going to the moon and lambos. 

AMC has been diluted multiple times since the pandemic to just keep them out of bankruptcy with the fundamental share price in the low single digits with some analysis calling it a PENNY STOCK!! On top of that, it is about to be DILUTED AGAIN to the tune of 500,000,000 shares! A company doesn't just vote on increasing their shares by 100% unless they are in a truly dire situation.

This stock was tanking all last week and was below $9 a share because it's a trash stock thats share price will be cut in half when they dilute it. The only reason it popped up at all and the only reason anyone is talking about it now is because it had a dead cat bounce that didn't even take it as high as the previous peak, let alone the first! AMC will continue to drill until dilution and then and only then will it truly have a chance to rebound, but this is a long term play. Think 5+ years and that is assuming it doesn't go belly up. 

Stay the fuck away from this stock if you like your money and this is coming from someone who made money off the first two peaks as I was holding calls. This is not the same entry as before. This is not a younger GME. GME can pivot and has strong fundamentals. AMC is dumpster fire and bag holders are trying to take you down with them because they missed their exits."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't give much to either of them. Games have gone digital. People like to stay home and stream. I would say there is more interest in going to the movies than in going to gamestop to buy anything physical, at least where I live. I haven't bought anything in gamestop in at least 15 years because why? I can download it online or through steam or something. Nothing against gamestop. It's just the way things are."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC has the exact same chart as GME. AMC's option premiums are a fraction of GME's. Why pay more?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,how much would the squeeze get to?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't short AMC when management just keeps doing more offerings lol.   But the reopenings is a catalyst.  Think it's priced in already don't you think?  It's higher than pre pandemic with a shit ton more shares. No underlying changes to the business model.  Probably worse news with studios giving less time before they move movies to streaming platforms.  Disney having Blaxkwidow and others straight to Disney+.  I'm not understanding the upwards movement in the prices, you apes are doing great pushing prices up though bravo hah."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really like the stock as well, I'm buying because even if they had to close theaters, there is no way their stock is worth less than $20. Every position of mine that goes green, I sell and buy AMC."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,did u actually get any good shares or were they fractional
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"-	Gas or public transportation
-	Concession
-	Probably eat out before or after

That above is probably your typical movie night for an individual. You can sit here and bullshit and pretend like it wasn't pre covid, but i've lived long enough to see all kinds of people repeat the same pattern.  Go out to eat, see a movie.

Disney or Amazon charging you 30 FOR AN ENTIRE ROOM OF PEOPLE is not bad.  It's not. Maybe for a single person, sure.  But you're not the demographic.  And you never were.  Otherwise the price would be lower.  Call some friends (hopefully vaccinated) or family and wear masks, split the cost.

Also you can watch the movie multiple time if you want.  How many of you Marvel-goers see the movie multiple times??"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price history is a bad indicator when you consider two things. 

1. Pre covid the price was falling for the last 5 years.

2. During covid not a lot has changed. The most they've done so far is escape bankruptcy.  Also they're voting to dilute the shares which is a bad sign for retail investors short term. 

I'm on the long amc train but the stock is currently overvalued at 10$. Especially with the news they're going to vote to dilute the shares. Spoiler alert. They will most likely dilute the shares because it will create capital to help them out with their bankruptcy and revenue issues. Which means even if they open up theaters in full swing (they probably won't this year) they'll be losing money. 

Keep in mind they already diluted the stock once. If you dont know what that means it means the share price will drop. Doesn't mean it can't go back up. It just means if they do vote to dilute the share price will drop. 

Amc stock isn't worth that much right now and will drop its only a matter of when. After it drops im scooping up as many shares as I can and hoping they get their shit together. 

Overall if you have been paying close attention to the company and CEO overall without emotional sentiment. None of it is good news."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's because he is bag holding GME at $400. The GME bag holders are easy to spot and for some reason they hate AMC. I distinctly remember all the shit that DFV got when he talked about GameStop. Isn't he up some 35 million dollars now?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short interest could be 1,000,000,00%, but if FINRA and the SEC do not hold the institutions accountable on the FTDs then it doesn't matter!! They just proved they aren't going to hold their asses to the fire as they slapped them with a pathetic slap on the wrist fine. It's business as usual and retail will continue to get bent over while shouting ""hold"" as the price continues to tank."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes amc isn’t doing anything to help a short squeeze that’s for sure, I think the window for it to ‘moon’ is very short and it’s now, I’m just not sure what a realistic price target to get out is."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is DD where i read a bunch of confirmation bias hype posts written by bros with an emoji keyboard?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you talking about the share holder meeting to grant the ABILITY to issue 500m more shares? I highly doubt it'll get passed and if it does they won't issue the entire thing, if any, shares. Unless papa Aron knows it's more than 200% shorted and wants to get extra tendies for the company itself.. but I highly doubt any of all that will happen. It's FUD at this point. Only time will tell though. The squeeze will be glorious on both sides and I'm hoping banks margin call these HF's next month due to leveraging laws reverting back to normal."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We know they're negligent but at this point it's a slow bleed for HF's. At some point they run out of money or get margin called to buy their shares back, literally a bank getting tired of this just has to raise margin requirements or if a singular HF wants to survive and covers it's positions it'll force all the others to cover too. It's a big game of musical chairs for HF's as they attempt to stay solvent together. We can be retarded longer than they can stay solvent. Stay the course. Buy and hold :)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's it retard...there can't possibly be anyone here knowing anything about the market besides you..what an absolute cuck you are..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No we aren’t we’re talking about the amount of available shares TODAY being too high.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyway,  that meeting isn't until may 4"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, it's funny that you think your 7 votes matter compared to the institutions and you better pray they pass and are able to dilute the stock because otherwise they are going to fold. No company tells the public they want to issue %100 more stock when they are doing great. THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE DUMPSTER FIRE! 

Best case scenario: they dilute the shares and the price tanks to fundamental levels (1 or 2$) and they use that money to pay down some debt as people slowly return to theaters.

Worst case scenario: dilution doesn't pass and the company slowly goes into bankruptcy because they are over their heads in debt as people slowly return to theaters."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is stupid, most of these places if short at this point have a hedge.

No ones getting margin called, you’re not living in reality."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean literally anything could happen right? But is “all of these very unlikely things could happen” which would cause a short squeeze really enough to think it’ll happen?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hhahahaahahahah good one
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a fucking slush fund. There is such a ridiculous number of shares. $14 was the moon. It might run again, I won’t say it’s over; but this company has Barely been able to stay away from bankruptcy even when covid wasn’t a thing. To me there is no turn around story and it’s a hopeless attempt at a squeeze. I wish the best for anyone on amc train, but if it runs (even to $14) than by god man take the profits and run"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're way past the point of having any meaningful debt left / bankruptcy being on the table. They raised SIGNIFICANT funds during covid and then went onto making a healthy amount of money off the first mini squeeze in January. AMC theatres are 98% open as of now and are regularly selling out. The company regularly posts profits (when open) however of course had a bad year during covid when it was completely shut down. The company has been shorted for years and now it's finally time to reverse this. Sentiment is at an ALL TIME HIGH. Btw I voted yes for the ability to issue more shares as I believe papa aron may be holding onto that as a means for a future acquisition if the opportunity arises. Everything is bullish on AMC, its safe, and more importantly has great fundamentals. It's a deep F'ing value stonk. I've never had more conviction or pride in owning the stock. I just like it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I hope you're right but I think it's more wishful thinking than DD. Checkout the short interest in both. Those HD just can't quit shorting GME. They've been caught 2x already and they are setting up for a 3rd dip. Meanwhile AMC is really going nowhere in comparison. Hold AMC if you think it's got a bright future but don't expect a squeeze.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in at 13.33 and I could have gotten out the other day but I have a notorious problem pulling out😂

The problem with the amc holders is they’re all brand new in the market, you can’t even get a price target from them or any dd besides dumb shit like HODL.

I’m hoping maybe something happens and amc hits something outrageous like $25."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For real. I bought in around 9 and dumped at 14, and I'm happy with that decision. Still hanging on to GME from 202 though... maybe I'll see a return on that, but I'm gonna keep holding if it doesn't moon 😆"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with this outlook. Bought at $8, sold at $13. The only CaUsE I care about is making money. Some amateur finance YouTubers have people whipped up into a frenzy over AMC with very little DD to show for it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"SO BuLliSh besides:

Besides some of the people in this echo chamber, retail has showed it is over these plays. Sure, they have their own threads now, but everytime they are mentioned in the discussion threads they are downvoted to hell because nobody care/ they already got burned an know better. 

The largest investor group in AMC made the decision to lose money by limiting their exposure to their own company.

The shares have been so heavily diluted since Covid that even if demand returns, which it hasn't because most states are still only allowing partial reopening, the price will be a fraction of what it was pre-covid.

People have changed their expectations about what a new movie experience is. I'm not saying people aren't going to ever go back, but it has opened the door to different options that weren't on the table before, which reduces demand. 

New dilution will undoubtedly drop the share price because that is how it works. 

Look at Europe, there is a 3rd/ 4th wave of Covid. Not saying it will happen here, but it's obviously still on the table."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha damn homie, throwing all AMC holders into the same bucket? I’ve been investing a long time and I love the stock. Also sounds like you need to do you own DD on AMC because AMC is as promising a squeeze candidate as GME. IN FACT, some people think GME already squoze (I don’t, GME to the moon! But for sake of example...) I have shares of both stocks. 

Remember, we’re all on the same team. Hedgies want division. GME and AMC holders need to support each other. Even if you prefer one stock over the other."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s all they have to do tho is hold nothing else
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at problem pulling out.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,just on your Europe point. the only reason america hasn't had a 3/4 wave is because your cases development looks like 1 big wave that only since vaccinating has started to decline.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So teach me with your infinite wisdom how amc holders are going to HODL 400 million shares give or take? You already know that it’s being day traded like crazy, you already know people are losing interest and selling for losses you know there’s hundreds of millions of more shares than GME for example, I think we can see the proof because when GME was on a rocket to $480 and AMC was as popular a stock as its ever been it tickled $20’s balls for a second.

All I can seem to get is something like this

1. BUY YOUR SHARE
2.????????????????
3. Moon

So please teach me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll make it simple, there are too many shares to really control something like that, the stock is so diluted it makes it not hard but impossible.

Doesn’t matter the short interest, doesn’t matter if you hold all the way to zero, too many hands in the cookie jar."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are really fixed in the number of shares bud.

Go do you own DD, there is a lot of solid DD on AMC all over Reddit. We all know that WSB has turned against AMC since late January, so you’re not seeing any good DD in here.

You seem like your mind is set. I support GME and have GME shares, but I think you need to do more DD before simply talking about the number of shares as your one and only factor lol.

Also, beware of confirmation bias. For example, I see people all over WSB constantly saying that GME has better future business prospects than AMC. I don’t see how this could ever be possible. Hollywood isn’t going anywhere, but video games are definitely are.... Just saying, these are poor arguments in a vacuum.

There is more to a squeeze than shares alone."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That argument is so stupid, if you hold 5 shares of GME and I hold 50 shares of AMC at the same price, what's the difference?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We control 80% of the stock we are hitting 1k easily
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then tell me why are they keeping the stock from going up ? I have gme also im not just in amc
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look it’s alright, the only dd that you have to educate me with is hopium, that’s not a good sign.

The amount of shares is literally the biggest reason it won’t pop off, it’s the most important aspect, you cannot have that many shares controlled and the price  and movement reflects that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your one share of gme could potentially be worth thousands of times more what your amc shares would be worth during gmes short squeeze and amc won’t squeeze because of the factors I mentioned previously.

Your example for why it’s stupid is based on factors that are random, everyone’s portfolio is different."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this a known factor?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It says institutions hold close to 40 percent of the stock.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me put it to you like this, you ever hear about the first Superman comic? There’s like 5 in existence today and when they get traded they cost millions of dollars, the value is in its rarity. 

The death of Superman was a hyped event during the comic collector phase that was marketed as a collectible, everyone has one and almost 30 years later its actually worth less than the cover price it was in 1993, you could pay less for this collectible today then when you bought it brand new because there are so many.

So you own your share of AMC share which is 1/10 pretty valuable right? Well the ceo says fuck you I’ll make 90 more now it’s 1/100 then he says ok I’ll make 50 million now because he doesn’t care if the company has 1 stock worth 100 each or 100 worth a dollar each, it’s all the same to him.

As far as ‘they’ everyone is they, the millions of day traders, the people selling for losses and so on.

That’s just the tip of the iceberg, you’ve probably seen the dd from both communities does the Amc community really have any dd past it’s gonna moon to $1000 a share guys trust me?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha okay brother, I hope you do well in your investing, when AMC moons you’re gonna be sad you didn’t do better DD. Start supporting fellow apes more, you seem like a hater."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're just as bad as what you're calling out here. You have provided no analysis on why you think $GME is ""potentially"" going to rocket, but expect $AMC investors to wrap it all up with a little bow for you. The big question is how much of either DD do you truly understand? You can see graphs and examples all day but it won't matter if you don't understand them. If you want confirmation bias on your own investments there are posts for that already."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,thats even better because that means theirs even more synthetic shares. outstanding shares - (institutional shares + insider shares) = float. look it up and do the math buddy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,All we can do is wait and see what happens
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t mean to be disrespectful honestly, it’s your money and you blow it however you want but you’re coming in to defend amc and have literally nothing to back it up. Not a thing, no reason why you think it’ll squeeze, no informed post just ‘it’ll squeeze trust me’ 

When the best argument for a short squeeze is to trust you and if not I’m a hater or hedgefund employee it means amc holders are fucked."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a couple hundred amc scratch off tickets and I think I can read the writing on the wall there, maybe if GME blasts out of earths orbit, maybe if the stars align , maybe as GME is busting through the 100 millions and going towards a billion a share, maybe then AMC will hit $29 a share."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha dude I own GME and AMC. I have done my DD and I feel fantastic, my whole point is that I don’t want to argue and try to convince with you about an AMC squeeze. 

For the record, hedgies want division. You’re playing into exactly what hedgies want."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the issue here is there is plenty. Short interest being the first, yes there are a large number of shares, but retail owns something like 88% and owns more and more every day. Technically ALL DD for $GME or $AMC is hopium, to say otherwise is just cultish hysteria. The reason being is because none of us have experienced an event like this; the closest example is the VW squeeze and even that isn't on the nose. We witness every single day the same trendline between $AMC and $GME, so my question to you would be, what event would occur that would cause the two to become disjoined?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe who knows
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"\> trust me

Stop with this"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right and look I don’t want to even pretend to offer you advice or think you’d want it or take it but the odds are very good it’s not going to squeeze like you think it will. Way too many red flags.

Now there’s two ways to go about it, hold it to ‘the moon’ or hold it to zero, I think our definitions of the moon based on all evidence are going to be very different."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $7 so I’m good either way if doesn’t squeeze I can double my money even tripe if I hits at least $21
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re good, I am not, I may never be able to get out. 

I’m in at 13 and change, I could have gotten out at 14 and change but I thought i might as well stay in and see if it hits $15,$20 it drilled maybe a day later was it?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"you done crying? lmao in at 13 and you crying like this? grow some balls or get out of trading. you should've sold at 14 dummy. too late, now shut up and hodl!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re in amc yeah? What’s a realistic price to get out?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding until $20 and that might take a year or two.  


IF it shoots up to $40 or more? I will be tempted to sell. More than tripling my investment, as meager as it is, will leave me happy, even if it continues on pat $100 (which I doubt many believe will happen.)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The other dude wouldn’t answer because they don’t have any answers.

$20 is a reasonable number, I thought if gme really does moon maybe amc would hit $25 but that’s the absolute limit, I think I’d be perfectly fine getting out at $20"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lestupid. I was busy doing something else or did your majesty need me to be here ready to answer your every post immediately? Grow up. 

20 is more than reasonable. 25 is great. You can pull out (at least your initial investment) and check the playing field from there."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's about what I am thinking.  


Unless AMC did something like switched up to serving local microbreweries in their theaters and worked at adding events, like maybe creating a themed meal/drink experience for certain films? It's kind of hard to see them drastically increasing market share.   


BUT... once the pandemic is lifted, people WILL run back to theaters, because it's simply better than what most people could possibly setup at home."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was your big brained answer?

You’re stupid I’ll just agree with you?

Fuck out of here useless😂"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company was dying before covid, I think there’s a very small window for a turnaround play based on people missing the theater experience and then it’ll continue downward.

The price now is based on short squeeze hype, based on fundamentals it’s work pennies."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Something wrong with my answer? Were you expecting “2008.69!! Moon!!! 10kkkkk I’m not selling!”
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure there are going to be a good deal of strong competitors at the other end of this pandemic.

How's Star Theaters doing? Emagine Entertainment? We know Alamo Drafthouse just filed bankruptcy and is starting to shutdown at least three locations. How many more will join those three before this is over?"
2021-03-29 00:05:58,wallstreetbets,"Let’s Talk About “Market Makers”  

Let’s Talk About “Market Makers”

Getting Straight to the point.

There are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a “Market Maker”.

However each license does not make you a market maker.

There are three different types of license holders:

\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),

\-Floor brokers

\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)

1.) The DMMs, formerly known as “specialists,” act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.

2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.

3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE’s goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.

Example of DMM Role:

On the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.

Each of the counters is a DMM’s post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs’ posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.

Important: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.

Example of DMM Role:

Your clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM’s post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM’s post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer’s representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to “work” the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM’s post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM’s bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 × 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.

For a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM’s post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the “crowd.” In such cases, the DMM’s responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM’s post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How barbaric.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate bursting bubbles but
1) NYSE and Nasdaq are the listing exchanges, your shares can trade at any of a dozen or so ECNs, or even over the counter where it is reported to the TRF.

2) Lots of companies do market making these days.

3) Jack shit happens on the floor, the ECN order books are all the way in New Jersey and Connecticut.

4) CBOE is the one and only exchange in the US that still has a relatively active floor, used for doing weird shit like finding a guy who is willing to buy the 500 leg option your wifes boyfriend wrote."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If I showed up with a suit and tie could I go in there and check it out? Could I execute my own trades?

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intelligent-ticks-make-sense-2020-01-09

It's all about the inverted pyramid in Chart #6.

The market makers try to maintain a wide pyramid with a large bid/ask size (depth) to make money.

The exchanges and market makers want a wide spread, as deep as possible, because that causes stocks to bounce back and forth from bid to ask while they make money on the spread each trade.

They don't want stocks to move, it causes them to run out of depth on one side"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Protected means that whoever accepts that order, has to execute it in a very specific way - there are many rules that lay out the various ways these retail orders are protected.

The most important rule is that a protected order cannot execute at a price worse than the National Best Bid/Offer (NBBO) - i.e. no surprises.

Most of these protections are intended to dumb down the ordering process so retail investors aren't overwhelmed.

Institutions have the ability to perform orders like intermarket sweeps that break these rules.

Retail users are also unprotected by these rules when executing odd lot trades, and a few other types of trades."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever seen a dandelion growing in a split in the sidewalk or in a gutter? Love is a bit like that.

We're for the most part inhabitable, unwantable bits of concrete and metal. We smell and taste bitter, we don't have enough water, and we're *hard*. Proudly so. Impenetrable, really. From the first time we fall walking as a toddler, we learn to defend. Close up. Even the open and brave and extroverted among us do this: default to saying no to danger, to others.

Loving someone is letting someone grow on you anyway. No, not *letting*. For most of us, it happens without our permission or noticing at first. Someone plants an invisible seed with a laugh or a song recommendation or the way their hair moves when they walk, and then their roots find something *under there*, under you. Not much, but enough. And they grow, and you helplessly watch as they grow, and if you are lucky, they grow into an oak tree, and the hard defenses of your concrete buckle and melt like butter, and you don't feel the breaking because you so enjoy the shade.

Oh. SPY 397Cs 4/1. Like a fuckton of contracts."

It is theorized that Archegos was responsible for the short squeeze on Muddywaters/Carson Block in GSX. Now it looks like Muddywaters or his friends have been shorting Archegos levered long positions causing a massive margin call. Blowing up Archegos and creating massive risk for Goldman, Morgan, prime brokers. Also suspect Cathie is being targeted by shorts since Muddywaters announced his synthetic short on ARKK in a podcast. Some think it is also why SPACs and tech have been getting hammered to blow out the levered longs. This. Is. Great."

My dog is going to be fine fortunately, but I'm still up after 2 am on a work night waiting to pick her up from the vet where she's being cleaned up.

edit: to all the replies - thank you. She's a trouper fortunately and walked it off immediately afterwards and would have been happy to just continue on with her day, but we took her in to get her on antibiotics.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares inched higher and the U.S. held near multi-month peaks on Monday as the chance of yet more trillions in U.S. fiscal spending underpinned the outlook for global growth.

Optimism about the U.S. economy helped Wall Street rally late Friday, while by Sunday some 143 million vaccinations had been given to almost 94 million people.

President Joe Biden is expected to put some detail on his infrastructure spending plans on Wednesday, while payrolls on Friday are forecast to rise 630,000 amid chatter it could be a million or more.

""We expect the global economy to expand robustly at 6.4% this year, fuelled by a large U.S. fiscal stimulus, with positive spillovers for the rest of the world,"" said Barclays (LON:BARC) economist Christian Keller.

""Rising inflation over the coming months should be transitory, and core central banks seem committed to looking through it."" …"

When mass liquidations happen they sell the 'safe' shit first as it fetches the highest price. Firesales in those causes liquidity problems.

It’s me, looking down on you from my mountain of commodity calls.  I squint to see you, feeling sad.  I wish you would have listened.  You look like an ant from up here, I think to myself.  A sad, small, smooth brained ant.

Soon the heat from the sun reflecting off of the steel and copper creates a gentle updraft, slowly lifting me into the sky.  First I pass the clouds, then the moon, then I slingshot past the sun straight to andromeda.

-BlackRock inc.

-Dodge & Cox

-Harris Associates LP

-Silchester International Investors LLP

As much as people seem to think hedge funds only short things, I highly suggest everyone review what the holdings of these groups are and start to adjust their portfolios accordingly. I don't know the future, but this seems like an interwoven system of funds betting on each other that can backfire  should these groups start letting go of their positions in fear."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If anyone is wondering why futures are coming back it's because someone was gloating how on Friday they put in 40k in puts when futures were down over 1% earlier. If anyone starts gloating how they bought calls we'll start tanking again.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The market will move to the right
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,SO LET ME EXPLAIN WHY TRADING IS GREAT. MAMA CATHIE JUST RAISED HER 10% CAP TO 20%. The shorts on ARK and Tesla thought she was trapped. It was a good play on the shorts part because they know she cant buy more than 10% of a single company in her funds and she hit that cap on Tesla last month. So lately the shorts have been levering up and piling on Tesla because Cathie was a big problem for them and they thought she was out. Now she can DOUBLE her Tesla positions. If Tesla goes over 900 those shorts are in danger of BIG BOY margin calls. Huge risks if those positions are caught out. Tesla has the largest short on EARTH holding it down. Do the shorts even have that kinda collateral? Never bet against Musk.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Public Service Announcement:

We all think about buying the dip.  Many people here seem to think the dip is a lot higher than it actually COULD BE.  Let me give you some examples:

TSLA:  This stock was 70 dollars Pre-COVID.  The dip isn't necessarily at 600 post-split (3000 dollars pre-split) as the tentative floor is WAY LOWER.

&#x200B;

NIO:  This stock was as low as 2 dollars pre-split.  Even though we havent' seen it at 35 in a long time, just because it went to 70 a share doesn't mean it doesn't have a floor that is a lot lower than the 35 it is at right now.

&#x200B;

PLTR:  THis stock was 9 a share at open for a while.  The floor for PLTR could definitely be less than the 22 it is at now.

&#x200B;

AMZN:  This was 1800 pre-COVID. It is now at 3050.  THe floor for AMZN may be a lot lower than where it is now.

&#x200B;

AAPL:  THis was 300 pre-COVID and pre-split.  IT is now 121 (484) post-split.  THe floor for this is much lower than where it is now.

&#x200B;

NVDA:  This was about 300 pre-COVID and went to 190 during COVID.  It is now at about 510.  It was as high as 610.  With that said the floor is definitely lower than 510.

&#x200B;

MSFT:  This was about 160 pre-COVID.  It went as high as around 240, and is now around 235.  This is a great company with a great future.  It's a tremendous long-term buy, but the dip in this market might be a lot lower.

&#x200B;

BABA:  This was around 180 pre-COVID.  It went as high as approximately 310, and is now around 230.  Between the market and geopolitical climate it's hard to know what the dip is.

&#x200B;

BIDU:  This was around 150 pre-COVID.  It traded as high as 340+, and is now about 205.  

&#x200B;

FB:  This was around 150 pre-cOVID.  It was as high as 300, and is now around 280.

&#x200B;

U:  This was 66 at IPO and went above 150.  IT is now around 95.  

&#x200B;

PLUG:  This was as low as 3 dollars pre-COVID. It went to around 70 and is now trading in the 30s

&#x200B;

Guys, I'm cool with everyone making money.  All of the above stocks are likely buys for the long haul, but I do feel the floor for these stocks could be way lower than what everyone has been thinking based on where this market could go with increasing inflation, bond yields, etc.

&#x200B;

When you are trying to assess the ""floor"" for a stock don't just go by what has happened the last six months.  Look at where these stocks were pre-COVID to have some feel for where the floor may be.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer:  I don't short the market, and I have no puts right now.  I'm actually very bullish on the market in general.  All the money I made this past year has been on the ""bull"" side of the market."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My fellow Americans, tonight we face a grave threat to our peaceful way of life. We have been targeted, our markets infiltrated, by a most disturbing enemy, an evil and hate filled foe which wishes for our complete financial destruction. They are not bound by norms of decency and human rights, rather they are emboldened by our suffering. These radical economic extremists, these bearorists, are without a doubt the single greatest threat to financial liberty the world has ever faced. We must take a firm stance against the evil they represent, pursuant to this I have ordered for the entire might of the American government to be mobilized to confront this threat and secure our markets.

Effective immediately all disciples of the extremist preacher Dr. Micheal Burry are considered enemy combatants. All bearorists are now void of constitutional protections and will be housed in the maximum security detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Cuba.

We will overcome this threat and emerge a shining beacon of financial liberty and unending bull markets, may God bless America 🦅🇺🇸"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Profit taking is healthy. What’s going on with market, at this point in time, is not. It seems kangaroo because it is kangaroo. It’s unpredictable, even more than typical. Very short term technicals can still be reliable and so are longer term trends. But everything in the middle is just unmoored. There is definite downward pressure on tech, and some tech in particular, and it’s better not to fight it or hope that it goes away. It will, in time, but in the short to mid term it’s better to get the hell out of tech and let it correct. All of these non-catalyst catalysts like bond yields, sector rotation, JPOW non-statements of “support” or “non-concern” are only relevant to price action for that day or few days at most. We’re sitting at or near ATHs, but it feels like we’re in a perceptible downtrend. The market, as a whole, is looking for an excuse to sell off. Talk of bubbles bursting, housing imploding, COVID resurgence — anything to validate the need to “correct”. That’s exactly what is going to happen. Everything will correct — growth, boomer, housing, the gourd market. 10-30%. It’s normal and it’s necessary in order for the upward trends to resume and not feel kangarooish. There need not be an elaborate explanation. Benefit from knowing that it is coming and just buy some Gawd Damn puts. You can also sell what you have, even if at a loss, because it will go on sale soon enough and you can buy more of it with money you didn’t lose on the way down. If you hold, then there is no negative to buying longer dated puts on anything. Consider it a smart hedge in times of definite uncertainty. Even if this is entirely wrong and everything skyrockets from here, all you would have given up is a little bit of profit. The insurance that puts (and other vehicles to hedge with) provide is more than worth the opportunity cost of not having made quite as much money if things take off.

I don’t know anything though — and I’m not an ape.

There are other subs now for non-GME folks, and legit hundreds of people had their accounts permabanned when the GME swarm arrived.

Now GME folks are always like ""why is everyone always trash talking the apes? Why is everyone always talking shit about GME?"" This is actually why. You came to a sub and immediately got defensive and started reporting people who have been here for years, and got their accounts perma'd. That tends to piss people off.

If firesales ensue, or if they start to dump MBS CDO's (mortgage securities) and any other insitutions were leveraged based on deposits of those securities, we're staring down the barrel of 2008 again and who's going to be the one to flick the match onto the gasoline.

Right now could be the bottom, for all we know the margin call means they’re forced to buy all the shorts back today and this week is the moon.

Or the bottom could be $40 again in 3 weeks times. 

Nobody knows. Literally nobody here can tell you. You just have to take the plunge and buy on the way down, or on the way up, or right now.

Trying to buy the bottom is like trying to throw a ball through a target while blindfolded and spun around 50 times. Sometimes you get lucky and hit it, but most of the time you don’t.

I will say though, it's been very, very satisfying watching them all lose everything because they are too fucking dumb to ever sell their positions for a profit. I cashed out in the high $360s for a +20,000% return on my calls and and advised that others think about taking profits at the time too (this is what got the mob unleashed on me), and it ended up never again going higher than it was at that time. It certainly takes some of the frustration away every time I look at my bank account with almost a million dollars more in it now, lol.

For me it's the institutional ownership data. Shows that institutions own 120% of the shares. There are more shares than there should be, that brings SI down. Where there's smoke there's fire and I believe there is something going on here. People have been getting hammered in tech stocks, gme is still ripping. Again this is nothing more than a bet, it's a black/red play at the roulette table. Because of the data and the weird anamolies, I feel there is no 0/00.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you threw away decent used camry
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When I deployed to Syria we had a dude in our squad sit down on a bank during a patrol and he literally sat like 3 feet from an IED in the ground 😂 dude shat his pants when he found out. Luckily it was a dud and wouldn’t have gone off anyways

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I made some cash on Tesla puts last week but I’m thinking of diversifying the put-folio
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad for them

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck no I'm not google
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"maybe not ""meet"" so much as growl at from across a large grassy area...  Maybe mark my territory..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i believe they’ll hear it. but you’re right. i’ve been 700 miles away for the last 5 years tho and barely get to see them. i think that factors into these thoughts - especially now that they’re in their 70s. just feels like i’m wasting some of my last opportunities but life is so fucking complicated
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,mic drop
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t anymore I already did
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think im talking about if not gme
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, 30-50% sell off is a crash IMO.  Anything beyond this is just bullshit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao they’ll take the market down before they give up those bonuses
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point being is that it's up, pre-market to be precise."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s a natural pull back from the Friday rip. I think we return to 391 tomorrow, even in my bullish scenario. That being said, I think we bounce off that to 400 this week. Ultimately I still think a drill to $370 is coming though"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I'm going within reasonable range of the speed limit and the other person wants to be an asshole and go way ahead of it just they can get in front of me. Seems like proper treatment to me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares? Buy calls dip shit
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh it’s one of those Sunday nights 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Now what?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Him and I agreed no condoms, though... he prefers bareback and I oblige"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And put on a little makeup?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s almost sociopathic them thinking gme decides the whole market.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve noticed that people here seem to think GME is somehow significant. It’s like one small salmon in an ocean filled with sharks and whales
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just push it..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s solid it’s just so boring seeing them red for weeks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I’m not sure what OP is thinking
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Clever girl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's hope for a misfire
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That bitch going down.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,NYSE is 25 trillion
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't that Ryan Gosling's arc in The Big Short?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know... I’m just telling myself I’m getting in better on this dip, and that’s all.

I know what I’m holding is good stuff and it will recover. 

That’s the key, I think.

Hang in there, Snoo. 💝"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe as an inflationary signal
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't do that bro it's way to messy

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"everyone here is talking about space stocks... little do they know that she’ll be adding drone stocks as well. BA, Lockheed Martin, maybe even UAVS."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Meh Bloomberg wants tendies to stare at the pictures.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,When does thisnone come out?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been waiting my whole life for this.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am going to directly investing in a company she considers a good prospect but my experience with ARKW and her spiritual leanings make me unwilling to invest in another of her plays.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point cathie wood’s investment strategy is between her and god and i will not be dragged into that relationship

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cathie is becoming from Stonk Babe into stonk transvesty donkey witch, according to comments, I believe in her still"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I was all about ARK and idk why but when I found out she was a hardcore bible thumper and that's why she named it ARK etc it put me off. Like smart is smart but thinking these ETFs are your purpose from God is strange af.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't like this lady... everytime she invests in something lately it gets pushed on wsb usually by new accounts with shitty insults when challenged then the stock fails.

If you enjoy getting ass fucked with PLTR then by all means.... place some calls on $ass $fkd... because Cathie likes to peg."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How are y'all commenting on an article that's behind a paywall?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There is already a space related ETF trading under the symbol UFO
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy shares in her etf because she’s a baddie😍😍😍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pay wall article, is there a date for this new fund?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Her irrational conviction for Tesla and the strong correlation with her picks all rising at the same time across industries gives real pause.

She's the kind of person _The Intelligent Investor_ warns about. Many have gone down this path."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She likes to buy high. I’ve seen that here haha. But seems like she’s wide open about her ideas and investment strategies.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a believer in Rocket Labs, I just wish it wasn't still SPAC. Do you think it's time to get in now or wait for the SPAC merger to be finished?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀 Rocket Labs LITERALLY going to the moon for NASA later this year.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like ABL and maybe even Astra better then Rocket Lab.

I don't think ARKX will invest in SPACs until the de-SPAC"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp is better prove me wrong
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait for all these SPACs to finalize so they can meme here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She should include TSLA cuz it actually went to space

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to see a space mining company. There’s got to be some tendies up there
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is doing awesome things, but nothing that can't be emulated. Rocket Lab is going to be a serious competitor to SpaceX within 5 years imo, and they're profitable now, and public."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the beauty of the fund will be all the merger/acquisition possibilities as the space industry keeps growing.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Altho very unlikely IMO, there’s noise that Elon’s Starlink might merger with PSTH."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,SpaceX is a reason many of these companies can now be successful.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also said that Tesla would have a fully autonomous fleet of taxis in NYC that would supplant the yellow cab and Uber by 2022. Then when they were clearly wrong they said it would be 2025. 

She just perpetually moves goalposts, never gets called out on her hilariously incorrect calls, and people hail her as the second coming of Christ when she makes it big off a lucky call.

Plenty of idiots on this very sub have outperformed her strategies with no fanfare - her strategies are pure hype and media love."

I have a large fraction of my portfolio in them, and I'm going to be looking to get in for more if the price is right in the pre-market this morning."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,wait until a few months after the de-SPAC transaction. No rush. There are 15 space-SPACs I know of
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you hesitant to buy a SPAC? I’d prefer to get in now personally and am planning to long term hold.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m gradually averaging in now. Fairly decent valuation for one of only two companies with commercial launches under its belt.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, rocket lab only 🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket Lab has real launches and paying customers. Does Astra?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"/r/investing is all pessimistic about ARKK.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thatd cover SPCE too...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Kratos is only kinda sorta a space company. They don't fly or operate in space
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear Weyland-Yuntai is thinking about a SPAC....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this might become viable as SpaceX lowers launch costs and rare earth metals become harder to acquire. At some point we have to stop digging down and start reaching out
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Lab isn't launching their new rocket model until 2024, assuming no delays. By then, SpaceX will have dozens of flights on Starship which is a generation ahead of rocket lab's next rocket, which will be more similar to Falcon 9. Starship production and reuse will be scaled up and the cost per kilogram will blow away whatever rocket lab can offer. I love Rocket Lab but I think Starship launches will easily be <20 million and they will be cranking out 20-30 rockets per year by 2024, so capacity will be sufficient to absorb market demand. Rideshare will be so cheap on Starship that it will kill demand for most dedicated small sat launchers, so electron will be obsolete, and Rocket Lab's new rocket just won't be competitive in terms of cost for other launches. Even if there are a couple years where SpaceX has constrained capacity and can't meet demand, or runs into serious development problems, and we push out the timeline for full scale Starship production/reuse to 2026, Rocket Lab still gets trounced eventually, it just takes a little longer. 

Everyone else is just too far behind SpaceX to be relevant at this point. I wouldn't have said that 2 years ago, but here we are. There's some interesting Satellite companies coming public via SPAC, but I would stay away from launch providers, especially ones with rich valuations like Rocket Lab."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"as much as the whole pray for god thing is a turn off as long as they do some market fundamentals it will be okay.  

not much different than other companies that only make decisions after The CEO does some mediation or a line of coke after jerking off."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't call it ""**^Ark**"" for nothing."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haven’t you learnt that the facts don’t matter, only what people think?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,buy puts.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Investing in the last few years is detached from reality
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,At buying the top?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am heavy in Stable Road Acquisition Corp, Genesis Park Acquisition Corp, and New Providence. 

I’m mega huge into Rocket Lab: Vector Acquisition Corp. love the idea behind this company and the closest thing I can get to owning spacex. Plus they’re doing a moon mission for nasa later this year. 

I like space and rockets."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Genesis Park has trading volume of like a quarter million shares... makes my mouth water just thinking about it!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, I'm just saying I've also been looking at other SPACs."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, very large portion of my portfolio."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,CZR went from $6 to $106 ath within a year.  I'd buy Rocket labs now before any merger.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,of Doom?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Her ""open source"" math was also so wrong that they made it private until they rejiggered it. 

She made a handful of lucky calls just like plenty before her."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Tsla felt like a long short squeeze. It all happened after that funding securing shit. People say it doesn't matter why it flew but it's not for the reasons Cathy described. Similarly, though I didn't look into it much, I was initially impressed when I heard she was in the coin in 2016 and sold out close to the top. Then I heard she was forced to close out for regulatory reasons. She seems smart but I feel as though she's a better saleswoman. My gut tells me the public style of her focused investments with more or less immediate public disclosure will work really well for her on the upside and turn hard on the downside. The new predictions for tsla seem fairly bonkers. While it's possible she's right it's more of a macro condition thing to bet on imo. I can easily foresee a future where everything she predicts is correct except the SP."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You bought puts on tesla but not her funds rooted in tesla? 🤔

I guess we aren't genius investors after all are we?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool story dildo up ass girl
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true. They just launched an AFRL sounding rocket very recently.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't have an opinion on Starlink?

How hard can it be to understand it? It's capital intensive at first (like everything Musk does) but then it's a money printer."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, building better worlds..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a great space for Rocket Labs...[look at their recent launch agreement with Black Sky](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/rocket-lab-inks-deal-to-launch-five-missions-for-blacksky-constellation/). An outfit like Rocket Labs allows for cheaper, personalized launches for specific needs of one customer. The large launches like SpaceX aren’t as great for smaller customers who are ridesharing if they’re on a specific timeline. 

There’s definitely room for both and there’s a place for both types of missions."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have no idea if there's a real market for Starship. It's fucking awesome, but it's still a big gamble. Even if the market works out for them, and I really really hope it does, I think there's a lot of room still in the medium lift market for Neutron to be a big hit.

If Starship was the guaranteed next right move, I would expect falcon heavy to be more popular, tbh. I still think it's the right move for SpaceX's long term goals even if it turns out to be ahead of its time for the commercial market.

And if Starship pivots to terrestrial point to point, which I think is viable, the timeline gets pushed way back (to put in landing sites), and it's a completely different market anyways."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well said, you hit the main point $/kg"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,NNDM has entered the chat

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buck ya, I'm all about Rocket Lab too! Who are these other SPAC's?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re a qualified investor, you can buy spaceX stocks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's because it just DAed, usually the following days volume will fall by a ton.

Personally prefer Osprey Technology Acquisition and New Providence Acquisition"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like Redwire a lot, good thesis. I know a fair bit about them. The AE guys are good, move fast."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t let the facts get in the way of a good story...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you're right. She's a salesperson and unfortunately she hasn't done a good job conveying that her understanding goes beyond what you would expect of a salesperson.

Her logic is a lot of non sequitors. ""We think valuations will go up because things will become cheaper. We base this theory off of a handful of correlations where this happened. Look at A getting cheaper and B getting a valuation that's more expensive"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because Tesla is going to be what drives the fund down the most. You can get a better return on tesla puts than arkk puts...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Pull it out then little buddy I don’t want you to have to walk funny all day
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"well it's still in beta and not released yet for general use. Musk says lots of things timing wise, that guy lives in his own reality 🤣

is it a money printer? The other company that was trying to do this went out of business (and the assets were purchased by another company IIRC)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I keep a highly diversified portfolio of NNDM and AMC. Those companies would never dilute their shares on us.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen her record n resume, please. She pisses all over most, thats just her level."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where? I am and I’ve searched in the past and couldn’t find a platform that had them available.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Made in Space is under their umbrella and I know one of their engineers; they're a good bet imo.

&#x200B;

I'm loving how low they're staying as I add on to my position."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But if you're gonna buy puts now.... Why wouldn't you before their staple drags the funds down? 🤔
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What other company? Did they have their own rocket launching platform?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao 🤣
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Her resume is that she was a middling analyst for decades, who underperformed by 60% for the first three years of Arks existence, to have a good streak the last two years. 

That sounds like plenty of other fund managers who come and go. She's nothing special."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forge Global. Have to buy in 100k lots. If you reach out to them, sometimes you can get in lower when they do special funding rounds."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They charge hefty fees, but worth it to hold pre-IPO in my opinion."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"idk what you're talking about 



Cathie has been looking like she's off her rocker recently so ARKK puts are in play now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"WebOne, though I got some of the details wrong. Seems like govt UK gave them a cash injection and they are going to be launching sats again but a much smaller sized constellation

&#x200B;

Musk is very hyperbolic on projections for his company. When I watched the neruralink conference a while ago where they were showing the testing progress with pigs he said we would be able to upload ourselves (or memories, can't remember which) to the internet in five years. That would completely upend our society. Don't buy it for a second"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah why you think that is, she went dimond hand like a boss and came out bigly.  
Eat it lol."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of the best in a while.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see spacex on there, but it appears no shares available? Is it just during funding rounds or what?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, Tesla is the foundation of the ARKK fund. If you thought she'd been off her rocker recently and you bought puts on Tesla then you should've bought puts on ARKK as well. 

Now that Tesla has dropped you need them to drop much lower still and for the rest of the funds holdings to not recover at all either. 

How much lower do you think Tesla is gonna go? 🤔"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but whatever he says on Neuralink has no incidence on the reality of Starlink.  


SpaceX has more boosters than they know what to do with so they are launching satellites for their constellation. Not only they get to improve the reusability factor of their rockets (one booster already flew 9 times!), they also get to build a constellation for much cheaper than everyone else (who would need to pay for the launch). There is absolutely no way Starlink faces any competition and the only limit for now is how fast they can make and send the satellites (the rate is increasing and when Starship becomes operational, it's gonna be even faster).  


There is really no risk to Starlink being a money printer once they are done building the constellation. So for now, they are not profitable but in a few years, they will be. They will have a large base of customers paying them 99$ a month while SpaceX has almost nothing to do but upkeep the constellation."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you even understand what's going on, or do you just repeat memes?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think so. I got mine a while back, in Series J. I would send a message saying you’re interested and see what they say. They email me whenever SpaceX does a funding round."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If you thought she'd been off her rocker recently and you bought puts on Tesla then you should've bought puts on ARKK as well.

nope you are completely wrong. the news about her changing the prospectus was only released this weekend.

and a presplit price of ~$750 for tesla sounds  more then generous."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks for the help!"

You should put on **Dreamer’s Wake** by **Rival Consoles**.  It's good, smooth and you can just listen to Untravel next which should help you follow us down the rabbit hole of schitzo speculation

**God Damnit there is so much to talk about today** that it’s hard to know where to begin. Earnings are tommorow 3/29 after market.  I think the usual disclaimer is that this is not financial advice and that you should make your own decisions like a big boy and girl is great place to start.

**Positions** \- 4/16 15$ and 17.5 and 30$ calls.

***Takes a hit of Copium***

**Price is not an indicator of value.** ^((said in the kind of voice that keeps the smoke in.))

Useful is to...***cough*** perhaps recap... ***cough cough***  the last week of price action as being something that was difficult to swallow as shares of GOEV began to approximate the cost of admission to your mom’s discount crotch circus but thank god we didn’t get that low. (By the way the quality of that spectacle really went down during her ""Groupon Phase"".)  The only consolation is that [GOEV accrued the most significant amount of short interest](https://u.teknik.io/KgmjB.png) in a small amount of time that I have ever seen.  If you can stomach the price drop and GOEV does return to the ring we are in a much better tactical position than we ever have been.

**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.

**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**

Micro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered [4 miles away.](https://u.teknik.io/JITxs.PNG)  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other’s FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall… I mean football game.

So we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet’s views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool

But suddenly cn0110 busts in and says “Have you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!”.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.

This continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta boots down the door with a loop stick in one hand, weighted blanket in the other and proceeds to tard wrangle everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of “Vehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time” and “Their electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo’s”.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said “God dammit not again”.

**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a “Sedan” like Canoo car this smells kind of like a “non-compete clause”.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.

Moreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause “""*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.""  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.

**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**

**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**

**TLDR** \- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech to produce customizable Top Hats provided by Divergent 3D whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**

**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**

**P.S** \- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.

**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.

**Edit 1** \- Canoo Has Bantz! they just dropped a video of the truck driving on their Instagram and called it ""Coming in hot"",  Ride Bros where the flames Ride Bros? where's the flames?

2021-03-28 22:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Pitney Bowes may be the beneficiary of USPS's new 10-Year Plan On March 23, 2021, the United States Postal Service unveiled a 10-Year Plan that may have some  incredibly positive implications for Pitney Bowes (PBI):

1. Shift from air to ground transportation: USPS can't do all of it at once and will have to contract out this service. Pitney Bowes has the logistics expertise to help them out. In 2020, Pitney's Presort Services processed a total of 16.7 billion pieces of mail which represents about 10% of all USPS mail volume.
2. Price increases: Pitney's Presort Services can help businesses mitigate the higher prices.
3. Shorter post office hours with some closures: Mailers can use Pitney's Send Pro Online which is the best deal for $5 a month.
4. Addition/Repurposing of processing facilities to meet package demand: With more drop off points available, Pitney can further reduce its transportation costs for ingesting parcels into the postal network.
5. Expansion of seven-day package delivery: Another reason for customers to choose USPS over other carriers which means more business for Pitney's Global Ecommerce."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How is a company with 3.5B annual revenue capped at 1.4B in this market?  Should it be worth like 10x that?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am working on the Helpdesk of this company lmao
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They fired my pops but fuck it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you need inside info hit me up OP. I happen to work for USPS. We made the transition to a ton of ground for parcels last year well before our normal peak season routing change(christmas rush) and we are still routing tons of parcels via ground diversion if it's close enough to meet our service guarantee for shipping times. Pitney bowes has been a close partner to USPS. The transition to more of our parcels going ground makes a tons of sense fiscally. And I can absolutely see pitney bowes picking up some of the capacity of our operational needs.

We are in an absolute financial problem right now due to a lack of capital from the postal accountability and enhancement act pension pre-funding mandate imposed upon us in 2005. It accounts for the vast majority of our operational losses over the past 16 years. They plan on repealing that act I believe which should help a bit. But that being said for the time being we are still bleeding.

I can see a lot of our capacity to continue slowly changing to ground shipments. Not only would it be more economical for our customers... But for ourselves as well. And being as we are a government regulated service and not a business those savings should be passed on to some extent. I have also heard of plans on increasing what we charge amazon for our parcels because we made a sore dick deal with them back in the day and they just so happened to fucking explode in popularity. Right now I believe we lose money on most amazon packages delivered... I'm not 100% on that though.

I have also seen in the past year a transition to optimize and prioritize parcel processing. Especially heavy and oversized parcels. The amount of fucking free weight plates I've seen people ship this last year was astronomical. And I believe there is rumor going around my plant of another smaller parcel processing machine going in while removing a couple of other underutilized pieces of equipment to free up the space for it. 

Last year was absolutely nuts for parcels with the pandemic... I was a temporary appointment last year (what they refer to as a pse) and because of that I worked 60+ hour 6 day weeks all year long. Many of them approached 70 hours. That's not really the case anymore being as I am a career now so the most I work is 48 hours in a week (excluding peak season). That being said things seem to finally be slowing down a little bit. Maybe that is places opening back up finally.... Maybe people are out of money to throw around (minus the stimmies I see coming through the letter machines)... But I bet it stays pretty constant this year. We'll be busy... But hopefully nothing like last year.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's worth remembering that USPS literally does 400 times the volume than FedEx and UPS combined.

Something like several billion pieces to 160 million addresses, where are the other to do a hundred and sixty million pieces to 40 million addresses."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I live in a major city and usps is invaluable. They deliver every piece of important mail consistently. They have the infrastructure and are really cost effective compared to other senders.

Also what other entity treats their employees as well as usps? Government benefits creates a good atmosphere for workers and is low stress. Maybe things are piss poor where you are but where I live Usps is the best option"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how you measure volume.  If you are going by quantity of shit junk mail sent that’s just padding the numbers while not bringing in much cash

Measure volume of mail in actuality (dimensions) or even simply by weight.

* Their revenue significantly increased from $0.7B in 2017 to $4.9B in 2019 (571% increase). 
* However, 2020 revenue was hit hard by the impact of the pandemic as ibuyers temporarily suspended buying houses

In terms of gay technicals: Opendoor is at a significant discount from their ATH's and has been consolidating pretty well around the low 20's. Support at the 150 DMA.

Positions: OPEN 25c 05/21, 25c 06/18, 30c 06/18"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"People need to understand Opendoor’s revenue will continue to grow as they scale and become a household name. Yeah they netted losses, but most tech companies of this scale do. The real arena of how they win isn’t appreciation or even fees—it’s the adjacent services like title and mortgage. They’re trying to become a one-stop shop for all things real estate from offering liquidity to sellers, title, mortgage, lending cash for buyers, marketplace, and so much more. As these adjacent services grow, they will be able to lower fees, expand into new markets, and offer even more for both sellers and buyers.

Opendoor is a volume game and also a long game. Their business model will continually be tweaked and refined. 

Just my two cents as a former employee."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although the short interest is much much lower, I am seeing cyclical patterns in OPEN charts and shorting pattern from iborrowdesk similar to what I've been seeing with GME. I believe that someone is cycling FTDs on OPEN similarly to GME. I believe shorts have been unsuccessfully trying to drop the price since the recent IPO. This is mostly speculation but it looks to me that they tactically covered a significant portion of their shorts in February (probably at a loss) allowing the price to spike before reshorting heavily on earnings (3/4) and again recently after letting the price recover a bit. The shape of the graph reminds me of gme in late January (connect the OPEN earnings tank to when they turned off the GME buy button) just before the panic selling set in and we plummeted to $50. I believe that the next week will be telling in OPENs ticker price whether the stockholders are holding or if the short tactics are working and there is a sell off. 

With the added pressure on manipulative short sellers from the new DTCC rules I wouldn't be surprised if someone (probably a smaller fish as I only saw <3% SI) got caught out while in a red short position and cycling OPEN FTDs, possibly over leveraged. The banks reducing the money flow at the end of March could be their deadline to get OPEN shareholders to sell before they are margin called. 

Again, all speculation and I'm not feeling like a research expedition rn so it's all ive got 🤷🏽‍♂️ I'm looking at this as either I buy at the bottom of the crash from the sell off or I buy just as the rocket ignites from the margin call

Looking at Wed (3/31), 10:30ish am buy unless the sell off happens and it tanks, then buy at the bottom before they cover possibly by the end of the month

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"i like cathie, but chamath is a slimy fraud. i'm conflicted"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"To what ??
ROI , get with the maths"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought Noah"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Does ANYONE actually understand what PLTR DOES??????????
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm bearish on most property valuations right now, for many reasons. Opendoor could easily see massive valuation losses on the horizon."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"opendoor seems iffy af; i know they must make money via their model, but the way they operate by buying houses at a discount/charging fees/selling at same price or moderate profit doesn't seem like it would turn into billions. the scope certainly seems interesting for ark holdings but i am not a believer."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"So...2020 was a boom year for real estate sales. For the first one ever, I was doing virtual only deals. Meaning a tenant or buyer only saw a property from the internet photos or a crappy video tour I made with my cell phone and would text to people. Or a zoom call where I’d walk around the units to show folks. 

So for this platform, which is supposed to dominate the ibuyer market, and in an economy that was booming for real estate with a tremendous incentive for folks to become ibuyers (to avoid in person showings to prevent Covid exposure) just stalled out - after going from 0.7b to 4.9b in revenue over the prior 3 years - excuse me if that doesn’t seem sus for the outlook. 

They should have tripled 2019 revenue in 2020. The fact that they couldn’t makes me wonder what really went wrong for them in 2020..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally, an opendoor post; this is the Hopium that I needed."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't even support New York City yet lol...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice volume
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy GME and AMC? Got it thanks.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"When she buu, u better sell"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like someone trying to distracts for amc gm lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 10 hours
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This woman has been sent by god to destroy capitalism
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathy's been on a losing streak tho :(.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Which ark? There's a ton of em.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"she's hot, that's pre much the only positive thing I can say about her and her investments."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Must be good if Cathie buys?

Must be good cos Cathie buys?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,she still buys pltr tho and it still dips and dips and dips
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Margins tend to be low in the ibuyer business, Opendoor needs to figure out a way to expand it further through other services."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,“Cathie just buys at the top” -someone that bought ARK at the top
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard of Zillow and Redfin.  How come I never heard of Opendoor?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Former employee here sitting on a bunch of shares so Im incentivized for this to 🚀 but I dont believe in the management of this company at all lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy ARKs
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tech right now is an ehhhhhhh for me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You're buying options based off of a long term investment made by ARK. Lmfao... You people have absolutely no patience.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but Peter Thiel wouldn’t back them so I won’t either
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Opendoor is trash.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathy woods is Kevin landis of the dotcom. Her 15 mins of fame is almost up!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in the realestate industry...its a overly competitive expensive  bubble mess right now stay the hell away
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,If rates get raised open door is fucked. They hold millions in homes. Price fluctuates stock drops
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Open door sounds like a less good version of Zillow.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not sure how you can justify their revenue tanking in 2020 when the housing market boomed during COVID. That was one of the few markets outside of technology that soared because of everyone wanting to move. If anything online buying should have beat out the in person market not got destroyed by it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not invest in her funds and stop trying to chase all her moves? The expense ratio is probably lower than the difference in price you will get a day or two later when you try to copy her.

Also, getting tired of idiots creaming their pants every time she makes a move. She is not some prophet. Eventually she'll mess up, just the nature of the game."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like RKT
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts it is
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone else remember some fuckwit mentioning Cathy buying into PLTR and pushing everyone to buy it based on that? 

Does everyone remember how it felt to lose money on it cause of FOMO? Yeah probably not a good idea to touch this stock... even if it is with someone else's dick. 🙃"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's correct. She has been managing other funds for a while.

Still, when I look at Ark long term it's just slow growth from 2015 until March 2020 and then a pop, like many other stocks and funds did, regardless of the ""vision"" of their managers.

So, it's not Cathy. It's just the market. She took in a lot of risk, and that shows now that the Ark funds have lost 30%"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't she buy ZOOM at damn near the top
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time I hear talking about tech, I cringe. The amount of BS she utters when talking about her forward-looking bets is amazing.
Five years of no-growth, one year at full steam, and now 30% off highs; not sure if the overall outlook is so rosy.

I own ARKK."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"She made 16% of my ARKW money disappear but I don't think it's a terrible thing to keep it around as a low percentage of my portfolio.

&#x200B;

I mean, maybe the people who sold their shares are more retarded than I am."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She wants to post the ultimate loss porn for maximum karma.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She's a born again Jesus zealot. God tells her what stocks to buy. Same as the Asian hedge fund guy who got liquidated last week. God didn't like him anymore.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She believes god is controlling her investing..so she’s a lucky idiot.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone's a genius in a bull market. My dog can pick any stock from a hat and it will go up 200% today from March 2020. Recently Cathie loss a shit load of money on PLTR, so I don't trust her anymore lol. Every time there are news of her buying something, the stock dips more lol."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She's a good sales person selling bullshit disguised as gold. Her risk adjusted returns are worse than the index...hahaha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"She’s all about Palantir a month or so ago and all of a sudden palantir execs selling off huge amounts of their stocks.  

.

So that’s weird."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,hahaha
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another question that they evaded on their earnings call: how are they beating Zillow? If data is king, how is it possible that Opendoor is making money essentially flipping houses while zillow loses money on every house. This was the redflag that got me to stop playing around with their options."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go check r/real estate, they've already determined there will never be a price correction or crash in the real estate market ever again."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The funny thing about real estate is everyone forgot the downside. Which are incessant repairs and being a fucking landlord to people that need to rent.

50+% of all rentals are now corporate owned. Up from 20% prior to 2008.

Here is what happens. The market crashes again and all these fucking over leveraged turds on wallstreet get bailed out again!!! Then they buy even more.

If somehow we don't bail them out, we finally have home prices fall to where they should be in a semi free market. I don't know what it is, but It isn't 6x median income."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree yet it is always a cycle and Open Door would be dumb not to diversify their geographic coverage. However, a counter point to this is that they maintain high current and quick ratios for this exact reason. Cathie is a read between the lines and seek profit when either the sales or the ROIC is high kinda girl. I would not discount her kind of experience. For example, she is now in control of large chunk of some market indices solely due to her Tesla positions. Ask yourself, ""would I short Cathie?"" If the answer is yes, turns out you really do belong in this sub."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro - bot
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">Stay safe

no"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">  Just because she is investing heavily in something doesn't mean she hopes to see a significant return this year or even the next year.

Cathie has even said that, after completing their due diligence and decide to invest in a company, Ark has a time horizon of about five years."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"And over the long term we know that stock pickers don't beat the market. 

She's a huckster."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Opendoor has two big looming problems    Housing bubble - houses can’t be built fast enough

>New Home sales are done by builders

These things are only problems if we do enter a recession and/or housing is a bubble. It seems to me, that Cathie is better the other direction. That with Covid ending, we're going to see a big economic upswing. Travel spending, unemployment going down, more people buying houses, and more people building them, etc... 

I know its crazy, but what if *we don't* have another huge recession again for over a decade?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't want it any other way tbh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well said, thanks for your insight."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This man's asking the real big time questions
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The existing Realtor model is just as fucked. My agent (who is a top 1 or 2% earner in his profession) has cut his rates twice. Disintermediation is coming, though OD may not be the answer."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they’re competing with the folks who put up signs everywhere “We buy houses for cash fast!” and “we buy ugly houses” lead generation."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also fill a niche for users who are looking to both sell their current house/buy a new one (from the OpenDoor inventory) at the same time. 

Useful for families looking to expand, or people moving across country.

I was in  a position where I thought I was moving to another state and was looking at their services because buying/selling a home at the same time is usually a major pain in the ass and they were offering the service to make it easy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't that the same as every sign on the road that says, ""we pay cash for houses""?  Those  people are making  living, why shouldn't a corporation also be making money doing the same thing?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Something something 5-year investment horizon
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">they buy, fix up, and sell? 

What you likely found out in your own experience is that flipping houses doesn't ""scale"" at all. Silicon Valley is retarded trying to do this. The real disruption would be convincing Americans that living in high rises is vastly superior to single family suburban sprawl. And good luck with that."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it take out margin and go all in LEAPs on her space ETF
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is an evil hedge fund plot. Tech is/was bloated with absurd valuations. Too many companies with p/e ratios of infinity/1. I'm certain that there are plenty of funds that are/were long ARKK, just as there were funds that are/were long GME. you're attributing emotional reasons for things in an industry where you have to check your emotions at the door to truly succeed."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cloud AI and ETL with a data visualization UI
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully that changes as yields start to stabilize a bit within the next few months. Investors will have a bit more confidence going into growth names then.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's in ARKW and ARKF
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Who has better growth insight than queen Cathie?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Palantir dipping is less about itself as a company, but more so temporary rotation out of growth as yields grew the past few weeks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket and Opendoor are completely different buisness models.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She would be averaging down if she married me
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that was my ex."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I follow Open and ark closly, she loads the bus under 21 a share. Sells non, buy non above that price. 80% of per position is build from 17-19 a share."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This exactly. Before 3/2020 the ARKs were as tepid as a limp dick.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're not wrong, but like every other prediction like this, the devil's in the timing."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its known as the Law of Diminishing Returns

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I carried that “sell when he buys” monkey before I got educated on WSB."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"She never says she'll make you a shit ton of money. Her ""horizon"" is 5 years.. So if you're expecting a return in less than that, you may be SOL"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,As long as there is a stock photo of her dressed as a school girl in an orphanage with the loss porn
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that religious side of Ark is scary"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop the hate
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably just about as right as whatever you think is controlling the market 🤷‍♀️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A blessed fool
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s been doing this for 20+ years tho
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No it’s not.  Look up PLTR compensation packages
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another question.. it's such a seller's market because if low inventory, however there is a huge unemployment rate. I can't entirely explain why I think so but I think there's going to be another housing crash in the next six months."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ASPS is a foreclosure servicing company. They are almost at all-time lows. I have bought the dip. Check it out.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It'll be fun watching both real estate bulls and bears heads explode in 6 months when we have a major correction (probably around winter) and prices are still up 7-12% YOY in most markets.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Surely they're aware of this bias and build it into their pricing model, no?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be careful what you wish for. Up until COVID it was cheaper to buy than rent when talking about TCO for most people. They still rent. If suddenly they aren't renting, they aren't buying. That's one thing that is pushing demand is a lot of people who were on the fence or enjoying the downtown life style gear shifted. 

Real estate almost approaches movies in terms of weird accounting tricks to look really unprofitable yet somehow continues making money. 

Add in that desirable land in a decent city is a better inflation hedge than even gold and it's hard to argue against it as part of an investment strategy."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure, I don't think OpenDoor is a bad risk proposition and well informed minds will disagree on where to buy and exit.

The only real systemic risk to OpenDoor is under capitalization (assuming some sort of over leverage situation at a black swan moment in real estate, like 2007)... or being undercut by someone with better tech and eventually being bled dry. So the downside is low when it's cheap... but I think their upside is similarly limited in that people are geared to pay for professional assistance in buying/selling homes and generally are suspect of one stop services."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bood Got
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,... do you guys really think stonks only go up?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The biggest problem I see with Opendoor is that is so heavily marketed as a seller's tool.  Everybody I know who has sold a house recently gets asking or above, within the first week of listing. Do they really need Opendoor?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is essentially the crux of the problem with the housing market:

1. Arguably, most people cannot afford a home that they *want to buy* but there are houses that they *can afford*.  However, someone who has their eyes on a $400k house in the best school district won't want to buy a $200k fixer-upper in a bad district.
2. This essentially suggests that there is a lack of inventory at certain price levels.  
3. Additionally, most people will not be buying houses with cash (especially not FTHB) so they only get prequalified at what the underwriting team decides to approve them at.  Some of clients have 10-20 people ready to buy houses that don't exist in their markets."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's the thing with iBuyers, their biggest play is the removal of commission (which traditionally is paid by the seller).  Commission, traditionally 3% for the buyer's agent and 3% for the seller's agent, can equal a huge chunk of ""Savings"" when using Opendoor compared to a traditional realtor model.

The other big benefit behind Opendoor was an instant offer (much like the zestimate) so that your house wouldn't sit on the market for weeks.  Whether true or not, realtor driven home sales estimates are always higher than iBuyer estimates (makes sense, it's in either party's best interest to have offers that best serve them).

In a normal market (read, not housing bubble or pandemic), this gives you a choice: 

1. Highest offer
2. Less time on the market

Problem for open door is that even realtor driven transactions in this market can come off the market in less than 24 hours.

I believe Cathie sees the promise of the disruption that Opendoor provides once these black swan events are gone."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"She had two good years, must be a genius the likes of which we havent ever see before."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Omar : nigAaaaa
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inverse WSB consensus. All these comments talking about opendoor being shit proves the stock will shoot 100% in a couple months 

/s but not really"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And as Opendoor expands I think economies of scale may kick in more for them and they'll be able to really undercut the market.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They work for Coldwell, Sothebys, Remax, or Century 21?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a very accurate explanation!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right. This type of situation can definitely be a pain in the ass. It's the agents job to make it as easy as possible for you and they should be more than capable of doing that without impacting your equity beyond the commission. I've trailed purchase histories of homes that went through OpenDoor's hands, and have seen their clients lose out on $50-100k in home value on top of the upfront costs (in my market that's 5-10% of the homes sale price). But I do understand some people need/prefer the convenience of it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">A strong housing market doesn't bode well for ibuyers.

Houses where I live are getting 10 offers in a week within listing. It's putting the 2006 bubble to shame. I can't imagine how financially distressed and functionally illiterate you would have to be to sell to an ibuyer like Opendoor in this market. Doubly so since Opendoor primarily operates in the hottest markets."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,YEAH! Like your attitude! Let em all move to Houston.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait.. you can do that?

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,unless you have unlimited money and it doesn't matter
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,One hell of a way to spin averaging down I’ll give you that
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,She sure loves companies that lose money.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck do you think the “f” in etf stands for?

Because it’s not fuck, frogs, or fondue."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure she has plenty. =]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Since she lost 30%. Same reason why Ark was unknown before 2020
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At last. Look at her analysis on Tesla share price to $3-4k, fantasy collection of arbitrary numbers and disinformation."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it true? I am against Christian zealots and Trumptards. Was considering investing until this comment
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey now. Its not my fault his deity punished him for being retarded. He's gunna post some serious loss porn soon.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"She's been doing finance, but please take a look at Ark's performance pre-2020. Total flatline"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just happened a few days ago.  You can thumbs down all you want.  Doesnt change the FACT that PLTR execs are selling off their stocks a little bit at a time for the last couple weeks or so.  Google it if you dont believe me.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crazy loans being handed out like candy even to unemployed people, mortgage delinquency and unemployment rates looking real similar to 2007, property value skyrocketing due to seller market.... But whenever I say we're in a housing bubble ripe for popping people think I'm crazy"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop you're giving me 2009 flashbacks.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Care to elaborate, please?

EDIT: I've been reading your other comments and am starting to see your point, but I would still appreciate a more detailed explanation"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real estate is not really at risk from crashing right now just because there is no supply, like at all. And when it comes to real estate, it takes a much longer time for supply to catch up to demand. However, I do think real estate is gonna be a major catalyst in the coming waves of inflation.

Add in the fact that the Covid relief bills made it significantly harder to evict/foreclose anybody, even after the moratorium is lifted. So i think real estate is still a couple years away from really getting into bubble mode

Just my opinion"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There is not enough margin to make up for it in pricing once the professional hustlers figure out this gravy train.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think their true cash flows rest in their ability to contract with homebuilders to build new homes at a discount because of in bulk purchases. With their current...current ratio history, I see this as an opportunity for them to debt the fuck up for awhile because they have the collateral to do so.

I also think if they get a finance guy that can then negotiate bulk order futures contracts per se with companies like LGIH and NVR, then that's the key to their ROIC. They gotta market those contracts well to those companies though or else they'll eat the costs for future homes they will sell to investors."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some guy was giving me shit for saying there was no reason for me to go with fidelity over RH because PFOF. Fucker thought he was smart saying “fidelity only PFOF your options not shares,” and I was like where the fuck are we why we talking shares and not deep OTM weeklies or dailies in meme stocks?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure there are a lot of people that just don’t know how to go about getting the best price, or maybe it’s a level of convenience they wouldn’t have otherwise? Maybe it’s for people who own multiple properties and want to sell quickly? I don’t really see a reason to necessarily be against bringing something into a digital marketplace that might not have thrived there before. Innovation is innovation So if it has the most recognition, perhaps it could do well. That is what I’m betting on"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,brother that is not how a bubble works
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just an FYI, I am in CRE and I Just recently sold an investment rental I own.  I shopped all the ibuyers since it was a residential unit and i wanted a quick sell to roll funds into something else.  Opendoor doesn't remove the commission.  If you are the owner/seller, then they charge you 5% (ie:  commission).  If you have it listed, they will collect a portion of that 5% from the MLS agreement as the buyer broker and then charge you the rest.  They keep those fees.  If you had a listing agent, you get stuck paying them as well their commission (let's say 3%, open door gets buyer commission from  MLS 3% which is from you).  If it's over 5, they keep it.  If it's under 5%, they bill you the balance for their fee.  


The benefit is ""time"" in a regular market.  The fees are higher and the seller will net more money on their low ball offer.  Opendoor gave me a price of $234k for my house and they charge me 5% on top.  I am licensed but just don't do residential.   I put it on the market and got multiple full price offers over $300k all cash plus I paid a 3% commission to buyer agent and sold just as quick.  We are obviously in a sellers market right now but I doubt opendoor will give a justified price in a buyers market as well.  Opendoor was slightly higher than all the other ibuyers I shopped (zillow, offerpad, ibuyer & etc.) so I will give them that.  


I think their idea is good for certain people but they are basically looking to rip people off right now and act as a middle man. That's my problem.  Not necessarily a bad investment for Cathie because I can see the model adapting but I think it could easily be gone when the market changes."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with this ""long-term"" thing is that everything will always be alright in the long term... it just can take a few decades during which you, the retail investor, will die of/in poverty.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inventory squeezes aren't unusual in strong markets so we see this happen a lot. In my market, it's annually when the weather turns sort of nice. There is a natural winter dip, spring surge, and inventory gets low and you get 5+ offers per sale in some ""hot"" neighborhood.

Fast forward 6 months and people in the neighborhood see that they can get out of their older home at a great price and start selling into the flurry. 

So prices overall are still higher, but a lot of people in the interim overpay."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"A alternate opinion, there is no supply because people are artificially being kept in homes by eviction moratoriums. And that once those expire we could see a sudden dump of houses onto the market crashing prices at least temporarily."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crash no, but correction from current and near term highs yes. The biggest ""missed lesson"" from 2008 is that people will suffer previously unacceptable levels of housing (parents basement, sharing house with more people, ext) if they think the economics require. 

We haven't seen any of that yet because the fear and gov policy is is stopping a lot of movement.

If/when that damn breaks, we could see a major retrench. On the plus side, the run up has been so steep and shallow in volume (because ya, there isn't that much inventory moving) and most of the lending has been in super low interest refinances that even people who end up under water short term are highly incentivized to just push through and wait for value recovery (it's not like they're housing costs will get cheaper since rates will shock back to 5%+ in this scenario).

The eviction moratorium effect was and is really overblown. I'm in a very hot market and we're watching rents suck wind, landlords are desperate to keep tenants in place and the new units completing soon are pre-leasing at 75% or less market for 20 year older comparable buildings."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely disagree, I don't see any way for OpenDoor to be an attractive partner for any large scale developer.

There is no bulk discount in home building that builders want to let go of... and there is no shortage of capital for them to do it without OpenDoor (or anyone else). Even at the bottom of demand in 2009, much less going forward while we remain in effective housing shortage. 

Major developers already have their realtors and preferred lenders chains, They aren't paying normal realtor rates and already get a piece of the lenders action... they have buyers agents doing their advertising for them. 

Frankly, I think you vastly underestimate how easy it is for any scale developer to get financing. OpenDoor brings nothing to that table."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You realized that, as a portfolio fund manager, she can't just *change* the investment strategies of a fund without proper steps taken, right...?  And she can't just keep things in cash for an extended period of time, either, as that would go against the fund's strategy and she could be sued by the investors."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. You might be right. But I’m shocked at what people seem willing to pay though. Even as a professional with a higher income, I’m pretty hesitant to plunk down wads of cash for a mediocre home. My staff on the other hand, with much smaller income and existing debt, seem eager to commit to massive housing expense.

I’ve always had a robust fear of debt though. I seem to be in the minority. Also, owning shit is a pain in the ass."

OSB is strands (chinks) of thin wood glued together, too big for particle board, to small for plywood. Unlike particle board, you can get OSB wet and it will hold up but not as good as plywood."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't aware that there was an Opendoor commission, is this a recent change to how they do business or has this always been like this?  My understand was their profit was done through low-ball offers compared to what they could get on a competitive market and then turn it around to sell without needing it shown by a realtor that needs commission.  In theory, when you have people using the app to go to houses whenever, without the need to have a realtor, the model is sustainable as long as they make up the margin by buying low and selling high (basically inverse WSB)."

According to Dictionary.com, an abbreviation is a shortened or contracted form of a word or phrase, used to represent the whole, as Dr. for Doctor, U.S. for United States, lb. for pound.

Initialisms and acronyms are two types of abbreviations that are used to shorten phrases.

Initialisms are abbreviations that are pronounced one letter at a time.
Examples:
– FBI
– HTML
– IBM
– DVD
– BTW (by the way)
Note that most people would simply call these abbreviations, which is fine. Some would call them acronyms, which sticklers would challenge.

Acronyms are abbreviations that are pronounced as words.
Examples:
– NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
– AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
– OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)
– SPA (Society of Professional Accountants)
– ASAP (as soon as possible)

But at this moment in the short term I see the stock going up and on that basis alone I'm buying in. I don't *always* care how the good the product is, at the end of the day we are all here to buy stock that's going up and selling stock that's going down, period. We should all remember that."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The low interest rates are whats driving it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't call it a commission.  It's a called a service fee.  It's also hidden in the fine print after they give you a big range of what they will pay for it and they meet you in person.  It also varies depending on the status of your house.  If it's listed in the MLS, they will buy the house using an agent from Open Door Brokerage and collect the buyer commission offered (ie:  3% from the deal) since MLS is a guarantee of compensation.  If they collect 3%, they will bill the seller/customer a 2% fee to make up their difference of their 5% fee on the purchase.  Even though the customer/seller is the same person.  On top of that, when they generate your quote on their purchase price, they justify the lower price as adding in another 5% commission for them to list it and sell it themselves after they bought it from you.  Not only are you being given a low ball offer but you are basically paying 10% plus the low ball offer.

I have no idea how new this is but I started doing my research back in October 2020 so it's been like that the past 6 months for certain.

EDIT:  If you do get far enough along you meet an agent, I will give them credit, that they do offer a program in which they front any repair costs and deduct it after it closes, if you list your property with them.  I can see the buying option as a loss leader to gain market share and get listings directly to make even more money on the actual deal.  I can see people going that route in a tough market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense. The real threat to Realtors is that the whole process is going to become less opaque and easier to coordinate/manage. At that point you really need a strong new value prop to justify paying 5-7%, especially with these startups that use online marketing to generate leads for shit-tier agents who are happy to get 3%. It’s a real race to the bottom now. You’ve intrigued me, so I am interested to see what develops."

There is some fundamental analysis that could be discussed but I wanted to see what people thought about these points or any points I am missing for either case.

&#x200B;

In the bullish case:

\- Sports equipment: More demand in the spring to summer as people gather together more.

\- Guns and Ammo (Not to be politically spicy): ammo is scarce and they keep selling out

\- Existing Rising Revenue

\- 48% short interest on the float (compared to 44.6% on float for GME) as of March 15th

\- Lol people love to spend stimulus on hobbies

&#x200B;

In the bearish case:

\- Recent shootings could spook current investors with low sales after potential gun reform

\- Other online or retail competitors

\- Low volume can create massive price swings; may not have attention for a long time

\- Sports and leisure may not be priority with unemployment and inflation

&#x200B;

I am relatively new to everything but I want to hear outside opinions so as to not give any impression of confidence. I am not just looking for confirmation bias but for reasons why I would be wrong. I will see what other subreddits think too and compare responses. (Not a financial advisor)

&#x200B;

Sources: Yahoo Finance

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO/key-statistics?p=ASO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO/key-statistics?p=ASO)

Let me know if there are better sources I could look into.

&#x200B;

Edit:

This is a rather new account so I cannot comment on anyone yet. That is a fair point that short interest does not necessarily mean a bullish case. I am not anticipating a squeeze but at some point shorts do have to cover even for their profit. I am also realizing that saying to take advantage of the gun craze after a tragedy is pretty bad. It would be also bad to not mention an important factor in price. Thank you."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love Academy Sports as a retail location. Looking at Dick's Sportings Good and Hibbetts I definitely think ASO is under the radar right now. The stores are always packed wherever I go (Atlanta, Valdosta, Jacksonville, etc.) and I'm always buying something (it *is* my favorite store).

Seriously, if you're into lifting or fishing - go check out their 'BCG' brand (fitness) and Magellan. Really good deals on clothes.

As far as investing goes - this should be a $50 stock easily (would put them around a $5B market cap - Dick's at $6B and Hibbett's Sports at $1B). They make money and have a wide variety of products and great prices (much more than Hibbett's). They're huge in the southeast. I'm long on them and have 2,000 shares and have sold CSP's to buy more if it dips."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I am still buying amc and GME. Will hold.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear gamestop shares are a safe haven investment.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I realized, the inflation Kenny is talking about is when everyone here is Gorillianaires and goes ape shit buying everything."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the guys with 90% of the wealth blaming normal people for inflation bigbraintime
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only thing inflating will be the value of my bank account once this Gamestop MOASS happens. Fuck Citadel, and Kenny can  “suck muh balls”- Cartman"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like inflation in my bank account, baby!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only inflation they need to worry about is my pp
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What I got out of it is that they are scared of apes.  We have the numbers. They are no longer the 1%.  We are the 99%
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to get the fuck off Robinhood asap.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Somebody needs to tell this putz that the capitol gains collected after we bankrupt him will cover a good portion of the US deficit.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish Ken would get his face dick slapped in jail by an inmate who traded GME
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Inflation on GME
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, they're basically telling us that the sky is blue. This is just a matter of time but due to the printing of money that the US decided to give away on that stimulus package.  And most of it was for other countries,  not its people"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's over. Hedge funds have been getting their asses kicked for awhile. Expecting the Glorious Short Squeeze forget about it. Follow the smart Money you Retarded Apes.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, if I knew I was fucked I would do everything I could to scare people too.

Nice try boomer..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol that first sentence. He’s blaming the gov partially for handing out stimulus checks regarding this trading frenzy.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably a good idea to invest in gold or silver rn!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think they had something to do with the ship blocking the Suez? Blocked goods flow can lead to inflation.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who else read that the cargo ship stuck could be from ""human error"""
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets," I think the article is telling me to buy more and hold... (not advice, i'm just an ape)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They got sticks shoved up their asses
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course, that would be illegal."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This means they are shorting treasury...other hedge cronie last week was on record too...holding TMF to reverse f*** these ass holes
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And thats why they want the Fed to raise interest rates so retail can be margin called and have to sell /not buy more GME due to infinite money glitch going away.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not an economist. Nor a financial advisor. 

Don’t worry about inflation rates. Check Turkey’s inflation rates during 1980-2000: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/TUR/turkey/inflation-rate-cpi

In 1994 the inflation rate there was 105.22%. In general from 1980-2000 their inflation rates were crazy but life was not any worse than what it is now in USA for ordinary people. 

Can someone correct me if I am wrong?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of you need to check out webull
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ken griffin has the most punchable face I’ve ever seen.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cidagay can suck on my left nut!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Theyre obviously just spreading some FUD around to hang onto the kang gang market. The underlying fact that this article uses to build this point is that retail traders aka normal people are buying stocks like crazy. Like bro I want the prices of my stocks to fuckin inflate its only shitty if I didn't hold any before that happens; stock pricing and how much retail traders are putting into the market is NOT a measure of inflation. This article proves nothing while saying a lot.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing useful besides 1400 potentially disrupting the markets for weeks
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got something you want to tell us, Kenneth? Make it three words or less, you're not worth more of my time than that"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO POSITIONS AND STRIKES
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit we can expect inflation. Printing money causes that. But ask an expert cause I don’t know about ergonomics.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell Ken Griffin that he can inflate my balls
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Inflation is the “bogey man” to banks.  They use it to scare the public.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So did Powell who said he basically is counting on it since the fed isn't restricting quantitative easing anymore.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,*golfclap*. So they figured out that money printing leads to inflation. This is why we have financial advisors and funds to fondle our money 👍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,then it's time to buy new amc shares![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ken, spread your cheeks. I will put a Barbie in you"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weird thing is that so much of US workforce has been in unemployment that if the stimmies didn't go out you would probably have had 'deflation' and I have yet to see an economist find that a good thing.


Kenn is just full of it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how they used a Pic from 75 lbs ago
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing that’s going to inflate is my bank account. Thanks hedgies

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ken still thinks he is hot shit for arbing convertible bonds out of a dorm room in 1987. Probably the only strategy he ever came up with that had alpha without straight up cheating.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well... On Tesla, retail was right and Wallstreet was wrong. On criptocoinz retail was right, and wall street was wrong 

Those alone should explain this imbalance already!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">it the fan and is not only blaming it on retail per se but on the government for stimulating this ‘frenzy’ with stimulus checks. We see you Ken.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not fair. They only control around 75% of the market and can only funnel around 46% through dark pools. Ken Griffin isn't at all a criminal that should go to prison with full asset forfeiture, but rather a respectable business man making a valuable contribution to the market. (s in case anyone is wondering)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"> They know exactly what stocks to short and call and to buy.

do you know what market makers even do"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why Public.com and vanguard are exploding.  People should be bailing on Robing-the-hood.  But they keep letting payment for order flow dictate their livelihood.  I also don’t trust webull .  What a great platform but isn’t it controlled by the Chinese ?  That’s a disaster waiting to happen.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,after they throttled GME buy-in? ARE POEPLE still using Robinhood?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Honest people pay *checks notes* $25m in securities trading fines in 10 years
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn and Robinhood was the main broker for a majority of GME?

Could we see more chain attacks?"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t know much about him until I heard Tom Sosnoff of Tastytrade speak nothing but highly of him. Called him the smartest guy in Illinois.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The money went to the three letter ticker that you're not allowed to mention in this sub. 550% gain since the first stimulus talks last year.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,because the gold market is completely controlled and mega banks pay 'fines' almost every single year for 'precious metals manipulation'. These markets HAVE to be controlled. If they weren't they would expose the lie of fiat currency every year via inflation.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you’re seeing a lot of people roll into the c word as protection against inflation and not gold.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gold has actually gone up. Inflation is definitely coming regardless of the MOASS, that’s what makes Ken such a bitch. Inflation was always gonna happen from the pandemic, he just gets to blame the apes now"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me unbearably angry. Nobody plans for the worst case scenario. We make the cog and the wheel work but nobody can imagine a day where it stops working what do we do next? Nobody thought this would ever happen and I’m sure as hell happy I’ll be here when it does.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only way to protect yourself from the crash is to go all in on GME with its -12 beta. GME is now a safe haven of stability, ironic."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,There are not enough hookers and cocaine for all of us. It's just simple economics.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the wealth of all the billionaires in the USA was seized and distributed to everyone in the country, each person would receive about $1700 dollars."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Back in 2008 someone hacked the AP Twitter and said that Obama was dead and the stock market algorithms dumped some 300 billion dollars worth of stocks.

Luckily, someone saw it and verified it as false before Market opening otherwise the economy would have collapsed right there.

It's always been based on feelings."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is really all the DD you need.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Historically, owning stocks is the best way to hedge inflation."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the message I received from it.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently the canal blockage was human error now. Hmmmmmnmnmmm
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they're also trying to say due to the retail buying, asset prices are going up (which can cause inflation (?)). Inflation kinda fucks over the little guy the hardest so perhaps this piece is trying to dissuade retail to buy?

Also the part at the end about the ice cream cone, there's no way he actually believes the ice cream cone tweet solely affected GameStop's price."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The current system, where the government taxes the middle class and gives it all to the upper class makes stocks go burr without spiking core price inflation.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"TD reports there was a glitch in regulating the stock.  when you tried to sell a call, its was coming up 1 share short in the system.  so while youre trying to sell a call, covered or otherwise, the system thinks youre going to be short one share.  i had to call and get them to override this."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This happened to me one time a couple months ago with ford. I thought it was a weird glitch. Now I'm reading more and more similar stories for all sorts of stocks.

 Most investors who realize gains probably just reinvest, pay taxes and clear debt. It could have the opposite effect of what Ken describes - reduced debt means money being destroyed (when it is borrowed, it is created; when the loan is repaid, that means money collided with its antimatter, which is debt, and thus was removed from circulation)."

1. The algos will absolutely front run you. As soon as you change the bid/ask, hundreds of other bids suddenly appear with your current one, making it so that you don’t get immediately filled and it’s up for chance. ""

WeBull let’s you trade shares not options at 4am!!! And after market is way later as well. RH used to not even let anyone trade premarket or postmarket. Even now their time is way limited to trade after hours vs other brokers. WTF you think they do this shit. If the stock does some crazy shit before RH lets you trade, you should be able to get out, or get in. So many problems more than just that with RH. It’s like feeding the very thing we are trying to fight!! But be you and GL 💎🤚🚀"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel you. We need just need some tegridy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Learn about the options the bid/ask. This is an issue when volume is low on that contract. You need to practice this because of one these days you may have a position with a big profit or loss that you need to close. You don't want to be fumbling around with the bid ask spread when you need to hit the eject button

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Right!! If your panic selling an option why not just ask 15 dollers lower than ask and get a for sure sale...whats 15 dollers when your potentially losing hundreds....when your dumping move your self from the bid ask spread and ask lower than that....then if volume is low or whatever u might be the only contract to sell......when your getting out get out any way possible and just start over......

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but what I'm saying is that it might have been set up. I'm not saying it happened that way just saying there is no way we on the outside actually know the full truth. All we know is that Enron collapsed and supposedly the books were cooked.

You don't even know if it is true what they said in court because many judges are crooks themselves as are DA's. I'm not saying this happened in this case, I'm just saying one has to be open to speculating because these types of people are very good at manipulation and will go to extreme lengths to pull shit off like this.

What we do know for a fact is that Citadel is highly correlated with several bankrupt companies where it profited in billions."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Andy Fastow is the man you're looking for
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Names of what? Videos? Companies? HF's?

If you want to know more I suggest you just start researching, most of the information is out there that lets you connect the dots but it isn't all put together in one spot. You have to put the puzzle together to actually realize what is going on(and even then you won't know for sure, you will just know evil shit is being done, that evil underlies virtually all the problems in our society(all the things related to economic issues which includes things from market crashes, wars, politician behavior, social decline, etc)).

You'll realize that all these billionaires are actually crooks and it will make sense that there is no fucking way to get a billion dollars without manipulation. You'll realize, once you start listening to them that most of them are psychopaths/sociopaths(They think they are the only ones capable of solving the worlds problems, but you'll realize when you look in it that they are the ones that have created the problems).

It's such a complex and deep problem(Probably the biggest problem humanity has faced) that I doubt anyone realizes how bad it is. The bankers(psychopaths), businessmen(psychopaths), criminals(psychopaths), and politicians(psychopaths) have been manipulating the system so much and getting away with it that all they have been doing is building a huge house of cards for their greed that what they built can no longer sustain itself. That is they can't keep up with the manipulation to keep it hidden. Their shuffle game is starting to keep so complex that they themselves can't keep up with it. They will try, maybe they will get away with covering it up another time... or the government will bail them out again to save themselves. (when the elites power is at risk the elites shit their pants and will do anything to keep it)

Again, all the info is out there, many people are aware of the problems more or less and some have done very good research to expose some  tentacles. The average person is too ignorant of economics and $$$ to really understand it and won't put in the time to learn. They just hear shit and say things like ""It's the democrats"" or ""It's the republicans"" and then kick their dog or bitch at their loved ones or drink another beer. Rich people are rich because they abuse others through financial manipulation. Many people were brainwashed by capitalism to think that rich people actually work really hard. Some rich people work hard, some are not evil, but all do not deserve their wealth(they might deserve some of it, but the system is broke and they were the ones that benefited from that either accidentally or intentionally). Most people for capitalism do not want it to go away because they too want to benefit from it and become rich. Who doesn't want a mansion, yacht, jet, etc...

If you want to dive down this rabbit hole then go start educating yourself. You are in on the front row right now. It's just beginning, In 1-10-20 years you'll see far more pieces come to the surface and understand far more, more than you would if you didn't investigate now. (just like those who were looking in to this 20 years ago see far more) It might not be something you want to do though, it's not fun and might be very frightening, if you want to understand how society got where it is and where it will be, you'll want to know."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying buy more GameStop...copy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to short Baidu and go long on Google.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a horribly executed liquidation. Two obvious reasons could be:

1. There were multiple prime brokers with exposure. They may have not trusted the other wouldn't front-run them so they all tried to be the first to liquidate.

2. They were the ones buying a shitload of puts in these companies over the past two weeks, and had more to gain by tanking the prices and blaming a liquidation gone wrong."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy GS puts lol

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure how margin calls and forced liquidations work when it's that much money and that much leverage.

China growth/tech was on a 20% slide already going in to last week, they likely knew they were in trouble by Monday. They knew they were in deep, deep shit. They were probably down over 90% at that point.

idk. 5x leverage, $16 billion capital can be levered to the stated $80 billion long. That means the other $64 billion long was borrowed money. Not sure why they were able to be extended that much margin given the volatility and the last 6 weeks of tech slide. 

I'm not sure what happens to the short positions, but I'd imagine they are closed out ASAP as soon as the margin call happens.

EDIT: https://twitter.com/acpandy/status/1376327888203612164?s=19

Still have 22 to 30 Billion to liquidate from his books. Don't know who he was short on though."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is 100% insider trading lol. Guaranteed. 1,000% insider trading. Somebody at Goldman or MS or Nomura told somebody about this massive margin call forced liquidation...

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But in the left table is a column called announced. Sounded to me that they have to inform about a block trade in some way or the other
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Best DD is incel DD
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Leave the GME cultist DDs out of it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Found the insider!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but they quadrupled since October. So who knows
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery only has monthlies but the $45 5/21 is what I would buy. IV is surprisingly low \~100% lol

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Also 9 of them pop out of a gun.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't mean them directly but likely friends and family got the hookup. There were multi-million dollar put orders leading up to it. People with a shitload of money knew. 

Also, insider trading happens literally all day every day. People like GS and MS have the SEC bought and paid for. As long as one of them isn't solely responsible for a systemic crash, they're safe."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cheddar, but they're honestly all pretty much the same. I'm autistic so I usually only put money on the big flows. Like the $9mil of GME calls last Thursday at around 11am. Shout out to whichever one of you apes did that."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. Should’ve followed the ‘smart’ money and got in too lol. Definitely gonna be watching unusual options closely this week..
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, does this mean we're finally resetting to some January 2020 pricing?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well the main loophole on insider trading is SEC have to prove you actually did it. It's not that the banks have bought and paid for the SEC (they have to some extent), it's mainly that a lot of the times they just say it was crayon drawings / astrology / read it on strong DD on WSB and usually the SEC don't have a case.

The way you get caught is if the insider also gets caught and cuts a deal then the bank have to come up with a ""rogue"" trader or analyst. 

Happens a lot with biotech stonks where company insider tells their wall St cousin their drug about to get rejected etc"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i had cheddar and canelled... it is hard as fuck to filter bullshit from insider trading
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I can't even get 1:1 leverage.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's places like Goldman Sachs that are extending funds like these a shit ton of margin right? Goldman lends $64 billion against Hwang's $16 Billion for a total of $80 billion. Hwang's portfolio takes a 20% shit ($16 billion), goldman force liquidates everything to try to retain the $64 billion it lent out.

The act of forced liquidation causes stock sales at below market value, so Goldman/other lenders eat multiple billion dollar losses imo.

Maybe buy some GS puts at open on Monday? Loooool."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They pumped it up, but got margin called and had to dump billions in shares. Crazy. My ass is about to get margin called too if I don’t see some green"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe October 2020
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's probably spread across several brokers and one Japanese broker already came out today and said it's looking at a 2B loss from a client.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like Hwang had more than one lender, they're all scrambling like vultures on a carcass tomorrow could be very interesting, especially for other hedge funds involved in the same long/short plays..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly
They probably bought puts 
My question is - wouldn't it be insider trading? Or isn't there a Chinese wall against this?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re talking about Nomura right?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and credit suesse just announced they had exposure also."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's fun
2021-03-28 21:22:32,wallstreetbets,"$Root why I like this stock. $Root is a disruptive fintech in the insurance world. 

Traditional insurance uses different correlations to gauge riskiness of customers to determine pricing, with credit score being the biggest determinant but also gender, age, and make/model of the car.

$Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers. Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user's driving behavior. Every 9 months the data collected allows $Root to reiterate their pricing models. Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions.

To highlight the effectiveness of using telematics in seasoned states with just one 9 month iteration of collecting data $ROOT was able to deliver a 15% improvement in their loss ratio. That is a substantial cost savings that will grow even further overtime with each reiteration. 

Thier IPO last year during a pandemic had some of the biggest tech names including snowflake investor Dragoneer at an IPO price of $27. 

During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37%. Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics. Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models. Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models. $Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies.

Bear Arguments.
Insurance is a nongrowth mature industry with big players to compete against. 
Covid-19- less people driving and nobody knows how driving behavior will be in the future with wfh.
Shorts are also not understanding the potential tech with telematics and how it could revolutionize insurance with fairer pricing and lead to SaaS to those who use driving info.
Root is a startup and is burning cash. Like most startups profitability will be an undeterminatable time away. Growth in written premiums is 37% over last year with a 17% reduction in loss ratio.

Short Squeeze Potential
Currently a lot of the shares outstanding are locked up until 4/26. 13 million float. 68-74% short interest.

Gamma Squeeze Potential.
Call Volume was over 40,000 on Friday for 4/16

Catalyst for short squeeze and potential price targets.
There is a lot of DD on here. If you type Root in the search bar and DD multiple posts come up in the past two months. Citron Research posted on Twitter Friday the potential for a short squeeze. Volume on Friday with citron posts was 3.5x the average.. This is really a wsb thing and looking at the DD on here it might be possible citron stole the idea from here. 

The insurance industry although mature is huge and Root could offer SaaS in the future to major insurance carriers. Most of the shorts probably entered at the 22 mark, the gamma ramp goes up to 40, I could see this from a short squeeze with the low float and the twitter pump going to 60+ by 4/16.

Positions: 2,000 shares 10 10c 4/16 10 7.5c 4/16 adding more tomorrow thinking 20c. 

Further readings: there's tons of DD on here if you look in the search bar. Also if you look up citron research on Twitter. Idk I think he stole the idea from us. Tendies should be ours."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"ROOT is going to print.  You don't have to like the concept, this is about making money.  When everything you read (and millions of other investors read) is ROOT is a buy that should be trading above the $27 IPO price, and at least one (Citron) gives it a $70 valuation you buy at half price, wait for the surge, and sell when you feel like you've made enough money.  ROOT is one of the biggest no-brainers in a while if for nothing else because the media is pushing money into it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like $ROOT, but in this market, I have a significant preference for $MILE."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR; Agentless Insurance ""companies"" don't make money 98% of them are in massive debt and don't make any money and continue to get loans.  


I'm an insurance broker, people fill shit out online and then never proceed then I call them and most sign up. All these companies miss out on that business which is a large portion of insurance business."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the chart. It’s a bit too rich for my trading style, but what I see makes me want to enter. (But my FOMO gauge is telling me not to)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Missed it by a week, bummer. Had a couple $12.50 calls for $29 premium last Thursday."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The share lockup expiry equals a lot more shares to short. It could seek lower lows. May might be a good time to enter into a long call.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work for a top P&C insurer and would personnaly stay away from this. People are naturally averse to companies tracking their movements and you'll find that unless there are wide scale laws forcing people to use telematics most people won't use it. 

Think about it. Who would want their insurance company to know every time you speed? Nobody. Who would want their insurance company to know every time they stomp of the break? Nobody. 

These devices end up increasing premiums which is good for the insurer but bad for the insured so they naturally cannabilize their customers. 

It sounds good from a pure business side... improve loss ratio by increasing premiums on select risky drivers. But what incentive do insurers have to EVER lower premiums on non-risky drivers and instead just pocket the easy premiums? None. The incentive is purely to raise premiums on risky drivers and pocket $$ on safety drivers. 

Once customers realize this they'll refuse telematics.

Not for me."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 500 shares today.. I like the stock 🚀
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I picked up more today
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice!

Ironically, you've just argued for buying their product. Ofc, your DD as a customer means the insurance gains should offset the one-off cost of the burner+ the monthly cost of the SIM.

The only reason why I don't think they're worried is that the majority of the customers are proud enough to think they do better with that algorithm than their mom (or even their wife's boyfriend, for the matter)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only DD I understand
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We should listen to Shitron why?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't base it on just profits man.  If it's a industry disruptive company its gonna print in the future.  Amazon, Netflix, TSLA, Uber, many lost money for many years.  They disrupted the industry and changed the entire game. If you think ROOT is this disruptive force then the future is gonna be great.  Look at Airbnb they are worth more than Marriot now."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine believing the public percentage. There's been multiple dds to prove that GME is still Infact shorted to the tits
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It was on wsb first. Pretty sure he stole from here. Just type root in search bar. Plenty of DD.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short thesis does not understand this is not an insurance company. It's a tech company using telematics to develop behavioral models to more accurately price insurance products.

The ""customers"" are the products and each iteration of the model develops further cost reductions which in the future could be used by ""real"" insurance companies as an SaaS.

In the future statefarm gieco progressive could use telematics and the models developed by $ROOT

Edit: The investors who invested at the IPO and paid $27/share are major tech investors. They did not invest in what they perceive as an insurance company but a tech company that is developing data models."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the real price momentum won't be this week but next week. This week I see getting over 20. Next week would be the short squeeze/gamma squeeze to 60. Do your DD first plenty on here. Just type $ROOT into the search bar.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch:(
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop, I’m gonna FOMO"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, I'm not telling you to believe them.  I'm telling you that if other people believe them, they will buy.  If you buy first, you make money when all those other people buy because price goes up."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're retarded, ROOT is a clone of 5 other failed ""tech"" agentless insurance companies, news flash none of them are profitable and are run by people who have never sold a policy in their life. Prudential bought Assurance for 2.35b it was a ""tech"" company but had an Insurance agent CEO, and a full agent sales force."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"""not shorted""
Meanwhile it trades over it's entire float in a day"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prudential bought Assurance for 2.35b, Assurance was a ""tech company"", it was actually a large scale worldwide insurance agency. You know why Assurance sold for 2.35bil?  
It focused on sales, it wasn't an insurance company (root,getethos,etc) it was an agency meaning they sold policies from another company, the CEO was a well established and well known Insurance agent turned insurance CEO, all agentless companies call them tech companies to get high evaluation in the hopes of selling the company."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've made so many bad choice fomo'ing.

Look up other's dd also, plenty on here. Then decide."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So you don't think having data sets that lead to significant cost savings will be valuable to insurance companies?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"All the other new insurance companies are getting taken out to the woodshed and spanked lately.  Mile went from like 20 to 12.  Lemonade hammered. Think it's gonna bounce back?  I like the huge short interest.   Might get some, thanks OP."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you retarded? Do you know what an Actuary is?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because agentless insurance companies don't make money, all of the best insurance companies and agencies make money by having agents, insurance is a sales and service business people will literally over pay for car insurance because they feel safe at Geico or because the guy who sold it to them they like and trust."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Insurance when it comes to P&C (auto insurance) is all about service, I could swap to geico and save 20 dollars but USAA takes of everything in the event i have a wreck. Agentless Insurance companies like ROOT, aren't doing anything new that hasn't already been done."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd pay far more than $10 to not have my insurance not tracking my movements inside and outside the vehicle
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Telematics is going develop more accurate pricing models then finding correlations between credit scores, zip codes, gender, age, and driving behavior."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The agent provided no other services.  You guys get commission from sign ups correct?  I need some sort of service lol.  I'm not attacking your profession so don't get defensive.  Just wasn't sure what the agent is even providing.  I called up a few companies and found the best price and just went with that.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I might be in the minority here but do we need insurance agents?  My last one was horrible before I switched insurance companies.  She called me the day a bill is due as a reminder instead of weeks ahead.  Really didn't do shit.  Switched to Mercury and went direct with no agent.  Haven't had any problems.  Old timers will like agents for the comfort of having someone talk to them in person.  The younger generation is alot more saavy and can do it without agents.  Idk like I said I might be in the minority here.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're actually retarded, Insurance companies buy Insurtech this is an Insurance company trying to pass off as a Tech company because their sales are ass just like the other three clones they stole from."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a broker, not an agent. Agents that are captive to companies usually don't do much. Independent brokers work with most insurance companies, If you work with a indy shop they'll shop for you and service you policy there.   


Captive agents are usually ass and are churned every 2 months, Only work with Independent brokers. We get comp on sales and also get charge backs if you lapse or cancel."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because Insurance companies all have different risk tolerances a good broker will be able to know what company your risk profile should go to have lowest premiums. Mercury has agents lol, and Also you're a grown ass man why does someone need to call you to remind you of your bill and some how there the bad person lol?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, Ive actually done this.

And fyi, the big insurers atleast in Canada already offer programs like this to bring down your rate if you drive well according to an app or device."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then don't hop on board then. Considering that in the first iteration root was able to obtain significant loss ratio improvements and early investor was dragoneer that paid $27 and bought the dip at $18, if dragoneer believes in the tech and they've already shown improvements in one iteration in four states, then..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who gives a shit if they go bankrupt because they have ass sales, then a insurance company can buy their company for pennies."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Then buy puts if that's what you think?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Jump on the short train or buy puts if that's your position.  Should print if your right.  🤷‍♂️
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey dumb shits it went down like I said. Lexus nexus is insurance tech root is not. Next time listen to the guy who does 20k in insurance premiums every month lol.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you buy puts or short it?  Lol.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a gamble but good luck! And HBD!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,For August if it's all the way to the bottom (green) does that mean a dip?

Am I doing this right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,With the tax deadline being moved a month I wonder if this will change things
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But when stonks do well GME goes down.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow may post election years is good too
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does that mean I buy in April, sell in May?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy in august/September and sell in November? Got it.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, add stimmies to this and April could get interesting alright."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Post election April-July we gonna see gains this year??
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this due to tax season?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Love me some dip

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So sell everything you’re saying?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What about November?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This better not be an April fools joke 😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck was this in February before I blew most of my gains?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,the spike in november i can only assume is because of black friday / holiday shopping and spending historically.  but what are the other months where theres big spikes?  what is the cause?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a more sophisticated form of astrology
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why’s this month been so bad tho?

2021-03-28 20:06:12,wallstreetbets,"QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated) Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as ""smartphones on wheels"", they see them as ""data centers on wheels"".

Blackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). 

The other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. 

In other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. 

QNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements which are essential for instrument clusters and vehicle control. Nobody wants to see their speedometer or brakes lagging behind or their digital dashboard crashing in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. 

AGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.

On the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video. Blackberry has a great track record in security and its security expertise is world leading, so this is another stickiness of QNX."

But one thing I can say for sure, Blackberry and Cylance have an excellent track record, as evidenced by the recent SolarWinds hack where Blackberry has successfully defended all its clients. In my opinion, the integration of Cylance's AI engine in QNX for security enhancement is a welcomed addition, especially as vehicles get connected to the internet and become a hackable surface remotely.

How did they defend anyone? They didn't upgrade solarwinds? Congrats not hard to not patch your servers.

I've elaborated enough.

The fact the first part of your DD is around ""hypervisor can hypervisor multiple OS"" is dumb. Not really sure what useful hypervisor out there can't hypervisor multiple OS's. Also what car would need multiple different OS types?

The second part is they use Cylance? I'm not sure if your 2 person garage company has ever worked with Cylance, but we implemented it on over 700k servers. It is a shit software, and we quickly replaced it. I'm also not really sure how Cylance is going to work in a car with limited amount of computing and ram..

>How did they defend anyone? They didn't upgrade solarwinds? Congrats not hard to not patch your servers.

I feel like your statement is unfair towards the entire cybersecurity industry in general. It's a thankless job, you get all the blame when your customers get hacked while nobody thanks you for keeping them safe. There's a lot of technical work that goes into prevention and early detection. If none of Cylance's customers got hacked in the SolarWinds incident, I would consider that a success. Otherwise, how else would you evaluate the effectiveness of a cybersecurity product?

>Also what car would need multiple different OS types?

If you have done the basic dd, you wouldn't have asked this question. Check out this [doc](https://www.genivi.org/multi-os-integration-centralized-vehicle-cockpit) from GENIVI alliance, an automotive industry consortium that includes members from big automotive OEMs(BMW, Honda, Nissan), Tier1s (Bosch, Aptiv), middleware and silicon vendors (Qt, Renesas, Nvidia, NXP). 

>I'm also not really sure how Cylance is going to work in a car with limited amount of computing and ram..

In case you don't know, automotive SoCs (System on a Chip)  are getting a whole lot more powerful. Nvidia just [partnered](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300614/mercedes-benz-nvidia-computer-orin-self-driving-adas-ota) with Mercedes recently to put its DRIVE AGX [Orin](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/faq) (which also uses QNX as the RTOS) in future Mercedes models starting in 2024. Running Cylance will be a piece of cake.

2021-03-28 20:00:18,wallstreetbets,"Why Cannabis Legalization is BEARISH for some MSOs and BULLISH AF for LPs like $APHA/$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀 This weekend New York legislators finally agreed on all details of their marijuana legalization bill, and expect it to be voted on in the coming days. It is GREAT news for LPs, and pretty worrying for retail dependant MSOs like Trulieve, but great news for wholesale based MSOs like Cresco or 4 Front. 

[Article about NY weed from our favorite shills, CNBC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1262266) 

The interesting part of NY's bill is that they are implementing a TIERED system. Meaning MSOs will **NOT** be allowed to create an oligarchy like they are accustomed to and rely upon. Some companies will be grandfathered in, but even those grandfathered will come with some pretty shitty limitations on expansion. LPs entering the market later will be in a better position than grandfathered MSOs, by multiples. 

It is also interesting that New York believes that their model will be the ideal national model. That would have some massive consequences for MSOs. 

>""When this bill becomes law, New York will be poised to implement a nation-leading model for what marijuana legalization can look like.""

Considering Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is crafting his own federal marijuana bill for the Senate, there's every reason to believe we will see similarities between New York's bill and Schumer's bill. The intent here is clear, Democrats want to use the marijuana industry to create opportunities for minorities, and oligarchies do not create opportunities. MSOs are watching their precious business model crumble right before their eyes, and LPs are watching a marvelous industry open slowly with WIDE OPEN arms. A forced vertical integration is worst case scenario for LPs, but being allowed to ship their products into states like NY without having to own a retail store to do so, is the **best** case scenario. No retail commitments and very little infrastructure is the exact ""capital light model"" Curaleaf is using to tackle the EU market, and it's the same one ALL LPs will be using to enter the US. Curaleaf specifically says that their EU approach has ""tremendous financial benefits"" versus the US approach of vertical integration. 

Keep in mind companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf wouldn't be ""big"" without having the advantage of establishing oligarchies. Trulieve for example holds over 50% market share in Florida thanks to the overly restricted laws surrounding marijuana. There's absolutely no chance they will be able to hold a 50% market share in a open legal market. There's also no reason to expect they will even be successful at all once *any* competition is allowed in. They will be fighting at least 10x the amount of stores they currently compete with. They will be forced to compete via price and quality, for the first time. They are untested in both aspects. Anyone can sell weed when you're the only guy in town selling it, just ask a cartel how they sell brick weed. Lol. Your product quality doesn't matter if there's little to no competition. Also, it's not like either company has a ""secret sauce"" that makes them successful. They don't have brand loyalty like ""Cookies,"" and they haven't been proven in a competitive market like 4Front. They just sell weed in places where there's not much competition, that's it. 

Most MSO gang morons, I mean Investors, are stuck looking at the marijuana industry as it stands today. Last I checked, Investing is a **forward** looking thing. Today's marijuana Industry creates oligarchies, tomorrow's marijuana Industry creates opportunities. Companies, like Cresco or 4Front, who are wholesale focused are in the best position to take advantage of the thousands and thousands of new shelves that will opening with federal legalization. Companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf will have to reinvent their business model, and Trulieve might actually have to pay someone to create some logo artwork for them. 

Their current logo looks like a $5 package from Fiverr. Maybe upgrade to the $20 this time, Trulieve. Lmao."

LP's have a risk factor of maybe not being able to transfer their products into NY as it is looking like all cannabis must originate from within the state (all though this might change in the future).  But it is foolish to think that anyone is going to have a risk free massive gain opportunity.

But they are going to have no need for retail heavy MSOs, and would instead look for wholesale based MSOs they can buy and eventually import their genetics they've won countless awards with."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Interstate commerce isn't needed. Permission to purchase companies within the US is.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,">""Headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Curaleaf has a presence in 23 states, owns and operates 101 dispensaries, 23 cultivation sites, and 30 processing sites with a focus on highly populated, limited license states, including Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.""

Yeah I'm not gonna put my money into a company that actively runs away from competition. Lmao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, so let me ask you a question. I'll make it easy. 

True or false: Uplisting is expected to be a benefit of upcoming legal change. (SAFE). (The answer is true)

True or false: The only thing preventing LPs from purchasing MSOs and having US based operations, is the threat of being delisted. (The answer is true.) 

So, if the upcoming federal changes allow uplisting, as is expected, then LPs will have a clear path to the US. They do not need operations in every State. Rather they will establish strategic manufacturing/production facilities that will serve large regions of the US, post Legalization. 

SAFE banking *should* allow uplisting, which begins the LP movement into the US. Exciting times ahead for those of us with an IQ higher than our shoe size."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, no. Lol their legs are about to get cut from under them."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""left"" are clearly for an open market, and against oligarchies. Please educate yourself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No recency bias huh?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is my thought, but again, not my space. I'm open to learning. 

I DO want to hear more about US MSO stocks and how they fit in though because that is where my gut tells me to put money."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They definitely aren't. CGCs partnership with Constellation Brands is 1000% bigger than anything any MSO has done. Do some more research.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,foh
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what you’re talking about. NY reform has nothing to do with LPs at all. I’d rather own Trulieve (even tho it’s not in NY) than ever touch a cash torching dumpster fire Canadian company.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, I dont necessarily agree with you, but these guys are morons. They understand none of what you said"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re whole thesis MAY be correct IF things play out exactly as you’ve described and MSOs don’t pivot. It’s possible, but no timelines or concrete facts to rely on here."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watch the US put an excise tax on all CAD weed brands, then boom, US MSO will completely dominate the US market. And why wouldn’t they, practically the entire market is in the US, why let another country benefit from that. On another note, weed legalization at federal level is still probably so far away, I personally think it will never happen, too much division in politics, but that’s cool with me and helps with MSO position."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"My ‘theory’ is based on fundamental facts of scaling a vertically integrated business and was in no way in connection to what any politician or political party has said. 

Actually, the premise I showed was VI enables more business efficiencies that smaller companies cannot compete with — look at Amazon — and the actual point I made was on the regulatory standards which These efficiencies help reach, while smaller, new companies struggle to reach (as it incurs time and cost). 

You completely just got defensive and didn’t read what I wrote.

Learn about McDonalds and maybe you’ll understand how they have a cheeseburger for $1, or Costco with a polish hotdog and a soda for $1.50. You’re a weiner"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point being, it's not going to be the Canadian products. Big tobacco is making their move right in front of us. That's not to say TLRY and APHA are bad investments, rather they're likely not going to moon the way people think they will post legalization.

&#x200B;

Believe me, I'm 100% bullish on weed. But the play is different in this scenario. Constellation Brands is also lobbying hard for legalization which means we'll soon see big tobacco AND big alcohol as the players in the weed industry.

&#x200B;

I'm also aware of $MO purchasing a stake in Cronos. Even more competition for TLRY and APHA at this point. Seeing as how they also own a stake in JUUL labs we could see a play into PAX labs which spawned JUUL labs in the future."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that was unnecessarily hostile. Have yourself a nice day.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Your clueless!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That might be a bit optimistic as the larger MSOs are going to be extremely expensive when that happens and unless LP's can get massive injections of capital they might not be able to buy them (but time will tell).  Most MSOs however have already pivoted and are recognizing wholesale as the future (Green thumb, cresco, curaleaf, columbia care, etc. have all made it clear that retail is not the future and wholesale is their focus.)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have a source for these expectations? Expected by who? Why?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,How so?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed with 5050. I’d run away screaming from anyone who says NY legalizing benefits the Canadian companies at all. There’s solid operators in the state who are benefiting from the limited license framework just released. A few publicly traded ones are Green Thumb Industries, Cresco, Curaleaf, and Columbia Care. I watched a video where some dude was convinced this benefits Tilray, how? People are still either: mislead, delusional, and/or defensive. Those who want to learn I have all the time in the world for."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The “cannabismso” sub was created on here bc the weedstocks sub is just a pump forum... there are many great comparisons of USA vs Canadian on that forum by guys like MJSTOCKTRADER and they know their shit. If you wanna know about them go there and snoop around. 
The main reason there is such a great opportunity with United States MSO’s right now is because of the way the markets are structured and they have to trade on the Canadian stock exchanges while the Canadian weed stocks can trade on the American exchanges... its fubar. But there’s many different aspects.... follow the numbers tho, The us MSOs CRUSH the CanLPs in all ways"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"NY reform is a snapshot of federal reform coming.

If federal reform looks like NY, it favors LPs. Not MSOs."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all of them. Every single ""MSO gAnG"" member claims to be investing for the future of cannabis, yet fail to take 2.8 seconds to think about what that future might actually look like. 🤦. They're buying things that are ""priced in"" and ignoring upcoming changes. 

It's sad, but I still try."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless you're under the impression oligarchies will continue to be allowed in a legal market, then there's absolutely going to have to be a pivot.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad they finally joined the party. Lmao. 4Front had that vision years ago, and invested their capital accordingly. They are sub $2 and are 10,000x the company that Trulieve is. 

Also, Cronos is sitting on over a billion in cash. Even ShitDial has a full war chest. Please educate yourself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Google. Help yourself.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Because this guy thinks penny stocks having more room for growth means they will grow
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  Unless the legalization in question is federal, Canadian cannabis producers are not going to moon due to any individual state’s legalization process."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao. I just explained why current numbers are bullshit. You MSO gAnG are some **DENSE** people lol
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Show me in writing where LPs are entering New York? You’re speculative future rationale also makes no sense because that means you’re willing to overpay for a bloated market cap LP on a “hunch” they are going to be able to operate in NY. You’re better off waiting until we uplist and huge capital flows out of the LPs to the MSOs, because like you I’m sure, your cell phone app doesn’t allow you to buy OTC currently. May as well get your golden LP children at a discount if you have that much conviction."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the current customer in PA, for instance, is quite loyal and familiar to Cresco products, grown in PA and creating jobs in PA, which they are, what is the incentive of buying canadian product?

Further, on the fence senators like Pat Toomey aren't going to get on board with a deal that favors canadian companies over US companies. There wont be a legalization bill that passes that allows for it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Douche bag thanks for the constructive input lol go buy more sundial and aurora
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should join the weedstocks sub. Good place for those who want to operate in an LP echo chamber focused on “what could be” versus what is.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I've got plenty of APHA, don't you worry. 

Also, I'll say it again, there ain't a god damn special thing about a single of the ""big 4 MSOs"" other than the markets they operate in. 

Markets that will sooner or later be open to all, just like alcohol and tobacco. Remind me, between LPs and MSOs, who have ""big tobacco"" and ""big alcohol"" poured their money into? Hmm.... 😘"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"WHAT COULD BE VS WHAT IS **IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF INVESTING YOU DWEEB.** 

Literally you look at what a company is doing currently, and guess what they can do in the future. Your precious MSOs have nothing special about them. At all. Other than the markets they operate and monopolize. Those same markets will soon be open to many many people, taking a TON of money away from the oligarchy club."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a matter of opinion. I do know that certain companies consistently win awards for certain products... also stuff like Trulieve in Florida has won the “best flower” award, but even then.... that’s still opinion based."

If they gave that much dough to a tire fire, imagine what the most profitable Cannabis company on earth, Trulieve, would get from a CPG company."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The LPs would be really good at showing the United States how to burn money, dilute, and merge with other poorly run companies.

""best flower"" out of 5 companies? Woooow. What an award."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you say its 'opinion based' makes me ignore everything you say. My definition of 'best' is in the economic context, the one that people would buy if given a choice.  


  
Here is the root issue: Currently people are purchasing from a legal mandated monopoly. If that legal mandate goes away and the free market enters, which companies will people seek out?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe he is, I don’t know. That doesn’t make it legal for LP’s to sell in the USA though."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"to your point earlier, the writing is on the wall the Cronos will probably be buying Medmen and Ianthus when they are able to.  Just a heads up as the big MSO's are probably out of reach for LPs but I agree the smaller ones will be fair game for the top LPs"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The laws are changing. Current companies that have thrived in this legal framework are less likely to do so in a new one
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,A consumer chooses the “best value” for them. It’s a subjective topic. I don’t buy anyone’s products bc I have my own so there that too. What’s the best car? What’s the best computer? It’s a matter of opinion....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,But allowing them to purchase MSOs without delisting does.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because another company can shake a wand and magically have 2M sq ft of cultivation and 80 retail stores along with brand recognition.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was waiting for when you’d make it personal, I knew it was coming because that’s what happens when rational arguments come up against nonsense point after point. Defensive -> personal attacks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,So the suggestion is that current proven successful operators working with the cards they are dealt are all of a sudden gonna start losing to companies failing within the cards they are dealt when the laws change? Explain.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your right, it is a matter of opinion. So whether I invest in APPL stock or HP; doesnt really matter. both are the same"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,don't forget he's also making the argument that accumulating outsized debt for under-leveraged purchases will help the stock.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You right bruh. 


Guess what? That market is going to be open to the LP's (and many many Americans) very soon. Again, it's an amazing market. Trulieve operates within an oligarchy inside one of the most populated states in the US. 

Don't get me wrong, they've had one hell of a run. That's all the past and current day though. Investing is looking ahead, and any rational person can conclude that Trulieve will be butt fucked by Legalization in FL. Especially if FL Legalization comes before national Legalization. 

Without the endless benefits of an oligarchy, they are going to struggle to sell their 1m+ sqft of grow space. Lol."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Accomplishing nothing? Bud, TilAphria operates in as many countries as most MSOs do states. You are just spiraling at this point bud.

You’re a complete moron for arguing that companies that have absolutely no business somewhere have a better opportunity than companies that are already working there making money, being profitable...."

Current Market - Priced in 

Future market - Price crashes. 

Idk how much simpler I can make it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like DISCA brands better.  When I have TV watching doldrums I end up watching Discovery or Animal Planet, never misses.  

Viacom has several brands that are shadows of their former glory days.  Comedy Central comes to mind.  Paramount Streaming is now in a field of other streaming services.  At this point with every streaming service taking back it's original content  you basically have On Demand TV.  It's no longer a one stop shop.

Also who has Shark Week?  Really if I am going to slug down cash for a service I'm picking the one that let's me watch show after show about sharks.  Fuck NCIS LA and Blue Bloods."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like both of these long but not sure the bleeding is done beware. 
Not financial advice."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked in film/tv for ten years on the production end, and I have some in-depth knowledge on the production process. This is good analysis by you, and I wanted to add another perspective.

DISCA is reality tv, which means it is extremely cheap and incredibly popular when it hits. 90 day fiance is a great example of this, but that same show isn’t airing on DISCA. They don’t have the rights back yet to fully stream individual episodes like their other shows, ao they have a workaround of a 90 day fiance channel. This is an issue, but one that should clear up. 

Viacom has lots of scripted television, which means writer’s guild is involved, SAG actors, the works. So while Viacom is spending 2-3 mil for a 1 hour episode of a show, DISCA is spending 200-500k, which is why there is so much content and spinoff possibilities. I think DISCA wins in the next 5 years, since their price point for the app can stay much lower than others since the cost is so cheap for their productions. I made some solid change on DISCA puts when it hit 100 because I had it valued optimistically at 30, and I got puts for which I never do. But that is my perspective on this, since DISCA has such an advantage on price"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,just wanted to say that VIAC is not done bleeding. Information can be found on twitter
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love the Discovery channel. I think I might just buy
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Discovery seems like a much better long-term investment than Viacom. Their shows are actually increasing in popularity, and their streaming service is doing well from what I hear. That said, DISCK seems like a better deal than DISCA--paying a premium to vote in a corporate election is dumb when you're a pleb like us. If/when they get bought out, DISCK shares will go the same as DISCA.

OTOH, for options, DISCA may be safer than DISCK b/c it's more liquid generally. 

Not financial advice!"

I especially think Paramount+ is gonna be a flop, just don't think it's shows draw alot of interest.  Disca is more specialized with lots of reality TV and trade shows, etc.  Think disca would be the better play but too scary to take the dip right now.  last week was absolutely crazy for both of these stocks."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I scooped up DISCA for $35.10 in the final panic.  Was too scared of getting screwed on bid/ask or IV to buy options.  Up 18% already, hoppe it’s a nice dip buy.  I hope to see $50’s before moving on."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I still hate VIAC because blockbuster late fees robbed me of scarce tendies as a young autist... so calls it is.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Look they had to sell their winners! I’m thinking these are oversold. I’m backing up the truck...literally can’t go tits up...like free money.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD. I like VIAC personally because of their shift to direct to consumer with Paramount+. CBS live, local CBS live, all of the awesome content from Paramount, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1. I could live and breath Nathan for You, Key & Peele, Face the Nation, 60 minutes, UEFA Champions league, March Madness, big brother, survivor, etc. This makes it easy to drop cable and not need an overpriced live tv plan from Youtube/Hulu/Sling/whatever. I think they have a far superior quality and quantity of content. I love house hunters and chopped, but I'm not going to pay just for these."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,All sports deals on streaming now will have the same problem. The reason cable was able to go for big deals was because they could average the cost over people paying for cable that did not watch sports. NFL is still on broadcast in the current deals which was always a big factor in their value. Also it will be interesting to see if any of the leagues go direct online and just cut out the media companies.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of NFL is available over the air. No need to stream.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Waiting for BB to go to 🚀.   Let's gooooo
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I held BB for years back in 2011 and it got me no where. It's one of those stocks like NOK that could cure cancer and world peace and the stock would still go down. Jokes aside. Once this GME thing passes, I will probably roll some gains into BB though, I like what I see."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,They’ve been talking QNX up for about a decade now...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like the stonk should go up but it just keeps going down it don't make no seanse.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB is dead. Cmon guys, I get that we all want them to get off the mat but the fight was over a decade ago. BB has no tricks up its sleeves. It’s a company lost in irrelevance, and has just enough patents to keep it afloat for a while. The minute it shows so much as a heartbeat, it’ll get bought by one of the other players on the market."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,ZERO CHANCE blackberry will be solid. Fool !!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next Google, next Tesla This shit makes me more and more bearish on BB lmao"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Poppa Chen is sitting on the BB eggs keeping them toasty until they hatch soon. Goooo Poppa Chen
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,i dont think so... canadian companies usually dont make it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought a thousand more shares last week. If I'm right about this stock by this time next year we should see it more around the $ 100 / share mark.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,for a second there I thought you said buy you're own horse
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would put it at a 60b market cap,"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Been doing this but skipping ER as im hopeful
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just average down. I’ll bought at 16 and I’ll bj more now. Buy in at 10-11 dollars is alright. Long Play.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you gonna celebrate your 69th day tomorrow with... 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

...just some masturbation, you lonely son of a bitch?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,you clearly have no idea about the future of BB...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It was the last straw
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL yah they get purchased by larger companies. Like Amazon or Google.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That's right!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, it’s too low. 100 billion MINIMUM."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you see APHA or many other overvalued Pot companies valued at the same price worth that much? Sometimes a stock is priced not only by it's current earnings but by it's potential future earnings.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like us.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Its unclear but it's either 2023 models which would be out late summer or early fall 2022 or fiscal 2023 which starts March 2022. Either way its next year.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same trying for 10,000"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I think if Amazon or Google were smarter than they already are they would purchase BB. I think we might see this happen. If my info is correct by end of year.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Money in the bank baby!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should mention that I have 14,000 shares at $13.08. I've averaged about $2000 a week."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wait for the stock price to bubble upwards 50-75 cents, the premiums will get nice and fat."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,He means when he buys the shares he covers himself above his computer so when it rains cash he won't be hurt by the falling bundles.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Covered calls. You couldn't infer that from my original comment?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, should have been more specific. How far OTM and what kind of times frames? Weeklies, monthlies.?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh.  I do weeklies but and I try to not go below my cost basis of $13.  Last Monday I sold stack of  biweeklies right before it started tanking.  That is turning out to be an extremely slick play.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Subscription revenue instead of one time as they are currently doing with QNX
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I should also mention this is a 50/50 partnership between BlackBerry and Amazon. Amazon partners with customers all the time. They dont often partner on co-dev of product.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever used a cars touch screen? Besides Tesla they are all garbage. 


Do you remember black berry App Store during 2008-10? It was not good."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah but is Amazon not gonna backstab BB once it has everything it might need?

Amazon partners with lots of companies only to stab them and take there ideas but at a cheaper price."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a crap shoot haha

The touch screen in my 2014 Hyundai is trivial, I agree.

That being said, nobody is investing in BB bc of what they did and didn’t do when they where a hardware company.

They have transitioned to software company and today majority of their revenue comes from software and patents under a new CEO.

Bottom line is, the number of endpoints are increasing and cars are becoming connected and OEMS are spending money to update the experience in the car. 

Regardless of how the experience is for the end user, the endpoints will require a secure OS. BB is positioning itself to be benefit."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought Bb car OS was just the underlying not the customer facing part. 


Don’t disagree. I’m long Bb but work to build downside cases to test strength of long."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you, love that your a question. That’s my understanding as well, everything QNX is the “plumbing” of an OS.

Ivy is going to allow OEMs to use sensor data to build apps, which to me sounds like underlying.

But, John Chen says AWS brings the following to ivy collaboration: Experience with user interfaces, cloud and machine learning. 

At the end of the day, QNX hypervisor will allow multiple OS’s to run together.."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Still getting my anus $PLUGged with 200 shares assigned off CSP @$58. Hope the package stimulates all EV plays
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Figure out who his best friends are and see which companies they own/invest in. Pretty simple. Dudes a lifer this is how its done.

If anything I'm getting long things like CAT, DEERE, and OIL/COAL if you want to take part of an infrastructure bill lol.

What do you think builds the roads, charging stations, and powers the electric grid? Coal and oil."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"For EV charging stonk
I read somewhere Koch investment is helping EVBoX in the US rollout"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,BLNK has already been confirmed not to be in the deal so I wouldn’t touch it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, hyperinflation to the moon! Printing money until the dollar is worthless."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel bad about not talking about GME .. This is not GSB ... Game short interest has fallen like a rock and many shorts have moved on. Of course, it can still go higher but not like a wild squeeze but maybe stair step up. Thanks for posting this BLNK idea. Recent low $3 , Recent high $64.50 and now sitting at the 50% retrace on the Weekly chart. Average price paid over past year $18 and currently sitting at double that. I like bearish or bullish set ups on the weekly chart. Right now, this looks neutral. 50/50 coin flip which also means it could go sideways for weeks just like the QQQ is doing. Weekly close above $40 or below $30 would change the look of things. My fave play right now is RCL going lower."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recently bought long call options on $PLUG after learning of their price plummeting from $75 back in Jan to just $33. They seem to be the “best” positioned in the hydrogen fuel cell sector amongst their peers and it seems like they have actual customers. Their financials are shit but from my recent DD, it could get back up to $70 by the fall, at least that’s what I’m hoping for. We shall see."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possible Infrastructure Bets: RXN, RRC, CMCO, BLDR, CLF - most are already on the upswing in last 3 months, might get bigger boosts this year."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Silver will be the only thing left .$ 30 trillion in debt next year and even if interest is on 1%  next year ....you do the math
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Already invested in clean energy mining companies.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,MT such a steal right now
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is true
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been driving an EV for 3 years, from a product perspective Blink is the worst and Chargepoint is the best."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also think Arrival will benefit .

 Also AI-powered energy management solution such a STEM company when Biden roll out green energy ( combination of solar , hydrogen, battery storage , wind etc etc ) they will need a Energy management solution to manage hybrid sources and optimisation"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeehaw brudder, it's not real. plandemic amirite. just waiting on the call from Q to put Trump back in office #blessup"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,GME!!!!!!!!!!!!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,CHPT makes their money from businesses that want to offer charging. They just get paid to install chargers and then they collect subscription revenue for people using their exclusive software. Much better investment than BLNK in my opinion.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Stem doesn't seem to be a ticker? Whatchoo on about?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The bless up at the end was necessary 😂😂😂😂
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,STPK. It’s a SPAC.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how everyone hated GameStop before this for their ridiculously low buyback value but suddenly everyone is riding this wave.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Single man makes a tiny profit and arguably has a bigger impact making the world a better place than the hedge funds ever did...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m so happy to see this I’m going to buy more GameStop stock as soon as the market opens! And, if it goes down from there, i’m going to buy more. And, if it goes down from there, I’m going to buy more, again because I like the company and I like the stock. For me this is the way"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for you. I hope this stuff puts a huge grin on some kids faces.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You am good.  Be the blessing you want to see.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some do some don't.  My sisters BF works as a nurse at our local hospital and they refuse video game systems but will accept general toys for kids.  They have a list of things they take if people wanna donate items.

Children's hospital (at least the one near me) will take video game systems and games amongst other toys and such.  Basically no limit.  Even if they don't want what is donated they will give it to another charity instead of just dumping it.

I suppose it just depends on the hospital.  Who runs it and what they need/want."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm probably more intelligent than you. I work in hospitals and every hospital room has TVs. Why wouldn't they have video games?
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Our three main ICU's are the PICU, CICU and NICU. The rest are step down units/floors with their own respective specialty such as the Aflac/Oncology floor as well as a technology dependent step down ICU. 

I'm speaking specifically about Egleston. Not entirely sure of the breakdown of Scottish Rite. I believe it's fairly similar though."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Initiating institutional change is an investment I can 100% get behind.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Think I stick to UWMC and buy PFSI __after__ you lot go and lose money from a short dump and then I feel safe to buy in for that boat. I like UWMC as a stock because it has tanked a huge dip. PFSI on the other hand appears to be at a peak... My ape brain is suspicious. I YOLO in on big red dips. I don’t like green. My investing strategy is try to lose money so that way I profit 90% of the time. Also I used to be really good at flipping in runescape as a kid until I got scammed a partyhat/mask/santa so my intuition says wait before going apeshit with ‘BUY’ 🙈💎👐🚀

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would that make spy go up....please explain....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was most likely Viacom and GSX. There’s small speculation GME, based on Tiger Management being long GME and selling their stake right around the same time as Hwang was eligible to start up his new fund."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Those dips don’t usually happen in a vacuum and it has a nasty head and shoulders. Like the stock but it’s a risky buy rn imo

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"&#x200B;

gme"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"sorry if its noob question but can someone please summarise this in simpler terms? 

From what i understand Archegos was overleveraged long on some chinese tech (tme, bidu and viacom, disc etc) and a drop in price caused them margin call and they had to sell/close their positions late friday? 

Meanwhile they were also short SPY? and were squeezed at the same time or they closed their short positions in SPY?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand the sentiment but looking at the current revenue growth ($1B in 2019 -> $1.7B in 2020), future growth potential with an excellent product in a high-margin growing luxury market (especially in China), $1.6B in cash on the balance sheet, partnerships with powerhouses like Alibaba and Richemont, a solid brand portfolio, this company is gunna do big things I think

You could argue it’s a worry with China but we don’t go and sell Apple for that reason so I bought this dip for sure. I think it’s a healthy sign that it was a margin call forced liquidation (so no choice) and the dip was bought back up (the same can’t be said of Discovery and Viacom)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,$DIS
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Goldman Sachs did the liquidating, I'm sure someone in the chain of command leaked some info to friends."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably his creditors, in fact I almost guarantee it. They would know early, and would have the cash to jump on leverage ASAP. Best way for them to recoup their losses, his loans are tits up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It was themselves but all they did was reduce the loss....but they bought the puts....
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,We don’t know their holdings since they used swaps with prime brokerages who held the positions.  We’ll know when the stock tanks 20% suddenly.  I’m really hoping Tesla is caught in this.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes they were short SPX so they had to buy back shorts which caused the end of day ramp before markets closed. There’s more that will come from this. Tomorrow’s open will be wild.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea fundamentals are good but u gotta have balls to step in front of a falling knife like that lol. Growth is getting hammered and  Look at the  volume and open interest on the $45 puts..someone (or people) with a lot of money is expecting more downside 

Also ftch didn’t go up in a line like disca and viac so it’s not as surprising that some dip buyers came in

Anyway it’ll be interesting to see what happens with this shit this week"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold May $170 puts and $230 covered calls, collected $120 in premium 😂 break even on this is $50 and $350. Had a couple hundred shares because I like the stock, but couldn’t pass that up."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they’re gonna have a massive coronary if you show up there talking about csps on gstonk lmfao ...  they hate that we’ve found their sub.  Dirty little theta fuckers wanna keep all their little tendies for themselves.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t a margin play, IBKR doesn’t offer margin on accounts with less than $110K NLV. It’s a cash secured play. Check the cash balance at the bottom."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The trade is actually bullish too! GME last traded at $183.75. It would need to go up at least 8% within the next four days for the 200-strike puts to be profitable.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes they do offer margin accounts for NLV less than $100k

It's portfolio margin that requires $100k+ NLV

But regardless, GME is no longer marginable on any retail brokerage. So those short puts require 100% collateral so the downside is 100% equivalent to buying stock with cash."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,TD will let you if you call them and pay them $50 for the privilege
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Downside is not infinite ofc but if GME moons this guys max gain is collected premium and if GME tanks this guys max loss is the difference between the share price and the price he sold the put at.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh my bad!
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say he'd make a profit given the volatility of this stock.  As it stands right now, he's lose ~20 / share before factoring the premium he got.  This stock could easily drop further.  

Seems a bit risky...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Puts aren't moon tickets, they're sideways tickets. The stock could moon, then come back down to reality and only assign him on the way down."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup this is how CSPs work

The advantage is that there’s less risk"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Nbd dude. Portfolio margin is where you can jacked to the tits on 10x leverage. Some sketchy shit fr though
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not factoring the premium isn't allowed. The premium is the whole point. The current breakeven is $164/share if the 200p is worth $36. I will sell you 200p all day, you can exercise and I'll sell at market  plus bag the extrinsic value"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,No use arguing with the cultists
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I’m sticking with them bc I’m playing this as shares
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"sure, maybe you have $1k to play with. Should you buy GME? Well, we're all on here mainly in the interest of causing a short squeeze. you want to know one of the key, defining factors of a squeeze? Extreme price volatility. Are you positive that you can tell whoever is managing the position to handle selling off if/when the squeeze happens? Do you know what price you are prepared to sell at? If you answer no to these questions, most likely you'll end up purchasing and getting left holding the shares after it crashes back down when everyone sells at sky-high prices and there's enough liquidity left to prevent the price getting back to your purchase price.   


But yeah, sure if you have $1k to gamble with, come join the cause. Just be aware investing in GME with an account like that is even riskier than having an actual live trading account."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a casino.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would just head over to bogleheads and learn it, and save yourself the fees"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm curious too
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct if GME goes to 300 he would have made more simply buying the stock but he is simply retarded 
  
not **rEtArDeD** like many of you-"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not how this works. 

Every CSP he sold removed $20k - premium received from his available cash. 

That maint number won’t change as the price fluctuates like it would with naked options."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the one I have :D it’s very safe and very cool, no follow up questions."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"*ASSUMING* the stock price is above $164/share.  

It's currently at ~$178/share and is highly volatile.  I would like to think it would stay in the $150-$200 range for a while, but it could just as easily drop back to the low 100's or even lower.

While 1 analysis has changed their price target to ?$175?, others are still valuing this stock < $50/share.

If you're OK with that risk, more power to you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is but until we actually squeeze, I’ve been using the weekly profits to buy more shares. It’s tough when we have weeks that we shoot up really quickly, as you are likely to get assigned, but I end up just rebuying the shares that were assigned on a dip."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy balls! Dude, that’s incredible! When I was looking early in the week, delta was pretty high but I didn’t feel like getting assigned this week (just in case of the squeeze). Seems like a good move overall though. Mad props for seeing that!"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too. I would like to try another broker for adding to the dips. 💎👐🦍
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The premium is nice don't get me wrong. I have sold cash secured puts to acquire shares. I jus didn't use my whole account to do it
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess so. It's good he doesn't have other positions because the margin impact would be insane.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s similar to owning a call but theta is in his favor. It’s not a squeeze play. This has never been about analyst targets - this was the play BECAUSE analysts and hedge funds were wrong.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if those positions were leveraged. 

This is no different from going long @ whatever his strike price is. He’s just getting paid to do it."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as the stock doesn't absolutely tank, this isn't a horrible plan.  I'm doing it myself, I'm just a bit lower in the strike price.  (and obviously lower premium...)"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sell CSPs too for even more premium, so I’m kinda doing a shitty wheel on GME. As /u/deltalatch mentioned, the only real cost to CSPs is opportunity cost, which definitely can bite you in the ass. Still 100% worth it in my book."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"God if this is true, I love you."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess. But he doesn't get any upside after the stock passes $200
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What strikes were you finding enough profits to make it worthwhile at? I eyeballed weeklies quickly and figured it prob wasn’t a popular strategy on GME because the premiums were like $10-$50 profits for essentially leaving $1k-$5k untouched in your account. But never played with CSPs, so perhaps I’m missing something. I mean, that said, those same amounts also make a hell of a lot less sitting in my bank account also untouched..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"100% true. I have loans with ANZ, ASB and Westpac totalling NZD$125,000 (New Zealand banks). I call them the consortium of lenders or ‘The Consortium’ for short. I spent $15k paying-off my two credit cards, left $10k in my cheque account for liquidity (I have three personal loan repayments now), and invested the remaining $100k in $GME.

Like I always say: “everybody wants to be a hu$tler, until it’s time to do what hu$tlers do”...."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s almost always a dip somewhere between 9:15-9:45 CST on mondays for GME, just watch and see. If it doesn’t dip, then I sell 1x at 100-120 or if it is dipping I’ll do 2x at 50-60 (unless the premium is garbage below 100).

Edit: I guess my position on GME is that I feel like I have enough shares already (currently 1151) and I’d only really buy more at $120 or less (I’ve bought up till 180 before, just don’t feel like it now). CSPs allow me to take premium while following my current “limit” price for purchasing shares."

Still, even if none of that is true, 18% short interest is a hell of a big number if the float is illiquid **in reality**. It only took 12% for the VW squeeze to happen.

My point is that yiur average human doesn't  read past headlines and oftentimes companies surge/fall in value simply because of baseless hype or in this case a story about a company mildly related to GS. Like how people on WSB think Michael Jordan shorted GME, because every story on the subject conflates his relationship with Melvin Capital and the Melvin Capital shorting of GME. 

But I would definitely love to hear about your conspiracy theories!"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Like i said it wasnt “on a whim” - the company brought $3B in supply to the market on Wednesday and it did not go well. The stock portion priced and allocated at $85 on Wednesday and closed $70 that night. They were probably playing that and got lucky with the fund implosion.

I'm in the chemical industry, which already has it's own supply issues due to global shipping, followed by the weather shitstorm in Texas.  But even if you can buy the chemicals you need, there are no steel drums to put the shit in.

The shortage is so bad, it has geo-political implications, and companies are begging for the removal of the Trump tariffs."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,this guy has obviously never seen any of the vitards steel dd posts . theres a whole subreddit devoted to it. and weve been in steel since december. this is old news. and this news doesnt follow the stock price. shit dd

Old distribution path:

Game Dev —> Publisher —> Retail store (GME) —> Consumer with console 

New distribution path:

Game Dev—> Publisher—> Consumer with console

You see how GME is a failed company ? Unlike Valve they don’t own any thing .... they never invested in game developers they never invested in hardware aside from white labeled Chinese BS. They simply never planned for the future and now it’s here."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh word that’s dope go for a physiological evaluation on me instead of embracing the logic. If you think GME has more squeeze potential got for it but if you think GME will turn around you are dreaming.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What’s your 🌈🐻 argument that it won’t?

The love for digital is too strong? 

I’d love to see the sales support your argument.

The guy who created the Amazon of pets with world renowned customer service can’t take the worst customer experience there is and at least improve it?

I just don’t see how it isn’t a turn around play."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The long play potential and the short squeeze are dramatically different... if it’s a short squeeze you can justify buying at 5x-6x the ATH but if you’re making the argument that long term the stock will stabilize at its current prices and then somehow the companies growth will gain enough to match its new 20b + Mkt cap and then grow past it to proved more long term value. 

What data are you asking for ? Here’s a big clue ... both new consoles offer a Digital only market place .... and that’s the cheaper variant ..... by significantly more than the price of a disk drive ... almost like they want consumers to purchase the digital option .... guess who can’t sell games for Xbox or PS in 5 years time when the next gen drops with no disc option ? 

Well that still leaves computer games right ? I guess it’s logical to think they could completely change from a brick and mortar store to a digital platform to sell games but even with that being said if they grew to rival steam and the amount of steam exclusive games and early access games and such STILL valve is only worth 10B ........... soooooo now you look dumb as fuck buddy"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The digital version is $100 dollars less than the disc version however paying that extra $100 opens you up to an infinite free market for video games while the digital leaves you to the mercy of the console maker.

So the disc drive in my opinion is the better option, now Sony and Microsoft want all the money so of course they want you to get the digital version but if they want to fuck you on prices of those games you don’t have a choice.

I don’t know what the fair market value is for a new gme, I just know it’s closer to the price it is today than it is $2."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,What ? You think you can run non licensed games on a PlayStation with a disc that you can’t on a digital ? If anything a digital variant is equally as capable of downloading the digital stolen game files .... my guy it’s all just hype GME wasn’t bet against because Melvin is the evil boogeyman trying to kill our childhood it happened because the company was run into the ground and ready to fail. Maybe they will make a comeback but that’s a big uphill battle and a long term investment like 10+ years with the HOPE that company’s would someday hopefully reach a fair market value of somewhere around what it’s selling for now.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody mentioned pirated anything friend what I’m saying is you own the digital ps5 for example you can only buy games from the ps store right?

You own the disc version you can buy vidya on the free market, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, target wherever.

You can trade games with friends, you can rent games even, if you own the digital version you’re beholden to psn prices.

So you save $100 off the top buying the digital version but you lose that money infinitely potentially buying games at higher prices on psn.

Does that make sense to you?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh less and less what you’re saying is true tho. The discs no longer contain the files they are literally being phased out and if you have you’re content purchases linked to an account you will always own it vs the CDs that will break and stop being compatible as generation progress. I mean even GME isn’t fighting what I’m saying they are embracing it hence the move towards PC where there is still some potential for competition VS consoles where Microsoft and Sony have locked it down.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"They want to be a hub for gaming, they’re gonna have their hands in every aspect which is great, I just don’t see disc based consoles going away, they tried to make one of the Xbox one or ps4 all digital with no discs and there was tremendous backlash against the idea. It’s not going to be any time soon if at all."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,The PS5 and new Xbox have a digital only variant ...
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s like saying Apple got backlash for removing the 3.5mm Jack ... they DID but also now you don’t get a 3.5 mm Jack

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they’re selling a covered put, why would they buy those shares for $9? They own them already, so wouldn’t they just go to someone who exercised if the price finished at or below the strike? Sorry, trying to learn options"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was talking about selling a put (so you receive a premium from the buyer) at a strike price that you’re comfortable with buying the 100 shares at. In this case you don’t own the shares, but you need to have the funds to buy the 100 shares at that strike price if the share price is below the strike price on the date of expiry."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah I’m with you now. The other poster said they were going to buy 100 shares and you offered an alternative. I took it as they’d already own the shares and sell covered puts on those 100 they already owned. 

What you’re talking about is a naked put, right?"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess it would be called that. I think most people call it a “cash secured put” ...since you will want to have the available funds in your account to purchase the 100 shares if you get assigned those shares.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, so I think I'm getting naked puts and naked calls a little mixed up. Naked calls have potentially unlimited loss since you don't already own those shares and you may have to purchase shares at market price to sell to the call option buyer at their strike. Naked puts, while not unlimited loss potential, still carry significant the further the share price drops and in theory could drop to zero. So if you sell a naked put, the most you'll be out I guess is the strike price x 100 (for one contract) and you'll need at least that much in your account to cover it. If the strike is $50 and the share price of XYZ company continues to fall to say $30 and gets exercised, then you'd have to buy those shares at $50 so you can sell them for $30 to the put option buyer which means you're taking a loss of $20 per share, i.e., $2000 total.

I think that's right anyway. This shit confuses me. lol"

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep.  Basically.  You have a massive slew of stocks that multiplied several times over after a March crash or a September crash.  A LOT of people rode those money trains all the way up.  We're very much at the end of all of this.  The downside is the market is EXTREMELY volatile now with a lot people wanting the same ride with no more trains.  People are jumping in and out of stocks, some spike 100% in one day or crash nearly the same another.  You're right, some folks are just cashing out of the volatile stocks and redistributing back to older paths.  This entire year will be a weird one as the easy money disappears and everyone starts doing weird shit trying to keep or make money.

I'll be curious to see how many keep their money in.  Profits are still to be had.  The odd thing is choice of when to get out. More specifically, why upset a good thing?  Maybe it was just a calculation of diminishing returns since you're making your money from the bottom, not the top.

Even so, the dips have presented a choice.  Do you buy more at a great rate?  Or do you let the stock drop?  The choice is at the whim of the people, although retail investors are alone a pretty small part of the overall pie.  It may be a question of what will the institutions do when presented with this choice.  Will they double down, do nothing, or cut?  Only some got the opportunity to lock in the rewards.  Everyone else got stuck holding.  At the moment, these are stocks with a lot of people willing to buy into at prices higher and often much higher than right now for all of 2021 so far.  This is the cheapest pricing these stocks have had all year.  What does one do?

This might be a unique situation too.  The dip was fast and not tied to any common event.  These weren't really meme stocks and stocks that many companies were placing in their portfolios.  It's likely that a lot of people were mutually affected outside of just silly retail traders.  For a lot of people, there isn't a choice to lock in.  There is only the choice to wait or double down."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the rate of leveraging, it could have taken a single bad play on one long stock to trigger the margin call, which led to a cascade effect as good positions were sold to cover the bad. The good positions were so big though, that the exits were causing the stock to trade down, leading in turn to more margin to cover.

This is what happens when bulls get fucked by a single bad play."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are ESOP shares part of the public float? Does OTIS buy these shares back and they are extinguished? I hurt my brain a bit after doing a quick Google search on how ESOP plans are set up.. I came up with my questions than answers. I think we would have to know how these shares were originally setup and how they get redistributed after being sold. 

42 trading days to extinguish $1.2B worth of stock at current price of $69 would be volume of a little over 400,000 shares a day."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent questions! If anyone can improve on my answer please do so! My understanding is they can sell the shares on or off market just as any large firm might do. Therefore if some firm (or OTIS itself) wanted to buy 4% of OTIS from RTX at an agreed price they could do so or RTX could just sell the shares on the open market. 

However, consider this: employees can change which 401k funds/ETFs their paycheck goes into every two weeks if they wanted to. That means the company has to be ready to buy/sell small amounts of shares every two weeks. The easiest way to do that is on the open market. Also, if OTIS were buying back their own shares they would have to announce that at some point, which they currently have not. The fact that RTX is exiting their OTIS/CARR position over time tells me it isn't a single bulk sell off-market but planned to be more of a careful exit on the open market.

Quoting the 3rd pdf: "" The Otis Stock Fund invests in a single stock, Otis common stock (NYSE: OTIS), and holds highly liquid, shortterm investments which provide readily available cash."""

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"There has been dumped so much money by the shorters to drive it done, once they are margin called you will know. This assumes, of course, a lot of things so..."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember though that it is not just the SI that will cause it to spike. It's that if a number of things all happen simultaneously. RC has a lot to do with getting GME past 1000$. If he does what he should do and others do what they do and all the numbers work out then we could see GME go past 2000. It may never go past 200 against though. That is the risk.

Remember, the first squeeze ended prematurely and the shorters may have shorted a shit load to get it down from 500 to 250$(The RH scandal allowed them time to get it down and release the buying pressure).

Even though they made money on that deal, if it's temporarily then it will all be dumped back in if they are margin called and didn't take their loses but just kept shorting thinking they would eventually win(and would then get all the money from those that bought).

This is a huge tug of war game. Winner takes all. So far it looks like the shorts are losing and there are a lot of mines in their way(the new regulations, RC and what he can do, DFV and what has has(and others)).

It's not a matter of when but if. No one knows what will happen.  Even if it doesn't go to 10k it doesn't mean it won't go to 1k. It has to do with probability. The higher the price the less likely it actually will happen.

The thing is, it is possible that such a set of circumstances has never occurred before in the market to drive a stock price up an order of magnitude or two.

&#x200B;

We can actually estimate the value based on various SI assuming the HF's fail.

Assume 50%, 50% of 70M is 35M, at a price of 200 that is 7B. So they have spend anywhere from, say, 3B to 10B to drive down GS. Assuming nothing really has changed then the MC of GS will nearly double => The stock price will nearly double. This is 400$/share or so.

That is without any other events that could push it higher. Now, once they cover, if everyone is holding, then demand will be high, this will push it higher.

If they have 100% SI, double the numbers. If RC then announces several key things, expect it to go higher as people try to get in. I would imagine he would have to announce first to set it all up, but by then the HF's might have dug even deeper.

It really all depends on what the fuck really is going on and I think no one knows. We can't get the real SI and FTD's.

Remember, if they are margin called then that will effect all their other stock too, a lot of shit will happen.

It's a gamble, let it ride. Could lose it all or not. People are putting in their life savings because this is one of the few opportunities they can play the lotto and have a very good chance of winning. Maybe it is 50/50. Is it worth putting in 50k to potentially get millions back? 50/50 gamble. I think most people would take that if it was truly 50/50. E.g., flip a coin that was proven to be fair. Maybe the only idiotic thing is people trusting that it is a fair coin."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with this is you don’t actually have a full understanding of what you’re talking about.

 Charlatans at gme have deluded you into thinking this is a battle or some sort of tug of war between retail and hedge funds.

If there were in fact some hedge funds still at risk, other in the know hedge funds would have shoved it up their asses by now. These people do not care about “retail vs hf” they care about making money, and they could not give less a shit if they are making it off of retail or their peers.

You say shit like “if they have 100% SI double the numbers” but you’re really just talking out of your ass. You have no idea what that type of SI would do to price action. There is no fact based dd that suggests reported SI is incorrect or that the short squeeze didn’t already happen. It’s all speculative bullshit and most of it doesn’t even make sense.

In case you didn’t realize, the market dip that occurred when GME squeezed in January was hedge funds deleveraging for the reasons you mentioned. It already fucking happened. These people got burned and have no reason to come back for more when they know there is an entire community of people praying they short it again.

Obviously, you can’t parse people who know what they’re talking about from idiots throwing around random ideas that popped in their head, but do know that you’re living on borrowed time until gme does an offering."

Even if the price doesn't move at all tomorrow you are going to see your calls be worth $300 less. You need the stock to rise enough so that the gains from delta outweigh the decay from theta."

Long time lurker, first time poster -- this seems to be a good enough time to break that trend as any. 

A fair bit of my wealth is currently tied up in cardboard ...... so it might be nice to work on diversification and learn a thing or two about different investing strategies along the way.

Before WSB, I had a boomer investment strategy. Buy and hold, I will be a millionaire by retirement. After finding this beautiful autistic community, I now want to be a millionaire by the time I'm 30. Therefore, my current investment strategy has enabled me, and given me the opportunity to be in the red since the first time of my account since February. High risk high reward!

I’m trying to have diamond hands here with my 3.65 shares of GME and 2 of AMC. It’s difficult because I really want this fancy printer to really kick off my small online art store (on Etsy) and so I’m trying to make money for that. The dream is that my Etsy shop becomes big enough that I can quit my day job and support myself only on my art rather than the opposite which is what is happening now.

Edit. I should add I got in using money I made from my art when GME was $50 and have no clue what I’m doing."

Been lurking here long enough to giggle every time I hear GUH-livers travels. Last dip I averaged my GME down to 185 and im holding aboard the rocket very comfortably. I think it would be really nice to actually learn something!

I dont want to learn to read. 

But all joking aside options confuse me terribly, I've expired worthless the three times I've tried, and im a part of this community because despite the crayons, I really do believe that there are some very smart investors here and im excited to educate myself. Thanks for holding this competition!"

Don't know a damn thing about trading, investing, saving, basically having any form of disposable income. I am lucky enough that my financial situation has greatly improved over the last year, but actually having positive numbers in my checking account is unusual and scary to me so I need to find something else to do with it. 

In all seriousness, my wife and I make enough money now to live very comfortably and I know enough to be aware that I don't want all of our money to just rot in savings, but that's about it. Literally starting looking up information on the next step and remembered WSB from the Gamestop thing, came here, read about the competition, and here I am. 

As far as goals, I'm not looking to become a billionaire overnight (although I wouldn't complain), I'm hoping to grow my initial investment to where I am trading with the profits from the trading itself without putting more of my own money in. That way I can be more aggressive and less risk adverse because if I lose everything, the only money of ""mine"" I've lost is that initial investment which I am prepared to lose anyway. I'm sure that is more difficult than I realize, but I'm here to learn and have some fun with it, and if I happen to make a few bucks along the way then great!

I literally have no idea what I'm doing though, so I'm going to need a lot of help, lol."

Newbie trader from Los Angeles CA formerly an Uber/Lyft driver and fitness trainer. Got into WSB and stocks when news of the GME squeeze happened last month. My strategy is investing in companies I like and deciding how much to invest (or short) based upon the stocks trends and history. My goal is to be an investor as a primary source of income, more specifically my short term goal is to earn a minimum of $800/month of pure take home profit from investing having nothing to do with the amount that I would be re-investing. I'm not really sure what a meme is so I wouldn't know how to answer that question but but please do not let that extensive clarification distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have Sept 17th $25 calls that paid $4.30 for. Am I pretty much guaranteed to lose at lease $0.30 per share now? At what point should I get rid of these? Obviously going to buy shares now to hedge, but fuck."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the hell is the deal with this ? Is the $29 guaranteed ? Why on earth is it trading at $25  I don’t want to do anything stupid and buy 100K shares, thinking I’m guaranteed to make $400K and then something bad happens"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta be patient and see your plays through to the end.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing is guaranteed. It’s just exceedingly likely. The deal can fall through, which would take away the whole reason the stock is spiking in the first place, but that would likely be bullish in the long term because most people agree that $29 per share is actually pretty low.

Also the time value of money, etc etc. Depending on how long it takes for this deal to close, $3 profit per share is actually pretty modest expected ROI for higher risk investors looking for better returns in that time period."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s my problem,  but all my friends and family are making money from my Tipps"
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I was more thinking buy 100K shares, now let it get closer, maybe $27 and then take $150,000 profit within a week. But I guess I’ll just sit this one out. I think we can all agree $29 is the new price for this stock though."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly the main problem here is that AMD is so heavily dependent on TSMC and despite having preferred status the current foundry situation is severely cramping AMD's ability to steal Intel's market share and buying Intel time to unscrew themselves. AMD has the technical advantage but they've been prevented from actually growing the way they should.

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,And..... we're red.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,It literally gained 14 % in an hour then dropped. How is that not squeeze action.
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"""It will take them 3-5 years to break even let alone profit."" 

I didn't realize you had a time machine and accidentally slept inside of it, waking up 4-6 years after whatever timeline you're from.

""They no longer have the initial tax breaks to show a profit next year.""

Not relevant. They invest almost all of their net income in capital expenditures; land, factory construction, securing materiel contracts, equipment, acquiring other companies, research and development, etc. Re-inventing the wheel is, unsurprisingly, expensive. 

But, again, they *are* profitable. They've been profitable for a year. That is a minimum requirement to get into the S&P 500, which they are. 

""<demand whinging>""

Okay.

""How the hell do you think a robo taxi is going to make it?""

Because they have the best engineers in machine learning optimizing the training of an algorithm that has access to millions of vehicles and the single largest dataset of real world computer vision driving data in existence, by far. The ""best engineers"" thing alone is really the only relevant moat, everything else is just proof said moat's already thoroughly entrenched."

I really noticed this with Family Guy's Thanksgiving episode; like, the whole plot was ""sitting down to eat and exploring what people would say should Joe's son wnd up not being dead.""

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you have to look at the scope of such problems. Using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is probably the most fundamentally understood practice in American economics, and is especially necessary for publicly traded companies.

It sets a standard which allows investors to get a fair understanding of where the company stands.

If they do not abide by GAAP, then they can easily manipulate investors into investing in something that they wouldn't otherwise invest in.

Using GAAP, or any other international standard, allows the market to flourish, as investors are well equipped to better understand what a ""good"" company looks like.

Blackberry is a company that probably wasn't trying to manipulate investors with non-GAAP accounting, and there is even a time and a place for other methods.

But when you are looking at all these stocks that blow up simply by the added level of investor interest, it's important that if it suddenly falls in price again, that investors are well informed, and the best investors can either decide more accurately whether they should invest, or divest.

Now, I'm not sure if the SEC is really all that concerned, or if there is some sort of under the table pressure from one of BBs competitors, or even a large institutional investors which is heavily invested in one of BBs competitors, but if that pressure is simply making BB abide by the standard accounting practices of all American public companies, then I don't really mind, and I'm actually all for it.

On the contrary, to actually pursue an investigation in shorting practices requires a lot of time and resources, standing starkly in contrast to the simplicity in enforcing GAAP on a company such as BB.

So if you really want the market to be more fair, than maybe this is a good thing for BB. It's certainly a good thing for you if you are actually trying to invest based on a good understanding of the company itself."
03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,Short sellers absolutely do have to pay taxes even if the company goes bankrupt. Goddamn why would you tell a lie that can be debunked with a three second google search

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I understand this is a joke post, I think it's important that more people know that rabbits should not eat carrots very often, as they contain way too much sugar for a rabbit's digestive system to process. A bit of carrot (or other high-sugar food) is OK as an occasional treat, but too much can cause gastrointestinal stasis, which is essentially super constipation, and if untreated will kill the rabbit."

&#x200B;

\- Does anyone else see major flaw with this argument ?

&#x200B;

Market cap is calculated =NO of shares \* Share price

and NOT total amount of inflows.

To double to 370$ a share ( and to double the Market Cap), it only takes for one share to be sold @ 370$  ( if no one sells under that price )

How was I embarrassing myself? you had absolutely nothing of substance to say... Everything I said was true,  Lambo's are overpriced trash designed for rappers who want to lose money. Just because they produce a low amount of a certain car doesn't make it worth more over time. You'd make more money buying the new ZR1 Corvette when they're released than you would buying a Lambo.

With Arizona maybe they make a play to really identify themselves and market their brand but we shall see.  For now this is a moderate growth stock, i can see them hitting 150-175 over the next few years but nothing like Nvidia has done over the past 5 years.  Nvidia really dropped their brand all over the market and they had die hard followers who pushed their brand too.  I don't see that with TSM but i am hopeful as i own their stock."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the problem with traditional gold is that as people rotate out of it into ""digital gold"" the price will be depressed. Which is why it's been sagging despite the inflation fears and the rest of the market being volatile as hell lately.

It doesn't work well as a hedge against inflation if there's another similar asset that everyone is buying into that's moving up rapidly in price while gold keeps sagging in price. These things tend to reinforce themselves->if one ""store of value"" to protect against inflation is *dropping* in price then nobody will want to use it as a hedge against inflation because despite inflation fears it's actually dropping in USD value.

I think the best thing to do is to pick seriously value stocks that can actually pay out in a highly inflationary environment and then if you want to buy a store of value to buy the one that people are rotating into and not the one that people are dumping. I'm slowly rotating into mostly value plays that'll hopefully be able to pay real dividends as well as some relatively safe REITs (i.e. ones that invest in boring shit like cellphone towers and not say, office buildings or malls). As far as digital gold goes though there's still no good US ETF and the one available OTC trust has discount/premium issues which makes it a little tricky to use at the moment so spot is probably safest but then you have the security issues with that."

03/29/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, we def have population growth in the cities where people are buying... And all that land is useless without infrastructure, hence why the population of Canada is actually squeezed into a country much closer in size to Japan than we realize. 

So I just can't see how getting ""burned"" will happen -- it isn't the same situation like when the US was approving all those high risk loans. People buying 1M+ houses make good money and can afford to hold through turbulence. Sure, there are a lot of investment props which can afford to sit empty, pay taxes, and rise in value. But this is totally different than empty housing due to oversupply. Look at the waitlist for subsidized Toronto housing, it's years.

And 100% in 5 years is definitely a hot growth market, but it isn't insane. The TSX has returned like 50% in that time. Will the growth cool? Absolutely. Will prices fall off a cliff? Very ulikely, because the demand is there. We saw it with covid, which was the biggest test there could be. 

But anyways, if you think you can hold out for X more years to get a detached Toronto home for 1990s prices, good luck! At least im sure we can agree that we live in a beautiful country :)"
