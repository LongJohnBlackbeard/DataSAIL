2021-06-02 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,Lol let’s just hope it doesn’t open at $20 tomorrow because those small gains will turn into a second mortgage to pay for your bills.

2021-06-02 19:46:57,wallstreetbets,"I had calls on GME previously, which I went from 3k to around 20k. I had held onto the calls till the day of expiration in which I finally sold. Then I saw the momentum that AMC had compared to GME, and decided to jump in AMC. No disrespect on GME of course."
2021-06-02 19:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Remember that GME started low like currently happening with AMC then skyrocket. Dont sell even if tomorrow opens at $20, real squeez is yet to come!"
2021-06-02 19:31:20,wallstreetbets,Newbie ape - is it better to have a closer expiration date or a lower call price?
2021-06-02 19:34:44,wallstreetbets,There was also a fake crash 70-150-70
2021-06-02 19:42:33,wallstreetbets,Depends on your risk. Closer expiration date is much risker than an long expiration date. Same with lower call prices which is also less risk than getting out the money calls. [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/) Is a great source to visualize your profit/loss area
2021-06-02 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,Cheers thanks fellow ape
2021-06-02 19:12:45,wallstreetbets,Kind of.  Remember that these institutions could already be holding shares so they don’t need to “buy them”.  But yes if the hedge fund is retarded and owns zero shares they would have to buy them at market price.
2021-06-02 19:12:49,wallstreetbets,I like money.
2021-06-02 19:38:45,wallstreetbets,Delta neutral hedging is done in real time.
2021-06-02 19:26:49,wallstreetbets,"They only need to purchase a number of shares to offset the change in delta of the calls. For example, the 50 strike calls currently have a delta of .72, so if the seller of that call wants to be delta-neutral, they need to own 72 shares to offset it. Now, that doesn't mean they have to buy 72 shares today, because they already had some. Maybe the delta of those 50 strike calls was .35 yesterday (I didn't look, but seems about right), so they already owned 35 offsetting shares, and needed to buy 37 more today."
2021-06-02 19:32:06,wallstreetbets,Yes except they already own the shares. It happens super fast.  High frequency trading simultaneously with your option purchase with very powerful computers.  They don’t sit around and talk about it over a water cooler.  When calls are sold and not exercised their programs sell shares.   100 per contract.
2021-06-02 19:29:40,wallstreetbets,I like money too
2021-06-02 19:30:25,wallstreetbets,So basically with all words and thoughts encapsulated; AMC go brrrrr
2021-06-02 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,$EDU IS THE NEXT SQUEEZE!!
2021-06-02 19:58:30,wallstreetbets,"I guess that makes sense - but there are 115 million shares here. Wouldnt that be a lot to just hold?

How about for calls far out of the money? For instance the $73 call option:

Let say I bought an AMC call option for $73 this morning at 8am when the price is \~$39. Does the market maker immediately purchase the stock at $39? Or do they wait for it to get closer to the strike price to make the purchase?"
2021-06-02 19:58:43,wallstreetbets,I LIKE MONEY TOO!!!!
2021-06-02 19:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha - so for instance today in AMC - once the price hits $60, the market maker immediately hedges by purchasing the stock?

Or is the purchase done as soon as I buy the Call option?"
2021-06-02 19:28:41,wallstreetbets,"And I meant to add: this is why it's called a ""gamma squeeze"" - gamma is the rate of change of delta as the stock price changes, and it's only that change in delta that feeds into the ""how many new shares to buy"" calculation."

2021-06-02 18:53:13,wallstreetbets,"The higher the price goes, the more shorts that join.   


For example, we could force the appreciation of a stock with <1% short interest. But at some point that short interest will grow to 20%.   


The thrill of screwing over shorts is never ending."
2021-06-02 19:36:28,wallstreetbets,GME looking good
2021-06-02 18:46:00,wallstreetbets,"Was wondering the same. Quite a few 'safe' stocks declined today, maybe they pulled some cash out"
2021-06-02 18:50:29,wallstreetbets,Mostly riding the wave (you can see in the chart comparisons that many meme stonks moved in a synchronized manner)and then $BB broke away from the $AMC trendline at 1:30. And I think it’s all wsb moving money around right now. That isn’t to say there is not squeeze interest to back up those movements.
2021-06-02 18:48:28,wallstreetbets,Interesting concept
2021-06-02 18:57:34,wallstreetbets,"All other stocks are going up because some of us missed the AMC boat and can’t afford those expensive calls anymore.

So I jumped on CLOV, BB and MVIS that had much cheaper calls this morning."

2021-06-02 19:17:48,wallstreetbets,I was wondering why all but two went up. I'll buy some AMC just in case.
2021-06-02 18:50:35,wallstreetbets,Do HF shorts have to cover? Why can’t they all just hold their line to prevent a short squeeze? I’m a little virgin puss to investing be gentle

All had a good run today... will wait and see if all the squeezing continues.... remember NO WHAMMIES!!!"
2021-06-02 19:21:05,wallstreetbets,doesn't really work like that some short holders are more liquid than others.
2021-06-02 19:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Retail order flow tends to be very random and clustered.  It often results in disorganized chart patterns.  When large players make moves they tend to do so in waves.  This is because they've learned that execution is more efficient if orders are spaced out to let the limit order book recover.  So it's hard to know when it is happening how much more volume could come but it's very apparent afterwards. Clean moves followed by pullbacks. 

Forced liquidations on the other hand just keep going as they dump the shares a fast as they can.  Price just goes straight up. 

Today's AMC chart looks more like the forced liquidation action to me."
2021-06-02 18:51:20,wallstreetbets,Isn’t WSB the digital equivalent?

2021-06-02 19:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. According to ortex, tomorrow May be even bigger. I wonder if the MM’s will reload the option chain tonight? Otherwise Gamma power May stall."
2021-06-02 19:17:36,wallstreetbets,"The problem shorts have is timing.

If you jump on Gamestop now and think its dropping to 150 next week, then its easy fucking money. Your risk tolerance could even let it ride to 350 before coming back down and you'd still profit.

The issue any shorter has, is that if it breaks the upper floor of your risk tolerance, you are seriously fucked.

There's no way on earth any shorters will be entering this stock now, because quite simply, predicting the AMC and GME ceiling is impossible. 

The only type of shorter who would afford to enter GME, is someone with deep enough pockets who could stomach it reaching 400$ per share and still not be sweating. There's nobody that would wanna run that risk, because if it runs to 400, who says it's not gonna run to 1000.

AMC is probably a safer short bet, because Adam Aron can fuck it up with his meeting. Meanwhile, the GME meeting has potential to send Gamestop past the Voyager1."
2021-06-02 19:09:05,wallstreetbets,"There are no coincidences. At some point the largest spike and drop happened at the same time for GME, AMC, and BB. I didn't look at others, but this makes me think that there are forces at play that we don't understand."
2021-06-02 18:50:35,wallstreetbets,"AMC was our much loved combo of Fomo + Gamma today. But I don’t believe the other stonks had the same. If anything, I would have expected dips on RKT and BB as apes freed up cash to throw at AMC."

2021-06-02 19:06:44,wallstreetbets,"They have to pay interest on the shares they borrowed, as time goes on they're paying more interest so they want to close the positions asap, the hope is that they can't sustain the losses from the interest payments anymore so they fold, buy back all the shares at a higher price which causes the price to go even higher and then we can start selling"
2021-06-02 18:54:45,wallstreetbets,"I’m as clueless as you brother ape. I expect HF to sell safe stocks to cover interest and margin. I think of it as a forced rotation of capital in the market. But if they are overextended (which we all know they are), then they may also be scrambling to reduce their overall short exposure on positions that are not as bloody as AMC or our neighborhood video game store."
2021-06-02 19:10:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes, eventually they have to cover. That’s what short interest is. They are “charged” interest for their positions. Eventually if those positions become too great (because they load up more) or if the interest increases, then sec comes knocking for a margin call. In which case, they must hand over the shares, if they don’t have them, they are required to liquidate assets and buy the shares at market price, which squeezes further."

2021-06-02 19:32:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey, is CLOV really the at tommorow? Should I jump on at opening. I have $4000 to spend"
2021-06-02 18:56:40,wallstreetbets,You tell me.
2021-06-02 19:10:16,wallstreetbets,How shorted are they?
2021-06-02 19:10:04,wallstreetbets,How shorted are we talking?
2021-06-02 19:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Let me explain how fucking costly shorting is.

I shorted SPCE after their recent test flight. I predicted that the flight success would cause a spike, and then it'd tank back down as everyone took profits and realised SPCE is still fucking garbage.

I opened two (very cheap) positions, because I'm acutely aware of infinity losses when shorting.

I opened my short positions when SPCE was as $23.94 and $24.10 on May 24th.

It was a set of 10 contracts on each price shorted through CFD means. If you don't know what i'm talking about, all you need to know is that I bet with my broker that SPCE would drop below these prices. I only went small, my initial outlay was around £15 on each set of contracts, on a 1:5 leverage. (my maths might be a tiny bit off, I deleted this play from my brain because it hurt but the detail still stands)

This cost me about £30 to enter these positons. Again, all you need to understand is that I basically 'bet' £30 that SPCE would drop.

The first day it dropped, then it fucking climbed.

In just 4 days, I got called by Marge. The SPCE price had gone from my $24 short positions to around $33. So, an increase of just 35% caused me to get Margin Called. I closed the positions at a huge loss.

This £30 short position cost me £74 and £72 respectively in the space of 4 days.

So, I throw £30 in, and in 4 days I suddenly lose £140, on a 30% stock movement, and I got margin called meaning I had zero chance of recovering those losses unless I put more money in the account....

Now imagine what happens, when a hedge fund, operating on a much greater leverage than a retard like me with a broker, and this hedge fund has put 30 million dollars in. And the stock has risen by 105% in a single fucking day.... You begin to realise why ""holding the line"" is so expensive, it's almost fucking impossible.

Edit - Also, i'm in a better position because i'm CFD shorting. Which means i'm just betting on the price without trading the stock. Actual shorters have to go into the market and buy the stock back, plus they pay a much high interest rate daily than I do, so they have it even tougher than me.

This is all very quick and basic, but basically - shorting a mooning stock is expensive as fuck."

2021-06-02 19:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Some of the bigger players have already gotten out. If you look at the holdings that Citadel had, the had stakes in Jumia and Airbnb. For the past 2-3 months, like clockwork, whenever those two stocks would rise, the meme stocks would have a red day and vice versa. I know it’s a very small piece of info to go off of, but it was so consistent that I looked into it weekly. During this AMC rally, Citadel’s holding have been green on the same day as the meme stocks. To me this indicates that at least for them and possibly a few others, they are out of the short position. The remaining shorts are on their own and Robinhood won’t save them this time."

2021-06-02 19:19:08,wallstreetbets,Not really how a game squeeze works though. I'm sure all MMs have covered their calls already - they're not going to wait till Friday. The new options will likely be covered by 80% if not more. We need to keep buying to make them buy the other 20%
2021-06-02 19:29:46,wallstreetbets,Why is BB so cheap to short? The borrow rate is lower than my savings account!
2021-06-02 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,"It's potentially the only real option you have.

You either cough up and get out of the stock, costing you a fortune, or double down and hope it all works out and you can save it.

Imagine playing poker. Half of your money is in the pot. You have a shit hand. You can fold and lose half your money, which will put you out of the game for a long time.

Or you can double down. The problem is, your hand is fucking weak, so you need to pray your opponent has an even shitter hand than yours. If he decides to fold, you win, but it's unlikely. Firstly, he's retarded and secondly, he only knows how to make more and more bets. He doesn't know the meaning of folding. And he eats crayons.

It's further complicated by the fact that the shorts might not be able to 'quit' and take their losses, if they made a load of bullshit fake shares as the thesis suggests.

Lets use the poker analogy, you wanna fold your hand and take the loss. Except the dealer is gonna inspect your chips before you walk away from the table, and he's gonna realise half of the chips you put in aren't the casino chips, you made them in your fucking garage. The casino are gonna kick your ass and they become worthless.

it's not the best analogy, but to prevent the cashier seeing the dodgy chips, you might have to go all in on the double down, hoping your opponent has that shit hand, and you can get enough real chips back to fool everyone. 

Meanwhile, in the security room, Papa Cohen is sat watching you on CCTV and knows exactly when he's gonna kick you out."

BB is cheaper though so the opportunity is higher because obviously you can buy more shares. I redistributed a few shares of AMC to buy more BB.
2021-06-02 18:45:36,wallstreetbets,And just for tomorrow?
2021-06-02 18:55:06,wallstreetbets,IMO AMC is flying to the next universe... i think maybe tomorrow or friday is the fuel of the rocket empty. BB rocket is ready to start tomorrow. The question is: just for a short short term 24 - max. 48 hours. Which rocket will go further by distance
2021-06-02 18:46:51,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow I think BB is going to hit ~23-24 per share, and I honestly have no clue how AMC is going to shake out tomorrow, probably huge buys and dips both ways."
2021-06-02 19:49:12,wallstreetbets,Gonna buy 5 $14c in the morning but dame it was 200 earlier and it up to 500
2021-06-02 18:20:28,wallstreetbets,I bought some around $37 and plan on buying much more... people need to jump on this stock ASAP
2021-06-02 18:27:42,wallstreetbets,It's a very good stock at a very good price. The problem is there’s several hot plays in the market for it to get attention.
2021-06-02 18:38:39,wallstreetbets,Since you put so much effort into all that gibberish I felt I owed it to you to buy some. I should learn to read so I don’t have to rely on smooth brained apes.
2021-06-02 18:56:30,wallstreetbets,"I find it crazy that it didn't bounce back quicker. Ok, so Archegos probably inflated the stock price a bit much due to being leveraged up to their eyeballs but there's no way it should still be down around $40."
2021-06-02 18:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Ok but on a serious note, can anyone tell me why it isn't worth a minimum of $70B? MGM just sold to Amazon, a mini major for 8.5B. Quick wiki search shows Viac with a 8x market share over MGM. That being said, I feel like at a very paper napkin math level, $70B is not wild. MGM looks to have a D/E of 2, and Viac looks to be sub 1. To me, if you're looking at just pricing of this as an acquisition play, the valuation of Viac went skywayrd with the MGM price. 

On top of what you get in buying Viac when compared to MGM, you actually get their streaming service too. Better yet, if an existing streaming service buys them, you get one LESS competitor, which is almost more valuable than a new guy entering this space of 20 streaming services. 

Idk call me crazy but I feel a 2-3x is likely. But know this is only valid if the streaming company valuations hold water  I for one thing Netflix and Disney's valuation is stupid (and MGM for that matter).

 Granted I did a very shallow dive into available data, so wtf do I really know."
2021-06-02 18:46:37,wallstreetbets,I agree and have been loading up.
2021-06-02 19:20:07,wallstreetbets,$42 —-> $120 by next earnings when its numbers go even further into the undervalued.  Also I think Shari might bid to take it private.  She’s buddies with owners of enterprise rent a car bet those conversations about not having to deal pesky peasant shareholders comes up.
2021-06-02 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,Also on VIAC waiting for it to 🚀🚀
2021-06-02 18:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Value? You must be lost friend, this is wsb. Land of infinite multiples and permabull runs."

2021-06-02 19:52:44,wallstreetbets,The hell is wrong with you? Talking all that English. Your shits all tarded or somethin?
2021-06-02 18:58:55,wallstreetbets,Market is irrational on the way up and the way down.  Billys margin call that sent the stock for 95 to 38 in a couple of days left some giant skid marks.  It will recover as shares go to strong handsz
2021-06-02 18:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  This one will moon.  Only a matter of time, too much going for it, just needed the stench of the Archegos margin call to fade away.  Just about there I think."
2021-06-02 18:35:41,wallstreetbets,"But imagine getting into before it goes infinite!  Pennies for OTM calls on this puppy.  I was looking at AMC calls, christ  $30 for $70 strike!"
2021-06-02 19:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Billy Hwang went YOLO, built a massive position in the billions, then he got margined called after  his stocks got hit.  Goldman and Morgan Stanley among others liquidated all his shares.  Bloodbath."
2021-06-02 19:12:38,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been sitting on it, sitting with a $45 average, I was thinking it would have a bounce after it dropped so hard. Ready to finally be back in the green"
2021-06-02 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,Buddy I'm just fucking with you
2021-06-02 18:21:16,wallstreetbets,I cant read I am an ape. Bb to Uranus
2021-06-02 18:23:22,wallstreetbets,Why $60 when $69 is right there?!
2021-06-02 19:35:58,wallstreetbets,We have 10+ year bag holders at $100+ waiting to be picked up.
2021-06-02 18:30:20,wallstreetbets,Well done and BB retard here too.
2021-06-02 18:39:57,wallstreetbets,"I can’t read graphs or text, blackberry is literally the offspring if gme and amc had a 1 night stand. Im all in motherfuckers"
2021-06-02 18:35:46,wallstreetbets,BB to fucking 420
2021-06-02 18:22:11,wallstreetbets,It's not ridiculous to think $BB will hit $60. Wasn't $AMC like $15 not that long ago?
2021-06-02 18:32:12,wallstreetbets,I’m holding my $17 call for this Friday. Let’s get it there apes!
2021-06-02 18:22:11,wallstreetbets,BB to the MOOOON
2021-06-02 19:37:02,wallstreetbets,"People said it was obsurd and impossible for AMC to hit 50, and we blew through that PT like an F5 tornado through a trailer park. BB to 60!"
2021-06-02 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,I bought some call options (12 contracts) please dont let me dooooown! 🚀
2021-06-02 19:22:32,wallstreetbets,"If it gets there, I'll finally be able to take my wife to real restaurant rather than Taco Bell.   Go BB 🚄🚄🚄"
2021-06-02 19:21:10,wallstreetbets,"Only $60?

Pfft. It's gonna beat AMC to $1000!


BBbbbbrrrrrrr."
2021-06-02 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,I believe you are right about the 30.  Chen gets bonus tendies compensation over 30 and 10 days consecutive. It IS achievable. 🚀💎🖐
2021-06-02 19:37:02,wallstreetbets,"BB to $169

🌝🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-02 18:27:34,wallstreetbets,I thought 140 to break ATH is the target price we aiming for
2021-06-02 18:40:25,wallstreetbets,I’ll review when done with my banana
2021-06-02 18:19:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah but is this shorted with naked shorts?
2021-06-02 19:30:35,wallstreetbets,"I’m in with 3250 @ 23.50, so I hope your $60 target is correct 🚀"
2021-06-02 18:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Those boomer nerd heads don’t know shit about shit. Us tard apes are the ones coming out of the market with massive gains. Step aside grandpa, im retard ape and headed to the moon 🌙 🦧"
2021-06-02 19:39:22,wallstreetbets,If you were to invest in any of these popular stocks would it be smarter to invest as soon as the market opens to check for initial volatility or does it matter that I bought in after market closed
2021-06-02 18:19:37,wallstreetbets,"We dont do target prices here, we go till hegies hemorrhaging."
2021-06-02 18:24:34,wallstreetbets,I think you misspelled 69
2021-06-02 18:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Also, remember, Chen bought 3M worth of BB shares in May! What does he know?!"
2021-06-02 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,I got in last night for the first time. I like the way your ass is talking. Finally something with substance
2021-06-02 19:54:40,wallstreetbets,BB moon
2021-06-02 19:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Looks retarded, but im also retarded so therefore I’m all in, bb 🚀"
2021-06-02 19:07:52,wallstreetbets,Also been in $BB since before the meme bullshit. Got in with 1000 shares at $6.93 my price target for EOY was $15-$20. Long term was $50-$70. Once EVs become more of the norm $BB will skyrocket. This isn’t just a short term squeeze play. It’s actually far from it
2021-06-02 18:30:18,wallstreetbets,Please get rid of your middle school valuation model and start acting like an ape. The « buy and hold » model is the way. So use the money your uncle gave you for your holy communion and start buying.
2021-06-02 18:41:28,wallstreetbets,What is the better move just for tomorrow? AMC or BB?
2021-06-02 18:26:58,wallstreetbets,Why $60 when $69 is there also
2021-06-02 19:17:16,wallstreetbets,Anyone wanna recommend an options call for open tomorrow?
2021-06-02 19:14:40,wallstreetbets,I’m finally positive on BB as of today I was holding heavy bags at $14.50
2021-06-02 19:16:25,wallstreetbets,Won’t this make it a dingleberry?
2021-06-02 19:23:05,wallstreetbets,Pp to Urectum
2021-06-02 18:27:38,wallstreetbets,Nice dd
2021-06-02 19:23:12,wallstreetbets,Why $69 when $69.420 is right there?  Gotta squeeze every penny my friend.
2021-06-02 18:43:01,wallstreetbets,Gg kid
2021-06-02 18:56:22,wallstreetbets,Rekt
2021-06-02 19:21:18,wallstreetbets,Fuck it why not
2021-06-02 18:25:26,wallstreetbets,"Right, but my point is also that AMC is probably the highest-priced movie theatre chain in the world at this point, as a multiple of earnings. Whereas BB, despite the run-up is still UNDERPRICED compared to other cybersecurity / endpoint security businesses. Which is ridiculous given its product was one of the few that would hav eprotected against the recent pipeline hacks, etc. So while I'm not sure what will happen in the next few days, I have a pretty damn good feeling about the long -term."
2021-06-02 18:26:28,wallstreetbets,Yes. Last Tuesday it was $15.
2021-06-02 18:29:23,wallstreetbets,"You mean, last Tuesday?"
2021-06-02 19:51:18,wallstreetbets,"BB is a gamma squeeze mostly WHICH is GOOD

IT CAN ACHIEVE THE MOON."
2021-06-02 18:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes - I'm not a technicl trader but latest data shows increase in shorts because a lot of people think this runup is unsustainable. They might be right in the short term as paper hands collect profit, but for us long-term $BB believers we're the most fundamentals focused group and think with LEAPS and shares this is about as safe as a meme stock gets, with the potential for short-term run-up"
2021-06-02 18:55:22,wallstreetbets,Fuck you it’s at least remedial high school level analysis
2021-06-02 18:47:50,wallstreetbets,for dem holy gainz!!!!!!!!!!!

2021-06-02 19:30:09,wallstreetbets,Holding over 4k shares at $17.62. Ready for extraction.

2021-06-02 18:32:23,wallstreetbets,Very true.
2021-06-02 18:31:17,wallstreetbets,"Fuck! it feels like it was forever ago. Sorry, I’ve been staring at a screen since the morning"
2021-06-02 19:51:26,wallstreetbets,GTFO with that shit. I was still losing money on long positions in microvision last Tuesday don't remind me I could have put 5000 in AMC at that time which would now be worth almost $25000
2021-06-02 18:40:36,wallstreetbets,Not just shorted …. but shorted with stocks that don’t exist aka naked shorts 🩳…. Also i am a idiot
2021-06-02 19:50:46,wallstreetbets,ha! Thanks for making me chuckle with this comment
2021-06-02 19:14:41,wallstreetbets,I think BB has more legs
2021-06-02 19:23:28,wallstreetbets,We will see tomorrow... wish us good luck bro lets make it to the moon moon wether with AMC or BB
2021-06-02 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,"Quick question: If you guys are super bullish on AMC and had $5000 lying around, would you spend it on buying the stocks or buying the options?"

2021-06-02 19:31:47,wallstreetbets,no 18 year old has the ability to save 15k no matter how much they work. unless theyre overpaid by daddys business or inherit it.
2021-06-02 18:40:01,wallstreetbets,Because they were born about 18 years ago
2021-06-02 19:32:13,wallstreetbets,rich parents or overpaid job in family biz. otherwise its simply not possible

2021-06-02 18:55:44,wallstreetbets,I like bb better fundamentals and long term potential
2021-06-02 19:14:47,wallstreetbets,"BB is actually a solid company with a good product.  AMC is the definition of a meme stock.  That being said,  I really wish I would have bought into AMC a month ago.  Had 100 share buy order lined up with a $9 limit price and it never quite got down to 9 and my order never executed."
2021-06-02 19:35:43,wallstreetbets,BB for sure. Less room to fall (less downside) and much more growth potential given its solid fundamentals and having not yet reached its ATH.
2021-06-02 18:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Personally, BB since it has more room to run IMO BUT that doesnt mean AMC cant continue its moon mission either :)"
2021-06-02 19:35:14,wallstreetbets,BB all day
2021-06-02 18:19:44,wallstreetbets,Just 100% ? Here’s a downvote for posting rookie numbers
2021-06-02 18:56:50,wallstreetbets,You could say I’m bullish

2021-06-02 18:41:32,wallstreetbets,It may be a battle around there since it will be near ATH.

2021-06-02 19:42:46,wallstreetbets,That doesn't solve the problem.  I can't sell the shares and take profit. I'd be fine if the expiry was this Friday.  Then they'd get called away @ 15 and I would have 100% gain.  No way BB is going to hold 15 until December.
2021-06-02 19:33:44,wallstreetbets,This is the way :)

2021-06-02 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,Some of you will still be saying the Horse and RIDE are fake companies when they hit 50+. Never understood the hate. Just regurgitated Hindenburg.  IMHO.
2021-06-02 19:10:31,wallstreetbets,Gang WKHS owns a 10% non dilutive stake in Lordstown Motors / RIDE and they just partnered with JB Poindexter. Morgan Olson is under JB Poindexter’s umbrella. Morgan built USPS’s LLV. They’re also partnered with Pride Group and Duke Energy. IMO ARK sold because of operational shorting. Here’s a video on what that means. Just look at ARKQ’s FTD’s. I put it together learning about GME. I’ve followed WKHS and RIDE for a long time. This is not a shit company. [operational shorting ](https://youtu.be/ncq35zrFCAg)
2021-06-02 18:59:58,wallstreetbets,To the moon!
2021-06-02 19:51:05,wallstreetbets,I'm in 👍
2021-06-02 19:35:40,wallstreetbets,Adding every chance I get. If it gets the volume AMC had today it could easily surpass GME share price. Hold me to it
2021-06-02 19:24:51,wallstreetbets,"One more thing WKHS is still under a NDA with USPS. Why is that... If the USPS wants 75% EV’s and they needed trucks 15 years ago where are they going to get them? Not Oshkosh. 
From LMC. The Endurance and the WKHS NGDV are built on the same skateboard. Coincidence..

To some of the others, please don't give a one-word or one-sentence reasoning to your opinion.  I'd like to know the logic of why you would disagree.  I really think this is an opportunity for all of us to get in at the ground level.  Let me know why I'm wrong.  Let's keep the discussion going."
2021-06-02 18:34:49,wallstreetbets,Ark sold all their WKHS recently.
2021-06-02 18:20:21,wallstreetbets,"Everyone thinks EV is the next big thing..... just remember,  automotive is already a market and a new technology doesn't make a company more valuable than existing ones. Cars are already a product and EV companies just enter into a crowded space to sell a car. They need to have more in sales than existing companies to be more valuable than them.  Everyone acts like TSLA valuation is the ""norm."" 

Honestly,  if you picture buying a car or truck in the future and deciding between a workhorse, Lordstown, nio, Romeo, or lucid.... you're nuts.

The reality is that batteries may be a future for the automotive business,  but the dollars and cents that the manufacturers take to the bank at the end of the day aren't going to be any more than the existing ICE concept. The market realized this when they all ran up and corrected for it."
2021-06-02 18:13:43,wallstreetbets,"$WKHS is highly shorted because it's a scam company. 

They're a truck company that doesn't make trucks

Their CEO is a con artist who fed investors a story about a massive contract that they had no chance of winning and couldn't meet even if they did win it."
2021-06-02 18:21:02,wallstreetbets,Scam go buy BB
2021-06-02 18:16:00,wallstreetbets,I saw a post saying that CLOV is gaining stream
2021-06-02 18:25:01,wallstreetbets,"After BB, sure."
2021-06-02 18:16:19,wallstreetbets,Short answer....NO!!! 😂😂😂
2021-06-02 18:41:34,wallstreetbets,Nah dude. wkhs is a crap company and a scam lol
2021-06-02 19:26:39,wallstreetbets,No.
2021-06-02 19:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Why buy when Bb is safer and similar price, all in Bb"
2021-06-02 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,Have you ever even driven a truck before? Parked out in the middle of nowhere and have to idle your truck from either freezing or overheating to death? Unless this comes self charging the only place this would possibly work is LTL. It would cost hundreds and hundreds of millions to place charging stations in places where drivers sleep or deliver to. Many times that’s out in the middle of nowhere. Completely unrealistic idea for an average OTR trucking company.
2021-06-02 18:40:26,wallstreetbets,How about..... AMC or GME?? Just a thought🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-02 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,WKHS?
2021-06-02 19:56:35,wallstreetbets,Which is a good thing. She has a target on her back. The Horse ain’t got time for her.
2021-06-02 19:01:51,wallstreetbets,The did it because of operational shorting. She had to.
2021-06-02 18:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Not all, only part of it.  They still hold millions."
2021-06-02 18:55:22,wallstreetbets,"I disagree.. they are not just automotive companies (Lucid + Tesla) these are companies going into energy also, and any other related field.. they are not solely focussing on building a car like a generic ice manufacturer.. they are much more (powerwalls, solar, Autonomous driving etc) much more!"
2021-06-02 19:46:30,wallstreetbets,You are missing the point.  It is a short squeeze....
2021-06-02 19:16:29,wallstreetbets,That’s not true.
2021-06-02 19:27:36,wallstreetbets,"No scam, but I’m buying the shit out of BB"
2021-06-02 18:19:13,wallstreetbets,Clov is the way
2021-06-02 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,Why?  Can you give the reasoning for this?
2021-06-02 18:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Why are some people saying that?  They're looking solid.  When things go bad everyone wants to blame someone.  They lost the USPS contract, it happens.  Why and how are they a scam?"
2021-06-02 19:15:51,wallstreetbets,So wrong..
2021-06-02 19:48:15,wallstreetbets,"because BB has a market cap roughly 4X WKHS' cap, which means we need 4X the money to move BB 1% than to move WKHS 1%. This means WKHS can move up 400% before reaching the same market cap as BB or AMC."
2021-06-02 19:30:16,wallstreetbets,"That’s why Amazon, FedEx and UPS uses EV’s. Lol"
2021-06-02 19:54:36,wallstreetbets,Not that kind of truck. WKHS is targeted at last mile delivery. Completely different market.
2021-06-02 19:22:13,wallstreetbets,"Did you look at their models?  They're step vans, not big rigs.  What do you think about that massive order of 6230 trucks?  

Something to consider: 

The busier routes( i.e., DC to NYC) in the US have charging stations.  Battery swapping may also be considered.  Biden will likely soon dump a lot of money into EV.  He's about to solidify a deal with the Republicans."
2021-06-02 18:42:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for these positions and have made gains from both.  However, they're too high for my liking at this time.  I like risk but not that much risk."
2021-06-02 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-02 18:54:19,wallstreetbets,"In which fund? Just checked ARKK and ARKQ holdings, none in there."
2021-06-02 19:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Actually, she sold it all. Shitidel was shorting her ETF. She had to dump it."
2021-06-02 19:15:20,wallstreetbets,They’ve been in the EV business for years. They’re just now getting up to large scale and delivering vehicles to UPS. It’s no simple task to build an EV... Workhorse vehicles have thousands of miles on them. Plus they’ve got the patent for drone delivery from a moving vehicle.
2021-06-02 19:01:08,wallstreetbets,"But energy is another existing market.  For example,  generac has a much nicer power cell option than tesla. My neighbor got the tesla and it took 3 batteries for what 1 power cell could do. I've shopped both myself,  and gnrc would be my only consideration when I pull the trigger.  Autonomous driving already exists with companies like cruise (gm) etc. At the end of the day,  maybe some get hyped about a movement in energy and automotive.... but if you're level headed,  as an investor it doesn't mean more profits or sales.  Dollars and cents are what get taken to the bank."
2021-06-02 19:49:42,wallstreetbets,"That's right,  everything has to be a short squeeze nowadays"
2021-06-02 19:28:12,wallstreetbets,It is completely true
2021-06-02 18:21:52,wallstreetbets,I bought a bag earlier today. Now just waiting for Lambo
2021-06-02 19:08:19,wallstreetbets,There are better shorted names like $ATER
2021-06-02 19:27:37,wallstreetbets, Looks up the amount of contracts they got versus the amount of cars (trucks) they produced and you will see why they are a scam... I almost fell for it too... no way they could have delivered on that USPS contract even if they got it
2021-06-02 19:38:57,wallstreetbets,They lost their huge government contract to Oshkosh Truck
2021-06-02 19:44:53,wallstreetbets, That many synthetic huh.. maybe.
2021-06-02 19:21:43,wallstreetbets,"She had it in ARKQ and some in ARKX. 
She dumped it because the scumbags shorting the shit out of her ETF using a little known method called operation shorting. I’ve got no doubt that’s why she did it. [operational shorting ](https://youtu.be/ncq35zrFCAg)"
2021-06-02 19:08:36,wallstreetbets,"They might have sold the rest.  You might be right, sorry.  Nonetheless, the stock is increasing quickly and did well today during and after the market.  You have to admit, there's a good chance that this stock can take off."
2021-06-02 19:47:19,wallstreetbets,I love when you guys say Shitidel.  LMFAO!!!
2021-06-02 19:14:19,wallstreetbets,The reason why there's a lot of hype is cause there will be a mandatory transition from ICE to EV WORLDWIDE.. now the companies with the best manufacturing processes and technology will absolutely kill it.. look at the prices of these EVs they ain't priced cheap that's for sure and if it becomes mandatory.. money will get printed!
2021-06-02 19:51:36,wallstreetbets,Up 19% today and now 16% after hours.  Yes it's a short squeeze
2021-06-02 19:43:18,wallstreetbets,It’s up 36%. Let’s go guys
2021-06-02 19:34:41,wallstreetbets,"To be mass produced at Lordstown.

You may be right but I don't see the number of contracts they received as a scam.  I see it as a promising future."
2021-06-02 19:20:26,wallstreetbets,"Ok let's say there is.  Do you think an EV company will sell and make more money than Toyota does? They cost more retail,  because they cost more to make.  It doesn't make them more profitable. The existing automotive companies will adapt and stay king. Period.

Everyone is just looking for the next TSLA, but there won't be one."

2021-06-02 18:51:39,wallstreetbets,"My next position is going to be more calls on ASO (already have almost 2,000 contracts). AMC was fun but I don't want to be holding it when the music stops. I know some of you are fine doing that and I'll say you have bigger balls than me. I may still dabble but it will be in shares with stop losses. How high will it go? Nobody knows. For me ASO is a safe bet and I believe it has a lot of potential upside especially with earnings coming up. I'm not willing to lose my gains, especially after I've already realized them knowing it is always the hardest part of a trade. 

I wish all of you the best of luck and might get downvoted for this, but please cover your initial investment +10%. Unrealized gains turn into realized losses if you don't manage your risk properly. Good luck and I hope you all hit your goal.

Edit 1: I am getting a lot of PM's about my next plays. Well folks, if you look through my post history, you'll see I'm following the same one's I have been talking about for weeks. I made a long post about both ASO and CLNE awhile back and it didn't get much traction. I did just see that u/BlackDiamondBear made an incredibly appealing post about CLNE that is getting attention so I am linking that below for your own enjoyment!

I guess in the end it’s not too bad. Still rich, unless you spend it all before tax season."
2021-06-02 18:21:21,wallstreetbets,Depends on this guys tax bracket. I'm thinking around 22% That capital gains tax is a real bitch

Same with CLNE. Although with CLNE, I love what they do and it's benefit to the world. Not as convinced on their revenue or leadership, but I was a truck driver before and would love to see my investment help shift the industry away from diesel."

2021-06-02 19:31:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s short terms capital gains though- I think he’s going to get taxed at his income bracket, which is also the highest possible due to making $450K. Let’s not forget state income tax if he lives in one with it."
2021-06-02 19:36:36,wallstreetbets,"looking at the above tickers as well, especially ASO. You doing any calls? if so, what positions? im thinking 7/18 40c"
2021-06-02 18:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Any gains you make over a certain amount (I believe it’s $600 but it may have been raised in the last year or so), you pay taxes on, even if you spend it to invest more (aka you never use the money to buy that lambo).

It’s the bad part about short selling and day trading. It’s also why people are encouraged to start practicing and writing everything down. That way you keep better track of what you’re doing and can put money aside. 

As long as he knows which bracket he’s in and saves the percentage he’s going to owe, he will be fine though. It’s just being careful. It’s a felony if the IRS catches you, and they do random checks each year during tax time. Don’t risk it."

Edit:

Taken from turbotax on gains and losses


Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.

For example,

If you have $2,000 of short-term loss and only $1,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one).
If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income.
Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income.
If you use married filing separate filing status, however, the annual net capital loss deduction limit is only $1,500."

2021-06-02 18:27:36,wallstreetbets,I'm still trying to understand how to sell options for profit. Does one sell the contract or wait for expiration with gains like this?
2021-06-02 18:29:33,wallstreetbets,Ngl seeing all these people printing money with options is making me wish I was retarded enough to understand what the fucks going on
2021-06-02 18:30:02,wallstreetbets,Lmao

2021-06-02 18:37:26,wallstreetbets, Still worth it tomorrow?
2021-06-02 18:41:21,wallstreetbets,It all depends on how it opens. I believe this goes above $20... But will be selling calls against my leaps until it does.
2021-06-02 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,GANG!! GANG!!
2021-06-02 19:51:54,wallstreetbets,This aint a yolo

2021-06-02 18:10:52,wallstreetbets,Close it. Take profits and move on
2021-06-02 18:19:49,wallstreetbets,Why would they do that

2021-06-02 19:18:08,wallstreetbets,Lol I yolod today in Corsair. Got 6% return. Tbh I've done the match and seen that Corsair has the potential to go 5x. They are undervalued for the growth!
2021-06-02 18:16:15,wallstreetbets,"My favorite quote for any stock I am (bag)holding is ""very undervalued, might buy more!"""
2021-06-02 18:25:44,wallstreetbets,Sell 4 contracts let the rest ride.
2021-06-02 18:08:00,wallstreetbets,Yikes this will be close!

2021-06-02 18:55:27,wallstreetbets,About to squeeze or is squeezing? Today was the second highest volume of 2022.

2021-06-02 18:08:07,wallstreetbets,Every time I hear someone here say “I made it to 6 figures let me take it to 7” it ends on loss porn
2021-06-02 18:08:51,wallstreetbets,Bro take it from some random stranger and sell at least half. You won. That money will allow you take do this again if things go bad.
2021-06-02 18:05:52,wallstreetbets,This 23 year old says fuck you 😂 but awesome!
2021-06-02 18:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Fuck no. You're 18. Take that all out and put it into a safe investment, You'll be LIGHTYEARS ahead of the rest of us."
2021-06-02 18:19:09,wallstreetbets,"This may be your only opportunity to get a huge head start, sell that shit and make bank in reliable investments."
2021-06-02 18:30:26,wallstreetbets,Damn.  All I had in my hands when I was 18 was my dick and a beer.
2021-06-02 18:03:17,wallstreetbets,Take half out
2021-06-02 18:08:46,wallstreetbets,Sell and invest in something more low key. Keep it there until you’re ready to buy your forever home and live without a mortgage payment.
2021-06-02 18:05:38,wallstreetbets,Take all out.  I made and lost $100k two weeks ago on options.  Wish I had listened to my brother and sold.  You always think about being a millionaire.  Think about having $0.  Can happen quick
2021-06-02 18:05:57,wallstreetbets,nice. i can’t help but hate you at your age.
2021-06-02 18:17:22,wallstreetbets,Are you in college/planning to go? Take half so you don't have student loan debt.
2021-06-02 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,Cash out and put 75% into dividend stocks.... You'll be laughing in your 30s
2021-06-02 18:05:19,wallstreetbets,"Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. Today was a great day for AMC, but don't get complacent. Take profits on at least part of it."
2021-06-02 18:13:52,wallstreetbets,Someone explain options to me like I am 5 years old.
2021-06-02 18:51:08,wallstreetbets,Cocaine and hookers don’t buy themselves. Take that money and die in some hotel in Vegas. Super jealous of course you lucky bastard.

2021-06-02 18:10:26,wallstreetbets,Off 32 contracts? Seven figures? Probably not. It’s not a bad idea to take profits. That’s a fantastic return.
2021-06-02 18:04:25,wallstreetbets,You can sell the contracts of course but if you HODL shares keep those. I'm not a financial advisor
2021-06-02 18:11:51,wallstreetbets,"The problem with this is that most people don’t respect the unrealistic number and PERCENTAGE infront of them and think it’s normal and goes on forever. Count your blessings and cash in. Use that jump start and put some cash in solid…. a solid INVESTMENT. 
Learn about other asset classes (like real estate) and put some cash in there too. Or be “diamond handed” and watch it all burn infront of you. One thing is a fact. Like history has showed. What happens after a short squeeze ? 

Figure it out"
2021-06-02 18:15:31,wallstreetbets,Not advise. But if you have to ask the answer is yes.
2021-06-02 18:41:42,wallstreetbets,If your asking WSB time to sell homie make that life changing money and move on to the next play
2021-06-02 18:12:30,wallstreetbets,Take half out put the rest into something else
2021-06-02 18:04:07,wallstreetbets,Make it 8 :-)
2021-06-02 18:19:23,wallstreetbets,We haven’t even squeezed.  If your worried wait till they start buying back

2021-06-02 19:44:40,wallstreetbets,Oh well... I’m young so this is just play money... right? 😅
2021-06-02 19:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. OP, cash out and put it all towards XEQT or something and you'll retire in 10-15 with a >50% savings rate.

Skip college, pick up a trade, retire at 30 with an outrageous pension that you don't even need due to investment returns."
2021-06-02 19:01:19,wallstreetbets,"LOL.  I'm guessing when you was 18, much like myself, you didn't have the ability to trade Options on your phone.  The negative of growing up in the dark ages."
2021-06-02 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,I didn't have a brew :/
2021-06-02 18:04:53,wallstreetbets,Agreed. That can really help you long term to have now. Or sell the whole thing. And movenon to the next trade!

2021-06-02 18:05:09,wallstreetbets,So you beleive BB is going to continue to go up enough to justify putting 350k into it?  I own a bunch of BB but I also know there's nothing to justify this valuation even at current levels.
2021-06-02 18:07:30,wallstreetbets,You're already down and if AMC goes down even a little bit tomorrow. BB will be under 14 and fast

2021-06-02 18:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Welcome brother 🙏, let’s make these shorts pay"
2021-06-02 18:12:52,wallstreetbets,Nice move. I somewhat fucked myself. In my Ira I own 1000 shares at a average of $11 sold 10 covered calls strike $40 for 2500 about 4 weeks ago. Those options are now worth 50k lmao. The good news is if someone exercises it I'll still make 30k profit. Bad news is that if I didn't do that I could have sold for 65k profit. If this shit goes up and buying to close ends up while selling nets me more than the 30k I'll do that too.
2021-06-02 18:16:43,wallstreetbets,Teach me the ways!
2021-06-02 18:27:45,wallstreetbets,Smart monkey!!
2021-06-02 18:01:56,wallstreetbets,Damn some beautiful earnings here lol ! I cashed out on my 5 shares today (newbie beginner ape here)... but will wait for a bit of drop and reinvest the money !
2021-06-02 19:31:55,wallstreetbets,Risk level: Safe... thanks webull for supporting us retards
2021-06-02 19:24:38,wallstreetbets,Nice play!
2021-06-02 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,lol why would anyone ever hold AMC?
2021-06-02 18:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I had to wait 5 days for the money to wire from my bank to my brokers app (like most do), But if i got the money a day earlier i would have averaged down at a better price and doubled my profit easy. Damn transfer waiting periods."
2021-06-02 18:04:30,wallstreetbets,"Ape strong together HODL, make these hedgies pay!"
2021-06-02 18:16:48,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to hear that, it’s the nature of the beast. As shitty as it is i just keep thinking “i want a piece of the mountain, not the peak.” The peak would be perfect of course, but green is green and AMC is still gonna juice baby! Let’s get it!"
2021-06-02 18:22:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s also entirely possible that those calls aren’t exercised. Most puts ITM are exercised, but a lot of calls aren’t. Regardless, tax advantaged profit is good."
2021-06-02 18:22:34,wallstreetbets,"I just make memes and read reddit all day, i got super lucky, but also made a conscious decision based off a collective of apes. If you can navigate reddit and all it’s subs then you have all the info you need. Research is money."

2021-06-02 18:11:35,wallstreetbets,“Cashed out” means you’re definitely not an ape good bye
2021-06-02 18:17:03,wallstreetbets,There will be no drops

2021-06-02 19:30:20,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud!
2021-06-02 18:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro thanks For confirming that off about $1500 you had potential earnings of about 100,000 USD… honestly good job even though I’m usually shitting on the certain movie stock.. if you see a homeless guy buy him a combo meal! The karma will keep coming round. Take care, guy!"
2021-06-02 18:18:03,wallstreetbets,HOLD THE LINE MEN/WOMEN
2021-06-02 18:19:08,wallstreetbets,I mean for me I should still profit I don't mind if I'm not cashing out at the top. I hedged my bets buying 10 puts 20$ strike for July incase the bottom falls out. If it goes back to earth I'll be able to sell the puts to make that cash back. If it stays high I'll profit more from holding then selling.
2021-06-02 18:28:31,wallstreetbets,Right on my friend! Props on the gains and thanks for the info! Apes like us bud!
2021-06-02 19:19:36,wallstreetbets,By friday!
2021-06-02 18:06:16,wallstreetbets,True! Although the trading app I use put a block and only closing trades are allowed lol ! Will see what the situation is like and might buy 5 or so shares again !
2021-06-02 18:13:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m ape in learning ... didn’t expect it to go higher so thought it’d be like few days ago , where it reached $40 and then went down to $20s .... was gonna buy more shares with the money I took out :)"
2021-06-02 19:34:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah i moved all my funds from robinhood and vanguard into webull because the desktop platform is just so fucking golden. Literally cant think of much information that it doesnt give you
2021-06-02 18:20:36,wallstreetbets,"I was homeless 2 years ago, I understand the struggle of sleeping behind a dumpster, and i will definitely spread the love. This is a movement and every ape involved will experience the shift, the revolution. ITS BEGINNING! ITS REAL EVERYONE!"

2021-06-02 18:09:50,wallstreetbets,Trading212. I’m yet to research what other apps are good for stuff - this is one that I loaded £100 into just for a bit of good fashioned fun and see what I can learn/do with it
2021-06-02 18:10:10,wallstreetbets,Definitely! Gotta start small!

If the price of the stock supercedes his strike price of $40, to let's say $80 to make the math easier; He'll have the total right, but not the obligation to buy into the company no matter what @ $40 bucks per share. 

Price of the stock currently trades at 33 bucks per share. Instead of paying 3,300 bucks to own 100 shares, he paid $310 dollars for the option (which is like having 100 shares without having to shell out the capital for 100 shares). That's a 90% discount right there if you ask me."

2021-06-02 17:12:13,wallstreetbets,"OP your point about the risks of IV collapsing in the next couple of days is valid, but fails to recognize opportunities in the here and now. 

If you hold weekly calls overnight anything can happen, however, consider the following: I day traded AMC weeklies (73C) between 12-1pm (EST) today and made 30k in less than one hour. I certainly was not worried about IV collapsing during that short period of time.

I bought only OTM weeklies for 6/4 and 6/11 mostly with a little bit on 6/18.

I do agree the IV is going crazy, but I got in at a much lower IV today, some of my OTM calls that cost me less than a dollar per contract are up over 3 bucks now (6/18 25c is 3.02)

I’d say currently you’re correct it’s too late for options as you can get hurt really bad with calls right now, but for the future you should always consider options when buying shares having both is good."

2021-06-02 18:09:18,wallstreetbets,It means you should remove yourself from the group. Unless safer is a synonym for HODL.
2021-06-02 17:03:28,wallstreetbets,Nah sex work is cool and would probably also help some dudes who will never get laid get over that
2021-06-02 16:57:31,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying you’ve never had sex? Because you’re paying for it one way or another.
2021-06-02 16:56:55,wallstreetbets,Oh i dont know it could be worth it.
2021-06-02 19:55:10,wallstreetbets,how so?
2021-06-02 17:15:33,wallstreetbets,Was a hypothetical in this case
2021-06-02 19:21:52,wallstreetbets,"Imagine buying the stock for $65, then selling a 70c for $2500.. so even if it goes over 70, you still make $30 per share"
2021-06-02 19:36:30,wallstreetbets,"Premarket and aftermarket trading is a thing, but not everyone has access to it."
2021-06-02 17:48:55,wallstreetbets,If Wirecard Hit's €40 I will eat my Hat 🤠
2021-06-02 17:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Trying to time the dip on these things is like trying to be a shark’s dentist... yeah you might do it right sometimes, but there’s always a massive chance you lose an arm."
2021-06-02 17:34:52,wallstreetbets,"He tried to rip off my post, not sure why. Mine was up 15 minutes earlier.."
2021-06-02 18:43:55,wallstreetbets,"Care to elaborate? IV goes down by a good percentage and then you bought calls, waited for IV to climb as stock price shoots up then sold said calls followed by a wait for IV to dip when you buy back in with more capital?

Trying to add a few more wrinkles to my smooth brain."
2021-06-02 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,Sorry about the kidney
2021-06-02 18:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Like not listening to interwebs randos without thinking first? Blasphemy!!!

Edit: seriouly, don't fucking listen to me. I'm part of the problem"
2021-06-02 19:39:12,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the service, but where are the hookers?
I specifically came here for the hookers, lol."
2021-06-02 18:29:20,wallstreetbets,">AMC 6/18 73c

So please excuse a newbie question... what does this mean?  ""6/18 73c""???"
2021-06-02 17:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Not only that but you are giving them an advance warning, so your conscience is clean. Nice."
2021-06-02 18:30:15,wallstreetbets,This is really the play. Sell options when IV is high.
2021-06-02 16:58:12,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-02 19:47:09,wallstreetbets,Hoping for a giant red day tomorrow to make back money on some cheap 6/4 puts I bought today that I lost 40% on in 4 hours.  Still up with all my GME though.
2021-06-02 18:55:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but can you explain? I've only bought, never sold."
2021-06-02 16:57:18,wallstreetbets,You don't know what DD stands for man. Come on.
2021-06-02 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 17:24:40,wallstreetbets,Yea and if you get the same hooker with those gains might even lose the other kidney.
2021-06-02 19:44:14,wallstreetbets,IV fuckery a foot. Good god the options market on AMC right now is a goddamn supernova in the making
2021-06-02 18:29:00,wallstreetbets,Time is money in the hooker market
2021-06-02 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,These are gamma squeezes. have you seen the ITM call volume?
2021-06-02 17:57:04,wallstreetbets,Not get it. Mind elaborate it?
2021-06-02 17:27:39,wallstreetbets,"I understand prostitution but I'll never get this onlyfans crap. If you're only gonna jerk it, just do it to porn for free like the rest of us"
2021-06-02 16:58:39,wallstreetbets,Oh here we go with this coping bullshit. Go buy some calls
2021-06-02 19:35:06,wallstreetbets,No way i’m paying hookers! I donate bro!
2021-06-02 18:03:10,wallstreetbets,"An arm might be a good day if you time an FD wrong.

&#x200B;

Had a steep and expensive learning curve with options so far."
2021-06-02 18:46:34,wallstreetbets,"I shopped for cheap contracts 5 strikes out last night. Had a buy order above market, but within what I was willing to gamble. Woke up today, price and IV increased which made the contracts very profitable. Sold them off in chunks. 400 -> 5500."
2021-06-02 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Sorry about the hepatitis too, it looks like you are covered with STD"
2021-06-02 18:31:23,wallstreetbets,Calls on AMC that expire on June 18th with a $73 strike price.
2021-06-02 18:35:34,wallstreetbets,"And if you bought the stock low, you can get a whole lot more selling cc"
2021-06-02 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,Selling calls and puts earns $ for the sale.  If the call or put expires out of the money you keep the $ and have no obligation.  If it expires in the money you have to buy 100 shares of stock or sell 100 shares of stock for the strike price.  Go visit the Thetagang forum and ask someone to translate optionspeak.
2021-06-02 16:58:16,wallstreetbets,Love meeee for who i am
2021-06-02 19:46:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah.. went back and sold 45p for January for a nice little chunk of change.. when IV crushes I’ll buy em back and walk away happy.
2021-06-02 18:52:15,wallstreetbets,I’ll bet you on a ban AMC won’t gamma squeeze either.
2021-06-02 18:00:21,wallstreetbets,"A call spread is when you buy a call at one strike and sell one at a different strike. Your liability is the difference in strikes. Your gain is the different in premiums of the contracts. So if the contract prices are inflated due to volatility, you’re insulating yourself by selling one as well as buying one. If they’re inflated enough, you might be able to get away with a really safe risk/reward"
2021-06-02 18:10:07,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I get paying strippers to be naked and hang out with you while you enjoy some beers and coke. 

I get paying some hooker or said stripper to fuck because in the end we pay for pussy one way or another at least the hooker is up front about the cost and commitment.

Paying to jerk off to chick's on the internet that is full of free and usually better porn I don't understand.

But I'm just some guy buying NOK calls and Ford puts. WTH do I know.

TL:DR - strippers/hooker = good - paying to jerk off = bad. NFA"
2021-06-02 18:10:17,wallstreetbets,You know some of us like to support the women we jerk off to.
2021-06-02 19:08:07,wallstreetbets,What if I'm the hooker?
2021-06-02 19:20:16,wallstreetbets,That's what your wife's boyfriend said.
2021-06-02 18:57:25,wallstreetbets,"In other words, don't buy options."
2021-06-02 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,Saw somebody who did this at $20 since they bought in early. Safe to say that they're not too happy right now.
2021-06-02 16:59:21,wallstreetbets,I'd buy puts on your DD abilities any day of the year
2021-06-02 18:03:46,wallstreetbets,Yea... so that’s fits amc. And day trade only.
2021-06-02 18:12:39,wallstreetbets,Or you could pay to get actually laid?
2021-06-02 19:41:34,wallstreetbets,Can confirm: I’m the wife’s boyfriend.
2021-06-02 19:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean, there’s risk in everything on the market. That’s called opportunity cost. The stock also wasn’t at 800% IV at $20 a share"
2021-06-02 17:00:37,wallstreetbets,I JUST SAID DONT BUY PUTS CMON MAN
2021-06-02 18:04:29,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, but if you don’t understand what you’re doing I wouldn’t recommend it"
2021-06-02 19:41:39,wallstreetbets,You can’t get an std from the internet
2021-06-02 19:49:54,wallstreetbets,You could make some $ on the IV crush by selling Puts.  If the IV ever crushes.  I thought 300% was outrageously high yesterday.  I did not know IV went this high.  I have never seen anything like this.
2021-06-02 17:00:58,wallstreetbets,Hhhhhhh
2021-06-02 18:08:18,wallstreetbets,True.
2021-06-02 16:52:47,wallstreetbets,"General. Rule of thumb is buy and HODL no matter what the price. This isn't financial advice. Just buy what you want, when you can afford it"
2021-06-02 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,Always more.
2021-06-02 16:52:24,wallstreetbets,AMC to 500
2021-06-02 17:11:46,wallstreetbets,"Once a stock bags once or twice, I like to take the original investment value out and stick it somewhere else. The rest is a free ride on the original stock and you may pick up a good opportunity somewhere else.

Totally investment advice."
2021-06-02 18:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Go for it, go all in for it. Tomorrow it will touch the $100 mark 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤑🙌🏽"
2021-06-02 17:33:04,wallstreetbets,"I just want to thank you guys for getting me the money back I lost the first time with GME, and then some. AMC you’re the real MVP! Averaged down from $15 to just under $10. I held on to that one since I figured movie theaters would reopen and averaging down was the only way *tears of joy* I want to keep holding but I too have debts to pay, need the money for Monday so today was my day to jump off the ship. Maybe next month when I can finally keep my paychecks will I join forces with you guys on another stock. I’d be willing to buy Nokia again, I mean I did sell that for GME and that was for the best! Again thank you, thank you, for not leaving me behind and hope some of you can forgive me  for not waiting to get some of our Apes with higher averages back."
2021-06-02 16:57:59,wallstreetbets,Come to BB mate
2021-06-02 16:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Not investment advice but don’t forget the short term gains tax when you sell and also think about diversifying beyond one stock, the whole eggs in one basket thing."
2021-06-02 17:02:23,wallstreetbets,Always more this is the way
2021-06-02 18:44:35,wallstreetbets,Not tomorrow you shouldn’t
2021-06-02 16:52:24,wallstreetbets,I did!! I got another xxx @45 🤪
2021-06-02 17:05:30,wallstreetbets,"If I hadn’t spent all of the usable money I had to buy BB and AMC this morning, I’d buy more now"
2021-06-02 16:58:48,wallstreetbets,"Buy more in increments of 42,069"
2021-06-02 17:01:50,wallstreetbets,I will if you will.
2021-06-02 17:13:45,wallstreetbets,Buy and Hold

2021-06-02 16:53:31,wallstreetbets,You should probably sell and then buy back in with the profits
2021-06-02 17:12:23,wallstreetbets,No! Buy low sell high. Why buy at peak price. Just hold what you have. Not a financial advise!!!!
2021-06-02 17:18:00,wallstreetbets,Id hold off on that and load up some $RYCEY
2021-06-02 17:51:15,wallstreetbets,In the midnight hour she cried more more more

2021-06-02 17:27:33,wallstreetbets,"I actually did that today. Sold 3/4ths of my position in AMC to get my original investment back plus $4k for the Mrs., and now I’m letting the rest ride free to the moon."
2021-06-02 17:47:14,wallstreetbets,Just be sure not to use unsettled funds to buy something new. Like I did today. Will get a little slap on the hand.
2021-06-02 17:37:07,wallstreetbets,Diversify 😏
2021-06-02 17:00:02,wallstreetbets,no idea what you just said. Short term? Diversify? 🦍💎🚀🌚

2021-06-02 18:03:30,wallstreetbets,"Why not leave it in, so you can give your mrs. 15k for the weekend to shop"
2021-06-02 17:58:24,wallstreetbets,"You can use unsettled funds to buy, you get in trouble when you sell before the settlement date (free riding)

IE: Sold shares on Wednesday. Settlement date is Friday. You could buy shares with profits, but can’t sell until Friday or you add money to brokerage account to cover your purchase"
2021-06-02 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,"I think it may only be a problem if you sell again while those funds are still unsettled.  But I haven't done that in forever, so I don't remember."
2021-06-02 17:37:54,wallstreetbets,AMC train has left. 1000% up this year already. Potential is bigger in bb.

2021-06-02 19:58:57,wallstreetbets,Hope he wines and dines the Mrs before she fucks him.
2021-06-02 18:07:25,wallstreetbets,"I got burned pretty bad on the tail end of GME Round 1 and CCIV, so we agreed that if it's good enough to take a screen shot, it's good enough to cash out.  That restart after the first halt triggered my stop loss at $54."
2021-06-02 17:39:20,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I mean. He should buy BB to diversify
2021-06-02 18:27:39,wallstreetbets,Win is win bro... 😁👍🏽
2021-06-02 17:40:00,wallstreetbets,You are big brains. BB!
2021-06-02 18:29:32,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  I still have 1/4th left thats pure profit.  I'm not gonna retire any time soon, but at least my vacation next month just got a nice upgrade!"
2021-06-02 18:35:56,wallstreetbets,Not a financial advisor but seems like AMC will it the 3 digits tomorrow. So if you want to reinvest....... 🚀
2021-06-02 16:45:43,wallstreetbets,I just sold ever stock I had and only kept amc. Now I got money to play with and I'm buying more shares tomorrow!!!! Keep holding!!

2021-06-02 17:43:16,wallstreetbets,This would never have been possible with a shred of this poisonous mindset
2021-06-02 17:09:41,wallstreetbets,Welp.... I'm in
2021-06-02 16:57:48,wallstreetbets,Noted…I edited my post lol.  Seriously take some damn profits please.  Pigs get fed but hogs get slaughtered
2021-06-02 17:55:03,wallstreetbets,That’s stupid…we’re in la la land at this point.  We are so far beyond the financial fundamentals it’s not even funny my friend.  But by all means hold into oblivion for your dream price and watch your ass get handed to you.  I’m a retail investor too so I’m simply urging realism.
2021-06-02 17:14:00,wallstreetbets,And non-believers eat gruel with the peasants
2021-06-02 17:56:57,wallstreetbets,But if we’re already in uncharted territory doesn’t that mean you just have a cap to your imagination? GameStop didn’t sink did it?

2021-06-02 16:49:59,wallstreetbets,"You think Mudrick thought  by selling their 8.5 M shares, it would trigger a panic sell off, and drive the price down?  Can we see if they shorted their position?"

2021-06-02 16:54:37,wallstreetbets,I can't believe you just made me unhappy about my 900% gain.

2021-06-02 16:41:30,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-02 17:08:17,wallstreetbets,"RE: the Mudrick news ... him selling the price continuing to move upwards was a catalyst in itself.  I'm betting more than $272 million was made by the AMC crowd here and you need to thank him for that.

&#x200B;

Otherwise the eventual speculation would have been that he bought the shares directly from AMC in order to close a short."
2021-06-02 16:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, That is exactly what I thought was going to start happening. I thought it was going to happen today when the stock dropped $10 in a split second. Fortunately, in this game of red rover, you can’t break the chain when the whole chain is holding on with DIAMOND HANDS!"
2021-06-02 17:16:46,wallstreetbets,The amount of petty in that response was 🔥
2021-06-02 16:31:34,wallstreetbets,Good ole WSB portfolio

2021-06-02 17:10:46,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your positive STD test!

2021-06-02 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,Remember to celebrate with your girlfriend today. Her husband will be coming home late to pay off the margin call on his shorts.
2021-06-02 17:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a Motley Fool recommendation - don't listen to him

BB to the moon for maximum disruption 🙈"
2021-06-02 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,Nah I’d rather hold my GameStop😁
2021-06-02 17:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Still seems overvalued. The chart looks as if the price is stuck below the $80 mark, and the trendline from the low on 3/13/20 shows support at $42. Lot of room to move. May be best to wait and see given major indices are at all time highs despite breaking their 3/23/20 trendlines. SPY has a double top currently and QQQ is forming it's second shoulder. Good stock, but too much volatility to be certain atm.

Not a financial advisor, I just eat ramen and look at graphs all day"

2021-06-02 17:24:39,wallstreetbets,"Buybacks. Russell inclusion. Dividend. Strong earnings and guidance. 

One of the safest plays with potential for a huge squeeze. 

Position: Holding bunch of shares from the low-7s and a handful of July calls."
2021-06-02 18:06:14,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is about to moon
 Just needs one day of massive volume."
2021-06-02 16:38:43,wallstreetbets,"You must’ve timed today’s dip damn near perfectly to have closed up more than 20% on these

Edit: the options, that is"
2021-06-02 18:17:18,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure that on the 1st day of good volume this will rocket hard. My thesis is that in 2-3 week maximum this will be over 20$ at least. An then ppl will join the $UWMC gang!
2021-06-02 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,4K shares and a few calls checking in. It’s about time to moon hard.
2021-06-02 16:49:58,wallstreetbets,"One of the safest stock that is highly shorted to go long on. Profitable, pays dividend, strong management, fintech, post SPAC thru a celebrity manager (Alex Gores), low P/E, hot market, keeping mortgage brokers happy, fastest turn around time...etc."

2021-06-02 18:43:48,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah! Let’s go 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 16:15:42,wallstreetbets,20 by July. Calling it
2021-06-02 16:37:02,wallstreetbets,Time for Uwmc to do their share buybacks!   I’m in with 1200 shares and 30 calls on it too
2021-06-02 16:16:30,wallstreetbets,UWMC!!! Let the summer season of squeezes begin!!! Off to a good start this week!!!
2021-06-02 16:16:11,wallstreetbets,I have a small position on this one 250 shares at $8.7 but holy shit it doesn’t move. The volume is usually really low and people sell on every small pop. Great long term hold though
2021-06-02 17:25:45,wallstreetbets,UWMC UWMC LES GO
2021-06-02 16:23:37,wallstreetbets,"If nothing else you're getting a dime per share on D day.

My wife, on the other hand, gets a lot more on D day.

At least that's what her boyfriend tells me."

2021-06-02 16:34:48,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you are right. I load up on UWMC too
2021-06-02 16:30:09,wallstreetbets,Satan says 👿 you would have tripled those gain in AMC
2021-06-02 16:37:16,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my UWMC (at loss) for GME. Best decision ever.

Good luck tho."

2021-06-02 17:01:38,wallstreetbets,Anyone who chases after these weak ass diversions while the stocks with the real short interest are popping is truly retarded.
2021-06-02 16:59:37,wallstreetbets,I hope so.  I have $10 calls expiring in August that have bled 60% since I bought them.
2021-06-02 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,+=20 close EOM and I will tattoo Ishbia’s name on my ass.
2021-06-02 17:09:35,wallstreetbets,Should get either a special dividend or increase in dividend the way they keep turning profit every quarter!
2021-06-02 18:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm about the same, still holding but feel I could have done better with more AMC instead, I still believe the potential is there so I'll probably just add to it post AMC/GME."
2021-06-02 18:07:58,wallstreetbets,🚀 rocket time.
2021-06-02 16:35:00,wallstreetbets,$CLOV I think you mean ... with those AMC gains haha! It will be bigger than you can imagine my friend!
2021-06-02 18:21:02,wallstreetbets,Damn your brain is the smoothest in the worst way I agree amc and gme are great (I enjoyed my play through gme) but if you haven't actually looked at uwmc your missing out the dividend is worth it alone at this price but last I had seen there was a 17-20% short and over 24 days of continuous fail to delivers. the float is 90 million so its pretty damn small and to top it off there's already one index it's been added to and another one on the way which means that there's a large number of shares being held that won't be sold along with the company's 300 million dollar buy back on common shares. So to sum it up this is a company with fantastic short term  possibilities and with their awesome Financials its got amazing long term growth possibilities as well!
2021-06-02 17:14:41,wallstreetbets,Like what?
2021-06-02 16:57:28,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! June 30

2021-06-02 16:18:49,wallstreetbets,Did what I did in Jan...didn’t end well. Take profits and don’t get greedy because when they manipulate buys and the market it goes to zero real quick lol.
2021-06-02 16:42:24,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
2021-06-02 16:47:16,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I'm envious.  I tried to buy 6/18 contracts toward the close but got skeezed by 5 cents.  Maybe tomorrow."
2021-06-02 17:03:47,wallstreetbets,Let’s go
2021-06-02 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,"That’s a lock and worth more than 6 figures..gold, black, green."
2021-06-02 19:46:35,wallstreetbets,"I spent a fairly large chunk of my life in 2001 hanging out at AMC, 'emailing' with my BB. It's karma."
2021-06-02 16:40:42,wallstreetbets,Thanks for buying my calls
2021-06-02 16:13:47,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how you do this please? Im interested in trading options but have no clue where to start.
2021-06-02 18:24:34,wallstreetbets,Why not on AMC?
2021-06-02 16:53:51,wallstreetbets,Placing buy calls after close.  Pro level move bro
2021-06-02 17:26:27,wallstreetbets,Such bullshit. I need to wait till next week for my money to settle
2021-06-02 17:29:55,wallstreetbets,You bought today? You’re so fucked man
2021-06-02 16:49:51,wallstreetbets,"Got caught with bb in Jan, it’s a hedgefunds way of distracting buy power from gme. Don’t get caught"
2021-06-02 17:46:58,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 2 weeks
2021-06-02 17:55:19,wallstreetbets,I’m to retarded to internet. Can someone teach me how to option?
2021-06-02 18:18:40,wallstreetbets,What's  the News on BB? Any catalist?
2021-06-02 18:25:57,wallstreetbets,I bought the 15C for next year. How overpriced are these options really? Did I buy pretty high?
2021-06-02 19:06:21,wallstreetbets,ape together strong brother/sister

2021-06-02 16:29:15,wallstreetbets,He's not holding BB stock lmao he's holding options that expire in like a month
2021-06-02 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,"If you think BB is going to go up ASAP, why wouldn't you buy the closest strike date? Just going to cost you more for negligible upside *if you think its going up tomorrow.*"
2021-06-02 17:31:26,wallstreetbets,Leverage
2021-06-02 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,Same lol
2021-06-02 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,Ur welcome
2021-06-02 16:15:25,wallstreetbets,Learn options before you buy them. I kind of understand it but don't participate yet. Stick to shares if you don't fully understand it. Fair warning

2021-06-02 18:51:10,wallstreetbets,GREEN SKY IT IS!!
2021-06-02 17:07:42,wallstreetbets,"That's what i'm thinking. AMC has 3,421 positive comments and 743 negative.

BB has 3,244 positive and 297 negative

This is based on the last 24 hours on WSB.

I'm thinking that we need AMC to run well though to have BB moon personally but I fux with BB"
2021-06-02 16:48:04,wallstreetbets,"At this pace, if it continues to go up, he should make it bigger than just holding 10k worth of stock."
2021-06-02 16:36:30,wallstreetbets,This^

2021-06-02 17:11:10,wallstreetbets,"I have an app from the Play Store that actually posts the trending stocks in WSB, definitely has not done me wrong!

SO HAPPY IM HOLDING $BB and now $NOK

2021-06-02 17:13:44,wallstreetbets,Just need to break through the scared money who think they profited a good amount. Just to find out the S$#@ the bed and left a ton on the table
2021-06-02 17:14:18,wallstreetbets,Just a thought: wouldn’t people cash out of AMC since they landed on the moon today and yolo it into BB now? Second trip to moon
2021-06-02 17:19:53,wallstreetbets,What’s the app called?
2021-06-02 17:48:03,wallstreetbets,"A wise lesson I learned from AMC today (sold at $34 per share yesterday)

I always heard rappers say ""Scared money don't make money""

it all makes sense now

$BB and $NOK to the MOON!"
2021-06-02 17:16:17,wallstreetbets,It depends if they think that AMC is the new GME. Everyone has their own price targets and opinions on how much money they want to make per trade.
2021-06-02 17:17:51,wallstreetbets,I sure fucking hope so
2021-06-02 17:26:02,wallstreetbets,"WallStreetBets Stats, it will give you a lot of solid analytics of the mentions of each stock

Obviously scrolling WSB helps too!

SEE YOU ON THE MOON APES, BIG DAY FOR $BB and also $NOK tomorrow hopefully"
2021-06-02 19:42:53,wallstreetbets,Volume is real solid on this stock for the past few days even. Should have a nice jump tomorrow looking decent after market so far.
2021-06-02 19:46:03,wallstreetbets,I learned about Volume literally last week and it is why I am all for $BB
2021-06-02 16:20:11,wallstreetbets,"You didn’t say “literally”. So,I will.

Literally.

One of the few appropriate use cases.

MVIS is so so undervalued."
2021-06-02 16:24:03,wallstreetbets,If they have been using VLDR since 2012 why would the stock shoot up all of a sudden?
2021-06-02 16:30:44,wallstreetbets,Hope believer in this and Clov. Loaded up
2021-06-02 17:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Well for me Velodyne is old. OUSTER and its projections in different markets and its chip manufacture in Thailand, without chip shortage, make them the best option in Digital silicon solid state lidar. I wrote a technical analysis today about it in r/docstocks."

2021-06-02 16:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Undervalued? What have they actually produced? What contracts do they actually have signed? 

They're burning millions of dollars a year with almost zero revenue while still developing a ""potentially disruptive"" (quote from the CEO) sensor that has yet to be validated or produced at any meaningful quantity.

Yet, somehow, they are undervalued with a $3B market cap??

MVIS is just hoping they get bought out by a company that actually knows how to produce products and scale up production."

2021-06-02 17:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Er, have you actually been following mvis?  They've already moved into production on a smaller scale prototype line, and they have contracted with some big names to produce many more.   Their confirmed specs are best-in-market.  FUD bullshit...."
2021-06-02 17:17:07,wallstreetbets,"FUD? Just read their latest earnings. It talks about ramping up future production and what they hope to accomplish. It lacks the ""we produced this many ___"" statements that would indicate they actually have real production numbers.

2021-06-02 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,"First, the Microsoft hololens uses mvis for the core component.  So while they aren't showing significant profits yet, it's only a matter of time.  

Second, from that earnings report: Another major advantage of our technology is its capability to demonstrate 
scalability. To demonstrate this, we successfully developed and installed our long-range lidar 
sensor pilot line in Redmond. This pilot line is sophisticated. It includes six custom active 
alignment stations that our team developed working with our automation partners to enable 
scalability and performance. Our team has launched multiple pilot lines in the past for our 
display, augmented reality, and interactive display products. 

He goes on to say:
This pilot line will allow us to validate designs and manufacturing processes in house 
in faster cycles. We expect limited quantities produced from this line will support exploring 
potential partnerships. This pilot line will also enable us to take our designs, process maps and 
control plans, and launch a new highly automated production line to support expected initial 
sales inventory in the second half of 2021 through a contract manufacturer. This future 
production line in Asia will eventually have the capacity to produce between 12-15 thousand 
sensors per year starting sometime in 2022. The purpose of this second line is to show the next 
level of scaling. The ultimate capacity of this production line can be adjusted to meet volumes 
as required prior to mass production in the 2024-25 timeframe.

They also just released mems version 5.

They have enough money on hand to last years if needed, but they don't."
2021-06-02 16:23:08,wallstreetbets,Still holding - feels bad to see -10% for the day but would be dumb as fuck to sell at these levels
2021-06-02 16:43:06,wallstreetbets,"I bought in for the first time today, and, yes, I'm disappointed in that last hour. But, yes, I can hold. Just a kind of brutal entry point. Guh."

2021-06-02 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,BBBY will be my short of preference this round. It’s always nice when big money buys up all the shares on meme stocks and retail gets giddy thinking it’s squeezing the market
2021-06-02 18:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Alright Apes you got me. Yesterday I opened call credit spreads on AMC at $35/$40 for a credit of $1.30 each. This morning when the stock was around $40 l considered closing them for $2.15 but didn’t. Later I saw it was trading over $60 and kicked myself... but wait! The spreads were now trading at ~$1.85! Wtf! IV went from 300 to 500+ and I ended up making money despite the spreads going deep in the money 🤣. I also want to be clear that the bid/ask spreads were not that insane, these were both closable prices. Ended up closing them out at $1.85 for a small loss and giving up playing this thing down (so... sorry it will probably crash now)."
2021-06-02 18:01:33,wallstreetbets,"man, now I gots to deal with all the ritch apes that I shit on over the last week over AMC. 

Congratulations!
And lick my taint."

2021-06-02 18:04:55,wallstreetbets,"8,629 open interest on $20 AMC calls expiring Friday - lets see what the shorts and market makers are made of. I got a feeling so many retards going into these meme stocks has broken the hedgies models and they are panicking.. How else can they prepare for our retardeness - who the fuck buys calls when IV is over 400% - retards like us lol"
2021-06-02 18:05:52,wallstreetbets,I'm holding the BYND I own. I went all in on it with my fun money account.They are opening in new markets. They have the plant based protein foods that many people are turning to for health and environmental reasons. Some people consider them a good reopening play.BYND only has 63 million shares outstanding and a market cap of about 9.4 billion. It shouldn't be to difficult to get some price action on a company of this size. It can be bought for significantly less than its 52 week high price. It seems like this one should be like shooting fish in a barrel and it should be a good long term holding as well as having short squeeze potential.
2021-06-02 18:08:18,wallstreetbets,"Sooo... The fed selling its portfolio of bonds is going to make the market go up?

It must be the end times."

2021-06-02 15:58:49,wallstreetbets,wouldve been different if u bought AMC
2021-06-02 15:55:31,wallstreetbets,Is it because GME isn't part of your portfolio?

2021-06-02 16:20:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 16:00:32,wallstreetbets,For real… To be honest I only had 1k this morning split between amc and gme. Now im all in on bb calls for January. Fingers crossed.
2021-06-02 15:56:47,wallstreetbets,I had GME if I go back further it gets more depressing. Sold during the second peak and lost all those gains. Tried to play options since then on it but those just lost me more money.
2021-06-02 16:03:39,wallstreetbets,Yup already done. 4 bb calls for January. Not gunna try to time shit this time.
2021-06-02 15:55:37,wallstreetbets,$RKT and $MVIS were the big killers. $TSLA and $GME didn’t help.
2021-06-02 17:19:38,wallstreetbets,"There was a glitch on my td ameritrade for about 10 seconds today that said I had twice as much in my account.

I got super happy and then the page refreshed and it said I was back to $17 again."
2021-06-02 15:59:21,wallstreetbets,Its alright got a good job and am young so this won’t kill me. I’ll rebuild eventually :)
2021-06-02 17:58:39,wallstreetbets,All time for this account is -16k with a peak of 70k during the gme push.
2021-06-02 16:06:42,wallstreetbets,Oh I have 2 other accounts. I don’t want to share the shame of those though.
2021-06-02 16:19:47,wallstreetbets,You’ll be good - earnings on 6/24 !!
2021-06-02 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,Don’t try to time the market. I sold AMC @ 15 the day before it started pumping.
2021-06-02 17:53:05,wallstreetbets,Choose a profit percentage and when it hits just take that profit. Then don't look back at those calls to see what they do.
2021-06-02 16:04:22,wallstreetbets,"Good God man, sounds like you flirted with all four of them at just the wrong time... Hope you dig yourself out eventually."
2021-06-02 15:59:18,wallstreetbets,"#RKT, couldn’t make it up. I hope you manage to claw some back"

2021-06-02 16:07:10,wallstreetbets,"Sold AMC yesterday morning at 31, 38 eod and 60 today. Oh well, gains into GME"
2021-06-02 16:01:03,wallstreetbets,"Me too man, thanks!"
2021-06-02 17:33:56,wallstreetbets,Just don't let your losses cause you to make more emotional decisions. Otherwise you'll just dig yourself deeper.
2021-06-02 16:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Gains are gains, that’s how I see it now. Yeah FOMO is a bitch when you miss out on bigger gains :("
2021-06-02 17:53:50,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty much what I did. Lost 10k took riskier positions to make it back and lost the rest. Briefly was above water though and should have just exited then but went full retard instead.
2021-06-02 18:06:08,wallstreetbets,Been there. Slowly dug myself out. Just rejoined WSB again so ready to lose it all again.
2021-06-02 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks man! I’ll dig myself out too just gunna take time. Still have 401gay and shit so it’s alright at the end of the day just unfortunate.

2021-06-02 18:23:10,wallstreetbets,Writing it out actually made me understand what he was saying much more clearly. He misspoke with the million and quickly corrected it to billion. It sounds way worse than it actually is. He really just mixed up one word and it's pretty understandable.
2021-06-02 16:09:13,wallstreetbets,Even he couldn’t if he tried. 😂

2021-06-02 18:58:19,wallstreetbets,$25 Million
2021-06-02 19:54:49,wallstreetbets,Skyrocketing? I’m in $XOM too but a sub 1% day while memes are up 50-100% is nothing to circlejerk about
2021-06-02 18:35:55,wallstreetbets,But nobody says “a trillion 300 billion”. It’s just 1.3 trillion
2021-06-02 18:45:45,wallstreetbets,Don’t make excuses for uncle Joe. He interviewed for and won the most demanding job in the world.
2021-06-02 19:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but. I prefer to think of his gaffe as meaning that the upper range is trillions of billions of dollars!!!! ;)"

2021-06-02 18:57:35,wallstreetbets,“And the Oscar goes to…John Mellencamp!”
2021-06-02 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah nobody without a disability or poor English skills would say “a trillion 300 billion” but Biden has a very bad stutter and you can often see him changing up the words hes saying because hes unable to get certain words out some of the time.
2021-06-02 18:38:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean yea that's typically how it's stated but it's understandable. Could have went to say 700 billion to a trillion then thought well actually its 1.3 trillion, better make sure to be precise about the amount so it came out a little awkward and with mistakenly saying million instead of billion it just exacerbated the whole thing."
2021-06-02 19:05:31,wallstreetbets,Hes just a temp...
2021-06-02 18:50:25,wallstreetbets,All I'm saying is watching this very brief clip I was like wtf was that. Then when I saw it written out I was like oh that's what he was saying. Dunno what you're going on about with this uncle Joe shit.
2021-06-02 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,"you mean because he's unable to read the teleprompter ""some of the time"""
2021-06-02 18:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Like Joe cares about being precise. lol Simply, the dude fucked up his words...again. That damned childhood stutter!"
2021-06-02 19:29:49,wallstreetbets,I mean he is old as shit. Personally I think anyone who is 70 and up shouldn't be running for president. I'm just saying this is an understandable mistake on its own.
2021-06-02 19:00:14,wallstreetbets,"Which came back with old age.

What does that sound like? Neurological regression. It's not extremely pronounced but this ""stutter"" really wasn't an issue in his prime years

2021-06-02 15:53:19,wallstreetbets,"You think it will be this price by this date. 

You have the right to buy the stock at that price you chose by the expiration date but don’t have to. 

You pay a premium for this contract. 

High risk/reward."
2021-06-02 15:52:11,wallstreetbets,So the strike price is $30 I have 15 of them and they expire next week
2021-06-02 16:21:30,wallstreetbets,Fucking Google it you bozo
2021-06-02 16:03:34,wallstreetbets,Ass eater
2021-06-02 15:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've only gotten into stocks like pretty much 2 years ago and the same cousin who introduced me to options referred me to robinhood, and honestly I don't think it's as bad as people say, but maybe in the future after experiencing and researching more I'll switch."
2021-06-02 15:56:59,wallstreetbets,Speak to me like your speaking to a 5th grader
2021-06-02 15:55:50,wallstreetbets,So so you set a time limit on em?
2021-06-02 16:04:21,wallstreetbets,I need a legit site which no is having issues with or are in the news for making decisions against us as they did at the beginning of these high margin gains. Definitely want to try contracts. Not sure where to start though. Smh
2021-06-02 16:04:36,wallstreetbets,I'm a chimp amongst apes 😂😂
2021-06-02 16:04:27,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know how much more I can simplify it.

You think price will go up and hit a certain price by a certain date and you can lock in that price now but it will cost you some money. 

If the price is higher than that target price at the end, you can say “I’ll take those shares at the price I thought it would be”. 

Or what most people do is sell that contract to someone else who buys them at that price. 

If the price is LESS than what you thought, you can just say “I’d rather buy the shares at this lower price than what I thought it would be”. And then the option you bought is worthless. 

So...option goes higher than price you thought = lots of money

Option is less than what you thought = lose the money you paid for the contract (it becomes worthless because why buy stocks at a higher price when the current price is lower)"
2021-06-02 16:10:10,wallstreetbets,Check put projectoption on youtube. He has alot of beginner vids and very detailed
2021-06-02 16:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah basically, the further the time the more expensive. Also calls are worth 100x then what is put on there. So my calls in the screenshot are actually worth $4000 each(40 x 100). I bought them when they were worth $7.50($750). You have 2 options in what to do before expiring you can sell the calls as they are, or you can execute them. Executing means you will buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price, but after getting them it will be at current price and you own them now so no expiry date. So it'll cost $3000 to execute one of them but the 100 shares at the end of it will be worth (At current price of $65.60)  $6560."
2021-06-02 15:58:52,wallstreetbets,All options have an expiry date. *edit. See also response from u/probablygetsomesoup.
2021-06-02 16:14:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm not really sure about other trading platforms, but I think all the other platforms also halted trading at the same time, and the reason robinhood was basically the poster child was because it was and I think still is one of the biggest trading platforms."
2021-06-02 18:38:17,wallstreetbets,I was trying to figure this out today and this was what made it click.
2021-06-02 16:41:37,wallstreetbets,"who is your broker? got Schwab and although got more than enough money on the account, they only approved i believe level 1 options trading so never bothered with it."
2021-06-02 16:22:52,wallstreetbets,"No bozo
You can sell the contract. You don't have to exercise. It doesn't magically lose value on the expiry date
Wtf. If you're itm and you don't sell or exercise on expiry I'm pretty sure your brokerage *may* sell on your behalf."
2021-06-02 16:51:37,wallstreetbets,Ah I see that makes sense. I use etolo duno how to do that
2021-06-02 16:44:31,wallstreetbets,I am currently on robinhood with level 3 trading options and I am also allowed to trade on expiration dates. I think I applied to get level 3 when I had 28k in my account a year ago.

2021-06-02 16:12:29,wallstreetbets,"On the bright side, you made $11,616 more dollars than me today! Nice work retard"
2021-06-02 15:41:33,wallstreetbets,I bought at 11 and sold at 9 way back when ... Rip me

2021-06-02 15:28:31,wallstreetbets,Sigh.. don’t we all. 🤝 at least we’re in. 🍿 🎥
2021-06-02 15:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I’ve been wanting to join in an Ape play for a while now but I never know when or what to buy and by the time plays are mooning I hesitate to put money in since it’s already up an amazing percentage. Where is the best place to get information from ?"

2021-06-02 15:31:08,wallstreetbets,Whats the word on $BB? 👀
2021-06-02 15:34:55,wallstreetbets,"Next resistance at ~25, if we blow past that it'll be ~45.
BB also isn't your average play, it's an actually undervalued stock."
2021-06-02 15:17:41,wallstreetbets,Broke? Are you smoking something
2021-06-02 15:32:56,wallstreetbets,That should fund a fairly steady coke habit.
2021-06-02 15:14:21,wallstreetbets,“Broke”. 🤦‍♂️

2021-06-02 16:12:59,wallstreetbets,"When you say buying and selling, do you mean options, or stock itself? I'm a newish ape, thank you so much and congrats!"
2021-06-02 17:14:34,wallstreetbets,"It is what it is man, its just reddit points at the end of the day lol"
2021-06-02 17:07:33,wallstreetbets,"Right move, don’t listen to people. You made those gains by taking risks, as long as you know when you plan to pull out you’re good."

2021-06-02 16:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Obviously, when did wsb become literal? I thought we were apes"

2021-06-02 15:44:40,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. A non-asshole reply on Reddit. Props dude! Lol. Keep grinding and best of luck!
2021-06-02 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,Prepare for the tax man lil homie; they got Capone
2021-06-02 16:56:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info! I'm the same way as far as options trading lol.  I'm trying to educate myself before diving into it.  Right now I've bought (haven't sold anything yet lol).  I bought AMC at $12.09/share..  now starting to buy BB.  Thank you so much and congrats again!  Keep up the great work!
2021-06-02 18:23:09,wallstreetbets,"> I literally found out what options really were last night

This ain't over yet.

We just started the propulsion. Wait for the trip to the moon 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎"
2021-06-02 15:23:51,wallstreetbets,"What's everyone's plan?  I sold 20 of my 93 shares at $67 to cover investment and secure $300 profits.  Now playing with house money.

Who thinks AMC is going over $100?"
2021-06-02 16:48:52,wallstreetbets,We didn’t do anything yet if you think this is the moon
2021-06-02 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,We haven't even broken the stratosphere yet.
2021-06-02 15:14:20,wallstreetbets,Congrats guys. Now give me some money:)

2021-06-02 15:35:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol, what does that even mean? I invested 5.000€ of loaned money into BB and AMC, not even thinking about securing anything yet. HOLDING"
2021-06-02 16:03:51,wallstreetbets,You're playing a dangerous game.
2021-06-02 16:05:03,wallstreetbets,That's what retards do
2021-06-02 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,Investing with loaned money is beyond retarded! What the hell are you going to do if this high risk play goes tits up?
2021-06-02 16:11:01,wallstreetbets,"If it goes totally tits up, I'm gonna pay back the loan with my normal job within a few months...not like it's a ton of money 🙃 it's still a hell lot cheaper than studying in the US lol...and don't worry, I have a safety net with various stop losses so that I will be able to cover most of it

Thanks for your concern tho"

2021-06-02 16:00:38,wallstreetbets,Just HODL whatever you’re in Hold the line with your giant  🦍 🙌 and 💎 💎 will appear - they keep buying the options calls and it will float the whole short boat. BB is the safest play BTW - it had the lowest perceived volatility of all meme(ish) stocks. There’s a reason Cathy is holding with us.
2021-06-02 15:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Lmaooo bruv shouldve bought a call, safer than puttin 20K down and only gettin 323 back as of now"

2021-06-02 17:12:58,wallstreetbets,"I got so fucked over for all the ""MEME"" stocks that day, that I hope we can get some in return. Pissed that I sold AMC too early, yesterday, but had to recoup some of my losses from January.

Hopefully I'll be able to diamond hand BB to the moon. Still have NOK and another that cannot named or face being banned."

2021-06-02 19:47:15,wallstreetbets,I put in $2000 (which is a lot for me) when it was at $11. Let’s bring $CLOV back up!

2021-06-02 15:46:51,wallstreetbets,I know nothing about this ticker but just bought calls
2021-06-02 15:42:07,wallstreetbets,"CLOV has the potential to be the next big squeeze. This was shorted over 140% back in April (AMC was at 61% in December)

Current Short Interest is at 40%, which is more than AMC.

2021-06-02 16:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the pandemic caused a real shortage this last St Patrick's day and now there is a huge demand to replenish 4 leaf clover reserves.  As a result, their business is booming.  The federal government alone is expected to purchase 500 million alone just to restore their reserve field to pre pandemic levels.  Consumers didn't notice the shortage because the Fed sold reserve clover on the open market to prevent a price spike."

2021-06-02 18:07:06,wallstreetbets,If the short interest was higher in April and there was no squeeze why is it going to squeeze now with a lower short interest?
2021-06-02 18:17:09,wallstreetbets,"So shorts covered 100% out of 140% and it didn't pop?

What catalyst does this need?"

2021-06-02 18:16:34,wallstreetbets,Ttcf has over 30% of the float short and has solid fundamentals. Growing revenue over 30%+
2021-06-02 18:19:12,wallstreetbets,140% short interest back in April? That doesn't sound accurate.
2021-06-02 19:43:42,wallstreetbets,Wasnt that 140% supposed to be a reporting error or something?

2021-06-02 19:17:09,wallstreetbets,"Your reasoning is not adding up.

If something is shorted 140%, covering 100% of that should make it pop. If covering 100% wasn't enough for a big squeeze, how much would you have to buy to have an effect? 200% of all outstanding shares?

Is this company even worth anything on its own?"

If this thing was shorted 140% and shorts covered 100%. It should have exploded.
Why is AMC is up 100% today alone on its 40% short interest?

This CLOV shit is FUD.

GME is the King and the God, of course. Up $100 from last week on no news at all."

2021-06-02 19:25:59,wallstreetbets,But is BB as heavily shorted as AMC and GME? I like BB and have some and am thinking of buying more but I don’t want to buy it in hopes of it becoming the next amc or GME. If it turns out to be like GME and amc then it’s just luck

2021-06-02 19:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Doubtful, most people that have skin in the meme stock game are still holding GME. GME is like 2nd nature at this point. Just buy and hold, it’s easy. All these new tickers being thrown around are great to hop into right now though, but if anybody is selling GME to move to one of these tickers it’s a very small percentage."
2021-06-02 19:31:27,wallstreetbets,"People said the same exact thing about AMC back when GME was first getting started...

Learn from history."
2021-06-02 17:54:20,wallstreetbets,There was absolutely no mention of BB on WSB before today. It definitely wasn’t in the news that they are the second most discussed ticker here and that definitely didn’t convince me to load up on it first thing this morning. You’d have to have magical powers to have seen this coming. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|stuck_out_tongue)
2021-06-02 19:42:20,wallstreetbets,"And another point, post or ban. Such a joke this place has become."
2021-06-02 19:24:05,wallstreetbets,AMC is coming pretty damn close
2021-06-02 15:19:29,wallstreetbets,"I did buy AMC. 

Now, I am also buying BB. You should too after witnessing the AMC success."
2021-06-02 16:27:18,wallstreetbets,What people said at gme $100
2021-06-02 17:50:42,wallstreetbets,💎or 🤦‍♂️
2021-06-02 19:55:48,wallstreetbets,The one that will obviously expire worthless because he is paying high premium due to high IV.  A little downward move and he will get crushed.   Best play to play meme stocks is just to buy the stock because you want to hold for a long time
2021-06-02 19:57:08,wallstreetbets,Tagging along to hear too
2021-06-02 17:56:30,wallstreetbets,unstoppable force vs immovable object

2021-06-02 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,"if it hits $30, i'll buy you and a friend a nice dinner."
2021-06-02 19:13:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the exact same place. Diamond handed since the first squeeze in January, then averaged down considerably to about $10/share. Buckle up, we're heading to the moon"
2021-06-02 18:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Im sure, my position was smallish didn’t make much but holding that for months just didnt feel right to me have other ideas. Still i hope the homies make money"
2021-06-02 19:29:32,wallstreetbets,Got 100 because of you.
2021-06-02 19:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Big same, I've had no problems"
2021-06-02 16:26:15,wallstreetbets,I have no premarket option so I rushed in minutes before closing. Got spooked that premarket would repeat AMC last friday
2021-06-02 19:13:55,wallstreetbets,Upvoted to get to -69. No one touch it.
2021-06-02 16:06:53,wallstreetbets,Bless you all!
2021-06-02 17:45:56,wallstreetbets,Exactly. It was already $25 before and now it’s stronger than ever. My short term goal is $30 then reevaluate.
2021-06-02 18:59:36,wallstreetbets,Suffering leads to the dark side.
2021-06-02 15:31:31,wallstreetbets,Rightly said.
2021-06-02 18:06:35,wallstreetbets,Fomo is kicking at AMC not a single share covered they borrowed more shares to short this will explode
2021-06-02 15:36:17,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro
2021-06-02 15:45:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks daddy
2021-06-02 16:25:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I bought more AMC today, so I didn’t have an excuse not to ape in on BB as well.  Why be a retard once when I can be a retard twice."
2021-06-02 18:36:56,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 17:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, thanks pops! To da moon"
2021-06-02 17:04:50,wallstreetbets,Who else peed a little in their pants reading that
2021-06-02 15:58:53,wallstreetbets,Sweeeeetttttttttttttahhhhh
2021-06-02 16:57:52,wallstreetbets,"I’m blindly trusting this post without reading DD after a brief look over their chart back a few years. I only jumped in at 4 shares but I guess I’m on the gme,amc and BB train to tendy town. BB was up above $100 at one point so I’m just doing this to see where it goes."
2021-06-02 19:31:46,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-06-02 18:16:20,wallstreetbets,Technically they all have pretty decent long term potential
2021-06-02 16:54:50,wallstreetbets,this is where i'm at. someone put in 750 and made out like a bandit on AMC?! fuck me i *easily* could have done that at the time.
2021-06-02 16:09:13,wallstreetbets,"But literally, this subreddit is filled with black berry now and I'm beginning to think it's a huge diversion, still, I have 50% in AMC and 50% GME. Don't worry I'm holding till the the last fucking hedge fund covers"
2021-06-02 17:30:13,wallstreetbets,"yeah but you only yolo once, yoyo"
2021-06-02 18:09:35,wallstreetbets,a lot of this sort of nonsense comments all the time. there is always an exit strategy to trim profits. pretending you are holding this stock till the grave is both dumb and a lie.
2021-06-02 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,yin vs yang
2021-06-02 18:46:31,wallstreetbets,That's how the singularity starts...
2021-06-02 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,"I think BB may be a 10 bagger if they announce the patent sale with a huge sum otherwise im holding for a 1-2 years.
However I can't figure out why all the meme stocks are moving so much and the more important question is when it will stop. It either stops or a lot of people are gonna get margin called for billions."
2021-06-02 16:15:18,wallstreetbets,wsb delivers
2021-06-02 15:33:17,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro
2021-06-02 17:13:29,wallstreetbets,Omg lol
2021-06-02 16:35:48,wallstreetbets,Bought more AMC at 35 this morning.... Am I mad? No!   This ape eats tendies with diamond hands!
2021-06-02 17:23:55,wallstreetbets,I def. we’d new thong underwear after that
2021-06-02 17:11:39,wallstreetbets,"It's what I did, I put 50% of my net worth (I'm 21 so not much) into amc last week and literally fucking doubled it"
2021-06-02 16:11:55,wallstreetbets,"We’re winning on all 3 fronts- if AMC or GME had lost capitalization proportional to the increase for BB I’d have to say you were on to something. But If this is a diversion, they are really bad at diversions- it’s like getting stung twice and sticking your dick in the hornets nest to distract the swarm"
2021-06-02 17:39:24,wallstreetbets,Your two statements contradict themselves
2021-06-02 19:13:55,wallstreetbets,Mono E Mono
2021-06-02 19:46:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way tho
2021-06-02 16:24:46,wallstreetbets,Lol... We'll see about that ... #greencandles
2021-06-02 16:59:26,wallstreetbets,There you go. This is the way
2021-06-02 16:20:26,wallstreetbets,"Ok true but what I'm saying is these hedge funds shorted GME and AMC so confidently and with so many shares compared to BB that this is the only diversion they have left, to reduce the amount of money they lose any way they can"
2021-06-02 18:02:53,wallstreetbets,fair
2021-06-02 19:35:44,wallstreetbets,Peanut butter to my jelly
2021-06-02 16:26:38,wallstreetbets,"They definitely think they can win in the end. They think they’re smarter and richer. But every battle we win, we gain resources to fight them with. I read today (and you should definitely believe everything written in financial news because what would the have to gain by changing our behavior) that the shorts are doubling down and not going to back off as easy this time- they will no doubt succeed on short plays that miss our attention, or eventually straight up set a trap for us and cheat even more than they’ve already tried- but they’re not going to beat us on one of the top stocks on this sub- no way. If anything, they’re going to bleed harder on the main few meme stocks. They’ll make it up somewhere by fighting where the enemy isn’t."
2021-06-02 16:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Well then I guess the most I can do is hold my positions in gme and amc, thanks for the talk man let's fight this fucking war hand and hand, ape with ape! 💎✋🦍"

2021-06-02 15:30:26,wallstreetbets,After Hours today on BB will tell a lot for where we are headed the rest of the week. Hoping for $20+ by the 8pm close
2021-06-02 17:52:10,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, stupid question but hopefully I can wrap my head around options.

Why would you buy an option with a strike price of $10,5 expiring 6/25 when the stock opened at around $12? Why not buy an option with a strike price of lets say $15? 

Retarded question, but gotta learn"
2021-06-02 15:32:30,wallstreetbets,Where can I learn how options work? Total noob on that approach.
2021-06-02 15:55:50,wallstreetbets,"Time to follow AMC and lets go to above $50 by Friday .

2021-06-02 17:57:37,wallstreetbets,20+ seems a bit greedy. If it closes over 15 it will have been a killer day and still primed for liftoff.
2021-06-02 18:02:59,wallstreetbets,Stocks can go down.
2021-06-02 16:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Buy options low, then sell them high, just like that.  But also options are a hot potato, sell them before they expire."

2021-06-02 15:38:29,wallstreetbets,"From NRD. 

“The shares drive the volatility and price up.
​
The calls are so damned cheap that when you buy the shares, the calls explode.
​
Look at it this way:
You buy 100 calls for $1.00 a contract. You buy no shares. The price stays the same. You lose $100.
​
You buy 50 calls for $1.00 a contract. Then you buy some shares. The price goes up. The calls are now worth $20 each. You make money.
​
You buy calls for $1.00 and then buy shares. The price jumps to $20 because of a gamma squeeze t hat takes place at $13. You made money on your shares and now you made $700 for each $1 you spent on calls. You are now rich and laugh at apes who talk about 10 baggers.

Yin and yang. With a setup like is presently there, you can't have one without the other. You can make money with shares. You can get filthy fucking rich with literal-penny calls so long as the shares still get purchased.

2021-06-02 15:26:25,wallstreetbets,"From Nrd earlier today...

“I just ran the numbers on the order book.  If they exchanged free popcorn (amc) tendies for cow farts(CLNE), anyone with more than 10 grand that half .01'd a call and half bought shares would be a millionaire (after taxes!) in the next 2 hours.

I'm done with the mainland.  Besides, one person pointing out a setup I've only ever seen a handful of times before in a lot of years of trading will get drowned out

They won't get to it in time.

The catalyst is the 6/18 13c.

At 13.01, 1.8 million shares become in the money for June (plus whatever is out there under those strikes).   June 19 the story is a lot less interesting.  Total would alleviate about 500k of those on the block, the rest would go into the sweep and trigger a series of breakers” 

Fucking over Shitadel and boosting a company that has potential to help the global environment as a whole? 

Apes don’t let us down now. 

Nrd is the word."
2021-06-02 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,"As the lighthearted ""patron saint of bagholders,"" I bless this DD. 

I was in GME for 570%+ gains; BB now with 3000 shares and 23 Jan 2023 $5c. I also have 1000 shares of CLNE, 7 Jan 2022 $10c, 14 Jan 2023 $10c, and 6 Jan 2023 $20c. I have more BP waiting for price movement. 

With CLNE, you can become a millionaire and also feel less guilty about methane byproducts from meat consumption. Win win! 🌎 ♻️ 🤑 🙏🏻 ❤

“The shares drive the volatility and price up.


The calls are so damned cheap that when you buy the shares, the calls explode.


Look at it this way:

You buy 100 calls for $1.00 a contract.  You buy no shares.  The price stays the same.  You lose $100.


You buy 50 calls for $1.00 a contract.  Then you buy some shares.  The price goes up.  The calls are now worth $20 each.  You make money.


You buy calls for $1.00 and then buy shares.  The price jumps to $20 because of a gamma squeeze t hat takes place at $13.  You made money on your shares and now you made $700 for each $1 you spent on calls.  You are now rich and laugh at apes who talk about 10 baggers.

Buy options and shares in equal chunks. Do not go all in on options, but if you have the opportunity to, you should certainly pick some up.

Split your play in two, with the options being the greedier, riskier side, and the shares being 100% safety.

So, half money in shares, half in calls. Boom."

2021-06-02 16:21:09,wallstreetbets,It's dumb to be honest. The stock is insanely easy to push around. It just needs the right support. Not to mention how it's a good long term investment generally with the Amazon deal.
2021-06-02 17:37:50,wallstreetbets,Seems like the train has left the station for calls. 0.01 calls have now gone up 900% probably because of people here buying. Sad that I missed this.

2021-06-02 16:24:35,wallstreetbets,"BUY SHARES ALSO. It's an absolute must. That price has got to get to $13 in order to trigger the squeeze. Load up on whatever you can. I'll be dumping some other stuff off tomorrow, even at a loss, in order to load up. This set up only works if we can get the price higher. Buying options alone doesn't do it."
2021-06-02 16:33:43,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-02 16:57:01,wallstreetbets,I think investors were stressed about the warrants to purchase 53 million shares at $13 amazon receives. But doesn't seem to add up to me since that seems like that would only help when the stock sits at $8?
2021-06-02 17:14:17,wallstreetbets,"So apparently IBKR only lists up to $12 calls currently at $0.10

2021-06-02 16:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. RNG is the future, at least the foreseeable one. CLNE is poised to be the number one method for delivering that to big transportation."
2021-06-02 16:35:47,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service.
2021-06-02 15:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Basically as call options come ITM HFs and IBs have to buy shares to cover their shorts, increasing the price of the stock, leading to other options coming ITM and its cyclical from that point."
2021-06-02 16:22:44,wallstreetbets,"See NrdRage's comments in his profile, or there are some copied in this thread. He's more eloquent, but yeah, the gist is that at $13, 1.8 million shares come ITM, and that will send volatility, and thus the value of call options, into space. At least that's how I understand it."
2021-06-02 16:25:49,wallstreetbets,buy shares!
2021-06-02 17:11:01,wallstreetbets,Buy shares too
2021-06-02 16:05:46,wallstreetbets,So .02?
2021-06-02 15:30:01,wallstreetbets,"Sort of. You’re right how contracts work, but a bit wrong about the profits. Contract profits are not based solely on the difference in price between your call and the asset, it’s based on numerous things like time to expiration, the stocks potential to go higher, the volatility of it. That’s why some contracts you see are only like a $4 difference but are up like 1000%"
2021-06-02 15:31:01,wallstreetbets,Exactly. If the squeeze gets squazzozled those 13c will be worth retarded multiples of where they are now.
2021-06-02 16:18:00,wallstreetbets,"The goal here is not to exercise the call option ( which, you're right, gives you the right to buy the shares at $13). The goal is to get the price to $13 before the option expires on the 18th. That will make about 1.8 million shares (that are tied up in option contracts) come In The Money, meaning that they now don't expire worthless, but have to be repurchased at a higher price. Those 1.8 million shares coming In The Money will trigger a massive gamma squeeze that will send the value of the call options soaring through the roof. A call Option that you bought for $5 today would be worth a hundred times that, and likely much higher than that. But you must buy shares as well, in order to push the price of the stock higher, otherwise the options will expire worthless. Absolutely need to hit that $13 number before the 18th. Buy shares as well as options!"
2021-06-02 15:35:49,wallstreetbets,"This is correct. You could also sell the contract any time before June 18th. If the price of the stock starts shooting up, the contract may be worth more without the price hitting 13. Granted the closer to the time it expires without price movement the lower the contract will be worth."
2021-06-02 16:26:32,wallstreetbets,I have an order in more at market open. Make my wallet hurt with some sweet AH gapping up baby.

2021-06-02 16:11:08,wallstreetbets,BUY SHARES AS WELL. SERIOUSLY. The options will expire worthless unless enough people buy shares to push the price to $13. It's absolutely critical. Split half your investment into shares. Or sell some other dead dog in your port and buy shares with that. The shares are a great long play even if the gamma squeeze doesn't work out.
2021-06-02 15:39:14,wallstreetbets,4/5. Needs more rockets.
2021-06-02 16:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. BUY SHARES as well as calls. And yes, volume on this is LOW LOW LOW, so apes collectively can really push this thing around. It won't take all that much. Spread the word."

2021-06-02 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,"This one, if we can get shares to $13 before the 18th, is going to be one for the ages. It will dwarf the stuff we saw today. Buy shares as well as calls. It's critical."
2021-06-02 16:35:29,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to split the investment. Half in Options half in shares. If it doesn't work out you will at least have the share of an amazing company.
2021-06-02 18:09:06,wallstreetbets,A few options first at the mntioned strike. Then shares would be the best play probably.
2021-06-02 16:35:15,wallstreetbets,"Grab some more, and some cheap ass options while you're at it."

2021-06-02 16:44:56,wallstreetbets,Not uncommon.  Fidelity does this also.
2021-06-02 17:29:52,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 17:41:01,wallstreetbets,how much were you able to get those calls for? I just checked and seems like IV is through the roof.
2021-06-02 16:22:01,wallstreetbets,"i also really like this company and already had some LEAPs @ 5calls for 2023. legit business that's being shorted to oblivion.

QUOTE:

Because approximately half of our sales contracts are structured on an index-plus methodology, whereby we add a fixed margin to the market price of natural gas we pay to purchase the natural gas we ultimately sell to our customers, we like to point out that although tracking revenue growth is important, it is not perfectly indicative of how our business is performing. In our business, the market price of natural gas can have a big impact on the revenue we earn related to these contracts, while at the same time not having any impact on the margin we earn on these contracts. I am now going to walk you through an example that demonstrates this point. For simplicity, all the amounts below are for illustrative purposes only and are not indicative of past or anticipated future results.  
   
Market and Contract Assumptions  
Base Case	Scenario 1	Scenario 2  
Market price of natural gas per gallon (""Index"")	$1.00	$.50	$1.50  
Other direct costs per gallon related to gas sale	$.50	$.50	$.50  
Margin (or ""Plus"") component of sales contract per gallon	$.90	$.90	$.90  
Financial Results  
Base Case	Scenario 1 . Scenario 2  
Revenue  
(""Index + ""Margin"")	$1.90	$1.40	$2.40  
Cost of Sales  
(""Index"" + other direct costs)	$1.50	$1.00	$2.00  
Net Margin Results	$.40	$.40	$.40

  
As you can see, in Scenario 1 revenue goes down 26% from the Base Case, and in Scenario 2, revenue goes up 26% from the Base Case, but our net margin results are the same in all three examples. Consequently, based on the impact these contracts have on our overall financial results, we believe our margin results are more indicative of our financial performance than revenues, which is why we focus so heavily on this metric."

2021-06-02 15:16:24,wallstreetbets,"If ape army jumps on this, they absolutely have the buying power to push it to that price. Combined, ape army has Assets Under Management that put them in the top 2% of hedge funds. A force to be fucking reckoned with, as is evidenced by the unreal meme action going on today. IF (and yes, it's a BIG IF) it can get pushed to $13 by the June 18 expire date, 1.8 million shares suddenly become In The Money, and that will trigger a gamma squeeze of truly epic proportions. The call options for June 18 are INSANELY CHEAP right now, so if that happened, it would put ten baggers to absolute shame. Because of the current AMC, GME, BB plays, this has gotten buried, but it has the potential to be even bigger. But after June, the real real juicy opportunity becomes considerably less juicy. Spread the word far and wide man. This would be one for the ages."

2021-06-02 17:40:50,wallstreetbets,"If I might, sir, I would like to try to explain this play in another way that might help.

&#x200B;

This is a fundamentally sound company that is trading below estimated fair value. 

It has very low volume, and most of the float is tied up in institutional ownership holdings.

The play indicated by OP is not so much a short squeeze as it is an actual example of a potential gamma squeeze. I know that both of those buzzwords have gotten entirely too much attention this year, but I firmly believe that the vast majority of posters on this sub are still unable to describe the actual workings of either.

For a gamma squeeze to happen, you need a stock that has abnormally low IV, but also abnormally high short-term open interest.

The low IV is pretty easy to watch, but the open interest is much trickier to see when there is enough. 

The gist of the play is that as the underlying ascends through the strikes, it creates pressure for the Market Makers to hedge their sold options - which they accomplish by buying shares of the underlying.

On a stock with heavy volume, that doesn't budge the share price much as the trades mostly blend in with the other patterns shown, but they do provide upward pressure and momentum. On a smaller stock, those pressures are exacerbated.

If the amount of options open is high enough, *and* the stock has the right properties, *and* there is large external upwards pressure on the stock, then it forces the price to the next strike, sparking a chain reaction (this is the squeeze) that will continue until equilibrium is attained.

This stock currently displays all the qualities that a typical gamma squeeze candidate should have.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am **NOT** saying that it will gamma squeeze, I am simply stating that the building blocks are actually there and it could."

2021-06-02 17:03:07,wallstreetbets,"Can I make sure with you that I understand this correctly?

I purchased $400 of options and $400 of shares.

At $8.xx I got about 50 shares.

Onto the options buying, I purchased 40 options (which I believe means 4,000 shares) for $400 at (not sure what this means) a limit price of $0.10.

So if this stock does hit $13 or more at or before June 18th, what does that mean for me and what should I realistically do to maximize profits? I thought it meant I’d make ~$5 per share but I clearly don’t understand this well lol, it’s my first time ever doing it.

Also, it seems like if this doesn’t occur then worst case scenario I only lose $400 since I didn’t exercise said option. I guess I just wanna know what happens if I do exercise this option like in the paragraph above.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From Nrd in private chat. Just copy pasting what he chatted me so don't get on me about the language. (Edit:  I'm editing out language and trying to condense it to the relevant information)

(some people) *did a quick 20 second scan, looked at float, looked at percent of float shorted, and ran some remedial math*

*Then (some people) compounded that by looking at the shares that will come into play if the 13c strike hits and compared it to total volume, not bothering to look and see the vast majority of volume is on block whereas the majority of acquisition to cover calls would be on sweep.What he failed to realize in so doing was that Total (the oil company), the state worker's pension funds in California and Wisconsin, Dimensional Fund Advisors, SSgA, and some other mutual fund I can't think of off the top of my head control the vast majority of the ""available"" float, but with the exception of Total, none of them ever sell.  The California fund, especially, because they have a mandate to hold a certain amount of green energy equity.*

(There was also a failing to) *understand the level of institutional ownership, the intraday short interest (which he could have gone to an old DD I did in OG's to see proof of that particular brand of fuckery) in relation to retail ownership in order to tie it all together to understand that over 2 million shares coming to bear on something that has ridiculously small sweep volume would have sent the price rocketing.*

*There is also what volatility would have done on something that has been channel bound for weeks as IB's trade the underlying equity between themselves to keep it pegged.*

People *then could further looked to the last time sweep orders were strong and witnessed firsthand how the company can move 25-40% in a single day with very little momentum*"
2021-06-02 17:49:10,wallstreetbets,"Well, somebody did. I don't have all the answers for you but I do remember seeing that most of the ""float"" is actually locked up in places that don't trade them and that the full story on this company was something that was deeper than a quick scan could reveal. I was also saying mix of shares and calls, and like 50 people were saying that the shares alone were worth it. The thesis was it was shoved down from like 18 to like 8 because of short attacking, something that has been proven true, and could just as easily be put back up. Somebody even found something on CNN saying the stock should go up 230% this year from where it is now.

2021-06-02 16:25:23,wallstreetbets,"The goal isn't 13 by 6/18, that won't cause a gamma squeeze. The goal is to shove the delta up as quickly as possible (preferably in the middle of the week as most squeezes tend to occur on Wednesdays) so to do this would require a very fast hard shove (doable) that drives the delta from 0.07 to something like 0.4 or 0.5 by either next Wednesday or the one after. This would accelerate buying as the MM's move it to hedge causing the delta to jump rapidly (gamma). If it's close to 13 on Friday, it's easy for a HF to just short the shit out of it that day to keep it below the threshold, but if it's close to 13 on Wednesday then that's a lot of capital to keep it suppressed if people keep buying shares and it's much much easier and cheaper to go long."

2021-06-02 18:53:37,wallstreetbets,Partially. But really any uptick in volume is enough to send this moving on its own terms. The float isn’t really all available. A lot of it is tied up in mutual funds and by long term owners who will very likely not sell. So heavy volume and the little bit of actual float available will allow for a bigger timeline

2021-06-02 16:13:55,wallstreetbets,"You’re good my guy. We all learn somewhere. So buying contracts, you have no obligation. How contracts work is that you have the OPTION not OBLIGATION to purchase shares at that price. As long as you don’t get into SELLING options, buying options only puts you on the hook for the amount you paid for them. If it doesn’t hit they expire and you’re just out what you bought them for"
2021-06-02 16:15:14,wallstreetbets,"No, call options give you the *option* to purchase shares, not the *obligation.* Your max loss is the amount you spend to purchase the option, $300 in your example."
2021-06-02 17:23:51,wallstreetbets,"So I’m a little confused what options you bought. It really depends on the strike price. So let’s say for example you bought the 13’s. If the stock hits $13.01, then you could execute your contract and you would buy 100 shares for $13 and then be able to sell them for $13.01, so you’d make a profit. The higher the stock goes, the higher the arbitrage profit is. So at $16, you can still buy the stock at $13, and make 3 a share when re-selling the shares you just bought. Maximizing profits is difficult, as its a lot about predicting the price. Let’s say you really believe the stock will hit $20 by 6/18. Then you’d be better off buying further priced options than 13 as there is less interest in those as they are inherently riskier. A lot of this has to do with the rate of decay with an option too, the closer you get to expiry date (in this EX 6/18) the more erratic option pricing becomes, as its more dangerous to hold an out of the money option near expiration. 

Option contract prices can swing wildly up and down and are not just based the difference in your strike and the underlying asset. A $1 change doesn’t equal a $1 shift in the option, it could be way more or way less depending on how extreme a change that is in the stock. IE. Apple swinging by a dollar is eh, CLNE by a dollar is Whoa! The price depends on the underlying Greeks (math that prices options). Things that effect contract prices are time till expiry, implied volatility, strike price and a few more things 

Also, as long as you’re just buying options, you’re just on the hook for how much you bought it for. (Note: Im not saying you can’t sell a contract that you own. If i buy a contract for 0.01 i now own that and can sell it at any time, still being on the hook only for 0.01). People get themselves into unlimited liability issues when they sell calls, as a stock could theoretically infinitely go up.

I believe I understand the concept that if the stock flys, then I can exercise my options at $13 per share and then sell to make that money depending on what it hits.

But I’m a little confused on what happens if I just want to sell the option rather than exercise them.. I guess I’m just not following what it means for this stock go up even $1 and how that could affect the options I’ve purchased.

Here’s the options I bought (I spent $400 on these options):

2021-06-02 16:34:07,wallstreetbets,"So, selling the contract is just selling the contract. When you sell the option, you are selling the same option you had to buy 100 shares at that price. What you’re talking about is EXECUTING the contract, which you can do at any time (but you don’t have to). That is when you buy 100 shares at whatever the option contract price is (no matter the current price) and the contract evaporated. IE: I own a contract to buy 100 shares at 10$. It costs 0.01 (it doesn’t but whatever). If i sell that later for 0.08, i have given someone else the option to execute that contract, and I no longer can."
2021-06-02 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,"Other folks have answered, but I'll try to make it more simple. It's usually not the goal of call option buying to actually exercise the option and buy those shares at expiration. If you are bullish and think the stock will go up, then you would likely just buy the shares outright instead of the call option. Buying the call option is aimed at making a good return on less up front expense. Keep in mind, if the stock did go above $13 and you choose to exercise the option, you would have to put up $1300 right away, even if you wanted to turn around and sell those shares right back into the market. With stocks like Amazon, trading at like 3500, that's would mean you're on the hook for $350,000. So, obviously not ideal in a lot of cases.

But take this example: I buy one share of ABC company for $10. I also buy one call option of ABC for .10 (.10*100=$10), so the call and the stock are worth the same initially. Let's say the stock has been at $10 forever, and the call option had a far out expiration, like six months out, and a strike price of $25. Now, ABC goes up in value to 13.50 in a day (huge! 35% jump!) So my stock I bought for $10 has netted me $3.50 profit. The option however is priced differently based on the factors the other folks mentioned (I won't get into it). All of a sudden, because that stock suddenly surged, it looks way more likely that your call option might hit the strike price, so it's going to be worth more than you paid, probably by quite a bit. You still have a ton of time till expiration, and all of a sudden the stock is making big jumps, so your $10 option could very well be worth double or triple in that one day.


This happened with BB options (and others) in the last two days. I've been sitting on long dated 2023 $42 call options for months and they've been slowly losing value. But in the last two days, even though the stock price is still waaay below the strike price, they're now worth four times what I paid for them."
2021-06-02 17:46:12,wallstreetbets,"u/whatsupbroski

You have two separate positions.

\~50 shares.

40 calls expiring 6/18 at $13 strike price.

Whatever happens to the stock price affects your shares 1:1. If the stock rises to $10, your shares are now $10 each. You can do whatever you want with them, you own them.

On to your options position. Your options were purchased at .10. Because each contract is for 100 shares, multiply .1 by 100 to get $10 per contract. This is why you paid $400 for 40 contracts. Any time between now and end of market hours on 6/18 you can sell your calls. What their value will be will depend on the current price of CLNE, how much time is left before 6/18, and how much price movement is expected in that time/has happened in the past. Your option contracts have a price that is correlated to the price of the underlying asset(CLNE stock in this case), but that correlation is not 1:1 like your shares. The current bid/ask for the option will be displayed in your app, you can sell whenever you want during market hours."

2021-06-02 17:21:42,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand, the June date is significant to push over $13 so that people who have already shorted the stock have to buy shares to cover, because so many options will be in the money as of that date (if it hits $13+). You don’t necessarily need calls for June. You would want shares so it pushes the price towards that $13. In fact, I would prefer to have calls for September, because if a Gamma squeeze happens, you are cutting it super close with the June expirations, whereas you can close the September calls whenever you would like before expiration. So I would rather the flexibility of not having to time my closing perfectly"
2021-06-02 17:31:58,wallstreetbets,well i'd watch tomorrow PM action - make sure u don't overpay w that bid at open; what strikes u trying to get??
2021-06-02 17:49:23,wallstreetbets,I’d hold off on a FD until closer to the June expiration. Shares are the way right now. It won’t happen unless the momentum moves the shares up in price
2021-06-02 17:23:25,wallstreetbets,Oh they are a PITA with options. I think you need a higher level approval than level 1 options to be able to buy calls and puts. Level 1 on Fidelity is basically just selling covered calls and buying calls to close your covered call positions

2021-06-02 17:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Gonna quote nrdRage himself here again. The stock got bullied around a lot in the past and down to an unreasonable low. CLNE is massively undervalued. 

Most of the stocks are locked up in mutual funds and pension fund managers. So most of the float is lcoked up. Citadel happens to have serious amount of short float in this. That's the reason there is barley any volume and why it's so easy to bully the stock around with 0 volume.

Now to the shares: The thesis is that there are these June 13 C that are worth a penny right now. You buy them. The price won't change. You buy shares the price of the option goes up. This works because like said before you don't need much volume to move this around because of most of the float is locked and it already moves on low volume. 

According to him at the strike of 13 and everything under this will be itm causing a series of circuit brakes and driving the price up."
2021-06-02 17:30:03,wallstreetbets,"See this is super frustrating. You didn't understand shit and deleted the post instead of actually trying to understand it. It's not like it's to difficult to read up NrdRages comments on this matter.

2021-06-02 18:34:34,wallstreetbets,"I think I’m truly starting to understand what you’re getting at. Now, am I able to sell the options I’ve already purchased assuming it gains traction way before the strike date? And if so, how do you even know what you’d get for your contract?"

Still awaiting word from Nrd that I can move his chat to me into the main post, but there's also a concern some of his vernacular may trigger an automod so I need his expertise on how to avoid getting the post nuked again. Long story short we all had a breakdown in communication but figured it out in the long run."

2021-06-02 19:15:22,wallstreetbets,"Okay so basically, the options are 0.15 each, at 10 options I pay a premium of 1,50 but do I need the money in my account to pay for the 1000 shares ?"
2021-06-02 17:43:42,wallstreetbets,I'm on the website on a phone.
2021-06-02 17:56:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, basically most of the time people just flip contracts. So once it goes up you’ll just set your price and see if it bites (usually it will if the stock is going up and you set a price that makes sense). 

Personally, I think that is a pretty good position HOWEVER, it all depends on what happens in the coming days. Things are looking good but there could always be a wrench thrown in the works. If it makes you feel better, I also own a bunch of 13’s on 6/18 that I paid quite a bit more for than the current price haha. And you’re welcome, I am but a humble moron on this sub."
2021-06-02 19:04:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, totally. That's really the whole idea with call options. You want the price to move up so that the contract is more appealing, and someone will be willing to pay more for it. If it moves up a lot, it will potentially be worth more than you paid, and if so you can sell it for a profit. You know what's it's worth by looking at the bid/ask spread. The bid is what people have said they're willing to buy it for. The ask is what people are wanting to sell it for. The actual sale price will likely be somewhere in between. In your app, you would click ""sell to close"" and then there is going to be an option to sell at ""market"" or you can choose ""limit"". If you sell at market, it will probably just sell at the lowest bid. If you sell at limit, you can set you price (your ""ask"") You may not get that price, but it won't sell it unless someone is willing to pay that.

Bid/ask spreads can be really large too, so for your options that you bought at .10, the bid/ask might be

.01-.20. 

That means someone has said they'll buy the option but not for more than .01, and someone has said they'll sell the option, but not for less than .20

So you gotta be careful not to always just sell at ""market"" because it might sell to the lowest bid, which could be .01 and in your case would mean you lose 90% of what you paid. If the stock goes way up the bid/ask will as well. If bid/ask was like .15 - .25, then even selling at market you'd get at least .15.

Hope that makes sense. Also remember, time to expiration matters! Options are worth less and less as the expiration approaches, because less time till they expire means less chance that it reaches the strike price. That time value is called Theta, and the decreasing value of options as time passes is called Theta Decay. So, since your options expire 6/18, each day that passes a little bit of value gets chipped away. Even if the stock price moves up a little, it might not be more than theta, and the option will still go down in value. 

It's tricky, I know. Hope that helps. I'm on mobile, so hopefully there aren't too many typos"
2021-06-02 19:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Nope. You can close the contract before expiration by selling it to close it. If the underlying ($CLNE) price goes up from the time you buy the contract, then you will be able to sell the contract for more than you paid. So the difference in premiums is your net gain (or loss)"
2021-06-02 17:49:37,wallstreetbets,"Oh, Fidelity mobile is just the worst.  I have their netbenefits app that sort of works, but it's pretty much just a web portal.  I can pull up the options chain with it though."

2021-06-02 16:36:38,wallstreetbets,I bought 69 shares of amc and 69 shares of bb back in January. I sold all of my amc when it hit 20 last week like a paper hands birch. I'm not making that mistake again.
2021-06-02 17:23:26,wallstreetbets,Doubled down today!
2021-06-02 15:20:28,wallstreetbets,19 shares at $14.15. LFG
2021-06-02 17:11:51,wallstreetbets,5 shares here. Even more broke than you.
2021-06-02 19:06:33,wallstreetbets,3 shares! Mostly in GME lol
2021-06-02 16:35:51,wallstreetbets,are you going to rebuy? Taking out 44k doesnt seem like a good move while AH is 10% up.
2021-06-02 17:42:26,wallstreetbets,Lol we’re already up a lot AH
2021-06-02 18:31:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! That was perfect, do you understand what you linked or were you just being helpful? As I read it the RS-ratio is functionally the first order derivative of the normalized ratio and the RS-Momentum is the second order derivative. The graphs make sense in that context as the momentum decreasing suggests that the ratio will also decrease or more specifically indicates that it will increase less we can use our deduction to infer that it will likely trend down."
2021-06-02 16:55:32,wallstreetbets,same I sold at 20 and I am punching myself in the face
2021-06-02 15:21:09,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 16:00:59,wallstreetbets,15 shares @ 18. Lol
2021-06-02 17:08:07,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t cash it all out. $44k was my gains I took to equal my initial investment. There’s $17k still in thats up to $40k already. I’m using part of the gains to buy BB, and some in reserve to buy down my average or doubles down inDIPs"
2021-06-02 17:44:04,wallstreetbets,Yea but I sold my amc when it dropped back down to like $10 fuck me
2021-06-02 17:16:20,wallstreetbets,"My friends keep being like ""why are you still checking AMC, you aren't in it anymore"" and I honestly can't answer that question."
2021-06-02 19:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse, you could have thrown a good portion of your funds into 6/18 $15 puts when it hit $20. (Like this dumbass did)."
2021-06-02 16:49:10,wallstreetbets,Let’s fucking GO!
2021-06-02 18:42:33,wallstreetbets,"I checked amc and gme everday during the first squeeze despite not being in either one just because i thought it was hilarious that a bunch of self proclaimed retards banded together to just fuck hedge funds simply because they felt like it. Currently in bb rn, but i still check on the others just because its still amusing"
2021-06-02 18:34:22,wallstreetbets,I’m not on AMC cause I’m a dumbass but I check it cause my bro is and i’m happy for him
2021-06-02 19:06:38,wallstreetbets,After I sold my AMC I bought into BB at 9.65 with my gains so maybe I can have a redemption arc 😅
2021-06-02 19:39:32,wallstreetbets,"I had 4 AMC shares (@16). Sold at 29, 31 and 41. Kept the last one just so i can check and enjoy the memes :)"

2021-06-02 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,"I had 100 BB and bought 100 more BB today, actually lowered my cost basis slightly. I hope you tards are right because if it goes GME/AMC mode I'll be sitting pretty even though I made horrible life and financial choices"

2021-06-02 15:22:33,wallstreetbets,This is not a financial advice but I believe it hasn't even started. You are too early. Try next week
2021-06-02 15:54:49,wallstreetbets,"I think it’ll hit $39-$40 
Next week."
2021-06-02 16:49:09,wallstreetbets,I sold a few shares of AMC to buy up more stock. I see it trending the same way AMC did. It’s going to ramp up and then shoot up next week if it’s going to happen. Of course we can’t advise but this is a good price to buy before AMC happens. I got in just in time with AMC and I more than tripled my investment. Sold some AMC to make that investment up and reinvested it into BB. Now I’m holding both. People are rallying behind both but AMC is a little late to make big gains in volume. Diversify your memes my fellow Ape!
2021-06-02 14:42:57,wallstreetbets,Beat me to it
2021-06-02 15:38:19,wallstreetbets,Tres commas in his future

2021-06-02 17:21:25,wallstreetbets,Give me your $300 and I will invest it for you.
2021-06-02 16:36:06,wallstreetbets,"I think BlackBerry is a great stock to be one of your first ones. The company actually has a lot going for it. Cyber security and car computers (what they do now, used to be phones) are incredibly useful in today's world. Been invested in BB for about 5 months and they are just coming out of a several month long slump this past week. Good luck to you."
2021-06-02 14:48:46,wallstreetbets,Bruh BB got FUCKING WINGS LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-02 15:31:00,wallstreetbets,Not much. Just 50 shares. Small fish! Once I close out my AMC though I think I might go in more on BB. It has both good fundamentals/possibilities and meme potential 🚀☎️🥳
2021-06-02 16:22:10,wallstreetbets,Now that’s some good retardation. Thanks for the laugh
2021-06-02 17:33:20,wallstreetbets,Best comment in awhile

2021-06-02 16:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Im curious, what are you guys basing that on?"
2021-06-02 18:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Hopes and dreams. 
The call options for $40 strike next week is already getting an increase in volume. Up over 1200%
And buying volume is 20x higher then average. 
Just a hunch."
2021-06-02 18:08:05,wallstreetbets,Solid intuition
2021-06-02 18:26:47,wallstreetbets,It can drop but that takes big sales to happen. It will be bought up by those loyal to the stock. If it dips I don’t mind just because my investment is safe and I’m playing with gains. If a bad crash happens I can just start over
2021-06-02 17:09:57,wallstreetbets,I think he took it as deep and wide financial advise
2021-06-02 15:34:53,wallstreetbets,Would be amazing to visit those bagholding boomers from 2008

I leave option activity to others but I factor it in as well. Not as well versed and something I’ve been meaning to get into."

2021-06-02 14:40:12,wallstreetbets,It's a volatility halt... It's controlled by the exchange not the broker.
2021-06-02 14:44:05,wallstreetbets,This  happens everywhere for the market to cool down
2021-06-02 16:02:30,wallstreetbets,Im sure they would prefer letting amc go to 100$ today and then crashing back to earth lol
2021-06-02 16:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Amc wont crash at 100, its not even started yet"

Already profitable and that's with only about 6 out of 180 of their viewers being paying users. Also a lot more room to add more users and implement advertising. Very low P/E for a growth company.

2021-06-02 17:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Even as Cathie Woods has been dropping this like a rock (she did the same with BIDU and BABA around earnings), it still has held relatively strong.

Besides that, there have been some massive buys at EOD for DOYU last week. I really think that someone is accumulating shares b/c they expect the merger to go through. DOYU's CEO said sometime in 3Q. So I bout 2023 LEAPs for DOYU and will be exercising once I can make a tidy profit after it turns to HUYA (b/c I doubt I will be able to unload them through selling by that time)."
2021-06-02 16:05:17,wallstreetbets,r/ChinaStocks and r/HuyaStock would love this
2021-06-02 14:55:01,wallstreetbets,But who knows with Chinese stocks. I remember a company that was dubbed “Chinese Starbucks” and that didn’t work out too good
2021-06-02 15:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Hoping this merger goes through. Last I heard, wasn’t looking too good. If it does though, gonna be a nice jump. 

If you truly feel like the merger is going to go through, the DOYU shares would get the bigger pop since they have to be converted to HUYA"
2021-06-02 16:28:32,wallstreetbets,Just picked up some as well before the market closed.
2021-06-02 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,Very rare seeing another HuyaBoss member in the wild
2021-06-02 15:44:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the Europoor award🤣
2021-06-02 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,"True, but in this case you can actually check out Huya and Douyu website and do your own DD. Looks legit to me, pretty much a twitch clone. Everyone knows how big esports is in China and together these guys control 80% of the streaming market. You can also check out NimoTv which is also owned by Huya. They are backed and majority controlled by the biggest company in China. Basically, I trust this company over 90%+ of Chinese stocks listed in USA."
2021-06-02 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,Remeber Chinese Netflix? Chinese amazon?
2021-06-02 19:31:07,wallstreetbets,I think if the huya subreddit had a better name more people would find it. Like HuyaInvestors or just Huya
2021-06-02 17:26:17,wallstreetbets,"yo I noticed in another thread you said if the merge happens the stock will drop even more. Is that correct, and why?"
2021-06-02 19:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Possibly, I might try and create one, don’t want to splinter the community though

Edit: Just created r/HUYAStock"
2021-06-02 17:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it’s because of the arbitrage (difference of price between Huya and Douyu). 

The proposed deal will give shareholders of Douyu 0.73 shares of Huya after the merger. Right now that would put the price of Douyu around $11, while its currently trading at like $7.6. 

This is why Huya is so heavily shorted, because you have so many hedge funds betting that the deal goes through. You also have a ton of hedge funds on the other side of the trade betting it fails. 

Once the deal closes, the price gap will also close instantly, dropping Huya and raising Douyu. On the flip side, if the merger is blocked that 35% of Huya shorts will cover instantly and likely send Huya price flying, while all those on the long side of Douyu just holding for the merger will sell.

Bottom line, it’s highly uncertain and no one knows the actual likelihood of what the Chinese government will choose to do. From reports I have looked at coming out of China, they want large concessions from Tencent and they have made little progress. The anti trust case ultimately has less to do with Huya and Douyu and more to do with the Chinese government wanting to control Tencent and stop them dominating every industry.

I’m not into making bets on what the Chinese government will do, because I have no idea. Either way, merger or not, this company is severely undervalued and the price will rise at some point to reflect true value, which is why I decided to buy LEAPs."
2021-06-02 19:37:59,wallstreetbets,"I think it could be worth a shot. I mean, just having a subreddit named Huya would be much easier to find. Also it'd be nice if the Huya subreddit had images of the iconic Tiger logo so it's easy to identify. HuyaBoss has nothing. I was actively looking for a Huya subreddit and had a hard time finding HuyaBoss."
2021-06-02 19:15:39,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you all talking about the merge. Deal or not, HUYA is so undervalued it’s insane. Leading streaming platform in China by far for gaming industry, decent growth, lots of cash. I mean deal or not it’s just undervalued at this point."
2021-06-02 18:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful breakdown, appreciate the response!"
2021-06-02 19:38:35,wallstreetbets,"I think r/HUYA was banned unfortunately, can’t even create a new one"
2021-06-02 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,"hmm, that's a shame"
2021-06-02 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,"I’ve just created r/HUYAStock, I haven’t got time to do much to it tonight but I’ll polish it in the morning"

2021-06-02 14:27:13,wallstreetbets,Any halt is instructed by policy for Wall Street because of too big a swing.
2021-06-02 14:30:11,wallstreetbets,"AMC is cheap to buy so people are going for it. It's simple FOMO and people see it going towards GME. The halts are due to volatility so that happens. 

Similar pattern and hopefully we go up up and away"
2021-06-02 14:44:13,wallstreetbets,Was thinking I’d sell AMC at $69.69.  Now thinking $420.69
2021-06-02 14:30:53,wallstreetbets,I like movies. I like popcorn!
2021-06-02 14:26:19,wallstreetbets,Good pep talk. The Apes are now ready for battle
2021-06-02 14:39:24,wallstreetbets,"We get lunch dips everyday. But beyond that what i think we r seeing is hf not learning while apes evolve.

The patterns are very close to January. This past weekend someone posted this huge explanation with charts and grafts based of January and it stated a 90% chance to hit 64$+ on or b4 6/10 with 2 dips. It didnt account for AMC announcement on Tuesday and Wednesday.

So we hit 69$ today.

2021-06-02 14:41:54,wallstreetbets,So when does the momentum get destroyed by treacherous brokers and a broker that doesn't have sufficient liquidity?
2021-06-02 14:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday i heard this youtuber say that hedgies cant buy any more shorts because they were maxed out. Can someone confirm? Because if this is true we are gonna go brrrr without a doubt. (We are going anyway but then they are not able to crash it with shorts, only selling pressure)"
2021-06-02 17:52:11,wallstreetbets,Post about patterns but no crayon pics? I'm out
2021-06-02 14:30:31,wallstreetbets,I noticed the same pattern. IF it follows GME then that means the next 2 days could show big gains.
2021-06-02 16:40:12,wallstreetbets,GME has a lot more potential tho the short interest has always been much higher
2021-06-02 15:25:08,wallstreetbets,I like movies and video games.
2021-06-02 17:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it definitely went up. Just like GME did. Very astute observation. Great post."

2021-06-02 14:24:13,wallstreetbets,"yeah i believe we are following the same route just like GME, Robinhood is doing the same thing as before"
2021-06-02 15:10:26,wallstreetbets,FOMO moved from GME to AMC. Now the FOMO from AMC is moving to BB
2021-06-02 14:28:28,wallstreetbets,yea I'm curious if it gaps up again AH or what. Float is a lot larger than GME so harder for it to move yet its still moving.
2021-06-02 14:31:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, so is C.L.O.V., but nobody wants to have that conversation 🙄"

2021-06-02 14:26:43,wallstreetbets,Rkt following AMC/GME pattern?
2021-06-02 16:51:44,wallstreetbets,"You new here? Wtf? This is common sense, amc is the distraction to deter people from buying more GME. The less people that own GME the less they have to pay out to the real unicorn. Go and do some DD on GME and you’ll see what the real stock is. Why do you think mainstream media is paid to hide it? DO YOUR RESEARCH"
2021-06-02 17:17:55,wallstreetbets,Honestly. Amc might be the real MOASS. Gme share price is too high for regular folks to fomo.
2021-06-02 15:14:47,wallstreetbets,The only thing I worry about amc... Is the halts letting the shorts out for cheap
2021-06-02 14:41:28,wallstreetbets,I feel like gme was manipulative in terms of hedge funds. Like robinhood stopping all selling or buying really screws with a pattern. Amc will just go up and up and away.
2021-06-02 16:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Where do these stairs go?
They go up."
2021-06-02 16:12:44,wallstreetbets,"[This post was made 4 days ago talking about the comparison between AMC and GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnpn9z/amc_gme_price_action_comparison_before_their/). There's some fortune telling from there.

[And here's something about the rallying in AMC recently by someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqa5x8/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue/)."
2021-06-02 16:37:26,wallstreetbets,It’s more explosive at this price point. Lots of room to run

2021-06-02 15:07:18,wallstreetbets,"Uh oh. Just saw AMC being talked about on CNBC. Is it time to sell yet?

*later edit*
Ok I’m holding strong. No paper hands over here"
2021-06-02 14:31:39,wallstreetbets,"Correct on the halt reason. I am interested in the pattern, in both cases of GME and AMC the activity of a huge dip, halt again then slow climb occured. For GME it then spiked up. I'm holding my popcorn"
2021-06-02 14:32:21,wallstreetbets,I only learned about the GME hype as it blew up ... is this pattern something that could really put AMC over $100? I am a total soft brain noob here and have no idea at what point I should sell and just back out as I clearly don't belong here.
2021-06-02 15:30:34,wallstreetbets,Sell? Was dat.
2021-06-02 16:44:24,wallstreetbets,Always stick to your plan. oR go full retard ! Wishing amc gang the best of luck :)
2021-06-02 14:38:08,wallstreetbets,Looks like they just shifted the driver seat to amc. Gme moved at the same interval it did last week following (+15 minutes) an AMC spike. Tendies for everyone 🚀🚀🚀 check out BB too Jesus 🤩

2021-06-02 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,It isn’t RH . All exchanges were halted.
2021-06-02 14:36:56,wallstreetbets,It is across all exchanges i think in the whole world. If a stock is explosive to the up or downside there is a cooldown of 5 minutes i believe
2021-06-02 14:28:46,wallstreetbets,"I dont think so. I'm not advising for nor against any stock, just dumb ape who like patterns and popcorn"
2021-06-02 17:20:26,wallstreetbets,No. Buy more AMC. Stop asking stupid questions.
2021-06-02 17:12:36,wallstreetbets,"bro, did you not see what amc did today?  if you're YOLO'd in on GME and cant buy into AMC, then just HODL, and when the time comes (6/9, right?) the time will come.  otherwise, you cant tell poeple that this isnt real, b/c the hedgies are really hurting rn."
2021-06-02 18:14:41,wallstreetbets,Great posts. Thanks for sharing
2021-06-02 15:40:01,wallstreetbets,CNBC reporting is going to get the FOMO hype train moving. That’s what it did with GME. I think tomorrow is another huge day.
2021-06-02 15:10:01,wallstreetbets,No? Lol
2021-06-02 14:35:22,wallstreetbets,I’m holding popcorn because I get free popcorn now as an amc stockholder.
2021-06-02 14:35:13,wallstreetbets,When amc was 30 (yesterday) people were doubting if it could hit 50 this week lol
2021-06-02 14:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I see AMC going over $100. Unfortunately, no one knows when is the time to sell or buy. If we did, we would be much richer haha 

Learn how to use sell limits if you fear of losing. That way you limit your loss on profits. Sucks to not make the most but sucks even more losing it all. In the end, do what feels comfortable to you."
2021-06-02 14:38:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah it could. This feels like GME when it was $70 right before going into the $200s.
2021-06-02 14:36:29,wallstreetbets,"You like tendies? Cuz if you do you belong here.
Ape together strong. 🌕🦍"
2021-06-02 14:45:14,wallstreetbets,Nobody knows. Just keep in mind that the people saying AMC to 100 are the same people who were saying GME to $1000.
2021-06-02 18:48:16,wallstreetbets,"“This pattern” isn’t really anything. 

There’s a thing called “technical analysis” (TA), which people use to follow all sorts of indicators, price trends, etcetera etcetera. While technical analysis (in its truest forms, using proper indicators) can be right plenty of the time, it’s equally likely to be wrong. A lot of people dismiss it as total BS.

This post right here is even less certain than TA. OP isn’t following any sort of indicators, they’re just saying “other stock did a similar thing, so I think this stock is going to do thing that other stock did”. While AMC could certainly hit $100, it’s INCREDIBLY unlikely that it’s going to see the same movement/trajectory that GME did."
2021-06-02 16:45:20,wallstreetbets,The color red isn’t real
2021-06-02 15:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Gme is also up 15% ... (amc up over 100% today)

2021-06-02 14:39:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah there was that post yesterday that AMC wouldn’t go past $38.50. Obv it completely blew last it
2021-06-02 14:47:28,wallstreetbets,Right! So doubting said would never ever happen
2021-06-02 15:38:17,wallstreetbets,Whoa whoa with the solid logic and reasoning. I’m just here to jam crayons up my ass and eat bananas for scale.
2021-06-02 17:47:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm so damn nervous, bought a few $4 1/21/22 calls in December, never imagined it would go this high, and this fast. I think if it did hit $100 or come close I'd sell them."
2021-06-02 14:41:21,wallstreetbets,"I do for sure, and I am not super concerned because I already felt like I ""lost"" the $165 I spent a few months ago to get my AMC shares... this is all a pleasant surprise for sure. Just thinking through whether or not I should set a price to sell at - not understanding any of this stock stuff makes me feel like it is not a game I should be playing lol."
2021-06-02 15:16:53,wallstreetbets,However AMC only needs ~50% gain right now to hit 100 and it has 110%+ gain today. GME needed 4x more growth when it was being touted as 1k.
2021-06-02 15:36:00,wallstreetbets,"True, GME had back to back 100% gain days. I still think this thing rockets tomorrow."

2021-06-02 15:20:09,wallstreetbets,"I am in the same position as you. What you can do is put a limit sell order for $75 for amc for 1/3rd of your shares.
So you make some of your cash back but be sure to hold and not sell after that. Seems if no one sells then that's how the stock will skyrocket"

The Annual Shareholders Meeting announcement went up earlier today, and very curiously it's only scheduled to last 15 minutes:

I wonder if that's an indicator that they're going to announce a postponement due to excessive vote count / synthetic share hijinks."
2021-06-02 16:43:29,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't just RH. Its a Wall St regulation to halt trading temporarily on certain stocks to prevent stock market crashes when the stock's volatility gets very high.

Think it's happened 4 times today, and it's required.

[Trading Curb / Circuit Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb)

What RH did to GME wasn't this and they are dirtbags for doing it. Fuck RH.

Edit: Today with AMC and back in March (?) with GME are different because a trading curb prevents TRADING of the stock, RH only prevented BUYING the stock, but people could still sell it. Very different."

2021-06-02 18:22:40,wallstreetbets,"Serious question, if OS is so good then why $BB was trading sub $6 until apes came in?"
2021-06-02 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,Is BB being shorted by hedge funds? Does it have a chance to go up to a few hundred dollars a share on that alone?
2021-06-02 19:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Liked the rockets, bought 10"
2021-06-02 17:40:08,wallstreetbets,I understand that BB has potential and is under valued but this is a big jump for a non shorted stock isn't it? I'm in 500 at 9.50 and plan on buying more just wondering if there will be a drop after the hype is gone?  Should I wait for that?  I think stock price will go up but is it going to fast?
2021-06-02 14:39:47,wallstreetbets,"30% loss for me since January, held strong, finally seeing green makes me 💦"

2021-06-02 17:18:26,wallstreetbets,What about a new and secure BlackBerry phone exclusively  for apes holding bb shares ? Popcorn worked for AMC why not not handsets .... the co can use proceeds by taking advantage of stock price rise and thank us shareholders for giving them the capital to develop and improve upon the old bb handset .... sort of kidding about this .... or maybe not .... what does everyone think about the bb phone exclusively for ape shareholders ?
2021-06-02 17:25:16,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias achieved

2021-06-02 14:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Is BB getting squeezed like AMC+GME were? Wasnt that the catalyst for why they shot up like they did? Why do we think BB will rocket too?

Im literally a newbie just trying to figure this out, someone explain me like 5"
2021-06-02 16:38:18,wallstreetbets,Nothing about this rise in price has anything to do with the quality of BB as a company. We all know that.

2021-06-02 19:52:15,wallstreetbets,Is there a working example being used on BB smartphone?  Aren’t they using Android?
2021-06-02 14:25:47,wallstreetbets,Big words and a lot of words. Let’s just trust him I’m in.

2021-06-02 16:34:06,wallstreetbets,TBH if this guy's right (who the fuck know not my smooth brained ass) then it's bad news for us. We want the company to be junk so we can drive the price up to squeeze the hedgies and force them to buy BIG to cover. If it actually has real value the hedgies won't short it as hard.
2021-06-02 19:19:00,wallstreetbets,"You son-of-a-bitch, I'm in..."

2021-06-02 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,People need to know that not everyone will hold onto their $AMC shares and the price will drop eventually. So time to sell and invest on BB.
2021-06-02 16:43:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 18:02:56,wallstreetbets,Oh god I wish. I had more of my funds invested in BB than AMC since half a year ago.

2021-06-02 16:02:28,wallstreetbets,You think GME short interest is 20%..?
2021-06-02 16:15:07,wallstreetbets,"GME is SURELY only shorted 20% 
SURELY"

2021-06-02 16:24:23,wallstreetbets,Lol 20% SI for GME.

2021-06-02 16:14:54,wallstreetbets,Except the GME is shorted minimum 200% and all ftds are hidden in etfs or deep itm puts
2021-06-02 16:15:02,wallstreetbets,"""GME 20%""... LOL

Rip to all excellent DD's"
2021-06-02 16:15:31,wallstreetbets,You serious believe that GME has SI at 20% 😂😂😂
2021-06-02 15:04:02,wallstreetbets,Already called my local lambo dealer today so kinda no way back at this point
2021-06-02 16:10:23,wallstreetbets,Wow 50% SHORT INTEREST!!! More than GME AND AMC COMBINED?!??! JEEZ I BEETTER SELL MY GME TO GET IN ON THIS BECAUSE SHORTS COVERED IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY RIGHT!!
2021-06-02 15:57:54,wallstreetbets,All my money is in Amc tho and I don’t know how to sell 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-02 19:13:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm smart like Warren Jimmy Buffet.  I'm diversified into AMC, GME, and CLOV."
2021-06-02 15:46:56,wallstreetbets,Why do you think CLOV  is more shorted than GME? And have a brighter future too?
2021-06-02 17:04:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not gonna try to argue about AMC and GME but there has been some DD of CLOV posted before and it does look ripe for a squeeze.

The DDs

&#x200B;

The options chain for 18/6 is also primed for a gamma squeeze. The 9 strikes went in to the money after hours today, if it holds 10 by the 18th there's another 28k contracts plus whatever people buy between now and then.

It's shot up from $7.75 at open and it's currently at $9.69 in after hours as of this comment.

AMC and GME are not the only plays in the world guys, getting in at \~$10 per share means you can buy far more shares compared to $64 and $280 for AMC and GME"

I am in."
2021-06-02 19:40:13,wallstreetbets,"I believe when the squeeze happen for this stock, the CEO of the stock would want to keep it trading at a minimum of $30 for 90 days so that they could sell off the shares they own. This means that they wouldn't be diluting it as they NEED the share price to be at $30 for 90 days before they can sell off their shares. A bonus would be for Chamath to use his connections and help us Apes to squeeze the hedgefund dry."

2021-06-02 14:26:28,wallstreetbets,CLOV is absolutely the next squeeze. It’s primed and ready! I’m long

2021-06-02 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,Your thesis assumes the 20% short interest on GME is even close to the actual reality.

2021-06-02 15:04:36,wallstreetbets,CLOV has higher short interest than AMC.  I am in AMC and CLOV.  When AMC takes off I will dump all my profits into CLOV.  You can't go wrong with a sub $9 healthcare stock that has great fundamentals on its own without a squeeze.
2021-06-02 15:11:55,wallstreetbets,"TITS JACKED. 35,000 shares!"
2021-06-02 14:52:21,wallstreetbets,CLOV is the way

2021-06-02 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,Apes coming soon
2021-06-02 14:41:18,wallstreetbets,CLOV is the place to go with these sweet GME and AMC tendies. The short interest is crazy and the price is an insane bargain given the company's growth profile.
2021-06-02 14:58:36,wallstreetbets,I agree CLOV is next. Let’s take it to the moon.

2021-06-02 14:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Totally agreed, this is the next one to pop up. It has a good short interest and can easily be squeezed compared to NOK which is much larger in market cap."

2021-06-02 18:22:52,wallstreetbets,You know all those stories that start “What if I told you”... yeah they all make me cry in the end.....$200/share might bring some tears!
2021-06-02 18:24:50,wallstreetbets,Not to interested in the si. But this will pop off by the growth alone. Everything else is a bonus.
2021-06-02 18:26:45,wallstreetbets,Clov apes 🦍

2021-06-02 16:23:08,wallstreetbets,This post is suspect as fuck. If you knew anything about the “reported short interest” for these companies you wouldnt be touching 90% of them.

2021-06-02 15:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Good growth company for long term. 40% SI and prime for a squeeze short term. Highly manipulated by shorts to keep the price down, once shorts cover, we gonna see exponential growth. Either way, good for both long and short term investment. Hold, don’t sell for penny gains. This will be the next AMC. Holding 1800@9.3 and not worried one bit."

They have a lawsuit for deceptive business practice and the CEO was sued for fucking over *hospitals* at his last company. This is a shithead investment if I ever saw one."
2021-06-02 19:14:27,wallstreetbets,">Clover Heath is Medicare reimagined with a government contract

They're a Medicare Advantage plan with some population health data layered on top to increase capitation profits. 

Not saying it's a bad investment, but they're certainly not doing anything that isn't already available from every other brand name commercial payor, as well as a broad selection of other niche providers.

I think if you aren't familiar with the industry, the San Franciscp buzzword proficiency might lead you to overestimate the novelty."

2021-06-02 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,70 shares bought at 6.9 (nice) wish i had bigger balls cause i was this close to buy 1500 shares
2021-06-02 16:02:53,wallstreetbets,"I'd suggest MFA, 4$ and so far haven't retrieved back to pre-pandemic($8-10). Financial would be hot after lockdown being lift. However fire needs to be focused. Therefore, AMC for now

Edit: btw, are you guys trying to dig the next stock to play with? If that's the case then seriously looking at that stock. In terms the industry it is in. If this legendary could be replicated (first gaming now entertaining) in finance, it'll a symbolic sign"
2021-06-02 16:17:28,wallstreetbets,"Placed an order for 22 shares, it might be on hold for 3 days. Am I too late?"

2021-06-02 16:28:48,wallstreetbets,There is no play until GME is over
2021-06-02 16:33:47,wallstreetbets,This guy said 20% SI 🤣😂🤣
2021-06-02 16:36:21,wallstreetbets,Already in CLOV so a great post this 👍
2021-06-02 16:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Really wonderfull DD, better sell all my GME to get into this…."

2021-06-02 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,Have never heard of this “CLOV” stock before. Definitely have not read hundreds of posts about it the last few months- plz tell us moar!!1!! SI 50% WOWzers
2021-06-02 16:53:26,wallstreetbets,I hope. Been losing money on these guys ever since I lost money and then decided to try again in an effort to lose more money.
2021-06-02 16:59:47,wallstreetbets,aaaaaaaand their under investigation.
2021-06-02 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,This is the worst DD I've seen if you think GME SI is 20%. Man this sub has gone to poop in the past few months
2021-06-02 17:17:29,wallstreetbets,"LOL. This is some nonsense. Literally the same post as u/haha_squirrel. Care to explain? 

Maybe add some depth to this analysis? That would be great to see."
2021-06-02 17:31:59,wallstreetbets,Have fun getting fucked in the ass by Chamath
2021-06-02 17:33:15,wallstreetbets,4 employees?
2021-06-02 17:41:32,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-02 18:16:54,wallstreetbets,Well the titles says it all. You have no idea what’s going on with the market. Didn’t even read the rest but I’m just gunna assume you’re pumping MVIS or CLOV. GME SI over 100%
2021-06-02 19:48:50,wallstreetbets,"It’s a relatively new SPAC, there are warrants issued when the SPAC began trading, in many cases the original investors will short common and exercise a warrant to cover, if they sell common at $11-$12 and warrants are exercisable at $7.50 or up to $10 they pay that to receive the $11-$12 proceeds and it’s a risk less trade but short interest looks bigger than reality"

2021-06-02 17:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention simply adding 20% to 20% and saying CLOV has more short interest than those two companies combined isn't \*exactly\* how percentages work, considering different market caps and all that."
2021-06-02 16:25:22,wallstreetbets,Probably closer to 220%.
2021-06-02 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that right there tells me all I need to know about this post."
2021-06-02 18:28:59,wallstreetbets,"Let's say for the sake of argument GME's actual short interest *is* over 100% still. Then at what price point should we expect the squeeze to happen? 

The problem with the whole ""GME's SI is still super high"" argument is that it can't be disproven. At least not in any way that you would believe."
2021-06-02 18:41:25,wallstreetbets,We gonna ignore that S3 is known to put out shit short interest numbers?
2021-06-02 18:54:03,wallstreetbets,Is it fuci
2021-06-02 16:37:23,wallstreetbets,"20%? 

Riiiiiiggggghhhhhtttttt.... 

And stop calling me Shirley!"
2021-06-02 16:41:07,wallstreetbets,"The shorts said they ""covered"" in January they wouldn't lie.  And don't call me Shirley."
2021-06-02 18:19:39,wallstreetbets,Ummm no it’s not 20 % and don’t call me Shirley!
2021-06-02 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Man I got that from market beats, are they unreliable?"
2021-06-02 15:51:59,wallstreetbets,Blockbuster?

2021-06-02 15:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Since it's too late to save RadioShack, what is our next move?"
2021-06-02 16:19:07,wallstreetbets,No I worked for them back in the day. I'm glad RadioShack is gone. To an extent.
2021-06-02 17:25:09,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t a regular shopper at RadioShack but I feel like they needed to find a niche given their small foot space. Either go full electronics hobbyist by selling parts and stuff or they could have gone full blown phone, tablet, laptop retailer. 

I still think somewhere to build robots and IoT devices would be really cool. I’ve been wanting to get into IoT but find it really hard to make the leap beyond the basic arduino/raspberri pi into more advanced actuators, sensors, displays etc and build anything useful.

Partially because I don’t want to spend money experimenting with random things. It would be cool to have somewhere to try things out and talk to hobbyists. Perhaps have meetups and training sessions"

2021-06-02 17:34:34,wallstreetbets,OP post has zero credibility. SI alone means nothing without considering the free float and institution %
2021-06-02 16:49:07,wallstreetbets,I thought from the websites I was looking at but by everyone’s reaction I think I’m wrong 😂
2021-06-02 16:45:11,wallstreetbets,😂 first thing I thought 😂
2021-06-02 15:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Too late, I already took all their lambos"
2021-06-02 16:17:39,wallstreetbets,I called mines too. I told them see y’all in a few weeks
2021-06-02 16:12:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah. This is CLEARLY FUD. Look at all the awards all ready and only 500 upvotes.
2021-06-02 17:25:02,wallstreetbets,"OP has the short interest wrong, but this is not FUD. I have balls deep positions in both GME and CLOV."
2021-06-02 16:16:33,wallstreetbets,Totally
2021-06-02 16:14:14,wallstreetbets,"No, don’t get out of gme til it’s squeezed! I’m just saying this is a good target after"
2021-06-02 17:07:09,wallstreetbets,Apes do not sell
2021-06-02 16:15:09,wallstreetbets,He said in his post that GME and AMC are shorted 20% each and that clov is shorted at above 40%. I thaught GME was shorted way more than that so I don’t know who to believe
2021-06-02 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Insiders can’t even sell till it’s 30$ for 90 days - they have Chelsea Clinton on the board of directors.  Obviously she won’t let this company fail, it’s her healthcare baby.

Read the DD on r/clov"
2021-06-02 17:07:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, can’t believe everybody thinks I’m a bot just because I said this was prime for a squeeze 🙄"
2021-06-02 19:26:54,wallstreetbets,To be fair on the initial runup of GME everybody started saying the next was AMC. Turns out they were right it just took a couple months
2021-06-02 17:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get that and I’ve lost money on a lot of those (MVIS being the worst, I went all in). I just all the sudden have money in my account and wanted to find something. I AM NOT saying anybody should sell the shit already squeezing lol"
2021-06-02 19:13:59,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t say RIDE is a bad call tbh because I think it still has a way to go. If you literally got in this morning you would be up 20%
2021-06-02 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,This is nothing wait a few days
2021-06-02 14:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Oh I agree, ride that as long as you can, I know I am. I just think this one is next!"
2021-06-02 15:12:07,wallstreetbets,looool this comment made me laugh out loud. if / when she dumps you This clov girl makes some great tendies.

2021-06-02 16:56:31,wallstreetbets,SLV (PSLV is better) is on its way to 52 week high as well but just a slower moving market with silver.
2021-06-02 15:00:27,wallstreetbets,Next week will be too late

2021-06-02 17:53:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah volume is what causes the shorts to have to cover!
2021-06-02 19:31:49,wallstreetbets,In the Clov group we have several good DD posts.   Ant man is spot on with his research.
2021-06-02 17:10:36,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair, but I feel like it’s too late now or they’ll call me spam.."
2021-06-02 15:09:02,wallstreetbets,CLOV cause we care. 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 14:44:37,wallstreetbets,why do all these comments seem fake
2021-06-02 15:14:09,wallstreetbets,Yup 1000% agree
2021-06-02 15:17:35,wallstreetbets,"No, it isn't. 

Chamlalth Palpythahiyah is allowed to have a couple duds. 

$CLOV is a dud. 

Healthcare/insurance services are a dime a dozen. Their ""proprietary tech platform"" isn't anything special. Also, the investigation from the US Department of Justice right out of the gate **that they failed to mention to investors** shit right on this post-SPAC launch. 

There are *much* better (SAFER) places to put your money."
2021-06-02 18:59:02,wallstreetbets,It's not a thesis it's a garbage post. He pulled the info out of his rear. Either that or he works for Kenny and did it on purpose.
2021-06-02 16:51:01,wallstreetbets,Market beats but I’m wrong I guess 😅 still like the stock

2021-06-02 14:26:06,wallstreetbets,Totally agree
2021-06-02 16:26:54,wallstreetbets,So no Gme? Only Amc and clov?
2021-06-02 16:03:30,wallstreetbets,"same, when AMC lands on the moon im putting what i earned into CLOV"
2021-06-02 16:44:59,wallstreetbets,Nope. Dont worry about that. This is FUD AF.
2021-06-02 15:10:32,wallstreetbets,My position is 3k shares @ $8.50 I believe in the company and I believe in WSB. Let’s fuckin go and make those suckers bleeds.

2021-06-02 16:17:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean I’m 27, so most of the time I’m on Reddit I feel like “fellow kids “ lol  

No diversion, I DONT THINK ANYBODY SHOULD EXIT GME OR AMC while it’s rocketing , I just think this is also a good play."
2021-06-02 16:40:19,wallstreetbets,This. Also how there are so many positive replies to this one. Highly sus.
2021-06-02 16:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Can you elaborate..? I’m just a dude trying to make money, is there a reason this one is shorted other then the March report?"
2021-06-02 16:32:11,wallstreetbets,I am not in favor of anybody pulling out of either of those til they are all the way squeezed. Idk what’s up with all the awards but I dig it

2021-06-02 14:08:11,wallstreetbets,"I saw that one too, but after digging in I didn’t think they had as much as an upside as clov, mainly because I could see Biden expanding Medicare ages and sending this thing to Fucking Uranus. Lol"
2021-06-02 17:20:50,wallstreetbets,You are trading for the gamma squeeze not fundamentals. AMC fundamentally is straight garbage but normies (or bots) got it trending on twitter for weeks and everyone bought shit load of calls for the gamma squeeze.
2021-06-02 15:22:26,wallstreetbets,That was cleared up in April to my understanding?
2021-06-02 17:34:03,wallstreetbets,🌈🐻. Get outta here.
2021-06-02 15:59:17,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Would like to know whats the next action from DOJ?

2021-06-02 16:43:58,wallstreetbets,I’m an amc ape. In for CLOV teddies too
2021-06-02 17:13:53,wallstreetbets,Check my history...not a bot...stocks pretty nice and the hedgies fucked it like the other meme stocks. I love gme and amc but I love clov too because I want the hedgies to get fucked everywhere.
2021-06-02 16:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Those are from market beats, is that unreliable?? I’m not trying to trick anyone I’m trying to make money lol"
2021-06-02 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,I have 100 shares and 23 January calls of CLOV plus 87 shares of AMC. Just waiting for AMC to take off and then all of that profits going into CLOV.
2021-06-02 17:36:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s up 20% today, what are you talking about?"
2021-06-02 14:19:30,wallstreetbets,"Funny you say that, I am in on RIDE as well, I just think that’s a long term play!"
2021-06-02 14:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Idk where you’re getting that info, they have 436 employees, give it a google... lol"
2021-06-02 14:53:04,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah but if you google clover jobs you can see they are hiring like crazy
2021-06-02 14:18:48,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about..? Look at AMC right now? Is that not from being so shorted
2021-06-02 14:25:55,wallstreetbets,Huh? No CLOV! Lol
2021-06-02 16:20:38,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-02 16:47:31,wallstreetbets,Lol that’s still a solid move.
2021-06-02 16:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not a fraud, just a guy who found a stock I thought I liked. Really don’t know what’s up with all the awards but I’ll take them."

2021-06-02 18:09:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes my very basic ape math shows that:
About 4-5b of GME and AMC stock is shorted EACH =  8-10b

Only 500m worth of CLOV shares is shorted."
2021-06-02 16:28:14,wallstreetbets,Try %2200
2021-06-02 16:29:11,wallstreetbets,Add a extra zero to that sir
2021-06-02 18:46:01,wallstreetbets,"The other problem is the matter of positions and whether or not they were closed, they say they closed their short positions but I have a feeling that that might just be something that someone that hasn't closed their position would say.

2021-06-02 19:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, same. The stores were nice in what they had, but their management had less intelligence than a bag of smooth rocks."

2021-06-02 19:51:02,wallstreetbets,Shares float??
2021-06-02 16:53:40,wallstreetbets,You are very wrong lmao
2021-06-02 18:06:54,wallstreetbets,Some say it could be shorted several hundred percent possibly over a thousand. It's so bad that it may take a very long time to unravel the mess the SHFs have created by naked shorting GME.  But retail owns the float several times over. And we're not leaving. I like the stock.
2021-06-02 16:53:15,wallstreetbets,Dude do you live under a rock?
2021-06-02 17:53:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm long on CLOV and believe in it, but yeah the SI numbers are self-reported and don't reflect reality for GME. Some quality DD suggests it could be shorted 1000% or more. That being said, CLOV is definitely being suppressed and is fundamentally strong."
2021-06-02 16:51:56,wallstreetbets,Why? Is it more ?
2021-06-02 16:14:26,wallstreetbets,Them AMC calls making millionaires out of a bunch of fucking retards

2021-06-02 16:19:43,wallstreetbets,You dont know who to believe?? Hahaha GTFO. Gme only shorted 20%.. Jesus..
2021-06-02 16:46:53,wallstreetbets,"GME was reported to be short 140% before the sabotaged squeezed in January. Turns out 140% is the legal maximum you can short a company. With how shady short selling is, it's safe to assume it was shorted more than that.

Since the shorts didn't care to report their shorting  of GME, there's no way they would have covered. And had they covered, GME would not be as manipulated as it is now."
2021-06-02 16:50:15,wallstreetbets,"WTF does Chelsea Clinton have to do with anything? And who the fuck is Chelsea Clinton? Is she some kind of business genius?

Anyways, how is this shorted more than GME? That was his main thesis."
2021-06-02 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,I can’t believe I didn’t see this until the market closed.
2021-06-02 18:45:45,wallstreetbets,Well everyone thinks you're a bot because you said AMC and GME short interest is 20% KEK
2021-06-02 15:16:28,wallstreetbets,Haha.... diamond hands makes this an engagement 😂
2021-06-02 17:17:40,wallstreetbets,"Bro, read some of the GME DDs.

But here's a quick mental exercise.

Back in the days of DFV before Apes knew who he was, GME was a failing company. All the genius short sellers jumped on it and shorted it to shit. THAT was before the pandemic.

The pandemic came and every store front had to close.  What do you think happened? The geniuses clearly shorted it even more. AMC was clearly shorted at that time too. Shorters gonna short.

Then the days of DFV came to be. Apes came to be. Apes grab GME and said FU shitty shorters. At that point GME was reported to be shorted 140%. Meaning that was the absolute meaning short interest."

2021-06-02 14:59:32,wallstreetbets,AH today could be lit
2021-06-02 16:52:58,wallstreetbets,Short interest is self reported. On top of that all of those websites are garbage. GME is the most shorted stock of all time
2021-06-02 17:12:07,wallstreetbets,It’s just a shame now all the top comments are gonna be ‘U think GmE sHoRT InterEst is 20%??’  🦧 💩 ugh.

I DO."
2021-06-02 15:14:57,wallstreetbets,Excited people who want to share the good news can sound forced i guess. Clov has been treated like cinderella here on wsb lately. time to shine baby.
2021-06-02 15:29:26,wallstreetbets,It's a 1 month old account that's just spammed clov.  🤔
2021-06-02 16:20:51,wallstreetbets,Heavily upvoted sour nothings.  The whole post is bought.
2021-06-02 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,Not fake. There are a lot of true believers like myself over in the CLOV subreddit.
2021-06-02 16:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that sub has tons of accounts that are all made around the first GME squeeze. I don’t trust it at all."
2021-06-02 16:22:15,wallstreetbets,"I’ve vetted out most of the users that are commenting and they seem legit. That said, what they are saying feels very forced like “hello fellow traders.” Do your DD. If this guy has been around then he should know that 20% SI on GME is a lie at best and nobody else is mentioning it. Be careful everybody and I wish tendies upon all of you"
2021-06-02 15:12:36,wallstreetbets,cause they are
2021-06-02 16:03:23,wallstreetbets,I keep trying to figure out if it’s a joke I’m not in on
2021-06-02 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,"This whole thread is sus af.  There was a guy on Tiktok named MovetheMarket, who tried to pump $CLOV a few months back and it didnt work.  He sold his account after like 3 videos, 200k+ followers.  On this post, Only 649 upvotes with 60% downvoted, disproportionate amount of awards.  I wouldn't touch $CLOV with two condoms on my guy.  Plus so many accounts here are ""new"" with low karma.  Idk, feels really astroturfy"

2021-06-02 15:37:23,wallstreetbets,"if u fall for that, your loss"
2021-06-02 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,"Here is why you are suspect as fuck:

1. Your post is extremely low effort except it has 40 awards.

2. You are claiming this stock has the highest short %, but we know those reported numbers have been fudged since at least February.

3. Your emotional response to “stick it to hedge funds”.

4. Your post history. Huge fucking gap in posts, then you start Pumping RKT and now CLOV (for the 2nd time). 

So... who do you work for?"
2021-06-02 15:16:42,wallstreetbets,But if you’re making more tendies then may be worth it
2021-06-02 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,It’s not on trade republic I don’t know where to get it:(
2021-06-02 16:21:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks but I was hoping for an actual website not an image
2021-06-02 16:26:31,wallstreetbets,"Actually I just did a quick google search and 3 different sites say that CLOV's short interest is at 36%. Still higher than AMC or GME but not the 50% you are stating. 

I'd appreciate how you got the 50% number."
2021-06-02 14:12:03,wallstreetbets,You have any good DD link? I am interested.
2021-06-02 14:10:54,wallstreetbets,Ahh interesting. How long contracts would you get? For next Friday?
2021-06-02 17:22:21,wallstreetbets,Of course. I just wanted to see where he got the info. I’m all about the shorts and gammas and all the stuff I don’t get cause of my smooth brain.
2021-06-02 15:32:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm aware Clover Health responded but couldn't find anything that would clear everything up from April. Do you know if it was a second response from the company or a third party report?

[This](https://medium.com/clover-off-the-charts/in-response-to-short-seller-firms-questions-47798b0b76da) is the response from Clover Health the day after the initial report came out."
2021-06-02 17:38:12,wallstreetbets,It's down 50% from its highs and has been trading flat for months.
2021-06-02 14:38:24,wallstreetbets,That’s why I hold. But it has very large short interest. Reddit Army wants a new AMC. It seems Ride is good replacement of AMC for a short term short squeeze. And it’s a great long call no matter what.
2021-06-02 15:01:34,wallstreetbets,It says that on Robinhood...
2021-06-02 15:07:04,wallstreetbets,Lmao

2021-06-02 16:44:50,wallstreetbets,Why would that be if clov has a higher SI and would be booming more than gme or amc. Unless you think GME actually has a higher SI than it states 🧐
2021-06-02 17:40:28,wallstreetbets,Rad! I’m in.

2021-06-02 16:35:42,wallstreetbets,"At some point you have to work with what’s given by every factual & verifiable outlet of information.  You can believe the short interest is a lie, but that’s getting a little retarded to keep believing at this point."

2021-06-02 16:48:39,wallstreetbets,"So where does that 20% from op come from ?
Thanks for the explaination. I knew I had seen it was more than that.
Edit : nevermind, op replied that he got the info somewhere online but probably not the most reliable source regarding GME"
2021-06-02 16:52:15,wallstreetbets,"Well in terms of healthcare and politics surrounding a healthcare stock like this id say she’s pretty important..  they also have the former trump head of Medicare on board & a partnership with google.

And again insiders can’t sell till 30$ for 90 days.

All you have to do is look up SI on Ortex.

Gme has less than 20% SI.

That’s why it’s having trouble squeezing like BB / AMC / WKHS / SKLZ / TLRY / SNDL / FIZZ / BYND / RKT / BBBY / KOSS / RAD / BLNK / CLOV / SPCE........ hmmm![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)

Yeah I think GME is a bit tapped out...  but go ahead and keep squeezing the last few % out lol I’m not against it....  just take off the tin foil hat and look around."

2021-06-02 15:30:57,wallstreetbets,"I can of think along the line of DFV when he said 'I just don't get how people can't see what I see' when he called the GME short problem. So I think this exasperation gets voiced as frustration and over excitement.



Either that or he's a Vladbot wanting you to close your AMC positions."

2021-06-02 16:53:54,wallstreetbets,"That's the reported short interest as reported to FINRA. But short interest reporting mean jack shit. The fine for not reporting the correct short interest happens 5 years later is only a few thousands.

Where as reporting the right number on GME would probably mean bankruptcy."
2021-06-02 17:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Monday last week GME opened around 170. It's now sitting at 280. It's interesting to call that tapped.

GME has Ryan Cohen and a ton of e-commerce experts on its board. They're hiring engineers left and right. They have a key set up in one of the biggest and growing industry.

CLOV has politics people. And seems to be in a gamble of a field.

It's fine if you see growth potential in it. But don't talk about a short squeeze.

GME has been shorted to shit. And it's mainly naked shorted. There no comparison."

2021-06-02 15:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Whats wrong with believing something that is accurate and true? 

CLOV is a solid company that just released solid earnings. Its also super shorted right now with room to run. A lot of reasons to believe right now."

2021-06-02 16:48:15,wallstreetbets,What’s your cost basis?  You must be a real DFV then huh
2021-06-02 19:14:14,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC kept diluting w/ share offerings, that’s suppose to bring the price down under normal circumstances but it allowed apes to buy up the float instead.  This is epic!

 Well see where AMC goes but anyone trying to get in it now is chasing it and could get dumped on any day now.    I’m just warning fellow apes to be careful here is all.

I’m a GME AMC ape but the point is you can get in early here still on $CLOV before it goes to the moon, look at it after hours already up 23% today

It’s worth fundamentally at least 15$ anyway.  It’s also Expected to hit 30 because the CEO has a huge portion of shares and agreed not to sell anything till the price is 30$ for 90 days.  Chammath called this a 10x company so he expects 100$ in 10 years.  

and because of GME / AMC being Cheered on by Chammath who’s tweet alongside Elon musks gamestonk tweet single handedly pushed GME up 100% the next day in January to actually fuck up melvin.  —Shorts attacked THIS stock because of chammath.  It’s short interest is upwards of 50% and it’s because of a fake short report by Hindenburg and all the same hedge fucks that attacked AMC and gme piled into CLOV!!!

It’s solid- checkout the DD on r/clov"

2021-06-02 17:16:51,wallstreetbets,AMC isn’t even close to be done. Short interest is literally up. Squeeze hasn’t started yet. This price action is literally just fomo and possibly delta hedging

2021-06-02 16:14:54,wallstreetbets,Smart ape will hold AMC and buy BB. Stupid to sell AMC when it's about too Squeeze. Thats like u are about to finish a race in first but u stop right before the finish line to grab a position In 5th. BB will take weeks and will not reach where AMC is headed.
2021-06-02 16:29:41,wallstreetbets,Bb is a good stock. But amc is far from done.  The gamma is just now about to explode

2021-06-02 14:05:28,wallstreetbets,I was thinking of this move this morning and did just that and sold at $28. Now Im a very angry monkey! But my move into bb is paying off too.

If January GME was anything to go by then it's really only one stock in a given squeeze that truly takes off, other stocks end up having significantly smaller subsidiary rises as backdraft from the hype. I doubt we'll see BB have a serious take off, it's just a distraction. BB is the AMC of the GME squeeze."

Held AMC since January. Damn bet if it hits 1000$ I will do it with a smile and my tendies."

2021-06-02 16:19:57,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t really been following, is BB another shorted stock or is there another reason it’s been all over this sub?"

2021-06-02 18:38:44,wallstreetbets,"not financial advice but here is what i would do.

1. Place the same amount of bet that I placed in AMC on something I have my eye on. ( money I was willing to loose).  
2. A portion to pay off debts.
3. Spend a portion on family.
4. Save some for reinvestment assuming there is a market dip. I always wanted to hold full shares of Google and Amazon.
5. maintain some portion liquid as a rainy day fund."
2021-06-02 18:52:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't really understand wash sales. How bad do they fuck you? 

It sounds like if you close out all the related positions, the cost basis gets adjusted so that it works out to the same as taking the short term loss, right?"
2021-06-02 19:00:20,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 7500 shares at 13 bucks. I’m in for the long haul. Unless it goes crazy. So let’s send this son of a bitch to the moon!!!

2021-06-02 16:03:21,wallstreetbets,Qs
2021-06-02 19:34:48,wallstreetbets,BB has the potential to be an explosive short term play while also being a very solid long term hold. Can’t go wrong with BB.
2021-06-02 14:06:11,wallstreetbets,https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1400112472414199809?s=21
2021-06-02 15:08:43,wallstreetbets,I think I messed up. Sold 40% of bb at 15 and put it into jok.
2021-06-02 15:42:24,wallstreetbets,Bb and clov for me

2021-06-02 16:31:43,wallstreetbets,Bb is doing well. I bought in at 11.02 and holding XX shares. I actually think NAKD will be the next squeeze.
2021-06-02 16:55:58,wallstreetbets,NOK
2021-06-02 17:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean NOK is at $5...it will never go below $5, it’s a great stock with nothing to lose. Wtf is $5 ? Push it to $15"
2021-06-02 17:28:34,wallstreetbets,TLRY + SNDL. They are low float and setup well the BB float is too large.
2021-06-02 18:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Tilray, as the option chain got started today, so if this stock holds until friday, this will run very high the next week."
2021-06-02 18:37:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, $BB is the way."
2021-06-02 18:46:48,wallstreetbets,Clov and BB next
2021-06-02 18:49:16,wallstreetbets,Imagine not buying BB when it hits $50 by next week
2021-06-02 19:23:04,wallstreetbets,Jump on BB now.  Up 30+% 2 days in a row.  I’m in at $9.35
2021-06-02 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,BB looking juicy
2021-06-02 19:54:06,wallstreetbets,"All in BB. 
CANT FAIL."
2021-06-02 15:30:21,wallstreetbets,Lol exact same price point I originally bought in as well. Never sold. Bought all the dips like a retard and now my average is $14.
2021-06-02 16:24:09,wallstreetbets,"We're coming for you, retard 🦧 🚀"
2021-06-02 16:55:00,wallstreetbets,Very true. No loss if you don’t sell. BB is very promising with its cyber security products and EV RTOS.
2021-06-02 17:39:46,wallstreetbets,sorry not brother! got in with 1800 bb shares in last few weeks. bought 200 more yesterday. we are coming to pick you up on way to $100.
2021-06-02 19:03:18,wallstreetbets,Why not average down? There was plenty of opportunity for it
2021-06-02 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,I’m flush with AMC gains. I’m coming
2021-06-02 17:09:35,wallstreetbets,what about bankruptcy?
2021-06-02 16:47:24,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't hurt to keep some realizable losses sitting around.

If you hit a big winner, you can then take the losses and use those to offset some of your tax obligation on the gains."
2021-06-02 17:27:12,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 19:30:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought bb at market.  When market opened, it shot up to $19 and then instantly went back down to like $14.  Guess what price my buy excuted at.  

Never buy market price when markets not open.  

I just want to break even and get out if it starts to dip again."
2021-06-02 15:59:34,wallstreetbets,what are you waiting for to average down?
2021-06-02 18:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Sunk cost fallacy, google it ape."

Apes should understand that once people stray away all the little gains being made by other stocks right now will be erased, the movement falls apart and they start doing the same thing in those, they just rinse and repeat the whole process again.

2021-06-02 16:25:55,wallstreetbets,Nah i sold it when it went down to 30ish and than sold part of it like a puss
2021-06-02 18:17:05,wallstreetbets,What do you think is the cap of AMC?
2021-06-02 19:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Exp June 18, 2021: 20 × 20c @ $3.50 ea"
2021-06-02 15:01:54,wallstreetbets,Just wasn't expecting it to move so soon is all =\]
2021-06-02 17:10:41,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t mind, I am going to copy this one 👌"

2021-06-02 17:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. 

I 100% do think it will go over $20.

I just want it to happen after Monday."
2021-06-02 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Some people are definitely getting scared and selling since the trading halts which is a fucking shame. I personally feel like I'm about to throw up, but I ain't no paperhanded bitch.

Edit: already up another 14% after hours"
2021-06-02 19:03:36,wallstreetbets,AMC has not even started yet get your tickets soon because it is going to go fast 🍿😎

2021-06-02 16:59:41,wallstreetbets,Up $50 now... funny we throw money around at these stocks then I get mad when I pay 10cents more a gallon
2021-06-02 19:25:44,wallstreetbets,We’re early
2021-06-02 17:11:27,wallstreetbets,I'll give 3:1 odds (in pizzas) that this guy doesn't buy any pizza from these bet results. Any takers?
2021-06-02 17:15:04,wallstreetbets,I will order a house to your house
2021-06-02 15:01:39,wallstreetbets,Ooooops sorry

2021-06-02 17:04:22,wallstreetbets,Clov getting me all the after market gains BB is losing
2021-06-02 19:46:55,wallstreetbets,What is your predition the price of CLOV by end of month?
2021-06-02 18:07:17,wallstreetbets,I like those odds
2021-06-02 19:26:04,wallstreetbets,You’ll lose that bet.
2021-06-02 17:50:00,wallstreetbets,Somebody order this guy's house to pizza hut!
2021-06-02 19:49:59,wallstreetbets,"On the 30-40% chance it get some hype around it, the sky is the limit.

Long term (2022ish) it’s going to easily break over 40$ , one day it’ll be a triple digit stock (few years)

CLOV has phenomenal leadership and the idea is great. It’s undervalued because of lawsuits which are bullshit"
2021-06-02 18:31:02,wallstreetbets,If you win I'll buy you pizza
2021-06-02 19:25:32,wallstreetbets,I’m on it. Pretty good at double tasking.
2021-06-02 14:01:10,wallstreetbets,what sub am i on?
2021-06-02 14:03:36,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this
2021-06-02 14:14:02,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this really only useful as a past indicator though? You won't know there is a correction until there is a correction. In which case then that may or may not fall within the bounds of the above correlation?

Correlation of past results is no indication of the future."
2021-06-02 14:01:55,wallstreetbets,"More terminal less 4chan, gotta even it out every now and then."
2021-06-02 14:05:37,wallstreetbets,fin-nance
2021-06-02 14:19:04,wallstreetbets,"yah I'm worried that the predictive power isn't to predictive if it is at all. Some of the other things I was thinking about was looking at the frequency at which they occur and seeing what happened with the markets at that time. Or creating a new risk measure by counting the number of spikes.

Honestly most of my research is in portfolio and risk management, and I kind of stumbled across this and I just keep searching through but I'm not really sure where all of it can be used."
2021-06-02 14:06:46,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-06-02 14:27:59,wallstreetbets,"I'd keep looking at this. Obviously the big tick being the covid drop dilutes the visual of the other drops. But perhaps if that was excluded from the analysis, then you might be able to understand some of these smaller (but not insignificant corrections).

You may need to calculate some mimimum threshold of variance between the medium and the low to maybe get a head start on when a correction might be occurring. Could be invaluable, even if the leading indicator doesn't actually let you know until the correction has somewhat begun.

Might even be able to use it opposite to see when variance is decreasing to a certain threshold to know when to buy."
2021-06-02 14:07:26,wallstreetbets,If finance is gambling I wanna be the house.
2021-06-02 14:34:02,wallstreetbets,"Yah the other thing that I was thinking is that because higher volatility usually leads to a drop in asset price, which I think is more of a behavioral economics approach. So when there is higher volatility there will be a small drop."
2021-06-02 16:34:14,wallstreetbets,Can I be in your house
2021-06-02 13:58:27,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-06-02 13:59:51,wallstreetbets,Sweet mama jama! Can I take you out one of these nights bro? Maybe have some drinks go to the movies or some?
2021-06-02 14:01:35,wallstreetbets,I used my last $65 to buy that option this morning.  Never even came close to these gains before.
2021-06-02 14:18:38,wallstreetbets,Don’t get use to it but enjoy the fuck out of it today
2021-06-02 13:59:33,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-06-02 14:00:27,wallstreetbets,To the mooooooon!
2021-06-02 14:07:06,wallstreetbets,You made 24k?
2021-06-02 16:58:36,wallstreetbets,"I also had my best day! I'm up 100.00

It sounds less impressive when I say it out loud"
2021-06-02 14:01:42,wallstreetbets,Watch what happens when the circuit breakers turn off after hours
2021-06-02 14:24:43,wallstreetbets,Did you sell no then you didnt make any money yet lol
2021-06-02 14:07:32,wallstreetbets,Should I hold this till Friday or sell?
2021-06-02 14:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Dude if I had that in one day, I would SERIOUSLY consider quitting work lmao"
2021-06-02 14:07:55,wallstreetbets,What option did you buy and what was the price of amc at the time
2021-06-02 14:31:06,wallstreetbets,Are you going to hold over night? I only have 1 and I'm not sure what to do. If I sell it pays for vacation right now.
2021-06-02 14:34:17,wallstreetbets,Getting it out of the ATM is the real challenge. I had virtual highs but didn t cash out.
2021-06-02 14:57:53,wallstreetbets,Take some off the table and congrats
2021-06-02 15:02:29,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 16:08:26,wallstreetbets,Noob here. How the fuck does one do this? Any tips for options?
2021-06-02 16:39:06,wallstreetbets,Damn son 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 16:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations 🎉 and fuck you, get back to work and find the next play. C@caine and hookers for everyone."
2021-06-02 17:14:01,wallstreetbets,Enjoy the 🍌 my fellow 🦍
2021-06-02 17:50:16,wallstreetbets,Huge!
2021-06-02 18:39:20,wallstreetbets,Wait until tomorrow.
2021-06-02 14:26:04,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy gme. Amc is a pump and dump
2021-06-02 14:04:55,wallstreetbets,And you never will again
2021-06-02 14:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Free popcorn for all us apes as well, don’t forget"
2021-06-02 14:23:10,wallstreetbets,I'll juggle his swollen balls...
2021-06-02 14:07:02,wallstreetbets,What option specifically
2021-06-02 19:43:22,wallstreetbets,I sold that option early :(
2021-06-02 14:26:10,wallstreetbets,Today and tomorrow. I am not selling
2021-06-02 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-02 14:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Dude, sell some to lock in the gains, let the rest ride"
2021-06-02 14:08:58,wallstreetbets,Hold lol. Why give up free money
2021-06-02 14:13:37,wallstreetbets,HODL can't you spell right?
2021-06-02 16:56:04,wallstreetbets,"You would quit your job for $25k, pre tax? How little money do you make at your job/per year? Part time at a Wendy's drive through serving us all tendies?"
2021-06-02 14:12:28,wallstreetbets,An AMC $73c
2021-06-02 14:33:11,wallstreetbets,Well my expiration date is tomorrow so I’m holding until Friday.
2021-06-02 15:14:36,wallstreetbets,10am
2021-06-02 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,Circle jerk
2021-06-02 14:11:01,wallstreetbets,73 strike call option 6/4
2021-06-02 17:13:32,wallstreetbets,Lol I make enough but go to school. I’d quit my job to focus on school. I work at a CPA firm bud
2021-06-02 18:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Right now I’m not working, because I started college this semester, but when I was working I got 600$/month and almost every job is like that in Hungary. So it might be low for someone in USA, but much for someone in east Europe or smh"
2021-06-02 14:15:25,wallstreetbets,Maybe I don't fully understand options. If I buy that one now at what price will it be profitable? Let's say I just buy 1 contract.
2021-06-02 14:39:38,wallstreetbets,If you ride it out to Friday won't it have to close at $83 to get the same 1k gain per contract? I don't doubt it will climb I'm just worried about climbing that much more that soon.
2021-06-02 15:15:53,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 14:12:09,wallstreetbets,When did you buy? When market opened?
2021-06-02 18:03:21,wallstreetbets,I used to make $400/mo at my job in college. I know how it is. It can be tough living on that.
2021-06-02 14:16:17,wallstreetbets,If the stock goes up higher than it is at the time you bought it
2021-06-02 14:45:08,wallstreetbets,No I am not going to exercise. I will sell tomorrow. That Friday was a typo sorry
2021-06-02 15:16:18,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-02 14:15:03,wallstreetbets,10am
2021-06-02 14:17:16,wallstreetbets,I set a buy limit and crossed my fingers right at opening
2021-06-02 18:36:04,wallstreetbets,"That 600/month is a full time job, if I had to work part time, it would be half or even less than half of that. Also that’s why I am trying to break out of the rat cage"
2021-06-02 14:17:49,wallstreetbets,I thought $73c means it has to hit $73 for me to be in the money
2021-06-02 14:52:23,wallstreetbets,Are you worried about holding tonight? I'm out either in the next hour or sometime tomorrow
2021-06-02 14:52:54,wallstreetbets,"My shares aren't going anywhere, just to be clear. They don't expire and I like them."
2021-06-02 15:17:46,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 18:37:41,wallstreetbets,No better time than now 💪🏼
2021-06-02 14:19:39,wallstreetbets,yes but you can sell it whenever to someone who believes it
2021-06-02 14:21:40,wallstreetbets,If you want to exercise the call and own the shares of the stock.
2021-06-02 14:53:21,wallstreetbets,No I am holding. No way it will drop that much overnight. Either way I still make a profit. Maybe not 24k if it drops
2021-06-02 15:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes I did I paid $1,969 total for them"
2021-06-02 15:33:53,wallstreetbets,I don’t like being called a lair. Here is your proof [proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/3zgPSF8)
2021-06-02 15:35:00,wallstreetbets,What do you have to say now??
2021-06-02 14:26:19,wallstreetbets,So I could buy the $73c when the strike price is $64 and exercise at $67 for a profit if someone buys my contract?
2021-06-02 15:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Well,  I decided to hold.  I made about 6 times my account total today on this 1 option. I won't be able to sleep tonight now."
2021-06-02 15:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily true. You have to be able to sell the contract. Even if only pulls back a little, say to $50/share, then you'll have to find someone really dumb to buy it day before or day of expiration. I'd sell now personally but best of luck to you."
2021-06-02 16:00:48,wallstreetbets,You’re mixing up terms in your example...your “strike” would be $73 for the call. The “stock” price would be $64. You are selling the contract when the stock hits $67 at “hopefully” a profit as Theta is a thing (time decay)...so profit isn’t guaranteed just because the stock price rises on a call. It’s probable but not a sure thing. “Exercise” happens when the contract expires “in the money” or at/above the strike price
2021-06-02 14:27:32,wallstreetbets,If you exercise you are not selling the contract you are buying the stock at the strike price. You can exercise or sell the contract back
2021-06-02 15:46:05,wallstreetbets,I sold it
2021-06-02 15:39:28,wallstreetbets,Oh that’s a good point I didn’t think of that
2021-06-02 18:23:55,wallstreetbets,Ok that makes sense. Ty
2021-06-02 14:39:54,wallstreetbets,"Not sure which of these is more profitable.

The part that I'm stuck at is if I buy a $73c it says ""in the money at $80"" or something. That would be if I sell the contract, correct?"
2021-06-02 16:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Lol, well,  normally I can't hold but today I did.  Nothing against you, but I hope it hits 100 after hours!"
2021-06-02 15:46:25,wallstreetbets,"A good saying I leaned here and should have listened to earlier myself: if it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell.

Even if it stays the same price all day tomorrow you'll lose money due to theta decay.

1000% in a day is insane and definitely worth taking the money and running in my opinion. But again, hope it all works out for you either way."
2021-06-02 15:47:31,wallstreetbets,"And as others have said, you could sell half now and secure profits. Let the rest ride."
2021-06-02 16:04:49,wallstreetbets,"“In the money” just means the stock price is above the strike for the contact you own. If you wait until the market closes on the expiration Friday, and you’re “ITM”, the contract will be converted to stocks (exercised) and you have to cover the call.

As far as which is more profitable...just math it"
2021-06-02 16:32:40,wallstreetbets,I should of held it shot way up lol
2021-06-02 15:48:30,wallstreetbets,I sold. I didn’t think about that. I never held an option to day before the expiration date. From 2k to this in a day. I’m happy. I missed the chance to sell at 32k though YOLO 😂
2021-06-02 15:53:41,wallstreetbets,"You did the smart thing! First time I saw huge gains I told myself ""hold for one more day"" and then the value halved at open the next morning.

Congrats! Enjoy those tendies"
2021-06-02 15:55:04,wallstreetbets,Oh and of course remember to put some aside for taxman 😑
2021-06-02 16:10:44,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it will go down. I think it will go up tomorrow.
2021-06-02 16:13:24,wallstreetbets,If you think it's still going up consider buying a call expiring 6/11 or 6/18 with some of your wins from today.
2021-06-02 16:25:35,wallstreetbets,They are like $25 right now though
2021-06-02 13:59:15,wallstreetbets,Congratulations and fuck you

2021-06-02 15:01:24,wallstreetbets,I bought in Jan also... but not enough😥 i could only buy 9 at the time.
2021-06-02 15:51:55,wallstreetbets,"I am a massive paper-handed cunt. Bought at $13, sold at like $9 a month later - congrats to all and massive fuck you's to me."
2021-06-02 16:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Dude sell 2023 covered calls ATM. with 1300 shares you could sell 13 contracts. Its 52.000$ you are receiving in credit, and as long as AMC doesn't increase beyond that in 2023 you will still keep the shares. congrats!"
2021-06-02 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,cant buy bananas with paper gains. Love to see what you actual make.
2021-06-02 14:59:48,wallstreetbets,Show us your profit not paper gains. Ride it up or tank with it.

2021-06-02 14:09:53,wallstreetbets,Options calls are DUMB expensive right now. I bought two this morning at $50 and $55 for less than 400 each and then made $3k by the time I sold them. All of them now are like in the 1000s range for 1 contract its insane

2021-06-02 19:46:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes you deserve this, congratulations! After doing endless research and DD I now understand why people are holding AMC and set such high price targets. The real fun hasn't even started yet if buying pressure continues. I hope to see the manipulation exposed and come to an end so we can all have a leveled playing field."
2021-06-02 14:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep, my BB leaps bled out 70%.  Almost margin called.  Only option was to double down, then triple down, then max credit cards... now sitting on 11k gains BB and $15k gains GME.  Feels good, forgot what that felt like since Jan. BANG gang unite! (Except you NOK, you go back to the meme corner and think about what you didn’t do)"
2021-06-02 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,how does one find a way out of Robinhood? Im a new investor and all I've heard is shitty things about Robinhood. Id gladly move to a new place if I could find one

2021-06-02 16:44:15,wallstreetbets,Flushed workhorse long ago i did make like $5 though

2021-06-02 14:01:12,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-06-02 14:33:00,wallstreetbets,Time to take the profits soon. So what's the point of showing paper gain vice actual gain. Show us your gain and font be a holder for someone else gain lol
2021-06-02 14:05:12,wallstreetbets,How can you be sure of that?
2021-06-02 19:02:52,wallstreetbets,He’s mad jealous he didnt buy any AMC
2021-06-02 19:58:24,wallstreetbets,They’ve started the share count today. Soon all of the synthetic shares will be documented 😎

2021-06-02 17:15:04,wallstreetbets,"Back in January, Robinhood placed limits on how many shares of certain stocks you can buy. They're restricted list included GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and a ton of others I can't remember, all wsb favorites.

Robinhood also as a commonality of ownership with one of the firms involved in heavily shorting GME, which I am a lot of people think raise serious questions about whether there was a conflict of interest that led Robinhood to restrict GME trading.

Funny thing is I remember as soon as I learn their restrictions on AMC I bought the max that I could, and then bought more through with my regular bank (Citi). You might say that I rage-bought AMC at around the same time I rage-quit Robinhood.

So yeah, Fuck RH!"
2021-06-02 18:25:58,wallstreetbets,"Nothing, as long as you don't mind if RH prohibits you from buying or selling shares at inopportune times"
2021-06-02 17:56:45,wallstreetbets,Thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands. I will be selling some shares once it hits around $100 so I can secure a studio or 1br apartment. But other than that I’m letting this thing ride. Trying to rake in a couple millies
2021-06-02 14:04:03,wallstreetbets,My friends were buying GME in January when it was at $35 and I was mad skeptical and got in too late around $150-220. Then there was all the talk that AMC was going to be the next GME. I invested a modest amount when it was at $5 and then continued adding to my investment after seeing it go up to $20 in January. I've held since then and added more but still average less than $10 a share. I believe in the short squeeze for AMC just as I believe in it for GME. I will be holding for a very long time.
2021-06-02 16:58:41,wallstreetbets,It’s moving way up now. I need more cash to buy it back. Don’t want to sell AMC.
2021-06-02 14:21:55,wallstreetbets,"You’ll be dead before that happens. But I like the way you think.

Apes dont sell. Only hdol.. this is not financial advice."
2021-06-02 14:34:07,wallstreetbets,Why would I sell at $65 when the short squeeze hasn't happened? Everyone shows their paper gains how long have you been on this thread dude
2021-06-02 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,Shorts haven't covered. This right now is just price action and FOMO
2021-06-02 16:16:39,wallstreetbets,I picked up NOK leaps on the dip. $5 strike price 01/23 expiry were like $0.90 lol
2021-06-02 17:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Really hope you're right, I'd be happy over 1k but did not find any good DD about a realistic target."
2021-06-02 14:04:46,wallstreetbets,That’s awesome man

2021-06-02 15:23:03,wallstreetbets,Okay real question for a new ape - What are the signs that the short squeeze is happening or starting?
2021-06-02 14:37:30,wallstreetbets,What’s a short squeeze and when is it supposed to happen?
2021-06-02 16:26:33,wallstreetbets,"An honor system based on gratitude?  Like tipping the government?  Instead of paying gas tax, you would just throw coins out the car window when you feel gratitude for the road you drive on."
2021-06-02 15:10:21,wallstreetbets,Not if you're an ape... apes hold.
2021-06-02 15:18:44,wallstreetbets,Changed it to YOLO. happy now?
2021-06-02 19:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze happens when calls become in the money and market makers have to buy the shares for all open contracts to cover any contracts that are exercised. This drives up the price, next you have short squeezes. Those happen when there is borrowed shares that have to be bought back. Shorts have not fully bought back the shares they borrowed. You can check this buy looking at the short data. Now add synthetic short shares to this whole mess and you will see why people are holding. It has not even started yet. They call us dumb money yet made dumb money moves. Yes synthetic shares are very possible and the most likely scenario. Do some DD and you'll be amazed how we got into this mess and why they stopped the GME squeeze from fully taking off."
2021-06-02 14:57:22,wallstreetbets,Use the search function. There are many posts and articles explaining what a short squeeze is.
2021-06-02 16:44:00,wallstreetbets,Exactly XD You have a choice of government workers that you can tip. If you grateful enough you can pay for cleaning in their building. My point is creating a system where you trick people into willingly paying tax and it actually going to right places hahah
2021-06-02 13:57:58,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna copy your portfolio.

Its only profit when it's in your bank.

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE JUST A RETARDS OPINION"
2021-06-02 14:02:27,wallstreetbets,Just take out what you put in that way either way you break even. I’d sell another 10-15% personally though to come out with some profit and YOLO the rest

You get halfway through the season and your team is absolutely smashing it. The likelihood of them winning the cup is now evens (50-50).

2021-06-02 13:55:51,wallstreetbets,AMC should accept DOGE and other crypto. They could partner up with Telsa on charge stations/drive in theaters/entertainment stops. AMC could pair up with GME and do arcade or gaming stations in theatres. Pair up with Instagram and do themed photo areas. Back your investors. Think of how you stay relevant and current. The future is ours. So many things you van do AMC

2021-06-02 17:41:53,wallstreetbets,"This amazes me that we may see stock change from being a thing that people with expendable money gamble on, to Patreon for companies you wish to support. 

I really do feel like the average person seeing what a stake in ownership is, makes it so much less intimidating and takes it back to the roots. You believe in a company, you financially support them outside of buying their product. Patreon, Kickstarter and all those platforms are going to change the way my generation sees the market"
2021-06-02 15:53:52,wallstreetbets,"I kept waiting for a pull back before buying AMC and now ive missed out on 400% gains.

So sad."
2021-06-02 15:16:33,wallstreetbets,Perfect timing. I plan on going to shit my pants at an AMC theatre to watch the new Conjuring  movie this weekend
2021-06-02 16:09:52,wallstreetbets,Hold folks....lets ream these hedgfunds for all they got
2021-06-02 17:22:24,wallstreetbets,I only wish I'd bought more a month ago or wherever it was I bought it
2021-06-02 17:58:31,wallstreetbets,"Listen AMC and GME is destined. When GME shoots up to fuck you prices followed by AMC, we will all be attending the premier of the GME Stonk movie at an AMC. Remember to wear your biggest fuck you outfits. Personally for me I’m gonna come in my party boy suit blasting some music."
2021-06-02 16:03:56,wallstreetbets,Just yolo'd 7k more in - Let's do this shit!
2021-06-02 15:21:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm so pissed off. I sold at 36. Check again a day later, and the fucking value is 68! I'm fucking cursed. I just bought again, so I fucking bet it'll crash into nothing tomorrow."
2021-06-02 13:44:06,wallstreetbets,based

2021-06-02 15:03:31,wallstreetbets,The guy that had his post about this deleted earlier deserves an apology.
2021-06-02 15:48:43,wallstreetbets,Monke like free stuff
2021-06-02 16:00:30,wallstreetbets,"This guy fucks, I don't own amc as they're not in my country, but if they ever open i'll own shares

“These individual investors likely own a majority of our shares,” Aron said during Thursday’s call. “They own AMC. We work for them. I work for them.”"
2021-06-02 17:52:41,wallstreetbets,I think stonks is the best marketing strategy there is. Look at all this publicity.
2021-06-02 18:41:15,wallstreetbets,Weed companies should learn from AMC.
2021-06-02 18:52:53,wallstreetbets,Don't know if should jump on got burned last time with bb losing more than 50% real quick.
2021-06-02 15:54:00,wallstreetbets,FOR HARAMBE!!!!
2021-06-02 14:53:38,wallstreetbets,"This a genius move by AMC, its great PR, encourages people to buy tickets,and encourages people to buy more stocks of the company"
2021-06-02 15:05:30,wallstreetbets,but if I have zero shares do I buy now?
2021-06-02 15:22:14,wallstreetbets,I assume this is for US people only? It's an interesting strategy.  Give away free stuff so people hold their shares longer to get that free stuff.  Brilliant!
2021-06-02 15:42:31,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah amc and naked is going up to

2021-06-02 17:17:22,wallstreetbets,"What are a companies obligations to shareholders in a situation like this? Like, whether it is a short squeeze or just an elaborate pump and dump, what does maximizing shareholder value mean - propping up the hyperbolic valuations as long as possible so current shareholders can get out at a favorable position vs using the unexpected value to raise capital and build something long term?"
2021-06-02 17:31:11,wallstreetbets,AMC should start a confirmed investor chat room. Like this one so when we squeeze we wont be in the dark once social media get blacked out.
2021-06-02 17:52:01,wallstreetbets,"sweet - i am happy I put money in AMC, with or without the perks given by AMC =D"

2021-06-02 18:35:09,wallstreetbets,How rich does AMC have to be to start giving away its most valuable product: popcorn?
2021-06-02 19:55:19,wallstreetbets,Just bought my first NOK options!!!! Let’s get it apes!
2021-06-02 14:46:34,wallstreetbets,High stock price sadly does not avoid the inevitable dilution into a penny stock or bankruptcy given their going concern issues.
2021-06-02 15:31:25,wallstreetbets,It's a trap! AMC CEO is a stooge pretending to be your friend while inviting you to join shareholder Facebook
2021-06-02 15:24:27,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to buy in?
2021-06-02 17:00:46,wallstreetbets,I'm shorting 100 shares and I just signed up with out issue

2021-06-02 17:11:10,wallstreetbets,Are our wives boyfriends allowed to redeem the free popcorn?  How else will they enjoy the movie while we watch their kids.

2021-06-02 19:01:29,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't look like they're checking to see if you're an actual shareholder, you just check the box in your profile. So, I guess anyone can just say they are and get free popcorn... weird."
2021-06-02 19:08:18,wallstreetbets,"Every movie studio that needs big opening weekends, Director who hates direct to streaming, and popcorn concessions supplier should be balls deep in AMC."
2021-06-02 19:16:06,wallstreetbets,I hope this includes renting out the whole theater for a party!
2021-06-02 19:17:32,wallstreetbets,My thoughts are what if the concessions included bananas
2021-06-02 19:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Wow , this is very much welcomed , who would’ve thought .. good job my fellow apes 🦍 for holding and making this happen 😁 $AMC $BB 🚀"

2021-06-02 19:26:29,wallstreetbets,So I fucked up and didn’t buy yesterday when it was $39 should I go in now at $60? Or wait
2021-06-02 19:33:00,wallstreetbets,How about on their App?
2021-06-02 19:37:15,wallstreetbets,I didn’t buy in yesterday because I thought it would have a hard drop. Should I buy in today? It’s doubled since yesterday and I’ve got $1000 to work with
2021-06-02 19:38:37,wallstreetbets,"AMC and FUBO. LETS GET THAT BREAD

I like the stocks"
2021-06-02 19:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Well obviously their giving away popcorn to investors so that they can dump their shares..   
Pretty clever marketing.. 

Every business should follow suit.."

2021-06-02 15:47:05,wallstreetbets,I wish I didn’t have rent to cover and was forced to sell last week.  Glad to see y’all moon
2021-06-02 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Oof... just moved to Ireland... not an AMC within 4,000 miles."
2021-06-02 18:19:36,wallstreetbets,I'll go see a movie and I will send you your free popcorn.   <3
2021-06-02 18:33:50,wallstreetbets,I own shares and there isnt even one on my continent 🤣

2021-06-02 17:08:33,wallstreetbets,"I find it interesting that the pattern now is:

a. Hedge funds: care only about making more money to hoard.   Deserve to bent over and fucked on principle.b. r/wsb and AMC: Actually donating money to help people (gorillas are people, dammit).  Doing god's work."
2021-06-02 17:25:56,wallstreetbets,"We've got popcorn, we've got vidya games, we've got brick breaker, imagine being stuck in earth"
2021-06-02 18:07:05,wallstreetbets,let's add NOK in there as well
2021-06-02 18:10:29,wallstreetbets,first time investor trying to jump on before the rocket takes off but no one told me it takes 3 days for trading app to let you do anything after making an account... so of course AMC doubles the first day after I learn that and I'm stuck just watching it go up. goodluck fellow apes and fuck you all
2021-06-02 19:36:51,wallstreetbets,Love the stocks but I love Ipic
2021-06-02 18:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Can you imagine the rocky horror picture show in a VR environment where you throw tp and stuff...

Great scott!"
2021-06-02 19:52:52,wallstreetbets,"There’s a theater near me that does 4d stuff. I watched Star Wars and in windy scenes, fans would blow. In rainy/wet scenes, water mist would fall. Seats would rumble. Sometimes there would be smells related to what was going on.

It was really different and cool. And not as uncomfortable for long term as say my oculus quest headset. AMC should invest in something similar"
2021-06-02 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,What app on Oculus lets you throw tomatoes at the screen? That sounds fun.
2021-06-02 19:29:07,wallstreetbets,This is helpful information.  You should send this to the company directly.  Direct communication with your base is a great way to build better companies.  Crazy it might actually become a trend.
2021-06-02 15:26:53,wallstreetbets,"Fine print on the website says international investors can sign up and should choose ""AMC Empire 25"" as their favorite theater, but the free popcorn offer is only available in the US at the moment."
2021-06-02 14:49:03,wallstreetbets,"Bummer man, probably because the ""stubs"" account may be a US thing, although I haven't checked into this personally just conjecture."
2021-06-02 18:27:49,wallstreetbets,They're guaranteed to add this feature to Odeon knowing the amount of UK AMC shareholders.
2021-06-02 19:01:29,wallstreetbets,My ass cheeks got real tight when it hit 69 and creeped past 70 for a brief minute in the extended hours trading. Now it's just doing a balancing act at 66.
2021-06-02 19:31:54,wallstreetbets,"Yes, which is what a smart CEO would do. Keep it’s investors happy with new ideas and projects for the company with these new funds. Which in turn means even more investment into the stock, which means even more funds for even bigger projects. This is how Musk has grown his companies. GME should take some notes from AMC."
2021-06-02 15:21:17,wallstreetbets,💎💎💎now at $66
2021-06-02 17:24:56,wallstreetbets,"$88 tomorrow (why so specific? YouTube ""BAM Investor""). $200 next week. Wait for it. Don't sell. Just HODL. 1000 is not a joke. 2000 is not even 1% of the bananas we all deserve.

Also: REMOVE your ***stop losses*** you smooth-brained banana smoothie drinking apes."
2021-06-02 13:44:51,wallstreetbets,"i wish i could buy more AMC but i also invested some money in GME, CTRM and HRPK"

2021-06-02 14:53:25,wallstreetbets,Just have BB do the cyber security and our trifecta will be complete.
2021-06-02 14:54:30,wallstreetbets,"I did a case study for AMC this past semester regarding what they could do to increase revenue and brand recognition in the long term. A lot of what you mentioned our team came up with, as well as encouraging alcohol sales, hosting sporting events (Super Bowl, UFC PPV Events, Olympics) [with the understanding licensing would be required]... Additionally something they did during covid they could implement more is the ability to rent out theaters for parties. There really is so much."
2021-06-02 17:53:59,wallstreetbets,All of this + VR rooms in Gamestop and I'll have to go see a doc about my permanent erection
2021-06-02 14:36:19,wallstreetbets,Add some Lululemon apparel?

Leaders eat last. AMC should put its employees, and business in front of its priorities.

Not ceo bonuses."
2021-06-02 14:47:35,wallstreetbets,Id invest in this.
2021-06-02 15:22:34,wallstreetbets,"yes, all of this"
2021-06-02 16:50:51,wallstreetbets,Not a half bad idea honestly.
2021-06-02 17:48:34,wallstreetbets,"That's bullish, nay, apeish af."
2021-06-02 19:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Partnering with Tesla would be a fantastic idea, as knowing you can park and charge while catching a flick on a trip would be fantastic."
2021-06-02 19:36:36,wallstreetbets,AMC drive-in theatres with Tesla charging ports at the most desirable spots to watch the movie. Bridge the gap between the 1970s and the 2020s
2021-06-02 18:03:52,wallstreetbets,"It says the new platform has direct communication to the CEO, maybe give him the dd on your community and see what the market is for movie theaters in your area and ask if they’d be willing to look into building one there. I mean, no harm in asking, right? Lol"
2021-06-02 14:28:42,wallstreetbets,Glad to see some conservative estimates out there
2021-06-02 16:07:33,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't be surprised if other places did the same. Free upgrade to a large for your meal if you own McDonald's stock or some shit
2021-06-02 19:24:50,wallstreetbets,That's why Tesla and FANG stocks have such insane valuations. People want to say they own them.
2021-06-02 17:18:39,wallstreetbets,Buy and sell in stages.  Always get a ride that way
2021-06-02 16:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I sold at 70 this morning. Made the biggest money I've ever touched in my life.

2021-06-02 15:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Stop reading hedge fund FUD. They already refinanced. And with a high stock price they can get better financing rates. Could there be some share dilution? Yes, but that would be bullish since its part of a recovery story. Go back to your cave 🐻."
2021-06-02 16:33:44,wallstreetbets,You’re a hedgebot.

2021-06-02 14:50:02,wallstreetbets,That might be it because when I signed up for the stubs account it said there isn't an AMC cinema within 50 miles of where I am when there's actually like 20

AMC currently does these things."
2021-06-02 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,"most people believe AMC makes it's money on ticket sales, so they study box office returns - but that only shows what the *studio* brings in on theatrical sales.

AMC and other chains make their money on concession sales & pre-roll advertising.

All of which have gone up even as ticket sales declined. 

Lots of peeps shitting on AMC don't even know how it works.

If you're all in on GME, party on wayne...but there is a solid company in AMC. It's more than a short squeeze meme."

Their best most profitable year ever netted the company $500M.

In 2020 alone they lost $4.5B all the while diluting the company 3.5-1.

They’re gonna run out of cash over next 18 months if they don’t issue billions in new shares, diluting the stock into the pennies."

The encouraging side would be a focus on making it more of a staple of their enterprise - rather than just a place to see new films which is largely the perception of the brand around the country."
2021-06-02 17:18:36,wallstreetbets,"This is where I disagree with you. Part of our study meant we spent extensive time researching the financial statement trends over the past couple of years. 

AMC has been slow to adapt to the technology age and has suffered as a result. They currently have more long term debt alone than they do assets. That being said they aren’t very solvent. Even with the uptick in equity they’ve received from investors they still need to find a way to pay off this debt or eventually they’ll have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which was predicted by many before the rise of meme stocks. 

The company has potential to rise from the ashes in light of recent trends but to say they are a solid company is very speculative.

This is not financial advice at the end of the day I’m just a retarded ape with an accounting degree."

2021-06-02 18:28:09,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what you mean with “slow to adapt to technology” 

They were leading the way in updating the projectors, seating, and sound systems. 

Many chains reacted to their investment in better playback technology. 

But yeah. They were slow to release a useful app I guess. 


As far as debt load? We’ll see. That may we’ll be a problem born of the wrong people on their board (many of which have left during the meme rally’s) since they’re gearing up to buy more theaters."

2021-06-02 18:38:56,wallstreetbets,"By slow to adapt, yes I mean the app and capitalizing on the streaming industry. 

Imagine how cool it would be to be able to pay to see movies as soon as they come out (or a bit earlier) by paying a small few each time you want to watch something (free app, PPV style). They waited and now that market is well over-saturated. 

I totally agree it may have just been the wrong people in charge. The problem is that the goal of any LLC is to generate shareholder wealth. It’s extremely difficult to generate shareholder wealth if many of their investments are going to be used paying off debt that was accrued beforehand, and can’t generate revenue today.

They need to find an effective way to really boost their operating income in order to provide value to shareholders. Without that, the stock (and company itself) are destined to be liquidated. Obviously this is all what would happen 2-3 years down the line and has no relation to the current moon pattern we watch and desire."

2021-06-02 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Amen to that brother, back when AMC was $9 I told a lot of my friends to buy, and they called me crazy for it. Now they're probably going crazy for not buying some AMC for $9 😤"
2021-06-02 17:18:20,wallstreetbets,"LMFAO
Word..."
2021-06-02 17:19:10,wallstreetbets,NOT FUCKING LEAVING
2021-06-02 17:19:11,wallstreetbets,"Well, ya, why the fuck would you go all in on a dying movie theater chain with shit financials and an obsolete business model? 

Glad the dice rolled your way though. Don’t be afraid to take profits."
2021-06-02 17:19:30,wallstreetbets,Retards can be smart.

2021-06-02 17:27:13,wallstreetbets,How are you regards still using RH. Some people never learn..
2021-06-02 17:27:15,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Now you're just a retard for using Robinhood!

2021-06-02 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,Yea I’d cash out now before this ship sinks
2021-06-02 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,Doesnt matter what the gme purists say. Amc was always a good play.
2021-06-02 17:30:30,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you. I bought June 18 $15 puts when shares were like $22.  Looks like I'm fucked.
2021-06-02 17:30:56,wallstreetbets,"You guys inspired me to look at the 30 shares of AMC I purchased back when GME was all the rage.

I’m rich 😃 but I’m also holding because eh, why not?"
2021-06-02 17:31:10,wallstreetbets,Literally bought one amc call at 60 for like 100 bucks a week ago.  Was struggling to figure out despite a positive on the rest of my portfolio why it was vastly higher than I expected.  The I noticed the 1600 percent increase
2021-06-02 17:32:13,wallstreetbets,Ape noises*

2021-06-02 17:33:49,wallstreetbets,This is beautiful
2021-06-02 17:34:02,wallstreetbets,"Funny people would mock you for buying AMC. Unlike Gamestop, AMC is doing poorly simply because they've been shut down. So shock and awe, now that things are re-opening they're coming back up."
2021-06-02 17:34:05,wallstreetbets,$amc squeeze is happening! You can’t be worth more with 6 billion in debt the biggest float ever and be worth more then pre pandemic smaller float best revenue years. Lol 100k?? Hahahah your guesstimate of shorts have closed in the last two weeks. But good for you don’t end up holding the bag!!!
2021-06-02 17:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Who's the retard now, bitch?!"
2021-06-02 17:35:53,wallstreetbets,It's not not retarded just because it worked out.

2021-06-02 17:52:07,wallstreetbets,Damn I wish I went in more on AMC hoping DOGE coin picks up cause I went all in on that. A few of my AMC shares are about to buy me a new air conditioner tho
2021-06-02 17:52:21,wallstreetbets,Remember - it's a round trip if you don't get out.

2021-06-02 18:32:50,wallstreetbets,Hope you are talking to your accountant about taxes if you took gains. Nothing like writing a check for 30k to support Trumps golf game.
2021-06-02 18:34:16,wallstreetbets,Just because it worked out doesn't make you less of a retard lol. Now you're just a retard up 170k lol.

2021-06-02 18:50:18,wallstreetbets,I had xx shares of AMC at $3.30. Sold at $9 and some cents back in April. I’m kicking myself in the nuts seeing the price it’s at now.

2021-06-02 18:55:54,wallstreetbets,"I've learned how to manipulate the stock market.  

If I buy it goes down. 

If I sell it goes up. 

So if I buy and push the stock down then keep buying as it goes down. 

I can then sell some and it will go up, then wait a bit until it goes past my original purchase price then keep selling at a profit and it will then go to the moon 🌙."
2021-06-02 18:56:00,wallstreetbets,I'll call you retarded for using robinhood.

It wasn’t a ton of profit and the ceiling may be much higher but it was valuable cash I needed and it was a pleasure joining the ride with you all. I bought my shares last summer before anyone was talking about any of this stuff. Best investment I ever made.

2021-06-02 19:57:29,wallstreetbets,Congrats man. But remember it's not profit until you sell it.
2021-06-02 19:58:10,wallstreetbets,They? Oh you mean this same subreddit that would only allow us to talk about GME for months & any time we would mention AMC we would get banned or attacked by adult virgins
2021-06-02 19:59:39,wallstreetbets,Congrats!!! That’s awesome. Now get out of robin-da-hood!

2021-06-02 13:54:38,wallstreetbets,"I’m not familiar with this app. Why does it say the price is $44 at the top, but at the very bottom it says the AMC price is $68?"
2021-06-02 14:14:43,wallstreetbets,You beautiful fucking ape.
2021-06-02 19:49:14,wallstreetbets,You’re still a ✨retard✨

2021-06-02 17:56:01,wallstreetbets,"I know the mindset doesn’t belong here but profit is profit and it’s never a bad thing. I did the same as you.  Bought at $14, dragged my average cost down kicking and screaming to $10, then sold at $15 happy to never go back."

2021-06-02 16:59:21,wallstreetbets,I sold all mine for GME; doing pretty decent there right now.
2021-06-02 19:04:18,wallstreetbets,Bro it happens to all of us man... only 1% of people get lucky like this...
2021-06-02 19:06:44,wallstreetbets,Bought at 3. Sold at 4.
2021-06-02 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I had 500 shares and sold covered calls that would expire this week..... for $19/share when I got in at $15/share.... I got the fuck out when it dropped from 32 to 26 and made $2K. 

but then again you have to be a retard to think it was going to go up 100% in a day after continuing on its current run as the odds and track history isn't good. Just look at what happened a few months ago...

Also who else saw this level of hype on RKT? 

I look forward to the loss porn of the bag holders on this one."
2021-06-02 19:32:21,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 8 and sold at 6 or something like that lmaooooo shit had me stressed, someone on YouTube said it wasn't gonna happen I was like damn they're probably right 😂 true retard"

2021-06-02 17:46:33,wallstreetbets,Sold all my calls at 24 :'(
2021-06-02 19:35:37,wallstreetbets,Did that today with BBBY essentially.  Nice scalp felt great sold and then it went up another 50%.

2021-06-02 19:58:25,wallstreetbets,Me too! But then I bought back in at 20 because I like the stock.
2021-06-02 19:44:11,wallstreetbets,"I sold wkhs, to buy tsla calls because they have event tomorrow evening. Then they came out and said it's being delayed a week."
2021-06-02 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,"Idk about them, but I bought when it was at $4, so $200k goes a long way"
2021-06-02 16:20:08,wallstreetbets,Rich people who can ride the meme train for more gains
2021-06-02 18:02:27,wallstreetbets,It’s actually terrifying how many retards have well paid jobs
2021-06-02 16:52:30,wallstreetbets,I made $650k off GME. Then lost it on everything else lol now back up to $180k. AMC is bringing me back!
2021-06-02 16:38:31,wallstreetbets,Most are people who put $10k on GME back in December when it went from $4 to $482. 100x returns.
2021-06-02 17:21:29,wallstreetbets,"He spent $40k. Still nuts, but good for him"
2021-06-02 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Well he didn't invest 200k in AMC, looks like he invested about 40k and turned it into 200k. Hopefully those are realized gains."
2021-06-02 18:50:57,wallstreetbets,He went in for like 40k.
2021-06-02 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,Looks like options could easily buy 200k worth of options for 8k
2021-06-02 18:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Aren’t these just unrealized calls? Did the dude really bet 200k on calls, not even shares? Sounds retarded to me."
2021-06-02 18:10:37,wallstreetbets,Retirement funds.
2021-06-02 17:49:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-02 18:53:12,wallstreetbets,"Check out inthemoney’s YouTube channel, he has a beginner options video (one that says trading options in webull) that is 2 hours and gives a really solid foundation for it. Be warned, it’s very easy to lose a lot of money."

2021-06-02 13:21:39,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-02 16:06:47,wallstreetbets,The real question on my mind (perhaps yours too) are we buying the RobinHood IPO?
2021-06-02 18:09:50,wallstreetbets,"I have an account on there and just for shits and giggles I tried buying 3 AMC shares, those fucks wouldn't process it yesterday.  Funny how the day Mudrick got his shares and sold them I had to wait all day for an order to be filled.  Pretty fucking sus.  Fuck Robinhood."

2021-06-02 14:01:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m kinda the opposite. Bowed out of amc early to go in heavy on GME. Tough pill to swallow right now watching amc rocket, but here’s to hoping GME follows"
2021-06-02 17:17:40,wallstreetbets,How would you miss out on GME when it’s still going?
2021-06-02 19:20:20,wallstreetbets,GME is just warming up
2021-06-02 13:56:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah man I bought at similar price paper handed at 61.00 though cause of my stop limit. Shoulda set it lower. Maybe I buy back in tomorrow? 🤔
2021-06-02 13:29:22,wallstreetbets,Look at avg cost. Most likely that if he went all in
2021-06-02 13:35:04,wallstreetbets,The average share price is all you need to know.
2021-06-02 14:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Not me, but I spent 4.76 on 10 shares. I wish I had bought at least 100"
2021-06-02 14:54:43,wallstreetbets,"He bought a $30 call expiring 7/2 and paid a $10.15 premium. So he paid $40,600 and the option is worth $177,520 (as of now)"

2021-06-02 18:49:13,wallstreetbets,bout $350
2021-06-02 15:18:05,wallstreetbets,Congrats !
2021-06-02 14:51:47,wallstreetbets,I did the same. I sold partly to make up for the initial investment. Now whatever I have left is just profit.
2021-06-02 15:14:45,wallstreetbets,"TBF is IS a meme stock and is absolutely garbage when you look at the fundamentals. The fact that it’s doing so well at the moment is a complete anomaly that’s due to the shorting of the stock. It’s still not a good long term investment, at least not at $63 a share.


They have a huge amount of debt, almost no cash flow, and their only valuable assets are the property the buildings sit on. If they liquidated everything they own it still might not be enough to cover their debt."
2021-06-02 14:07:28,wallstreetbets,"Please don't pretend AMC is a good company. 5 billion in debt. They were on the road to bankruptcy. Happy for you nerds, but AMC is still a shite company."
2021-06-02 14:47:02,wallstreetbets,It's been trading higher than pre-pandemic levels since January. Congrats to everyone who will make out in this but idk who's buying right now.
2021-06-02 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Even if people thought it was a total meme stock, the idea that it was gonna drop to 5 dollars over the weekend was absurd. Some really absurd stuff on here."
2021-06-02 13:50:45,wallstreetbets,This was my thinking as well. I just wished I'd trusted my gut more and bought more than I did. Hindsight is 20/20 though I guess
2021-06-02 15:45:41,wallstreetbets,"before covid, theatres were NOT doing very well.
my guess is that there will be a spike when things open up again. but i still think the comfort of watching something at home is there. Plus, maybe we just learn to not like being around other people now. Arg. the idea of sitting close to someone for two hours. no thanks."
2021-06-02 13:57:04,wallstreetbets,People were afraid they’d go under. They were going a long time in life support
2021-06-02 16:54:38,wallstreetbets,"But let’s not ignore that the company was languishing for years and in Jan 2020 was $7. Business before the pandemic was bad and while there are promise of turnaround, nothing had happened yet b"
2021-06-02 17:54:11,wallstreetbets,Well it’s 5 year high pre-covid was about $32 in 2017. It’s easy to declare yourself a genius in hindsight but was there any reason to believe this stock would essentially double it’s pre-pandemic high? And is there any reason aside from internet hype that it’s doing it now?
2021-06-02 19:13:53,wallstreetbets,"> People seem to refuse to acknowledge AMC was more than a meme stock

Because it isn't. AMC is pure meme stonk. Come on guy, you think this has anything to do with fundamentals? AMC mooning isn't even a real short squeeze. This is all gamma from people piling in."
2021-06-02 19:41:51,wallstreetbets,"exactly, like after any flu we come back and go to cinema for entertainment"
2021-06-02 14:05:55,wallstreetbets,AMC being a theater during this pandemic just made it too easy to root for! I almost felt like I was investing in a local storefront haha
2021-06-02 14:09:14,wallstreetbets,exactly. Reopening play.
2021-06-02 17:45:48,wallstreetbets,They \*still\* refuse to acknowledge AMC. It's amazing how many people on other subs still trashing AMC even after we had a 95% gain today....
2021-06-02 14:01:07,wallstreetbets,"amc had no where to go but up. If they didn't crash completely once their theaters closed that meant they were probably going to do whatever necessary to make the comeback. It also helps they got added to the meme hype, which meant they had a pretty strong play to recover."
2021-06-02 14:21:35,wallstreetbets,Ah nice I'm glad I read this 4 months ago.
2021-06-02 15:12:26,wallstreetbets,"That's the reason I bought back in February.  I just figured it would take until 4th quarter to show any significant return.  I'm glad I was wrong, and glad I didn't sell last week when I doubled my money"
2021-06-02 15:30:58,wallstreetbets,I had faith in it but not this much. I sold half my shares at $25 and then forgot to turn off my stop limit/loss and sold another quarter of them accidentally this afternoon at $50.
2021-06-02 16:12:33,wallstreetbets,You're high af if you think we are at a fair evaluation bro
2021-06-02 16:36:59,wallstreetbets,"> still a solid buy in the teens

Thats where I bought in"
2021-06-02 17:44:47,wallstreetbets,"As a stock, since support is only thing that matters , maybe. 

But i do refuse to acknowledge that its legitimate. Its a business model that just doesnt work anymore. The demand is decreasing and amc needs to focus on how to adapt. Either smaller theaters, or more services offerings to make good use of unused space. 

Instead, ceo giving himself fat bonuses and dilluting over and over to get out of their debts. They were litteraly drowning and they got picked up by massive support wanting to keep their ground vs shorts, and it only hapened because of gme and because amc was cheap as hell. 

Fundamental wise, amc is a pile of shit. They could pivot and adapt. I see a few opportunities but as of right now, they just dillute over and over. 

But as i said, support is all that matters. Its what makes people value currencies when its just a piece of paper. No more trust no more value. 

I made a part of the ride up to 33 something but i will keep thinking amc is shit until someone can come up with real facts as to why amc is worth something.  And if you are going to talk about the post covid that will help them, remember that it will be temporary and used even less once inflation hits the economy. Luxury expenses always suffer first. 

Hope they use this hype to pivot and actually do something for once but i doubt."
2021-06-02 15:52:56,wallstreetbets,I need more value plays like this
2021-06-02 16:03:27,wallstreetbets,This is exactly how I feel every time I see a post from this sub

2021-06-02 16:57:11,wallstreetbets,Shorts haven't covered yet so yes.
2021-06-02 17:29:16,wallstreetbets,Why would you think that jumping in after a +100% day on anything would be a good idea?
2021-06-02 16:45:51,wallstreetbets,"All I have to do is sell one contract and I will be in profits, I have 50 :)"
2021-06-02 18:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Damn. You actually are a r*tard. With gambling addiction like that, you’ll definitely be back to $27 soon enough though."
2021-06-02 13:34:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way.  Then you FOMO back in at the peak right before the dip
2021-06-02 13:29:47,wallstreetbets,It could have easily dipped to $7 im not complaining about closing at $47 when it hit 66
2021-06-02 17:16:57,wallstreetbets,Couldn't have said it better my friend
2021-06-02 13:54:57,wallstreetbets,It's not profit until you sell.
2021-06-02 13:47:33,wallstreetbets,No. Short interest is up
2021-06-02 17:33:18,wallstreetbets,"The stock went up 100%+ in a single day. Why the fuck would you not realize profits on that? Do what you want, but c’mon man. What the fuck"
2021-06-02 14:52:35,wallstreetbets,fuck you and your 1k shares.
2021-06-02 18:21:03,wallstreetbets,Maybe because they were shorted more than Gamestop and we’ve been telling you all this for months and yet you kept downvoting? It was inevitable this would happen and it hasnt even lifted off yet

2021-06-02 14:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, I bought at peak last time around as a meme but it didn't go up anymore. Just held cause I memed with a small amount. Shoulda bought the dip but at least now I can afford some dip with my chips."
2021-06-02 17:24:16,wallstreetbets,i had 246 or something at like 10.  today is a great day
2021-06-02 16:28:20,wallstreetbets,"Way to make it go BRRR m8! What is that, an 800% increase?"
2021-06-02 17:47:39,wallstreetbets,>Hey cant be worse then when the motley fool told him to fold at $9 with 1500 shares. Dude told him to cancel the subscription.
2021-06-02 17:36:38,wallstreetbets,Saaaaammmeee. AMC about to fuel my new stock addiction.
2021-06-02 17:54:22,wallstreetbets,"And I’m the dumbass who bought the gme dip at $150. Granted it’s up significantly, and I also only bought two shares. But I should have listened. What’s next?"
2021-06-02 16:42:21,wallstreetbets,"I only bought 4 shares at 9!😭 got shit on big time for buying, but look who gained in the end 😌🖤"
2021-06-02 15:26:56,wallstreetbets,So all of them? 😏
2021-06-02 16:27:16,wallstreetbets,Primarily Etrade with my IRA in fidelity and some leftovers in RH.
2021-06-02 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Being real with you, I think any PPS  higher than this is based solely on a combination of short covering and speculation that the company will somehow become profitable again. 

That being said, the shorts have not covered and it is getting more and more expensive to do so. The price it reaches really depends on whether the shorts try to play chicken with the retail investors. If at open tomorrow they all move to cover at once we will probably see a spike up to about 150-200. If they let it rise a few more days that could be higher. 

I personally see it going higher but am not investing anymore, I have a pretty diverse portfolio at this point and it's all doing well (70-80% today) BB carried most of the weight today for me but I'd rather miss out  on possible gains than bet the farm on one horse just to see it break its ankle. 

Lastly, with GME max gains came down to selling at the exact right moment. It peaked way higher than where it's held. If you decide to dive in more than definitely plan on watching the market like a hawk."
2021-06-02 19:15:40,wallstreetbets,Hold for a day or two and pay someone else to do it
2021-06-02 16:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 15 (Feb.), sold at 71 today.

Feeling goodish. My only regret is that I played conservatively and only the money I was willing to loose, instead of going all in with savings.

The whole selling was huge dumbfuckluck, I was playing a game, after the map ended, I remembered that AMC was quite high yesterday. So looked up it at 65 USD, placed order to sell for 71 USD and just before trades froze, my order went through."
2021-06-02 19:00:39,wallstreetbets,"I was in at $10.98 on a hundred shares, so I sold covered calls to bring it down.  I sold a 5/28 13.5c around the beginning of May... was feeling pretty happy with it last Tuesday.  I was a little disappointed by Wednesday.  I was really sad Thursday.  I got assigned Saturday and made a very respectable 35% ROI... 

...Had I not been assigned, I could sell a 100c for 6/18, double my investment on just the premium, and if I happen to get assigned, I have $10K more."
2021-06-02 18:33:37,wallstreetbets,There will be more

2021-06-02 17:42:30,wallstreetbets,Holy crap that's retarded!
2021-06-02 17:56:09,wallstreetbets,I hope you saved money for taxes
2021-06-02 17:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Wow, what did you invest in after making that much on GME?"
2021-06-02 19:24:12,wallstreetbets,"Your paying taxes on all realized gains after you sell for higher and take profits. The gov doesn't give a shit regardless of what you do afterwords even if you lose all of it your still paying taxes on all realized gains. Thats why you divert 30%-40% of your gains to savings for taxes when you sell.

Edit: losses only offset gains if you don't buy the same stock again within a 30 day period after you sell it for a loss. It's called wash sale rule if you lose 500k from trading 10 stocks over and over again within a 30 day period none of those losses will count so your basically fucked."
2021-06-02 15:47:25,wallstreetbets,I have a little concern for the T12 SEC halt.. could create gov fuckery

2021-06-02 13:47:28,wallstreetbets,Those fuckers haulted trades on AMC today.
2021-06-02 17:20:23,wallstreetbets,I’m brand new to this and scared. I’ve made $5k on AMC using Robinhood. What should I be using instead?
2021-06-02 16:43:11,wallstreetbets,I was wondering about that AMC Halt earlier today...
2021-06-02 13:29:53,wallstreetbets,Literally anything else.
2021-06-02 13:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Charles Schwab or Fidelity.  Schwab if you like Option contracts.  Otherwise, Fidelity."
2021-06-02 13:37:30,wallstreetbets,Using Robinhood to trade stocks is risky af. Remember when Vlad halted buying of GME stock last time. He single-handedly killed the momentum. There’s a reason a ton of people left RH.
2021-06-02 13:31:06,wallstreetbets,I just send it in an envelope. OP sell in chunks and slowly on the way up and down.
2021-06-02 13:52:38,wallstreetbets,I bought mine on Cashapp a while back
2021-06-02 13:53:00,wallstreetbets,I use Schwab.
2021-06-02 14:07:05,wallstreetbets,Fidelity took the least amount of time and if your account is below a certain threshold they'll cover the $75 transfer fee. Also most employers are already using Fidelity for their 401K so most people already have an account with them.
2021-06-02 14:06:31,wallstreetbets,Fidelity
2021-06-02 14:14:44,wallstreetbets,Fidelity with 0.00 trades

2021-06-02 15:14:30,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry. I don’t understand the question. What does “sold” mean?
2021-06-02 18:14:40,wallstreetbets,No sir! I will update when I’m selling
2021-06-02 14:05:09,wallstreetbets,I had about 2000 shares bought at 2.80 and sold at 17 and thought I was a genius. I always just try to smile at everyone whose killing it right now tho
2021-06-02 17:22:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean, GME is doing FINE."

2021-06-02 14:03:36,wallstreetbets,Should buy back in now lol wth. We told you guys to remove your stop losses on something like this or GME.
2021-06-02 13:31:26,wallstreetbets,Oh I c
2021-06-02 13:52:56,wallstreetbets,"So does that mean, 40 contracts = 400 shares, so 400 * 10.15 = 4060. So he paid 4060 on the options ? If my understanding is contract. Sorry retard here who is new to options."

2021-06-02 19:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, calling it a ""value play"" is just the wrongest thing."
2021-06-02 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Ya. Exactly. Shit’s annoying. 

Fundamentals say it’s a weak as fuck $5 stock (if that). Let’s not kid ourselves and start pretending it was a legitimate investment in a solid undervalued endeavor the whole time. 

Slot machine went ding. Take some money off the table."
2021-06-02 14:34:56,wallstreetbets,They treat their investors like shit too
2021-06-02 14:09:34,wallstreetbets,Nowhere in there did i pretend they were a good company. They're a company in the perfect situation for them to rebound simply due to demand for their product regardless of what action they take.

2021-06-02 17:30:27,wallstreetbets,They don’t need to. They own most of the shares you dumabasses are buying already. For the love of God go look at the stock information at least once while you’re holding something. It’s right there on page 1.

2021-06-02 13:34:18,wallstreetbets,"Dumbass, every brokerage halts trading for a security when it jumps or drops 10% in a short time period. Was definitely not a robinhood thing, lol."
2021-06-02 13:32:52,wallstreetbets,These two comments show your lack of understanding  how any of this works
2021-06-02 16:15:53,wallstreetbets,Congratularly buttfuck time
2021-06-02 16:22:33,wallstreetbets,"...tell me of things forgotten by time, old man."
2021-06-02 14:23:44,wallstreetbets,Rolls Royce. Ez money

2021-06-02 17:46:17,wallstreetbets,Tesla.
2021-06-02 16:44:36,wallstreetbets,This is the answer. Everyone buy fully loaded Model S or X and invest the rest is the stock
2021-06-02 14:39:29,wallstreetbets,"I love them but owned by Geely now since 2017, who also bought Volvo more recently. Just owned by a Chinese company."
2021-06-02 14:40:43,wallstreetbets,Notes?
2021-06-02 18:44:29,wallstreetbets,Javelin!
2021-06-02 16:49:00,wallstreetbets,I made $10k off $1400 today lol
2021-06-02 15:43:23,wallstreetbets,Nice. I didn't even buy that much. I literally just liked the stock in like.. February of 20
2021-06-02 15:51:00,wallstreetbets,Congratulations 🎉 and fuck you  “in a nice way “
2021-06-02 14:59:51,wallstreetbets,Kroger brand mesquite chips are no joke
2021-06-02 17:35:24,wallstreetbets,True Believer! One of us! One of us!
2021-06-02 16:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Something like that, went from my lowest holdings to my highest in a week though!!"
2021-06-02 16:29:17,wallstreetbets,Any reason why that particular format? I'm debating between fideltiy or robinhood
2021-06-02 19:38:08,wallstreetbets,300% in five months.  I’ll take it as is.  I’ve held a few huge paper gains and never realized them. Only to have the stock still not recover years later.
2021-06-02 17:00:55,wallstreetbets,Only play with house money. No such thing as a sure thing.
2021-06-02 18:32:19,wallstreetbets,"Nah dude, you did pretty much everything right. Congrats and fuck you."
2021-06-02 18:23:57,wallstreetbets,Don’t regret being not retarded but don’t expect any sympathy from me sitting over here in my throne of losses
2021-06-02 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,"You call it dumbfuckluck, but it’s really just gonna be dumbfuck since it’s gonna keep skying tomorrow."
2021-06-02 17:41:22,wallstreetbets,"Should have held, just wait until you see how much it goes up next week."
2021-06-02 19:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Look at it this way, everybody who is up and holding hasn’t made any money right now. If you sold after you were up nearly 400%, you’ve still made more money than diamond hands."
2021-06-02 19:24:31,wallstreetbets,Timing is everything also having fucking time to do the DD and well not be working also helps...
2021-06-02 17:36:28,wallstreetbets,"What percentage has the stock risen in the past few months? How could you have made millions unless you invested 10s of thousands or more? Did it rise like 10,000%? I'm OOTL"
2021-06-02 17:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Lol it’s ok, I’ll just do it again. 😂"
2021-06-02 19:03:02,wallstreetbets,Story?
2021-06-02 18:32:54,wallstreetbets,"Losses offset gains, so he’ll only be taxed on the net gains at the end of the year. Losing all your profits is a perfect tax scheme. 

This is not financial or tax advice, and certainly not good advice."
2021-06-02 18:31:02,wallstreetbets,That’s not how taxes work on capital gains lol
2021-06-02 17:41:26,wallstreetbets,"Lots of tech. Tesla leaps, SMH leaps, Nio leaps, ARKK OPTIONS. Everything got fucked."
2021-06-02 18:09:08,wallstreetbets,Decorative gourds probably.
2021-06-02 19:25:08,wallstreetbets,Incorrect. Taxes are paid on net realized gains. Gains minus losses.
2021-06-02 16:06:05,wallstreetbets,To be safe I sold enough to make back my investment but im holding the rest regardless of the outcome. I’ve recouped costs so I have no problem putting gains on the line 👍🏻🙌🏻
2021-06-02 15:31:44,wallstreetbets,"Understandable response, I can agree with you. There are other options so others that are new should know that they don’t have to follow everything."
2021-06-02 13:53:12,wallstreetbets,It was halted everywhere.
2021-06-02 13:51:34,wallstreetbets,That’s not how any of that works.
2021-06-02 13:51:26,wallstreetbets,Halts happen in the market no matter the brokerage...
2021-06-02 13:50:43,wallstreetbets,"No, the NYSE halted trades. It was across all platforms."
2021-06-02 13:58:25,wallstreetbets,It was an exchange halt. I initiated a sell and the halt didn't last long.
2021-06-02 13:49:55,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 15:24:44,wallstreetbets,Please see my edit for an explanation.
2021-06-02 16:10:03,wallstreetbets,This comment clearly shows why you are using RH.
2021-06-02 17:32:06,wallstreetbets,"I use Fidelity…they also have a beta softwAre that’s giving more analytics so you can see what is happening quickly and trade quickly. I’ve also had a few tell me they financed their account from their bank and RH hadn’t given them the money for almost a week now. Problem with that is, you want to buy, you used up funds, don’t want to sell to reappropriate funds and so you are stuck with no buys. Then market closes like yesterday and we’re up $32 a share from $32 a share. One day it doubled. You see how it’s already beneficial? I got my money advanced to me on Memorial Day and was ready to buy in the market on Tuesday. Setup my BB stocks and it’s up $4 a share. I also was able to secure the AMC stock in time so I made my Investment back held some AMC and reappropriated funds to BB to increase my shares. I’ve heard other things but I don’t trust RH. The CEO never even fully explained to people why the halt happened. Creating confusion for what is mostly small retail buyers looking to learn about the market. He did a disservice to our community, their platform and those that are wanting to learn so they can invest and make money like the rich do. I’m going off track a bit here but I’m trying to provide specific examples so you can see and feel what I feel. Fidelity also gives you EXTENSIVE resources to teach you, webinars, investor help (with minimums) bots to manage your portfolio, analytics, articles attached, watch lists with analytics, price alerts. I mean everything you could imagine is there for you. I love it! To summarize on RH, slight disadvantages lead to large losses and missed opportunities. Lastly, fear is normal, you are playing with high volatility and stocks are not guaranteed. A company can go bankrupt and liquidate and stock tanks to a few dollars. Learning a bit about the stocks are important if you are going to manage your own stocks. You can also make automation for sales if you can’t watch for the best time to sell. Protect yourself from getting any loss by setting limits on lows or highs if you have a target you want to sell at."
2021-06-02 13:44:14,wallstreetbets,The problem is that RH has the friendliest interface and retards like us need as much help as we can get.
2021-06-02 13:40:48,wallstreetbets,What’s the commission for these?
2021-06-02 14:38:01,wallstreetbets,I’d say TD more than Schwab (it’s the same thing) but thinkorswim is the best platform for trading in my opinion.
2021-06-02 13:38:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree they did it again with AMC 10 mins ago.
2021-06-02 16:44:41,wallstreetbets,"It's a stock legend, it's not a story the Investors would tell you. The sold button is a Unicorn none of us have seen."
2021-06-02 15:19:21,wallstreetbets,"Selling is when you actually profit, ya dumb ape!"
2021-06-02 19:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Then you are a retard until you sell and have take home money.

Until the check clears you don't have jack shit."
2021-06-02 15:13:14,wallstreetbets,"30 grand bro? Smile on, people could lose all of this tomorrow"
2021-06-02 14:23:31,wallstreetbets,"profit is profit and thats a solid fucking profit man. if you're doubting it in the future, dont sell everything. let some profit ride. either way you made almost 30 g's on a dumb fucking meme stock lol"
2021-06-02 15:42:19,wallstreetbets,still solid gains! win
2021-06-02 14:30:53,wallstreetbets,Can't complain about free money.
2021-06-02 18:33:04,wallstreetbets,You should buy back in !!! Retail owns 285 million shares of the 415 million outstanding... AND COUNTING!!! Tomorrow I ADD MORE !!! They doubled down their Short so they're inviting me to get DEEPER!!!
2021-06-02 14:29:35,wallstreetbets,I’m a poor student unfortunately
2021-06-02 14:27:47,wallstreetbets,not bad at all
2021-06-02 13:54:48,wallstreetbets,"40 contracts is 4000 shares. Close, but you're missing a 0. You can always just subtract the gains from the total value as well."
2021-06-02 14:12:25,wallstreetbets,Newbie also. So how much $ did it cost him upfront? And …how do they work? Curious. Something new for me to learn!
2021-06-02 14:31:40,wallstreetbets,I'm also new to options... So this means that you can sell the options any time you want? Don't need to wait for the expiry date?
2021-06-02 17:28:17,wallstreetbets,"Well its safe to say amc aint a dip atm, so to start with buying now is riskier then it was at 12. Thats no science but ape smart. Some gme are stuck at 300 or more levels, i hope amc players cash in their initial and some extra, and consider the rest a hilarious ride. So they get both, fun,  break hedge, profit, and money to ride again and again."
2021-06-02 14:37:54,wallstreetbets,They give them popcorn for free. Whoooaaaaa!!!!!
2021-06-02 15:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Lots of words praising AMC... ""Nowhere in there did I pretend they were a good company!!!""

It's okay, don't need to lie."
2021-06-02 14:19:05,wallstreetbets,5 billion > 230 million
2021-06-02 14:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Agreed but I firmly believe they are not done yet. They recently announced shareholder reward as part of their ""AMC CONNECTS"" program so hopefully more good news to come"
2021-06-02 16:09:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they're not done yet. There may not be anymore days like today but places are reopening and people are going to start going to the movies again. AMC is also the largest movie theater chain in the world. As the world goes back to normal AMC will start doing business again just like everyone else."
2021-06-02 19:37:17,wallstreetbets,"Let's be honest we are all here for the short squeeze,  fundamentals dont matter here.  AMC is not worth 30 bil atm, but the only thing that matters at the moment is supply and demand.  If you are dying of thirst and I'm your only supply of water, doesnt matter what the water is worth you'll pay what I ask for."
2021-06-02 13:39:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my Lambo."
2021-06-02 16:36:44,wallstreetbets,There sure is a whole lot of buttfuckery but I like it
2021-06-02 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm only an old man at heart lol, I just think it's funny I haven't heard anyone make jokes about buying a Gremlin or Pacer with their gains lmao"
2021-06-02 14:28:47,wallstreetbets,Nah they are owned by BMW. All the small ticket cars are owned by major companies.
2021-06-02 16:53:11,wallstreetbets,RYCEY is the next banger 🚀
2021-06-02 18:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah let´s all go for Rolls Royce ! Shares below $2.

I´m in !"
2021-06-02 15:06:50,wallstreetbets,"Aston Martin, they're pretty cheap under 30$/share they were near bankrupcy. Hopefuly Lawrence Stroll will bring them back."
2021-06-02 19:11:48,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, the don’t need our bananas. Besides cars, they make freaking Fighter Jet engines.

Woosh-machines, essentially."

1.) order medium trim lotus w/ AMC gain

2.)

3.) finally stop stealing cable"
2021-06-02 17:04:20,wallstreetbets,I made 2500 on options probably more when everyone else opens
2021-06-02 15:44:01,wallstreetbets,About like me with gme bought it last year for 4$
2021-06-02 16:38:31,wallstreetbets,Nicest thing I've ever heard
2021-06-02 16:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Careful throwing the Robinhood word around here. You'll get shit on. I personally have not done much trading in fidelity as most of my ""play money"" is in Etrade. I have been really happy with Etrade so far, I just upgraded to a margin account and now have really been enjoying the platform over all. I'm in fidelity because that's where my employers have all dumped my 401k money. Robinhood is a really good platform for beginning investors as it provides great explanations for a lot of the different securities and such that you may be interested in."
2021-06-02 19:25:33,wallstreetbets,I’ll take profits after the roller coaster I was on with GameStop

2021-06-02 19:04:51,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I’ve only ever experienced net capital losses. Thank you for the information"
2021-06-02 17:44:04,wallstreetbets,I have no words 🤯
2021-06-02 17:53:47,wallstreetbets,"What would you suggest using, I’m new to this and I’m on Robinhood but if you guys don’t think it’s safe what should I use."
2021-06-02 13:54:02,wallstreetbets,Why is that legal?
2021-06-02 15:16:18,wallstreetbets,"🤣 This fuckin sub now adays man, I swear"
2021-06-02 16:41:23,wallstreetbets,That's not even how the letters in the word works as well
2021-06-02 13:51:59,wallstreetbets,Yea its bullshit.
2021-06-02 14:31:48,wallstreetbets,I initially thought it was some shady shit going on but I am glad to hear it's normal.
2021-06-02 14:29:04,wallstreetbets,So does the hault stop you from both  buying and selling?
2021-06-02 13:52:30,wallstreetbets,"Tbf you can always “exit your position” and sell I think. On the other hand, screw Robinhood and why would anyone keep using them?!"
2021-06-02 13:46:07,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is in the works of a new UI that’s just as good and they are the most neutral of all brokers from the january squeeze
2021-06-02 14:04:12,wallstreetbets,I'm a retard but I use fidelity. It ain't as friendly but if I can get it done then you can too. Anything but Robinhood cuz F them. Never again.
2021-06-02 13:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Is it worth getting fucked on all of your transactions to the benefit of RH and Citadel due to the order flow arrangements they have? You’re aware that Citadel Securities (the market maker with the order flow agreement with RH) and Citadel Advisors (the hedge fund shorting GME, AMC, and tons of other stocks that you’re trying to profit off of) are sister entities controlled by the same person (Ken Griffin), right?"
2021-06-02 14:03:18,wallstreetbets,"Who cares about the UI? All that matters is functionality, the UI is just window dressing."
2021-06-02 14:08:15,wallstreetbets,"Not only that they offer some crypto. There's a fee to transfer out and they automatically sell your crypto. Also people dont wanna miss the MOASS while being in transfer limbo. No excuse to just do it now though, fidelity takes less then a few days."
2021-06-02 17:30:45,wallstreetbets,"On top of that, they aren't the only ones who disabled buying. They're already in a heap of trouble for what happened in January, I doubt they'd do it again this early."
2021-06-02 17:08:03,wallstreetbets,Webull?
2021-06-02 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,"no it doesn't. just because it looks like some college kid's web app project doesn't mean it even remotely comes close to counting where it is needed. get off that shit, like yesterday."
2021-06-02 13:46:42,wallstreetbets,I switched to fidelity and boy did that show me just how little I know. Too much numbers for ape
2021-06-02 13:51:09,wallstreetbets,"For Schwab $0 for regular trades, and $0.65 per Option contract one way.  Although you can get around that cost with the ""Walking Limit"" feature that reduces the premium you pay.

&#x200B;

For Fidelity, it is the same minus the ""Walking limit"" feature."
2021-06-02 13:54:15,wallstreetbets,"I think Schwab was like 7 dollars a trade but you get so many free trades. I have only had like five or six trades recently but haven’t paid any commissions, even the 7 dollars."
2021-06-02 14:08:47,wallstreetbets,NYSE halted it. Not robinhood.
2021-06-02 14:05:12,wallstreetbets,Amc was halted like 5 times already
2021-06-02 13:39:36,wallstreetbets,Plus Robinhood sells their order flow to Citadel.
2021-06-02 13:43:01,wallstreetbets,I think the SEC actually halted that one. I use eTrade and Thompson one to follow stocks and it was halted on there too
2021-06-02 14:18:34,wallstreetbets,That's not how halts work. That wasn't RH
2021-06-02 15:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Not ""yet"""

I’ll take my tendies when I can pay off my house. Life changing or nothing."
2021-06-02 15:58:41,wallstreetbets,Ha ha totally I'm really thankful and I typically exit these things earlier than the big pops but the FOMO never completely goes away for sure
2021-06-02 15:44:49,wallstreetbets,No no. AMC will climb forever and hit $500k per share easy peasy. /s
2021-06-02 14:44:22,wallstreetbets,DCA(Dollar Cost Average) man. There is still fractional shares. It's what i plan to do with GME so im in both plays.

2021-06-02 15:02:07,wallstreetbets,Koenigsegg  is pretty independent
2021-06-02 16:03:23,wallstreetbets,Kind of fitting though when you consider that the GME all-in idea came from VW
2021-06-02 16:58:01,wallstreetbets,Ferrari then; they are stock exchange listed and no longer affiliated with a large auto company.

2021-06-02 19:12:17,wallstreetbets,You can write off much more losses as long as you have gains.  So he could write of $650k losses in one year if he had $650k gains and then lost it all
2021-06-02 17:44:47,wallstreetbets,"Yup, all my leaps were conservative too. Tech sell off took everything from me"
2021-06-02 17:54:27,wallstreetbets,I made another extensive comment but let me see if I can tag you on it.
2021-06-02 13:59:13,wallstreetbets,Something to do with stocks having circuit breakers so they dont run up too fast. It is supposed to happen on both extremes (up or down). We are up 97%... ON THE DAY!

2021-06-02 14:38:20,wallstreetbets,"It’s the limit up limit down rule implemented sometime after the 2010 flash crash. The thought is that it lets people take a breather, is the price change because a huge fundamental shift occurred, is it someone trying to fuck with the market, is it just the algos going crazy. Sucks if you’re on the right side of the trade but it’s not meant to be nefarious."
2021-06-02 14:01:08,wallstreetbets,"You don't know what you are talking about. Halts are normal, and happen for literally any stock when there is a large amount of volatility going up or down. It's not bullshit. This is to protect investors and the market."
2021-06-02 14:56:48,wallstreetbets,Normal shady shit?
2021-06-02 14:51:17,wallstreetbets,"Yep. If you sell or buy during that time, it will only be initiated after the halt is over."
2021-06-02 14:32:58,wallstreetbets,The only reason I have them is because it's my first time buying stock and I didn't know what a shitshow it was.  Can I transfer my account elsewhere?
2021-06-02 14:58:42,wallstreetbets,I need them to hurry up with the new UI!
2021-06-02 15:28:47,wallstreetbets,"I am in the 'Beta' app now, is this the new one?  If so it hasn't been that bad for me to use."
2021-06-02 13:47:35,wallstreetbets,Fidelity didnt give me same.options access RH gives
2021-06-02 13:48:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah but the interface now sucks
2021-06-02 16:23:16,wallstreetbets,Settle down
2021-06-02 14:21:38,wallstreetbets,This. Blows my mind that people will risk losing money just because something looks basic and pretty.
2021-06-02 14:41:32,wallstreetbets,I put money into Fidelity and 3 weeks later I asked them to send me my money back. Couldn't figure out how to buy anything.
2021-06-02 17:07:57,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the execution on the options is well worth the $0.65. Don't have to deal with the shit spreads on RH."
2021-06-02 15:54:22,wallstreetbets,"~~Fidelity is free, not the same.~~"
2021-06-02 13:59:07,wallstreetbets,">Community heroes

They went free regular trades in October 2019.  It made headline news and inspired other major brokers to offer free regular trades too (Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, and ok boomer Vanguard)."
2021-06-02 16:52:53,wallstreetbets,Doesn't everyone but fidelity? And fidelity does PFOF for options
2021-06-02 16:37:46,wallstreetbets,There's no point in xx'ing if you're just gonna post your position in the next sentence 😂
2021-06-02 15:27:11,wallstreetbets,Preach
2021-06-02 19:43:25,wallstreetbets,The hedge funds are not squirming. They’re making hundreds of millions of dollars because they OWN STOCKS. Do you know what a hedge fund is 😂

2021-06-02 16:07:48,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I need a house
2021-06-02 15:00:05,wallstreetbets,Not a bad idea.
2021-06-02 17:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Why does is it say his break even is at 45.15 - wouldn't that mean at the current price he's losing money? Or is that the stock price, not the option value aka all that Greek shit?"
2021-06-02 15:09:49,wallstreetbets,Thank you for lesson! Appreciate it
2021-06-02 14:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Oh I understand, so it's similar to bonds in that sense... Thanks!"
2021-06-02 15:57:08,wallstreetbets,"Lol. First time away from the farmers market drum circle?

*any* *time* a company can take profits for its C-Class, it will. Always. On the way up as much as on the way down. 

Drink more pee and you’ll realize that a company acting in its own self-interest is hardly an indicator of profitability. 

Studios are simply unable to abandon the marketing and money-making beast that is a theater chain. They keep trying and can’t. 

AMC isn’t going anywhere. Long-term hold."

ummm, should we tell him?"
2021-06-02 14:49:06,wallstreetbets,I'd get a Porsche because they were the catalyst of the VW short squeeze.
2021-06-02 14:50:58,wallstreetbets,If you really want to get to the moon you’d get on a virgin galactic flight. SPCE!
2021-06-02 14:49:55,wallstreetbets,They shorted the fuck out of RYCEY too. Tons of step downs.
2021-06-02 17:41:21,wallstreetbets,Another buddy of mine also turned me on to them a few months ago—there’s definitely an opportunity there
2021-06-02 15:04:34,wallstreetbets,Isn't it listed in London though?
2021-06-02 19:30:40,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I have already created my DBX online. Fully loaded, of course. 

Let's do it."
2021-06-02 16:57:11,wallstreetbets,AMC Ape Motor company
2021-06-02 15:18:10,wallstreetbets,Fine
2021-06-02 16:31:43,wallstreetbets,they make like under 100 cars of each model though.
2021-06-02 19:16:47,wallstreetbets,They are tho lmao
2021-06-02 14:55:22,wallstreetbets,That's fine. That's why I bumped it from no 2
2021-06-02 17:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I think I found it downloading fidelity now."
2021-06-02 16:13:10,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense, thank you."
2021-06-02 14:27:43,wallstreetbets,But why?  I'm really new to all of this.  I legitimately don't know.
2021-06-02 16:12:08,wallstreetbets,Well I think its shady af if a company you trade stocks through prevents you from selling said stock for a profit.  Like I said I'm really new to all of this so I didn't know.
2021-06-02 14:58:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep I use Charles Schwab. Only problem is your account will be tied up in the transfer for like a week. So might not be the opportune time. You can choose to start an account separately and transfer things 1 at a time over a longer period if you want but might miss out on some promotions that whatever brokerage gives you for making a new account and adding [x] amount of funds/holdings (like Schwab will give you like 100 dollars for starting an account and putting 50,000 dollars in it by a certain date)."
2021-06-02 13:52:36,wallstreetbets,You can have the worry free ability to trade shares on fidelity and trade options on RH if u want i guess
2021-06-02 16:58:38,wallstreetbets,All you have to do is go online and enable it
2021-06-02 13:51:54,wallstreetbets,"Right, let me just go call Fidelity CEO and tell them to hurry up so people can’t get fucked by robbing hood again"
2021-06-02 17:05:04,wallstreetbets,"LOL. This is a casino, what were you expecting."
2021-06-02 15:17:30,wallstreetbets,"I can buy stuff on fidelity, but they're really stingy with level 2 options access"
2021-06-02 15:26:48,wallstreetbets,I decided to make fidelity my place for long term holdings. I'll get fried by the educates investor but I just have a few hundred in RAIL and SPAXX at least I don't have to worry so much
2021-06-02 15:19:15,wallstreetbets,"For Fidelity you really want to be using Active Trader Pro, their desktop software for trading

https://www.fidelity.com/trading/advanced-trading-tools/active-trader-pro/overview"
2021-06-02 15:58:38,wallstreetbets,"For regular trades of stocks & ETFs, they are the same.  $0 for commission.  
For Option contracts, they both charge $0.65 per Options contract one way. 

How is Fidelity trades different?"
2021-06-02 15:00:53,wallstreetbets,Nice my dad kept telling me they went commission free but I kept thinking I just had fre trades left over.
2021-06-02 16:44:38,wallstreetbets,I never claimed not to be retarded.
2021-06-02 19:57:59,wallstreetbets,"No, I have no idea. Why don’t you explain it to me? 

Ooh, can you also ELI5 how they’re not losing money on AMC?"
2021-06-02 16:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, sure 🙄 I haven’t seen a packed movie theater room in years. Good luck bud."
2021-06-02 18:53:44,wallstreetbets,">""More than a meme stock and legitimate long term play""? Lol

Because of what circumstances...

None of those words say ""AMC is a company with a solid foundation and a brilliant mind at the helm ready to guide this company forward."" They say it's a legitimate play because of the circumstances."
2021-06-02 19:53:38,wallstreetbets,Almost there
2021-06-02 18:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Me too, but unlikely. No options to attract the WSB horde."
2021-06-02 14:51:01,wallstreetbets,I fuckin love porsches. Some of the most subtle flexes. Is it a 3 year old base 911 worth 50-60 or 911 gt2 worth 400k. Idk because it’s dark and the body lines are the same
2021-06-02 14:52:18,wallstreetbets,Already did lol. Last Wednesday yolod the last 300 I had left on SPCE calls made it out with a few thousand
2021-06-02 17:16:56,wallstreetbets,SPCE is the next Great Squeeze....give it a week or so
2021-06-02 17:06:59,wallstreetbets,"Well with all the tendies to be made, theres hope to buy at least two, and why not customize them fully. Why settle for main stream cars when AMC took you to the moon buy a Koenigsegg, its pretty close to a rocket ship."
2021-06-02 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm drinking beer while sitting on the toilet and browsing reddit so fuck it, I'll feed ya. Why do you feel that way?"
2021-06-02 16:20:07,wallstreetbets,Solid plan! Use a Pencil? Or crayon?? 🖍
2021-06-02 14:32:15,wallstreetbets,"It stops everyone from getting fucked. Imagine if there was massive downward pressure and the price dropped 30% in a few seconds. There would be massive sell offs. With the halts, it gives people time to think about what's going on after a stock loses 10% in a short period of time."
2021-06-02 14:38:16,wallstreetbets,"In part because trades don't happen instantly. If you put in a buy order and in the 5 seconds it takes for the transaction to go through, it rises 30%, you are fucked. Same same only different with selling."
2021-06-02 13:54:42,wallstreetbets,Kinda what I do. Other thing that sucks about fidelity is doesnt trade afterhours and the prices dont update constantly. You have to hit refresh.
2021-06-02 14:03:25,wallstreetbets,That's not what I said. I use fidelity and Rh. Fidelity sucks. Their daily charts are ass. I'm sure their new app will be great.
2021-06-02 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,just wait until you try for after hours trading and margins
2021-06-02 16:09:55,wallstreetbets,I can buy stuff with fidelity but they're really stingy with profits
2021-06-02 16:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Don’t mind me, I can’t read. Mind skipped over all the words between the costs and thought you were saying the .65 cost was for both."
2021-06-02 16:16:18,wallstreetbets,"And clearly it's not essential to fill every single seat and maintain a solid profit.

It's cool you don't know how the business model works, but at least admit you're talking out your ass."
2021-06-02 17:48:06,wallstreetbets,Maybe because you haven't gone yourself? Theaters were packed this last weekend where I'm at....
2021-06-02 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,How come? Sorry I'm new to this whole stonks thing
2021-06-02 16:01:13,wallstreetbets,Porsche's are so good they're boring. I'd never have one.
2021-06-02 19:23:00,wallstreetbets,Didnt realize people were betting big on spce. Whats the news with them?
2021-06-02 17:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it. Pagani, not a public company but it's a flex and a half if there ever was one."
2021-06-02 18:09:13,wallstreetbets,Impossible to keep any crayons around. Someone keeps eating them.

2021-06-02 15:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they do have live streaming updates in the settings menu and they do trade after hours."
2021-06-02 14:22:23,wallstreetbets,That's why you get Seeking Alpha and plug in your stocks and shares so it can act as a virtual ticker.
2021-06-02 15:44:22,wallstreetbets,Probably 1/2 the problem right there.
2021-06-02 16:21:14,wallstreetbets,"Wow you must not have seen AMCs profit direction in the last 5 years, or be near anywhere with internet capable of steaming movies straight to your house without you having to drive, pay 5x what it would be online, pay for overpriced shitty popcorn, and deal with other stupid people you don’t know in the same room as you. I bet you pump water from the well out back too huh?"
2021-06-02 17:53:00,wallstreetbets,he probably lives in a small town and goes to the local theater. Every major theater near me is packed when covid isn't a thing
2021-06-02 17:52:31,wallstreetbets,"I’ve driven by movie theaters nearly every day and the parking lots are barren all day. Sure, blue moon movie events may encourage some busy days. However “some busy days” aren’t going to make the company profitable enough to be valued anywhere near its current price"

2021-06-02 19:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Look at the trends over the last year, then just technical analysis for me. The news is just that they’ve been testing flights nothing crazy"

2021-06-02 13:37:16,wallstreetbets,AMC just snorted a line and started eating tendies
2021-06-02 13:18:59,wallstreetbets,I think we just hit ludicrous speed!!🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 13:19:53,wallstreetbets,You guys I'm sweating.

2021-06-02 13:13:47,wallstreetbets,Congrat-Fuck-U-lations!
2021-06-02 16:36:01,wallstreetbets,I accidentally bought AMC two days ago when I was trying to buy AMD. The most well-timed accident ever.

2021-06-02 17:38:10,wallstreetbets,I follow this sub but have a staggering 250$ in the stock market. I just enjoy the drama that unfolds here.
2021-06-02 13:31:21,wallstreetbets,"You earned profit. Rare on this sub, I know… congrats and fuck you."
2021-06-02 13:14:26,wallstreetbets,Apes happened. The end.

2021-06-02 13:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I looked up and my option was 17k I tried to sell and it dropped to 2500 & then back up to 6k. Then froze at  $51.35. now it's over $70 and it's now $3500."

2021-06-02 14:13:01,wallstreetbets,I think your broker made a mistake.  send those gains over here and I'll get it straightened out.
2021-06-02 13:13:35,wallstreetbets,Probably some hedge fund that was shorting GME/AMC/BB/etc. got margin called today.
2021-06-02 13:15:16,wallstreetbets,How much gain do you think amc has?
2021-06-02 13:36:13,wallstreetbets,You got PAID is what happened. Congrats
2021-06-02 15:53:10,wallstreetbets,"GME and AMC are on their way up again. AMC is currently more impressive, but I sure hope GME follows suit."
2021-06-02 13:27:56,wallstreetbets,Honestly. You guys pulled it off. Amazing.
2021-06-02 17:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Kind of wish I had bought options instead of just stock, but I'm still up over 400% and happy."

2021-06-02 15:53:53,wallstreetbets,Same happened to me my 1 40c 6/18 said it was worth 18k but when I tried to sell it was like 1200 so glitch in the matrix?

2021-06-02 15:41:46,wallstreetbets,I'd really really appreciate if someone could drop a link on what explains all of this. Casual over here. Am I looking at the results of clever call options?
2021-06-02 14:52:53,wallstreetbets,Can we do this every day for a week?

2021-06-02 14:02:27,wallstreetbets,You’re early
2021-06-02 15:58:40,wallstreetbets,The amount of people that don't realize this was some kind of glitch is ridiculous. The same strike/date calls in my RH also showed a similar crazy high bump like this. I think they're messing with us. I feel like there's like a whole separate off-the-books options chain out there.  In the January pump there were weird duplicates of options in the chain for GME at crazy high prices like this.

2021-06-02 18:54:50,wallstreetbets,An option. It’s like a bet. I bet that amc would go to $40 a share by June 18th and it did!
2021-06-02 18:58:00,wallstreetbets,I bought 2 may 21st for like $70 each. And another one at like 500. Cost avg $237 I think

2021-06-02 15:16:12,wallstreetbets,How much are short term taxed at?
2021-06-02 16:44:05,wallstreetbets,I hope so. A few more weeks like this and I’m telling my wife’s boyfriend I’m done babysitting his kids.

2021-06-02 16:49:11,wallstreetbets,"To get to 1000 it has to START somewhere, 100% gain in a day could quite possibly be the BEGINNING, hence me saying it has BEGUN not finished"

2021-06-02 14:12:25,wallstreetbets,The short squeeze is when short sellers will have to cover sharers that they borrowed (synthetic shares) all I know is when they have to pay them back. Price go 🚀 I’m an ape tho so I don’t a lot
2021-06-02 19:14:54,wallstreetbets,"This means the retards on this subreddit is under the delusion that this is another short squeeze like GME. They have a fundamental misunderstanding of, well, pretty much how anything works.

Like this idiot below who thinks that hedge funds are still holding short positions from last year or something. It is the literal definition of projection - because they are THIS retarded, they think everyone in the world must be equally retarded."

2021-06-02 13:22:35,wallstreetbets,It only went to $61. Quickly and my option jumped up and down. Did you close out at 180.38? Or are you still holding?

2021-06-02 13:37:03,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot of funds out there shorting. Not all institutions are graced with unlimited money. Smaller funds with noticeable position on shorts on GME/AMC/BB/PLTR without proper risk management .. I can definitely see it.

&#x200B;

Plus, there's gamma squeeze on top (calls going ITM) if price shoots up. Add those two together and you see the result of simple supply/demand."
2021-06-02 17:54:04,wallstreetbets,"Of course. Old shorts get covered and new shorts come in.

There's always new institutions that come in with these stocks thinking the 'peak is near'. The institutions that shorted a while back might be forced to cover in meantime.

&#x200B;

After all, I'm one of those new shorts on AMC earlier today. Not so happy day today![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

At some point, the new shorts will find the 'peak' (or short at a price in which they are able to survive the pump). In the meantime, those that shorted at $8\~12, R I P."

2021-06-02 16:00:40,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah for sure glitch the bid ask was like 10.5 350 or something crazy. Would have been nice though lol

2021-06-02 13:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Options prices didn't actually go insane. You're seeing a mid price between the best bid and best ask. During a volatility circuit breaker you would expect prices to get wonky in options as the pricing provided may be unloaded from the book with the halt. If you legitimately think that your 12 DTE option that was $35 ITM spiked it's extrinsic value to double the price of the stock... I suggest you sell, take your gains, and do some fuckin reading before you buy more options"
2021-06-02 18:56:52,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, congrats that is awesome! How much does it cost to buy calls/options? Like how was the value you received calculated, like is there quantities of how many you buy or just a bet on this by this date?"
2021-06-02 13:44:03,wallstreetbets,Yea recently lost my job so I had to pull a lot of stocks out (but not AMC) to pay bills
2021-06-02 16:28:21,wallstreetbets,"For him it’ll most likely be 24% because of the bracket it falls under. But if he makes a lot money for his day job, it’ll be more depending on what bracket he falls in."

I saw a LOT of shorts go out of the money and I can’t imagine that’s anywhere near a good time for them. I’m also not sure whether they have started to cover their short bets or that is a phase yet to come.

It’s also not clear what the count is going to deliver and whether there’s a downside (e.g.: there’s only just 100.000 synthetic short shares borrowed) to that."
2021-06-02 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,Conservative? Please! The god damn VW squeeze hit a $1k without 3.5+ million diamond handed apes buying and holding. AMC no less than $100k

2021-06-02 19:22:28,wallstreetbets,Definitely holding!!! $180 is nothing for AMC it’s not even going to start the short squeeze! This movie has a very happy ending 🍿
2021-06-02 13:49:01,wallstreetbets,It says $72 - 52 week high in my app
2021-06-02 17:49:50,wallstreetbets,Was it right before they froze trading? I had an option up to 17k also and then blinked and It was down to 9k then blinked again and it dropped to 3k. Another one dropped right to 0.01.  I freaked out until I saw what happened.... Then just pissed cause it never went back up that high again.  Still holding.
2021-06-02 15:08:12,wallstreetbets,Doesn't it slow down at the end of the trading day? Tomorrow morning I would expect more.
2021-06-02 15:21:40,wallstreetbets,Don’t be confused shit this is what will not have us get to 1000 plus! AMC was suspended 4 times today and after each time it resumed it shot back up. This is a gama squeeze this is just the fucking beginning

2021-06-02 14:23:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm just factoring if it squeezes it might hit 8k, who knows

But with Cohan and Gamestop rebuilding this is at least a $500 stock, and then you have NFT and that E coin that can't be named being built with gamestop, $800 can't be out of the question"
2021-06-02 18:22:20,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze hasn’t even started yet, strap in. It’s likely to get bumpy but this thing is definitely going over $1000 a share if we hold. 💯"
2021-06-02 16:52:21,wallstreetbets,Yes just hold!
2021-06-02 18:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Regular shorting involves borrowing a share, selling it at market price and waiting for the price to go down. Then you buy the share at the lower market price and return it. There are over 95 million of them presently. These ALL have to be purchased and returned to the lenders. Synthetics are shares that were not actually sold by AMC. They have been created illegally by hedge funds to double and triple dip. These ALL have to be purchased as well, regardless of the price. A conservative estimate is over 450 million of those shares that the hedge funds will have to buy at any cost as well. This is going to be huge, and all we have to do is hodl."

2021-06-02 16:20:25,wallstreetbets,Is GME going through the same deal or is AMC just taking off on it's own atm? Haven't been paying much attention the last few weeks and was notified AMC was up 90% today at one point.
2021-06-02 13:23:23,wallstreetbets,"I was in the same boat, my contracts for a few brief moments were worth a quarter of a million before dropping back to 30k total."
2021-06-02 14:14:52,wallstreetbets,"When a stock gets halted, the options quotes get screwy as most market makers pull out their bids/offers. When the stock resumes trading again, the volatility is immediately high, so the bid/ask spread is also wide enough to drive a bus through. Typically the market makers tighten the spread within a minute or so, but during periods of high volatility (like after a halt) the spread remains wide.  


Anyway, typically profit and loss on options are quoted on your trading platform as the mid-point between the bid and ask. So when the spreads are fully blown out like that, you look like a paper millionare. It's almost always an illusion."
2021-06-02 14:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah some sneaky bastard probably put a limit sell at 180 and some dumbass did a market price buy... Transaction goes through, value spikes for a split second. Sometimes it doesn't even register on charts, it's so fast (or small order)."

2021-06-02 14:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Right.  Let's say the stock gets halted and your option had a bid/ask of $10/11, so the mid price becomes $10.50 and that's what your P&L shows.

Stock gets halted, bids go away. 

The quotes now are $5 / $3000. Mid price is now $1502.5. You look rich. That asking price is insane. 

Market opens back up, things start trading, ask price drops back down to sat $13, bid comes back up to maybe $9, and you could sell at the bid at $9."

This leaves a lot of questions; will people smoke more? Maybe. Will people smoke that much more? Doubtful. There will be winners that may replicate these results, but there will be a lot of turnover and firms getting swallowed up during that time as well.

2021-06-02 13:03:59,wallstreetbets,I guess I don't understand the comment. The TLRY merger has strengthened their position in the market as global industry leader. They should theoretically be able to capitalize on the market growth better and faster than their smaller competitors. Doesn't mean it has to happen only that they are well positioned to take advantage. They could grow at 60% YoY for all we know I would just rather track it conservatively at the projected rate of growth of their market.
2021-06-02 17:58:09,wallstreetbets,This estimate is just tracking the projected market growth of the legal weed industry globally. It's not crazy or unrealistic. TLRY is positioned to outperform the market growth by eating into competitor's revenue. If the market grows 30% YoY and TLRY grows slower TLRY is doing something wrong. They should be outperforming the market growth.

2021-06-02 18:45:42,wallstreetbets,"So far this year, Tilray, Inc. (TLRY) has reported several significant announcements as it relates to the international cannabis opportunity and has been increasing market share in several key emerging markets.

As it relates to the international side of Tilray’s business, we are most excited about the leverage that it has to the opportunity in the European Union (EU). We believe the EU cannabis market is attractive due to the size of it and the economics that are associated with the vertical. When compared to North America, the cost of medical cannabis in the EU is much higher. This is due to the market being much less saturated and do not expect this trend to change in the near future.

A Leading Play on the EU Cannabis Market

A few weeks ago, the Canadian cannabis company reported to be one of a handful of operators that were selected to participate in a new French medical cannabis experiment. The market responded favorably to the development and we are bullish on the leverage that Tilray has to strategic international cannabis markets.

Yesterday, Tilray announced an important milestone and reported to have received the necessary approvals and market authorization to offer branded medical cannabis products in Portugal. The Tilray branded cannabis products will come from its EU Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) state-of-the-art facility in Portugal and we are bullish on how the company has been executing on the EU cannabis market.

Tilray received the market authorization from Infarmed, which is the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products. The company is the only cannabis business to be granted this type of market authorization in Portugal and the development enhances its leadership position in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.

As it relates to Tilray’s leverage to the international cannabis market, Portugal will be the 16th country that sells the company’s products. We are bullish on the leverage that Tilray has to the international cannabis market and expect this aspect of the story to play a key role in the growth of the entire business.

The process associated the with the market authorization was complex and Tilray was required to submit a full quality dossier for a medical cannabis product. The approval from Infarmed confirms the quality and safety standards its GMP certified production and is a testament to the strength of Tilray’s ability to execute.

Tilray Seeing Increasing Demand for Cannabis in the EU

Tilray reported that it has seen increasing demand from patients in Portugal and throughout the EU. Patients are able to access Tilray’s products through major pharmaceutical distribution channels throughout Portugal and other markets in the EU. Going forward, the company expects to see continued increases in demand as emerging international medical cannabis markets continue to gain traction. Tilray’s EU campus is well positioned to capitalize on the demand trend in the EU and in other international markets and we will monitor how quarterly numbers reflect the increasing demand on a going forward basis.

Last year, Tilray was granted its third GMP certification for the facility in Portugal and we are bullish on this aspect of the story. The certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in the facility and export medical cannabis products to certain markets and expect these certifications to support growth on the international side of the business.

Another important aspect of the certification is related to it allowing Tilray to manufacture bulk extracts in the approved facilities and sell them as cannabis active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The certifications also let the company have additional quality control lab capacity to further advance its product innovation and research capabilities."

2021-06-02 12:37:18,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you didn’t buy too much. Seems like the market is being manipulated to benefit the hedgies again.
2021-06-02 12:39:55,wallstreetbets,BACK UP BABY
2021-06-02 12:49:54,wallstreetbets,Have faith my friend

2021-06-02 12:36:38,wallstreetbets,What's weird is that I had put in an order to add more AMC since it was rocketing and then it filled at 59. When the trading unpaused for a second.
2021-06-02 13:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Lmao

Edit: I don’t know why this got me so hard 😂😂"
2021-06-02 12:37:37,wallstreetbets,RIP my $70 lol

2021-06-02 12:39:00,wallstreetbets,"WERE COMING BACK UP TO TEAR THEM A NEW ONE!!! Your $59 bout to turn into tendies, never fret fellow ape!!

Edit: not financial advice"
2021-06-02 13:13:04,wallstreetbets,Retail investors like us literally own 80% of AMC right now. If we sell the price drops. We literally control the value of the company right now.
2021-06-02 13:12:37,wallstreetbets,"Im not the best financial advisor, to be frank im just a retarded ape but I see the line going up and I see the hedges trying incredibly hard to drive that price down but we arent letting up and were riding this rocket past the moon to mars and maybe even neptune if we wanna. Just hold because if you sell right now before the market closes in 3 hours you’re a moron. Fuck you and have a nice day"
2021-06-02 12:40:43,wallstreetbets,"Already coming back!!! They can only slow us down, nothing can stop silverbacks and their wives boyfriends!!"
2021-06-02 12:43:47,wallstreetbets,Maybe? Or maybe we’ll take theirs.

2021-06-02 12:40:48,wallstreetbets,Me and my lowly 5 shares are holding.   This is my first real experience with all this and its thrilling as hell.  I am honored to be amongst you apes.

2021-06-02 12:28:55,wallstreetbets,Guys I think stage 3 is preparing to fire
2021-06-02 12:57:16,wallstreetbets,"I just ordered everything I need to take summer off and try streaming / video editing, and I'm still deep in AMC too. Diamond handing has also given me more back bone in personal relationships, too. This was not just a gamble / investment, but a huge lesson in following my own compass, in the face of overwhelming scrutiny."
2021-06-02 12:38:28,wallstreetbets,HODL APES THEY THINK THE HALT WILL GET US TO FOLD ITS ONE BIG WIG THAT SOLD OUT DONT GIVE IN

2021-06-02 12:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Trade Halts are the SEC bailing out the Hedgies, and getting paid on the back end…"
2021-06-02 12:27:47,wallstreetbets,Believe it just got put on hold.

2021-06-02 13:33:01,wallstreetbets,Why in the hell would you cash out now? So much more upside potential here with the publicity today’s events will garner.
2021-06-02 17:22:04,wallstreetbets,holding 95 right now. already got my investment back. I'm nervous as shit. I'm about 6k up as we speak
2021-06-02 12:35:32,wallstreetbets,Volatility halt. Normal when a stock has an immense amount of trade volume in a short time.
2021-06-02 12:42:38,wallstreetbets,the SEC put it on temporary hold
2021-06-02 12:39:00,wallstreetbets,Party is back on. Keep the music going DJ
2021-06-02 12:41:18,wallstreetbets,Don’t be surprised if this happens again if it keeps trading at such high volumes in short amounts of time.
2021-06-02 12:29:16,wallstreetbets,Yup Robinhood just halted trading.
2021-06-02 17:23:11,wallstreetbets,trade halting is to let the computers calculate all the trades
2021-06-02 14:00:55,wallstreetbets,Again just now
2021-06-02 15:38:47,wallstreetbets,Yes that’s what happens? It’s not some conspiracy. Before you comment ask yourself “Do I even know what I’m talking about?” retard.
2021-06-02 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,Until it reaches $200 a share
2021-06-02 12:44:00,wallstreetbets,Yesss i bought more at 50 🤤
2021-06-02 12:45:24,wallstreetbets,Wish I knew what the hell i was doing!!!   A HUGE thanks to all the others posting their (non) financial advice.  Help us newbies get our feet under us before we learn to fall on our own.
2021-06-02 12:45:05,wallstreetbets,4 shares of profit is how I see it.

2021-06-02 13:28:22,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you! 23 shares! Fuckin’ halts are giving me anxiety, but I’m in for the HODL."
2021-06-02 18:33:59,wallstreetbets,"My goal is to gain some knowledge to the point where I feel confident enough(or retarded enough) to be buying 95 shares at a time.  I owe the apes of this sub a giant amount of gratitude for the little knowledge I have gained so far.  Now, I need to read up and learn call options cause that seems to be very popular method."
2021-06-02 16:45:53,wallstreetbets,My 2 9.5 contracts are like the foundation of my gainz right now
2021-06-02 12:50:05,wallstreetbets,No I meant from before where the hedges used the halts to fuck us over. Not hating on GME!

2021-06-02 12:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Man I don't even know you and I'm happy as fu\*k for you!!! You took a risk and it's paying off, well done my friend."
2021-06-02 12:28:02,wallstreetbets,Remember to put aside money for taxes when you sell....
2021-06-02 12:16:30,wallstreetbets,I’ll be the lame one here - don’t forget taxes!
2021-06-02 13:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Cringe, this guy is using the green theme on his app. Everyone knows red looks cooler"
2021-06-02 13:11:21,wallstreetbets,"My grandmother passed away on Monday the 24th and it's been a rough few weeks. But GME and AMC started to moon that day, so I feel like she is somewhere pulling some strings. Cheers to you Gangie. Love you.

2021-06-02 12:36:27,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness, remember to lock in some profits. I know the feeling of having nothing, getting excited about the money, but then never selling and being devastated"
2021-06-02 12:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Your father is screaming ""SELL, YOU FUCKING RETARD"" right now."
2021-06-02 16:32:21,wallstreetbets,Those contracts should be sitting @ $4500/ea by now.  Congrats. I almost bought the same strike. Almost doesn’t get you shit tho.
2021-06-02 12:18:41,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain how any of this works? How did he turn $750 into $40k?
2021-06-02 12:59:08,wallstreetbets,"I doubt you would ever sell 90%+ of it, but for fucks sake, do you and your future self some good and at least take 50%-70% and throw it into something safe. Taxes are a bitch, but damn so is a flash crash. lol"
2021-06-02 12:28:51,wallstreetbets,Sell. Take your profits
2021-06-02 12:55:11,wallstreetbets,why is the average cost only .61? o.o

2021-06-02 12:23:43,wallstreetbets,And it’s to 55 now. You’re a real 🦍. And also fuck you
2021-06-02 15:16:10,wallstreetbets,You’re probably doing even better now that the share price is $20 higher than when you posted this.
2021-06-02 12:20:57,wallstreetbets,Let’s gooooooo bro!!! You got this! I know we apes but Maybe consider taking some protists and buying real estate! 🙏🏼
2021-06-02 15:18:15,wallstreetbets,"Man I need to read up on how this shit actually works. I just went ape and bought AMC back in January when was at $11 and been waiting for this day.

Finally realized what limit sells were and last week set to selling at $50 a share. Never cancelled to change to higher amount, was gonna set to $75 or $100 but I'll take my 456% profits!"
2021-06-02 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Get that rocket ready, we about to see your dad up in the stars mate."

Congrats and fuck you"
2021-06-02 16:01:39,wallstreetbets,Those calls are worth 57k now with AMC closing at $63 today. (June 2nd). Sell half OP by this week to lock in gains
2021-06-02 18:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah dude. My dad left me some cash when he passed, and I dumped it into AMC. I'm sure he's happy for me now! Planning to buy a tribute for him with the gainzzz"
2021-06-02 15:35:37,wallstreetbets,Unpopular opinion but consider selling at least half to lock it in. Sure it might continue to moon but in case it doesn’t you won’t have regrets of taking some off the table. Nothing to scoff at for selling for a profit!
2021-06-02 12:38:45,wallstreetbets,"I wish I knew how to do anything other than just buy and sell shares lol 

Godspeed!"
2021-06-02 12:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, I had $3 calls the first time around. Sold for so much profit before the crash, but could you imagine? Congrats"
2021-06-02 12:55:30,wallstreetbets,This is the way.  Good feels

2021-06-02 13:26:09,wallstreetbets,"Sell it dude please, I’m hurting just seeing you hold it right now. Maybe not all but take half the profits at least!"
2021-06-02 16:03:45,wallstreetbets,"When it first started going up, I was like ok, I'm setting a stop sell at $14. It almost immediately dropped under and my 80 shares were gone. Then for a couple of days it stayed there and I was like ok whatever I made a profit yipee. Now all I can do is regret not buying back in. I had an original buy in price at $8.36 a share. I failed you apes. I'm a paper handed bitch."

2021-06-02 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,"Probably against the grain…but until you close your position and cash out, you don’t have anything.
Don’t forget that, and don’t start gambling money that could make a difference to your life."

2021-06-02 19:28:17,wallstreetbets,"What’s your exit point?  You need to realize the profit before celebrating, just keep in mind that what goes eventually does come down.

If I were you, sell half and lock in those gains and let the other half ride a little, but always have an exit strategy before you take a trade."
2021-06-02 13:33:45,wallstreetbets,I wish i bought at .61$ loll good decision. I got in at 10$ and still sitting pretty happy on profits. Not even considering selling until we hit 4 figures per share minimum

2021-06-02 13:48:02,wallstreetbets,"If it's good enough for a screen shot, it's good enough to sell.  Take those profits, you earned them.  I lost my dad in 2006 when I was a younger dude, so this brings a little tear to my eye.  That said, don't let this slip through your fingers, options move fast."
2021-06-02 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,How do I get started with options?
2021-06-02 13:48:34,wallstreetbets,when did you buy in?
2021-06-02 13:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Congrats!  
You don't HAVE it until you sell it, so if this is something that could be life changing for you, I would recommend cashing some out."
2021-06-02 13:51:11,wallstreetbets,💁🏼‍♀️Abort Robinhood 🙅🏼‍♀️

2021-06-02 14:00:28,wallstreetbets,"False. If you know how to make this much money off of $750 using options, you've done this before and definitely had this much before."

2021-06-02 14:06:01,wallstreetbets,Remember it isn't a win to you sell some or all of it. Sell a contract and you 4x'ed what you started with. Maybe put in orders to sell a contract or 2 at increasing prices. Don't assume it will have another day like today.
2021-06-02 14:06:04,wallstreetbets,"F it, I'm in on BB tomorrow. 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-02 14:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Well done, but it’s not always so easy. If you’re up almost $39k donate $750-$1,000 to a local animal no kill shelter or other charity in your area, it’s good karma, I promise"

2021-06-02 14:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Be EXTREMELY careful there. RH halted trading on AMC on the last bout of gains several months ago. If the deadline on that option weren’t so soon, I’d tell you to transfer out of RH.

I just seriously hope they don’t halt trading again for your sake. 🦍💪"
2021-06-02 14:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Having do much fomo, sold my amc shares a few months ago. Stonks are tough."

I think I finally understand them, but why does your screenshot say ""Current Price $30.33"" and then below says ""AMC Share Price $48.14"", when I do the math the gains seem in line with the $48.14 number.. so is the $30.33 # just lag behind?"
2021-06-02 15:17:02,wallstreetbets,Ummmm... I'm jazzed knowing that AMCB is riding high.  Can't wait to see it hit the 300s. 🍾💪😎👍

2021-06-02 15:20:10,wallstreetbets,"Funny how as soon as AMC starts to fulfill it's destiny WSB starts loving it. I remember when AMC was a ""distraction"" and ""pump and dump"". Funny how attitudes change on a green day."

2021-06-02 15:49:56,wallstreetbets,"So how many of you actually think a piece of shit like AMC is actually worth saving? I understand making a buck, but you can't possibly be pathetic enough to care about a (terrible) first run movie theater chain can you?"
2021-06-02 15:49:56,wallstreetbets,It will all be gone in a few days if you don't take profit. You've been warned.
2021-06-02 15:50:38,wallstreetbets,"I put $30 when it was at $9. You apes really are praiseworthy. Thank you. Heartfelt thank you.

2021-06-02 15:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Trust me take out like 10k right now and if you wanna risk the rest go for it but my question to you is,

If you had 40k right now would you put every single cent of it buying IN to amc right now at this current price? If the answer is no don’t gamble it all now because that’s essential what you’d be doing"

Be smart with your money. Beef up your emergency fund first, then decide what to do with the rest."

2021-06-02 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,Ok I’ve looked at options a few times and I absolutely cannot understand how $750 can become over $30K. Am I just stupid
2021-06-02 16:20:08,wallstreetbets,"What kind of options are these, short/long? Calls/puts?  Just curious, new to trading options."
2021-06-02 16:20:23,wallstreetbets,You should update this
2021-06-02 16:21:02,wallstreetbets,"I am completely new to stocks and have no idea how to read this. Does this mean you invested $750 and now you have $39,429?"
2021-06-02 16:21:08,wallstreetbets,Well a couple of contracts my friend. Maybe 3 or them just to lock in some profits and sleep happy

2021-06-02 16:36:49,wallstreetbets,That was when it's 30 so did you hold the contract since it was hitting 70 or did you sell today?
2021-06-02 16:37:19,wallstreetbets,Close it first thing tomorrow and YOLO into $CLNE shares/calls. June 13c are literally a dime right now and have massive OI which means legit gamma squeeze. Split between shares and calls.

2021-06-02 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap. I just checked AMC today. Major regrets selling AMC for OCGN. AMC is going to be (already is) worth more than another potential covid vaccine for USA (and that’s still a big if). 

Congrats to all of you."

2021-06-02 17:09:11,wallstreetbets,"It's not profit until you sell. Not saying you should sell, but as someone who watched $350 turn into $25K and then into $0, don't forget to sell ITM contracts."
2021-06-02 17:09:36,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness, what app is being used???"
2021-06-02 17:10:03,wallstreetbets,Man .. I wish I would have had some kind of money to put into GME or AMC. Guess I'll just keep staying broke.

2021-06-02 17:11:59,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, with so much life changing money, could consider taking profits soon at open, or hold if that’s the way you like to play it. Either way, Godspeed 🚀"

2021-06-02 17:12:33,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 17:12:41,wallstreetbets,Looking down because he’s taller than you? Or because he’s in ape heaven?

2021-06-02 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,"What website/application is that? Does that work in Australia? If not what works? 😊
I'm new here, so...."
2021-06-02 17:14:40,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain to my ape brain what this screenshot means? I have only bought stocks and held them for the most part so I'm completely retarded.

2021-06-02 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap, I did not notice. Glad I held those 25 shares."
2021-06-02 17:20:28,wallstreetbets,"Awww fuck me. I bought 3 shares a while ago at $13 something per share. Then bought one more at $11 something per share (I was doing this mainly for fun since everybody else was.... I don't have money for dicking around with the stock market). Anyway, it started to tank and I sold all 4 shares for a little over $5/share."
2021-06-02 17:20:38,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful Sight!! Love it, get ready for tomorrow’s thrust AMC still has 4 more Stages on this Rocket 🚀 Congrats on the gains"
2021-06-02 17:20:46,wallstreetbets,Its gme part 2 buy the dip before you cant
2021-06-02 17:21:12,wallstreetbets,So I bought an option last night for $160 at the strike price of $73 dollars. The limit price was a 1.63. The option was only in effect to the end of the day and it got canceled. Is there anything I can do about this? Because I literally would’ve made a decent amount of cash.
2021-06-02 17:21:21,wallstreetbets,Congrats. Now what’s your exit plan to realize some of those gains?
2021-06-02 17:21:43,wallstreetbets,"I sold yesterday at 30. I am retarded.

2021-06-02 17:26:58,wallstreetbets,How are you regards still using RH. Some people never learn
2021-06-02 17:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Wait, if I'm seeing this right, you bought them for 61 cents a share? How even?"
2021-06-02 17:29:28,wallstreetbets,Happy for you! Now go out and have some fun.
2021-06-02 17:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Use it wisely. If you don't come from money and can't ""waste"" it , don't piss it off trying to hang with these folks that have more to play with"
2021-06-02 17:30:24,wallstreetbets,How did it end up so much off just 750? Is there a multiplier or something?
2021-06-02 17:30:39,wallstreetbets,How much of this goes to taxes again? You have to pay for unrealized gains right? Sorry... I don't know much
2021-06-02 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Awesome. Don’t listen to anyone when it comes to staying or leaving. 

Just try to save some of it."

2021-06-02 19:09:22,wallstreetbets,Love to see it
2021-06-02 19:10:47,wallstreetbets,"Most important thing you can do right now is sell one, take that $3k and keep the rest of the money in if you want to roll with it. Don't get greedy and keep it in to lose it all, your expiration date is 6/18, there's a lot of time to potentially lose a lot of value by holding on too long."
2021-06-02 19:16:53,wallstreetbets,Amazing

2021-06-02 19:59:01,wallstreetbets,You deserve it. Is this like pocketing the cash after hitting a jackpot at the casino? Don't give it back. Play smart. Good luck in the future. 👍
2021-06-02 12:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Sell those contracts now!!! Well maybe sell 10 and exercise 3

2021-06-02 15:25:28,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain to me? Did he make 39 thousand? What am I looking at I’m very new to the market
2021-06-02 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain how they made this much off of $750? I'm guessing this is an option?  I thought an option would cost a lot more than $750
2021-06-02 19:51:56,wallstreetbets,Can you even math bruh??? Where in your life is there $750 here I clearly see only $5k profit meaning u did not put in no $750  lol
2021-06-02 16:03:25,wallstreetbets,How is your Avg. Cost that low? AMC hasn't been under a $2 in over 5 yrs
2021-06-02 12:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Please close out, this is life changing money."
2021-06-02 15:15:09,wallstreetbets,"Forgive my ape brain, but how were you able to make $750 into $38,000? Did you buy them when they were .50c a share? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"
2021-06-02 15:24:30,wallstreetbets,Wait how did you make so much. When did you buy
2021-06-02 15:42:43,wallstreetbets,[deleted]

2021-06-02 15:57:11,wallstreetbets,Is this options trading?
2021-06-02 16:01:17,wallstreetbets,"This amount of money would literally change my entire life.

2021-06-02 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,"Aye congrats man. I've been in stocks since September of last year, so I'm not too familiar with options, but this is awesome. I bought 75 shares at a $12 average, so seeing someone who spent less and gained more is awesome. Up to you if you wanna sell. I'd be careful about hedge funds doing a repeat of January and causing everything to tank. Congrats on those gains!"
2021-06-02 13:10:59,wallstreetbets,Sell at least some to realize gains ath aren't forever if 5 or 10k is life changing money I highly recommend cashing out at least that while you can at this share price.
2021-06-02 13:26:48,wallstreetbets,"At least sell 1 contract man, cover that $750 and then laugh as you’ll be in the black if it tanks anyway"
2021-06-02 13:30:08,wallstreetbets,Cash a good chunk of it in. Swear no retard would call that paper handing

Congrats. Take it and run."

2021-06-02 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,"can someone explain what is happening with AMC? is there big whales who have shorted AMC stock and retail people are buying it go make the price up forcing the whales to cash out / take big hits?   
I just see short squeeze short squeeze but who is the fucking target????"
2021-06-02 16:05:36,wallstreetbets,"Okay, but you still need to sell to get that much. Don't diamond hands that shit like an idiot, dump it the moment it looks like it's falling."

A)  If this is truly life-changing gainz, don’t forget to sell those motherfuckers.  Enjoy, fuck you, etc.

B)  Put X% in (untouchable) savings for taxes.  If you don’t know how much you should estimate, see an accountant now."
2021-06-02 18:44:37,wallstreetbets,I wished I could understand options

2021-06-02 19:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Question from a newbie, How come the closing price on a stock is a different amount than my etrade price, they show closing different? Is this an issue?"
2021-06-02 19:10:26,wallstreetbets,All I'm getting from this thread is a lot of people about to lose their lunch money on their first option
2021-06-02 19:12:23,wallstreetbets,I'm noob but how do you do this? I mean what are you buying if not the stock itself and how does it work?
2021-06-02 19:14:01,wallstreetbets,How did you get an average cost of 61 cents???
2021-06-02 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,"You Sir, can soon become my wife’s boyfriend."

Learn from my mistakes haha"
2021-06-02 19:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Hi everyone. I've been watching videos to finally start trading options. I have one question, I understand I get to select an expiration date when buying a contract. In theory wouldn't I want to set long expiration vs a short one assuming the price per stock continues to grow and exercise that contract whenever I like before it expires? Thank you."
2021-06-02 19:53:43,wallstreetbets,How's that even possible with merely 750 dollars. what?
2021-06-02 19:56:39,wallstreetbets,Rotation to tlry and palantir guys. For more gains.
2021-06-02 15:43:46,wallstreetbets,this guy fucks
2021-06-02 15:49:50,wallstreetbets,"I am new to options.. I think I finally understand them, but why does screenshot say ""Current Price $30.33"" and then below says ""AMC Share Price $48.14"", when I do the math the gains seem in line with the $48.14 number.. so is the $30.33 # just lag behind?"
2021-06-02 15:55:15,wallstreetbets,Wonder if his dad is looking down on him smiling because he is smaller then his dad?
2021-06-02 15:39:12,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-02 16:55:02,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah, I’m drooling for buying at $8 and cashing in at $20"
2021-06-02 17:19:08,wallstreetbets,I feel like he cashed out and screenshotted his gains right before but i could be wrong. I myself was sure that the amc train was coming to a halt at 30-40 mark but boy was i wrong.
2021-06-02 15:50:44,wallstreetbets,How does the taxes on this work?
2021-06-02 16:03:47,wallstreetbets,What trading platform do you use
2021-06-02 16:37:37,wallstreetbets,"I was just thinking that. Damn I should have played more options, now they're stupid expensive."
2021-06-02 17:12:56,wallstreetbets,What else is there to do besides buy and hold?!?

2021-06-02 12:26:44,wallstreetbets,"He bought 13 contracts at 61 cents per share. 13 contracts = the right to buy 1300 shares at 19$. If he hasn't sold yet its much much more. Just think 1300 shares times the difference between the strike price and the current price. Then factor in IV and those contracts are probably nearing 100k rn

Call options are incredible. But you risk your premium since you are buying the right to buy instead of shares."

With the stock at $56 right now, that is ($56 - breakeven of 19.61)* 1,300 = $46,007.

2021-06-02 16:03:05,wallstreetbets,Those are call options. Each option costs .61 per share and each option is for 100 shares. His stroke price is $19. This means for each option contract he can buy 100 shares at $19 per share. He bought 13 options which means he has the option to buy 1300 shares at $19 per share even though the price in the screenshot is $30. $750 basis is $.61 x 13 call option contracts x 100 shares.

He has 13 contracts (amount). He bought the 13 contracts for $61/ contract(0.61*100). Each contract = 100 shares. 
So in order to calculate his profit you do this 
30.33(actual price)-0.61(price he paid) = $29.71 
$29.71*1300 (13 contracts) = $38.639"

2021-06-02 18:09:49,wallstreetbets,30.33 is the options contract price (each contract has 100 stock shares) so multiply contract price by shares (30.33*100) and then multiply that by 48.14(current actual stock price of amc as everyone sees it). Then you’ll get how much equity he has in it ($39k)

It’s high because short term investments are taxed higher than long term https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets

For instance, if someone on here claimed to have made $500k plus on their short term gains, most likely gonna get taxed on 37-50%  of that

2021-06-02 12:54:18,wallstreetbets,"With STCG, it depends on your tax bracket. A gain of $39k may pull one in to the next tier, so it’d be good to calculate now and set aside the appropriate amount. 

Also recognize if you’re used to getting refunds at the end of the year, that ain’t happening this year, so don’t go assuming you’ll get some back come Feb/Mar/Apr 2022."
2021-06-02 12:52:30,wallstreetbets,depends how long he held.  Less than one year = short term capital gains --> taxed at marginal income tax rate.  More than one year = long term capital gains and is lower than that (0-15% depending on income)
2021-06-02 12:46:18,wallstreetbets,"You enjoy living in a civilized society with roads, schools, infrastructure…? Yeah, tax money my friend. Tax rates should be lower and the money should be better spent, but taxes serve a purpose."

2021-06-02 13:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Lessen them? Buy high, sell low. 

Other than that, donations, interest payments in some vehicles like property, etc. Talk to an accountant if you need more info."

2021-06-02 15:26:40,wallstreetbets,"> Any way to lessen them?

Put money into an IRA and invest there. I've made truckloads on AMC, TSLA, and AMD and it's all tax free. I've put in probably $75k to the account over the years, and I could pull out all $75k today without any penalty whatsoever. I can't pull out any of the profits until I retire though, but when I do they won't be taxed."
2021-06-02 13:35:42,wallstreetbets,"I can’t speak to international taxes, but here, unless you’re selling your securities, there’s no income implications."

in sweden you basically pay no taxes on your stonk gainz, while we have the worlds highest taxes overall. different countries handle this differently, it can also have to do with the size of your account and such."

2021-06-02 14:19:43,wallstreetbets,"You sell, it’s a gain or loss and will have tax consequences. They don’t give a shit what you do with it after.

2021-06-02 14:12:01,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. I had some old galvanized steel pipes burst in my home. Needed cash fast for repairs. Had no choice but to sell my AMC when it hit $12 a couple weeks ago. At the time I was super happy with my ~30% gains, but today I am crying.

Welcome to the stock market, where even the winners feel like losers."
2021-06-02 15:54:53,wallstreetbets,"I could have been sitting $1000 in BB options right now instead of $475 in cash I sold for earliertoday, and that would make me sad  *EXCEPT* that I'm sitting on $475 in cash that was $150 just 6 days ago.  And I'm okay with that."
2021-06-02 16:56:28,wallstreetbets,Are you me?
2021-06-02 16:57:07,wallstreetbets,For real. I was watching AMC today. Didn't think it would move above the 30s. Next thing I know it's pushing 60. I buy. It immediately peaks and goes down. I sell at a loss. It reverses and goes back up. I'm so tired.
2021-06-02 18:57:43,wallstreetbets,My GME bag stares at me from the corner. I've been holding since 316.

2021-06-02 14:55:36,wallstreetbets,No it’s not a game or team sport. It’s a market. Markets purpose is primarily to make profit. If you don’t do that then you are fundamentally misunderstanding how you actually make big gains.

2021-06-02 13:04:27,wallstreetbets,"Is there a way to tell how long ago the option was purchased?

Or is there somewhere that shows the historical prices for a given strike price for a particular stock?"
2021-06-02 13:20:20,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for this detailed explanation!!!
2021-06-02 13:45:19,wallstreetbets,"But why 13 contracts? Why at 61 cents? Why the is it the right to buy shares at $19? 

I understand he did a thing but where did those numbers came from?

I can barely understand buying stock lmao"
2021-06-02 14:39:15,wallstreetbets,So what happens if the stock price tanks? Can he only lose $750 or will he then owe a ton of money?
2021-06-02 15:29:28,wallstreetbets,"Noob question - That all makes perfect sense, but it would mean that to exercise the contract he would need $19x100x13=$24,700 in order to sell those shares and collect the profit, correct? Does Robinhood/other apps allow you to buy those if the share value exceeds it? Or would it be a matter of buying on margin?"
2021-06-02 15:38:05,wallstreetbets,My smooth brain is thinking then that it's best to do calls when it's so close to zero that it's unlikely to go any lower?
2021-06-02 15:49:44,wallstreetbets,How is that different from just buying 1300 shares at 0.61 and selling when it reaches $19 (or whatever)?
2021-06-02 16:14:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about this. Say, I wanted to gamble $100 just to test it, where could I learn more about this in brief? 

And is this sub legit, or is it still a meme. Are amc and gse good stocks for real?"
2021-06-02 16:28:50,wallstreetbets,insane
2021-06-02 16:50:46,wallstreetbets,How do I buy contracts on RH?
2021-06-02 17:09:19,wallstreetbets,"why would anyone sell 61 cents per share if the stock price is much higher? 
so if the price hits $18 he gets go buy the stock for 61 cents per share?"
2021-06-02 18:11:38,wallstreetbets,Ok next question: how do I buy stocks? Lol
2021-06-02 12:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Hey, dumb newbie question... but how do most people get out of a position like this? Some people were telling me that you wouldn't exercise your option to buy for $19 but instead you sell your call options? How does that work?"
2021-06-02 12:43:40,wallstreetbets,So if you are without the capital to exercise the option are you SOL? Can you sell the option and deduct what you would have payed?
2021-06-02 12:43:15,wallstreetbets,So he has to hold these until the 18th and that's when he gets the gains?
2021-06-02 16:51:42,wallstreetbets,How do I do call contracts on Rh?
2021-06-02 12:56:52,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, he bought 1300 things for $.61 each, now they’re worth over $30 each"
2021-06-02 13:24:30,wallstreetbets,I made 1200 lmao
2021-06-02 13:10:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 16:39:37,wallstreetbets,Had it to sell only half of my shares incase AMC decides to go past the moon
2021-06-02 13:23:54,wallstreetbets,Sell.  Yes sell.  He never had that type of gain before.  And still hasn’t.  Bird on the hand is worth 2 in the bush.
2021-06-02 14:41:21,wallstreetbets,"You bought it when, wow"
2021-06-02 16:12:19,wallstreetbets,And then he can either excercise the option and buy the 1300 shares for 19$ each or just sell the option for for it's market value right ?
2021-06-02 13:27:52,wallstreetbets,Did they really?
2021-06-02 16:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh, that definitely seems like the way to go."
2021-06-02 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,thank you bro
2021-06-02 14:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah… memes aside; if he’s never had that kind of money, it’s best to take some profit at the minimum since he probably won’t be able to time the top."
2021-06-02 13:26:40,wallstreetbets,Most new investors make a ton of money but do not sell. And then it goes down. The best way is to get out and wait for a new opportunity. (My two cents)
2021-06-02 13:28:16,wallstreetbets,Not yet. I almost sold a few weeks ago when I broke even but I chose to keep holding since 5 months of wait for $80 profit didn't seem worth it to me. Currently looking at nearly $4k profit instead. Doesn't even take into account the gains from GME
2021-06-02 18:31:01,wallstreetbets,Did it work?
2021-06-02 16:08:39,wallstreetbets,"To expand on what this guy said:
100 (shares per contract) x 30.33 (price per share per contract) x 13 (contracts)"
2021-06-02 17:16:12,wallstreetbets,How does this guy have 750$ dollars in but 30k in equity on options?
2021-06-02 16:50:22,wallstreetbets,Ok so I’m new too. Now what? Let’s say he doesn’t have the capital to exercise. How does he sell what he does not own? Where does he make money?? What I’m seeing is that if he exercised and sold that’s what he would make.
2021-06-02 16:09:39,wallstreetbets,"oh.. I thought the gains = (48.14-19.61) * (13 * 100)=$37089

what is the difference between the ""break even,"" ""Current Price,"" and ""avg cost"" ?"
2021-06-02 17:33:33,wallstreetbets,"> $30.33 is the cost per contract.

Is that the mid price, or the last price, or what?"

If you get you give and the universe will reward you exponentially.

2021-06-02 14:49:48,wallstreetbets,Set aside 40% for short term capital gains.  Always come in under that and get to enjoy the windfall.  Problem with a smaller % is you don't know what your tax bracket's gonna be.  You could do this 5 more times between now and December pushing your income into higher brackets.  Short term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income but they are added to your W2 income.  Better have too much set aside than have to liquidate something in the middle of a good trade just to cover your taxes.
2021-06-02 13:19:59,wallstreetbets,"tbh wouldn't mind that, lottery shit right there, walking away with 50% of 500k isnt bad. sad, but not bad :D"
2021-06-02 13:48:45,wallstreetbets,With options it's essentially impossible to hold to long term capital gains with any sort of reasonable return - I assume if you exercise it's not taxable but that seems like a pretty bad idea for AMC and in any case it would be very capital intensive.

Later-later was happy I had sold digimoney when I did. Later-later-later bought back digimoney at $40k. Even later I regretted having bought back in at 40k.  

There is no winning because you'll never perfectly time the peaks/dips. And even if you do, the very bottom or top of a peak is low liquidity and you would've only had like a 1% fill.  

IMO, if you make a trade and it doesn't _immediately_ move against you, it was probably a bad trade and you're going to be suckered in on the reversal OR you're into HFT shit."

Basically if you wouldn’t put in 40k right now at the current price and risk it all than you should keep it all in now at the current price cause it’s the same thing. I don’t think people think of it like that and I get why, but it’s essentially what hed be doing"

2021-06-02 17:13:13,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to learn about calls rn too.
2021-06-02 13:14:32,wallstreetbets,"He bought at .61, so not that long ago"
2021-06-02 13:20:09,wallstreetbets,"You can see that in the robinhood app (or on your broker in order history).   In robinhood, he'd have to scroll down on this screen and it would show the purchase date."
2021-06-02 15:49:33,wallstreetbets,"He bought 13 contracts because that is how much he was willing to spend at the time.


61 cents is the premium he paid to have the OPTION to buy each share in a contract at the contract's strike price. Each contract has 100 shares so to find the price he paid for each contract, you take the premium and multiply it by 100 (61¢ x 100 = $61). 


Since he bought 13 contracts for $61 each, he paid 13 x $61 = $793. 


A contract's premium is calculated using a contract's Greek values (theta, gamma, delta, Vega). Those values represent different things such as how likely the contract is to go ""in the money"" aka hit his strike price. They are calculated in different ways but basically, as a stock has more movement & volume, it's IV will increase since the stock could change prices at any moment, which drives up the premium price. 


Many times, you can make money by buying a contract and if the stock price spikes causing the IV to spike and the premium to increase, you can sell it for a gain even if it never hit the strike price.


There's a lot more to option contracts that I won't get into. Some of it is necessary to know and other stuff is good to know but not required to make money.


I definitely recommend researching options more since if you know what you're doing, you can make some nice profits with minimal investment/risk."
2021-06-02 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,"all you need to know ,  money is green, you turn it red by playing with stocks"
2021-06-02 14:58:43,wallstreetbets,"Max he’ll lose is $750. If the price tanks and no one wants to buy his contracts by the expiration date, they’ll become worthless and basically the $750 will become nothing."
2021-06-02 15:52:27,wallstreetbets,"You can sell the contract if you can't afford to buy the shares at the contracts strike price. This is what many people do.


But as we saw with DFV and GME, he exercised his calls and bought the shares at the strike price, since he could afford to buy 50k (or maybe it was 100k) shares at his contracts strike price. 


If you believe in a stock/company long term, it's not a bad idea to exercise the contract and buy the shares. But many times, people will just sell the contract and collect the premium.


Who buys these contracts? Many times it's a MM, with lots of money to spend and often times they buy and sell contracts for tiny percent gains, which add up with how much volume they buy and sell at."
2021-06-02 16:29:01,wallstreetbets,"As banshee said, most people sell their contracts before they expire instead of exercising. You can usually get more money out of them that way too. Selling the IV"
2021-06-02 16:26:04,wallstreetbets,"IV and theta are weird beasts that I don't fully understand yet. But if a stock plummets from $30 to $14 in a single day, you can probably find $35 strike price contracts at 10 cents a share. But those will have very short expirations. The further out the expiration and the higher the implied volatility, the higher the price of of contract. Be ready to eat those bags of dicks for survival wheb playing with call options."
2021-06-02 16:15:01,wallstreetbets,Because the price of the shares were around $16 when he bought those contracts. And his sell price isn't $19 that's what he's allowed to buy 1300 shares at. Right now amc is sitting at $65
2021-06-02 16:19:32,wallstreetbets,"Look up tdameritrades paper trading. they give you 100k of fake money to trade with. Find informational videos on YouTube to learn.

Amc is legit being squeezed rn. I made 3k today off 2 contracts that I bought for $120 yesterday. I'm kicking myself for not pulling the trigger on 20 contracts."
2021-06-02 18:52:12,wallstreetbets,"Have to enable options trading and be approved. Then instead of a ""buy"" button you get a ""trade"" button on most tickers."
2021-06-02 18:57:00,wallstreetbets,"No, he paid 61 cents a share or $61 for the right to buy 100 shares at $19. The contract seller assumes it won't go past or even near the strike price. For him it's free money. Just collecting a premium. Until it goes to $70 a share and the seller has to fork over his shares at $19 a piece.

The $61 is a premium that is gone when you buy the contract."
2021-06-02 18:51:26,wallstreetbets,Just throw your money into the fireplace. Same thing.
2021-06-02 12:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Exactly like selling a stock. You sell your contract to a buyer. For educational purposes the best way to learn options is spend 50 dollars on a random option and watch how it moves and how you open and close the position. 

Consider it 50 dollars worth of tuition and don't expect to do anything but lose it for educational purposes. 

It doesn't matter how much you read, you'll need to buy a contract to learn about it at some point."
2021-06-02 12:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Since the option contracts themselves have increased in value, he is able to sell the contracts for the amount that's listed in the screenshot to someone who would be able to exercise that option. IF there is a buyer."
2021-06-02 12:52:16,wallstreetbets,You can just sell the option before it expires.
2021-06-02 12:57:44,wallstreetbets,"No, the expiration date is just the ""do something by end of day"" requirement. He can either flat out buy the stocks at $19/share right now if he wants (exercise the contract). Or, he can sell the contracts to someone else. Or, he can close the contract which means he just gets the difference between the current asking price and contract price. If he does nothing by end of day on 6/18, then the contracts are auto closed and he gets the price difference."
2021-06-02 12:56:28,wallstreetbets,"I think he can sell the contract at any point before that, but you can only exercise the contract up to the expiration date"
2021-06-02 13:33:04,wallstreetbets,"No, that’s not right. He bought 1300 things for 19.61 each."
2021-06-02 15:29:28,wallstreetbets,I broke even w/ my paper hands LMAO
2021-06-02 18:09:14,wallstreetbets,I'm poor and made $1600 lol. I'm going to hodl for some life changing money though. Hopefully it goes up 5x more!
2021-06-02 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Yep, mars is around the corner"
2021-06-02 13:27:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay so he should’ve sold it in the 40s instead of the 60s, got it"
2021-06-02 13:31:15,wallstreetbets,I only made £350 and thinking of selling
2021-06-02 13:32:16,wallstreetbets,I only made £350 and I’m thinking I should get out now since trading was paused
2021-06-02 16:11:22,wallstreetbets,"oh.. I thought the gains = (48.14-19.61) * (13 * 100)=$37089

what is the difference between the ""break even,"" ""Current Price,"" and ""avg cost"" ?"
2021-06-02 18:18:50,wallstreetbets,To expand on this guy... AMC made a few people millionaires today.
2021-06-02 16:13:50,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 16:25:18,wallstreetbets,"Who buys the contract when you are ""in the money"" & want to take that profit?"
2021-06-02 18:05:44,wallstreetbets,Where does 100 shares per contract come from? There’s no “100” anywhere in the screenshot.
2021-06-02 17:10:20,wallstreetbets,"If he doesn't have the capital to exercise his option, he would sell his option before expiration.

In the above screen shot, he paid $0.61 for the option, which is currently trading at $30.33.  So he could sell his options now for $30.33, minus the $0.61 he paid for them, making $29.72 per contract.  Each contract represents 100 shares, so 100 \* $29.72 = $2,972.00 profit \* 13 contracts = $38,636 total profit.

And he would be done.  I don't want to get into the technical aspects of option trading, as that would confuse you, but suffice to say, You can buy an option to ""OPEN"" a position, and then sell an option to ""CLOSE"" your position.  The two cancel out and you no longer have an obligation.  Your Done."
2021-06-02 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,"So it appears he bought $19 calls @ a cost of $0.61, so his breakeven price = $19.61 ($19 + $0.61)

The current stock price was $48.14 per share

The current option price was $30.33 per contract.

So quick math = $30.33 price - $0.61 cost = $29.72 profit per contract

He's holding 13 contracts, and each contract represents 100 shares, so . . .

$29.72 \* 13 \* 100 = $38,636 profit"
2021-06-02 16:20:50,wallstreetbets,Breakeven price is only relevant if you hold until expiration. He bought $19 calls that expire June 18th. He paid 61 cents per share for the right to buy at $19. So if the price is above 19.61 through expiration date he will not lose money. But typically most people sell before expiration.
2021-06-02 19:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Frankly it’s the opposite. Madman theory. The more you know the more conservative you tend to play it. What’s going on right now is not something any Econ professor would ever have thought possible even a couple years ago (in theory maybe, but not real life)."

2021-06-02 17:40:09,wallstreetbets,I remember seeing AMC at $9. Someone at work told me to take a look but I was balls deep in DOGE at the time. Glad for the people who have a position.
2021-06-02 17:42:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Reddit is a community of people who love and help one another. I’ve been on the app for 3-4 months and never seen shit talking or degrading. It’s a safe place.

2021-06-02 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,We just like the stocks.
2021-06-02 15:52:04,wallstreetbets,It’s GME and AMC are the main focus because those were the strongest RH tried to limit and stop buys. AMC is still priced pretty good compared to the 320 price when GME really starting rocketing. I think NOK and BB were also limited to trade back in January too

2021-06-02 18:06:01,wallstreetbets,"It's kinda a silly stock. All the meme stocks are silly.

Doesn't mean it can't go up. AMC is almost certainly going to have positive year on year comps for the next two years. That's a nice ramp to have. Granted it won't last and the company will probably resume a long term decline but hey, that's 2 years from now.

You want to jump in? It won't be a rational choice, it will be based solely on momentum. Is there more momentum? No one knows. Just ask the apes that pimped Palantir."

2021-06-02 16:01:14,wallstreetbets,99% of this sub isn't making enough money to be taxed at 40%
2021-06-02 16:50:04,wallstreetbets,"40% is for short term capital gains at the highest income bracket. Long term capital gains (selling after 1+ years) are taxed at 0% from $0-$40k, 15% from $40k-$441.45k, and 20% at $441.45k+. This is for single filers, and the brackets are more lenient for married tax filers."

I have no idea what this means in English."
2021-06-02 13:30:23,wallstreetbets,You use a IRS Form 1040-ES. You can fill it out yourself or pay a CPA to calculate for you.
2021-06-02 17:21:18,wallstreetbets,I was assuming he would be exercising the options and holding the shares.
2021-06-02 16:04:03,wallstreetbets,You’re also eligible for installment payments with minimal interest (.3%) if you didn’t owe them the previous year.   If you’ve cashed out and stashed your money in your pillow case and not in an investment vehicle / savings account they might even take a settlement sum lower than what you owe (depending on your yearly income).
2021-06-02 13:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Dont worrry, you could always pay one of the many companies that lobbied to make paying taxes hard to do your taxes for you!"
2021-06-02 13:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Short term gains are just taxed as normal income so the IRS sees it like you made 500k that year at your job but didn’t pay any of the taxes you normally would have. They see it like your employer gave your gross 500k salary to you in lump sum but didn’t withhold anything for them. That’s why they take like 40%. Sucks but that’s the way it is for short term cap gains. Long term is much less, like 15%."
2021-06-02 14:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, always be conservative with your take profit estimate"
2021-06-02 14:21:04,wallstreetbets,"What did the government do to earn that 50%? I hate how the government thinks 100% of the money is there's and we get to keep whatever THEY deem fit. 

So you 'get' to keep 50%, and when you buy stuff, they'll charge sales tax, so you save it, and they charge gains tax on the interest, so you give it to your loved ones to inherit, then they tax that too."
2021-06-02 15:22:33,wallstreetbets,Hell yea
2021-06-02 16:13:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 19:38:22,wallstreetbets,I bought 2 shares of amc at $30 and sold right afterwards cause of anxiety and lost $10 last night lol
2021-06-02 13:59:26,wallstreetbets,"I bought Tesla fresh out of high school, 2012? I was told to sell at like, $150 by my uncle in finance. Glad I at least said fuck it and waited longer."
2021-06-02 14:54:05,wallstreetbets,How much have YOU made on AMC?
2021-06-02 13:15:21,wallstreetbets,No he means selling naked calls. Your risk is theoretically infinite at that point.
2021-06-02 16:21:15,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-02 16:28:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm confused, I don't recall it ever being under a dollar, what?"
2021-06-02 17:15:35,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your detailed explanation! Are there any specific sites or persons you follow that would be beneficial in explaining this more?
2021-06-02 15:41:11,wallstreetbets,Wow so that’s a pretty low risk compared to the potential reward then. I mean even if you did the same but only put in 100 you could still bring in a large profit. I need to read up on this more!
2021-06-02 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,"I see.  So what is the price of a contract today, when the stock is at $65?"
2021-06-02 19:43:14,wallstreetbets,Thanks for answering me my question. If you don’t mind I have a  follow up Newb question lol. Are options better than stocks? Is options more risky?
2021-06-02 12:51:07,wallstreetbets,Thanks! When you say $50 I know you really mean YOLO everything but I appreciate the explanation.
2021-06-02 13:22:32,wallstreetbets,">IF there is a buyer.

I believe, generally the market makers are buyers.   

But there's things to look at like liquidity in some of the more obscure stocks with low volume it might really be hard to unload once you purchase.

With AMC as hot as it is right now, there'd be no problem offloading these contracts."
2021-06-02 13:40:39,wallstreetbets,generally how easy is it to sell the contracts?
2021-06-02 13:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you did, You got T-Mobile."
2021-06-02 13:26:34,wallstreetbets,If he sells the contract does the same expiration date apply to the new buyer as well?
2021-06-02 16:45:29,wallstreetbets,You can sell the contract at any point up to the expiration and you can exercise the option at any point up to the expiration. This is assuming American style options
2021-06-02 15:07:10,wallstreetbets,"He spent .61 x 1300. He has no obligation to pay the extra $19 right now, he can sell them as is."
2021-06-02 16:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Neither of you ( u\detrydis and u\SPACmeDaddy ) are correct.  
  
13 contracts purchased for $61 each (averaged). At the time of the picture, each contract was worth $3033 each (mid price, halfway between bid and ask prices for the contract).  
  
Since nothing was exercised (assumption), no shares changed hands for OP. Only contracts. He only bought and sold the ***opportunity*** to purchase 1300 shares."
2021-06-02 14:08:03,wallstreetbets,No he didnt- that would make his initial investment 25k.
2021-06-02 13:29:58,wallstreetbets,Not everyone has the crystal ball you have.   He said his dad would be proud.   It was a ridiculous gain.   So yes sell when your up.  Don’t hold for imaginary gains.   Hindsight is 20/20.
2021-06-02 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,"Break even is the price point at which the underlying shares would need to close at before the contract is profitable. So since these had a 19$ strike price, with a cost of .61$ per share, it has to close higher than 19.61 on the day of expiration for the contract to be generally profitable at expiry.

Current price is exactly what it says, the current price of the contract per share. Since he has 13 contracts of 100 shares, you multiply 1300 times that current price to get the total value of the contracts ($39,429)

Avg cost is the average spent on the contracts per share. He may have bought them at different times, so it could have been some at $.30 and some at $.90 but the average he paid per share is $.61 or $61 per contract for 13 contracts."
2021-06-02 16:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Break even - the price at which, if the stock hit, you’d break even by executing the contract.

Current price - current trading price for the equity (stock or contract for that stock)

Avg cost - average cost that you paid for all the contracts. In a way, this shows how much you paid for the contracts before they changed in value."
2021-06-02 16:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Well if you look his average cost is $0.61.

So 100 (shares per contract) x 0.61 (price per share per contract) x 13 (contracts) = $793"
2021-06-02 16:52:38,wallstreetbets,"People who think the price is going to continue to rise before the contract expires. Sure he bought the contract for $0.60 and it’s worth $30 today, but next week it could be worth $40 or $50"
2021-06-02 19:15:09,wallstreetbets,Contacts are sold in blocks of 100 shares
2021-06-02 17:28:23,wallstreetbets,"With my simplistic newb brain, I looked at this as the contract being the tradeable item since I never intended to exercise any of the options I ever traded.  I think what you just added here confirms that, thank you."
2021-06-02 19:33:25,wallstreetbets,Just to clarify this person bought a 6/18 Call with a strike price of $19?
2021-06-02 17:25:58,wallstreetbets,Ooo ok. The question I have and the one I think this other commenter was trying to get at is — would there ever be a scenario with options trading where you would owe or have spent more than your initial investment - in OP’s case owing or losing more than $750?
2021-06-02 17:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Math is a little off there.  100* 29.72 is $2,972.  But he has 13 contracts which gets you to the xx,xxx range"
2021-06-02 18:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Why is this so upvoted? 100 \* $29.72 = $29,720?

It's not that he could sell for $29.72 per contract. $29.72 is the price *per share,* less the price per share that he paid initially. He can sell the contracts for a net profit of 100\*$29.72 = $2972 each, and he has 13 contracts, so 13\*$2972 = $38636 total profit."
2021-06-02 19:20:42,wallstreetbets,OMG... this sounds like... a way to make obscene monies... if things happen to go your way.
2021-06-02 19:37:14,wallstreetbets,"So you can ""buy"" options with no intention of actually holding them until expiration as long as you ""sell"" before the exp date?

I'm still trying to understand them."
2021-06-02 17:49:38,wallstreetbets,I think I finally get it.
2021-06-02 19:17:02,wallstreetbets,So paying for a contract is better than buying one stock since you get 100 of them in a contract??
2021-06-02 19:28:43,wallstreetbets,"$29.72 \* 100 = $2,972   ??? I'm a teacher, and truly amazed we never learned ANY of this kind of math in context in my entire education, including college (minus that one quarter class I had a biology teacher who was also a real estate investor and taught us a tiny smidge of this)."
2021-06-02 19:57:57,wallstreetbets,I so want to learn options trading. I have it on my account. Need to find some videos that really explain the process.

2021-06-02 18:19:07,wallstreetbets,"I trade on margin but I rarely have more than 25% tied up. My investment portfolio was around 100k in Jan 2020, it's about 300k now. It's dishonest to say that I took my portfolio from 100k to 300k since a lot of the ""gains"" are from stock awards and real estate profits. 

I've been making at least 1k per month. In Feb 2021, I made about 9k, it would had been my first +10k month. The goal is try to reach a 10k month by the end of the year.

My trading strategy is mostly thetagang inspired though, I almost never ""buy to open"" options. I almost always sell to open first and then buy to close. Sure I can make 1k+ per month now. But I also went through a very shitty 6 months were I thought I was just losing nonstop to very trades. I would had never opened the trade that OP did. It's just not my style.

2021-06-02 19:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Options are much riskier, especially for new Investors. Easier to make big gains. Easier to lose your money. 

When it comes to stocks, if they go down, you can just hold them till they go back up. 9 times out of 10 you won't take a loss if you just hold. but that ties up your money for who knows how long. Take me for example. I bought 200 shares of mvis when it shot up. Fomo got me. I bought at 22.14 and then it went back down To $13 the next day Now I'm still holding and it's teasing it's way back up to $20 now.

Just don't start selling contracts, calls or puts, until you've gained experience. You can lose infinite money selling selling contracts. Otherwise, lose and learn."

2021-06-02 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,"That is correct.  The OPTIONS CONTRACT is the SECURITY you are trading.  It is a separate and distinct vehicle, apart from the underlying security."
2021-06-02 19:39:07,wallstreetbets,That is correct.
2021-06-02 17:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Not on this particular trade, no.  He is holding a call option, which gives him the right to BUY.

If he wanted to exercise, then yes, he would need 13 contracts X 100 shares per contract X $19 exercise price = $24,700.  Meaning, he would be buying 1,300 shares @ $19. 

But he wouldn't ""LOSE"" that money, he would then own the shares.

If he had ""PUT"" options, then he would have the option to ""SELL"" shares.  Much different story.  If he held the underlying security, then he's fine, he would just have to sell his shares.  But if he DIDN'T own the shares, then, YES, he would have to go buy those in the open market to ""SELL"" them.

He would/could lose the difference between what he paid for the shares versus the price he sold them at.  That could get very expensive.

But like I stated earlier, he would just ""sell"" the option.  Close out his position.  Be done.  

Bottom line: sell your option position before expiration, and you're done. No incremental loss.  You only lose what you paid for it minus what you sell it for, or if it expires worthless, then what you paid for it."
2021-06-02 17:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Not going long on options aka buying calls or puts, but shorting options, the other side of the trade or selling puts and calls to open you can lose more than the initial investment if done naked without cover/collateral."

2021-06-02 19:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Oh Ya.  For sure.  You're playing with a factor of 100.  One Contract = 100 shares.

So, Ya.  Big payday, if you play it right. 

Dude in this example invested $793 for 13 contracts that are now worth $39,429.

So, throw a zero on the end that:  $7,930 investment worth $394,290.

Or two zeros: $79,300 investment worth $3,942,900."
2021-06-02 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Correct.  It's YOUR option.  You can do with it what you please. You can hold it and exercise it; or you can sell it.  Or worse, allow it to expire worthless.

I would assume that the vast majority of retail options traders sell their options prior to expiration to close out their positions.  I seriously doubt there are a lot of retail traders who hold and exercised.  I'd be shocked if it were more than 5%. But that's just a guess."
2021-06-02 19:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes and No.  You are buying an option that expires.  You are correct, one contract represents 100 shares of the underlying security, so you can magnify or leverage your buying power. Example: if you only have $100 and the stock you like trades at $100 per share, then you can only buy ONE share; whereas if you buy a call option contract for $100, it represents 100 shares.  So you greatly increase your return by a factor of 100.

HOWEVER, the big caveat is that the option contract has an expiration date.  It Expires.  If you do not exercise your contract or sell it, or if it expires ""out of the money"", it goes away.  Gone. Poof. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

So be careful."
2021-06-02 19:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Ya, a critic in every bunch.  Sorry, was typing too fast for my brain to keep up."
2021-06-02 16:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Correct.  The actual share price drives the price of the contract.  Typically, the ""in the money"" price + implied volatility (IV) + time left until expiration (theta).  Doesn't always go up in lock step, as IV and Theta decay.

In this case = $48.14 share price - $19 strike price = $29.14 ITM price

Then add to that IV + Theta, or inversely, $30.33 - $29.14 = $1.19 IV + Theta"

It isn’t exactly FOMO, I’ve known options have been around for a long time but just never took the time to learn them thoroughly. But these are not as risky as what I was assuming so it suddenly has become a valid strategy for me personally.

2021-06-02 18:25:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the contract for the right to buy/sell the stock at a certain price has a value as well. That’s how these guys are making the money. They’re buying super unreasonable contracts for dirt cheap, and then when the impossible happens, they shoot up in value.

Let’s pretend:

A few months ago I wrote a contract saying “whoever buys this contract, I’ll give you the right to buy this basket of 100 ping pong balls here for $5 per ball from me at any time between now and Jan 1st.”

Ping pong balls were only $1 back then. I put that contract on the market and asked $10 for the contract itself. I thought “there’s no way they’ll go up to above $5, so the contract will probably expire worthless. I’ll probably get an easy $10 out of this”

Then you came along and saw my contract for sale. You thought “ahh, what the hell. I know Ping pong balls are only $1 each, but in case they’re worth over $5 by Jan 1st, I’ll throw $10 at this contract as a cheap gamble.”

Then, for whatever damn reason, ping pong balls go up to $20 each! I’m fucking sweating. I have these 100 ping pong balls in my basket, and instead of selling all 100 balls for $20 each and cashing out $2,000, I have a CONTRACT saying I need to sell them to you for $5 each, only cashing out $500.

You’re ecstatic though. You literally only spent $10 on this contract and can do one of three things now:


1.) Wait for the balls to increase even MORE and cash out even more (but they might decrease too, so it’s still risky)

2.) exercise the contract right now. You come to me, hand me $500 (contract was for 100 balls at $5 each) and say “hand the balls over”. You then put them on the market right away and sell them for $2000, making $1500 profit.

3.) even though the contract is with me, you bought it. You can sell it to anyone. And it just turns out that this contract that you initially only spent $10 on is now worth, let’s say, $1650. You always get more selling a contract that doesn’t expire soon than executing it. 

This is what we’re seeing in the post.

Your average cost would be $10 per contract (you only bought one so this is easy)

The current price would be $1650 per contract (not the balls’ price)

And the breakeven would be $5.10. This is calculated by saying “I **paid** $10 to buy 100 balls at 5 each. If the balls were worth $5.10, I’d make $0.10 per ball, times 100, and get $10 **back**, breaking even."

Think of it this way, options are just that, ""OPTIONS"".  The HOLDER has the OPTION to exercise or NOT exercise.  His/Her choice.  

The Option to BUY a stock is a ""CALL"" option.  The Option to SELL a stock is a ""PUT"" option.

Whoever wrote the option (the seller) he/she is ""selling"" the option to exercise to another person.  So the writer of the option IS on the hook to either sell their stock (for a call option) or buy the stock (for a put option).  That can get very expensive, and should only be done by very experienced market makers, or traders with vast experience."

To make the conversation weird, my dream car is a 2017 Viper ACR. Would you know anything about that /u/snakebite2017 ? :) I'll be happy with any Viper though."
2021-06-02 18:48:42,wallstreetbets,"I think our approaches are different.

I don't gamble :)

I don't buy to open options. There is no way handle a bad trade with a call that went against you.

I also keep my positions on X different from my positions on Y. If position X is doing bad, there is usually you can do on X to improve it. Don't involve Y.

Before I open a trade, I know what my target is. Once I get it I close it. I don't moon or bust."

2021-06-02 15:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Such a disingenuous comment. Your parent's privilege afforded you that opportunity. The government still used the money to give us (assuming American here)  **checks Google** 99% literacy rate across the country. Paved roads across the land. If you can't recognize the good that taxes bring to us as a whole, you gotta go back and inform yourself some more. The fact that public schools are continuous works of progress that take investments and resources to maintain doesn't mean we shouldn't pay into them. And again just because there are homeschool and private schools that do better, doesn't invalidate the work of teachers and staff who make things happen every day for a public school education"
2021-06-02 15:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Those public school kids u can read better barely get tax money lol. Or theyd be reading a lot better.

U kinda fight ur argument trying to defend it. 

Be mad at companies that dont pay shit but make 20B a year lol. A .1% Tax on that does more than taxing a single ape 50% of their amc gainz"
2021-06-02 16:15:10,wallstreetbets,Robinhood won’t let you sell naked calls.
2021-06-02 17:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, you've got the right attitude. Speculating with whatever you can afford to lose.

It's not to say I don't buy calls and puts, I do it all the time. I find all the short term trading is a headache and I end up treading water for the year. Meanwhile, my retirement portfolio is taking off."
2021-06-02 16:39:27,wallstreetbets,Of you timing a call perfectly before a huge spike just like this guy has? Not really.
2021-06-02 15:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Good comment about IV, that definitely explains why even the AMC 120 calls are crazy expensive"

2021-06-02 17:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, unless you like the stock."
2021-06-02 18:00:08,wallstreetbets,"The question was about exercising the stock. You are correct on the second half that they could sell the contract, but many people do exercise contracts and that’s what was asked  — to which the answer is yes they had it correct."
2021-06-02 18:00:45,wallstreetbets,I always exercise my gme contracts for the lulz (and I like holding the stock)
2021-06-02 18:19:49,wallstreetbets,The only reason to exercise the contracts is because the option will not fill at a fair value. The other reason is to hold shares in after hours in case you want to sell them. Options cannot be sold in AH. So if they announced after the close that they were doing a secondary of  500M shares you may want to sell them in after hours.
2021-06-02 17:56:45,wallstreetbets,The dibs are worth more money than the shares right now anyway
2021-06-02 18:33:22,wallstreetbets,Doesn't the contract generally sell at less then actual value vs if he executed?
2021-06-02 17:47:02,wallstreetbets,So he/she can sell the contracts for 42k?
2021-06-02 17:38:14,wallstreetbets,Can you close before the expiration date and cash out the gains?
2021-06-02 18:42:48,wallstreetbets,You don’t necessarily need a margin account to trade options. But you will have to own 100 shares to sell a call and you will need to have the cash sitting in the account for the executed contract price to sell a put. You could always buy options with nothing more than the money that it costs to buy the option.
2021-06-02 18:05:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, for my broker (Merrill Lynch).  I'm pretty sure that's the standard for ALL brokers. You must have margin to trade options."
2021-06-02 19:48:25,wallstreetbets,"There are Daily options that expire daily.

There are weekly options that expire weekly.

There are Monthly options that expire monthly.

And so on and so forth.  LEAPS actually go out 1+ years. 

On the highly active ticker symbols, you can find a multitude, a plethora, of options that expire just about whenever you want.  You can find them expiring every business (trading) day out of the year.

I don't know when he bought these, but he bought options expiring June 18th."
2021-06-02 17:10:56,wallstreetbets,The best kind of apes!
2021-06-02 18:50:34,wallstreetbets,"In this case, how much did he pay for the option?"
2021-06-02 17:48:04,wallstreetbets,"Your broker.  I believe, though I could be wrong, ALL online stock brokers offer options trading.  You have to apply to trade options, they don't just offer that to anyone. Some are more stringent than others.  Just ask your broker."
2021-06-02 19:04:58,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino. You're gambling, it's just got less glitz and a more sophisticated veneer than a typical casino. Especially if you're trading on margin. You might be playing it safer than most ""investors."""

2021-06-02 15:52:02,wallstreetbets,Oh so taxes have done some good so let's all pay a 90% tax rate? Listing a few good things that come from taxes doesn't make all taxes good. Very little of the taxes you pay go toward the few things you listed.
2021-06-02 16:45:50,wallstreetbets,"I had to do chores for the lady that homeschooled me. My dad could barely afford the educational materials. 

Private schools and homeschooling are superior to public education. 

I actually think the government should get about 3% in taxes tops. Those taxes should be put towards military. 

We can do everything else without there interference."
2021-06-02 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,"the government is piss-poor at managing money, just look at the national debt. they've been living on their credit card for generations. And we are the ones paying the price for their blatant ineptitude, they just say 'oh well lets just raise taxes to pay for our stupidity', then repeat. It's not their money; once out of office, they go on their merry way while the public suffers."
2021-06-02 17:29:51,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. Maybe I meant more in a sense of us being able to get a decent or even huge gain because of this Reddit’s “brute force.”
2021-06-02 15:19:38,wallstreetbets,"He paid .61 per share for the contract, just like (when I posted earlier) someone was offering to pay 41.95/share for the contract.  So that was a direct .61 -> 41.95 gain if he sold then.  Nobody needs to buy or sell any shares for that gain to exist."
2021-06-02 17:57:01,wallstreetbets,"$39,429 is the market value of those contracts at the time of the picture being taken, that’s how much they would get for selling. Minus capital, that’s the value on the total return line ($38,639)"
2021-06-02 17:45:46,wallstreetbets,"You can sell the contract to someone else until it expires, the contract is always changing value, based on a much more complex pricing structure than a simple share (black-scholes model). It takes into account all of the Greeks, for example theta (decaying value closer to expiration). You can buy and sell a contract at any time before it has expired if there is someone willing to buy it.

I for example didn’t want my $50 strike price 6/4 contract of amc to decay more in value and sold it yesterday afternoon for $120. I couldn’t have known it would hit $2500 in value today. Whoever bought the contract from me gained, I lost out, and it’s traded up till expiration"
2021-06-02 18:31:32,wallstreetbets,Do you need good credit or lots of capital to open a margin account? Is it like applying for a loan?
2021-06-02 18:59:22,wallstreetbets,"His average cost was $0.61 per contract.  Each contract represents 100 shares, so $0.61 \* 100 = $61 per contract X 13 contracts = $793 in total."

2021-06-02 16:23:26,wallstreetbets,There's never been an effective rate of 90% ever. Go cry elsewhere.
2021-06-02 16:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, I have no idea what the tax rate for stock market gains are, but I'm pretty damn sure it ain't 90%. Someone else in this thread quoted a few different rates based on state and whatnot, and also said the national rate is somewhere around 20-30%, but still depends on your income. Sounds really far from 90% to me, especially for something the government is probably trying to prevent the average idiot from throwing their near non-existent money at (reference to the comment saying that short term gains/investments were taxed higher than long-term ones). Your comment also sounds really disingenuous to the topic at hand, just as the one I replied to above. I'm not here to argue about effective governance or ideal tax rates. I never said all taxes were good. I never said I agreed with everything my taxes paid for. Yet you somehow extracted those words from my comment and attributed them to me. Also there isn't enough time in my day and comment limit on Reddit to list everything that taxes go towards, and I don't even have that kind of grasp on the tax code to even begin that discussion."

To date, the DNA and mRNA vaccines all effectively do the same thing - they turn your own cells into spike protein factories.  You own immune system will attack the hacked cells.  The vaccines work in the short-term, but nobody knows what (if any) issues there will be with this technology 1 or 2 years from now (fear over autoimmune diseases seems most prevalent).  Because of this general fear of the unknown, we have a lot of vaccine hesitancy around this new tech.

Enter NVAX, the vaccine works by essentially injecting little balls of spike protein into you.  Your cells are not hijacked.  This technology has been around for about 20 years and has been used on other vaccines.  Thus, long term side effects are known and a real alternative to the mRNA and DNA vaccines exist. 

I fucking like this stock.  And I also like this vaccine (I have personally been holding out for it).  The company has said publicly that results are coming in June.  Jump on board the money train."

2021-06-02 12:24:13,wallstreetbets,"I did take profit, came close to doubling my money at one point.  I am not mad at all, happy the other apes are eating plentiful.  I have a VIP rocket pass and diamond hands for BB, I'll die before I let go 🚀🚀🚀🚀😎"

2021-06-02 11:49:55,wallstreetbets,This didn’t age well
2021-06-02 11:45:52,wallstreetbets,That premium is insane....
2021-06-02 11:46:48,wallstreetbets,"The volatility is wayyy to high to be doing this.

The huge drop that’s coming will make you money, but it’s not easy to time it. I’m getting 1DTE puts tmrow and hope for a Friday sell off"

2021-06-02 15:14:48,wallstreetbets,Even if it drops you won’t make money. IV is too high you overpaid for your puts. Shoulda bought put spreads to play the downside. Oh well your sacrifice is appreciated
2021-06-02 12:14:34,wallstreetbets,The sell off is coming very soon and you might print money on these.
2021-06-02 13:41:21,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I bought only puts yesterday! Somehow my 20p 6/11 only went down from 94 to 88 today even tho 100% stock increase.. Weird

2021-06-02 12:46:23,wallstreetbets,Should just buy ACB calls that will be the next AMC cause letters

2021-06-02 13:16:26,wallstreetbets,It's aging even worse now
2021-06-02 12:49:29,wallstreetbets,Thats why I'm selling condors/spreads left and right.
2021-06-02 17:45:59,wallstreetbets,Rip in advance
2021-06-02 12:54:30,wallstreetbets,I got in at $48 and made $35k already lol
2021-06-02 12:09:13,wallstreetbets,And then to 1000 😂
2021-06-02 13:53:39,wallstreetbets,Mine are also up
2021-06-02 15:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Not that weird

It's called iv"
2021-06-02 18:13:12,wallstreetbets,Volatility is way up that's why.
2021-06-02 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,I’m also somehow not completely destroyed
2021-06-02 13:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Yepp, I’m just reading this 😅"
2021-06-02 12:55:58,wallstreetbets,Nice. If you can get out on time then great. You can lose that 35k or below so quick
2021-06-02 12:11:24,wallstreetbets,Lmao Fr. Stocks are so unpredictable. But it’s best to not buy in cause of fomo. Did that one too many times lol
2021-06-02 12:58:03,wallstreetbets,"I sold then put in orders during the halt. I’m up another few $5,000 profit with $15k invested."
2021-06-02 12:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol I hear ya. It’s hard not to be jacked to the tits rn, I’ve held since January. Feel bad for shorts and puts."
2021-06-02 12:58:36,wallstreetbets,Damn teach me your ways lol
2021-06-02 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,Same. Well I’ve only holder gme. I sold my amc to put in gme. Regretting it but that’s just hindsight is 20-20 lol.
2021-06-02 13:01:24,wallstreetbets,You don’t want to know my ways. I made $650k off gme and lost $500k since then. Yolo doesn’t always work but AMC yolo is worth the risk
2021-06-02 13:00:02,wallstreetbets,Sell when you’re happy with profit and buy when there is a massive over reaction. If I had held all my contracts from this morning and never sold I would be up about $70k. Sucks but it’s good to take profit.
2021-06-02 13:03:19,wallstreetbets,"I did that with doge when it was 5 cents 😂. Luckily AMC eased my fomo... GME isn’t done yet either, you guys are just priming up 💪."
2021-06-02 13:02:43,wallstreetbets,Lmaoo true. Yea stocks can make you bank if you do it right. L
2021-06-02 13:01:50,wallstreetbets,Yea. I just don’t have the money to make a quick profit from buying 100+ shares. I should get into options but that’s too risky too lol
2021-06-02 16:41:32,wallstreetbets,Yea gme just has a late start lol
2021-06-02 13:04:09,wallstreetbets,I started with $10k in Jan and went up to $700k at one point. Lol back down to $150k in the account but I pulled out some cash
2021-06-02 13:02:51,wallstreetbets,No risk no reward. The amount of money that hedgefunds lost today should ease your mind about the risk
2021-06-02 13:05:42,wallstreetbets,True. Yea I hear in order to make profit you need to at least invest 10k. I did under 10k LOL. I just might invest half my savings
2021-06-02 13:14:37,wallstreetbets,My last call was $1400 and it’s at $15k lol had you listened and bought options when I said buy you would be up like 40-50% already
2021-06-02 13:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, especially with options you have to take contract size of 100 shares, sometimes the opportunity comes but the share price is too high to make a position without breaking the account."
2021-06-02 13:15:49,wallstreetbets,Yea hella fomo. Should I buy in now? Feel like it took late lol
2021-06-02 13:20:04,wallstreetbets,It pulled back a bit. I would buy.
2021-06-02 13:21:08,wallstreetbets,"It felt too late at $20, it will always feel too late. No risk no reward. Manage your risk and help the cause. Fuck the hedgefunds."
2021-06-02 13:20:56,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m thinking about it. How much tho lol
2021-06-02 13:22:02,wallstreetbets,"It’s your call, I’m in about 20% but it’s your call what you’re comfortable gambling with"
2021-06-02 13:23:07,wallstreetbets,True. Yea I don’t like to gable too much cause I could lose it real quick too. Might just start with 1k lol
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Some people may say I lost all my money, others know my diamond hands will make me 10 if not hundreds of dollars!! "
2021-06-02 11:46:37,wallstreetbets,Welcome to options.... Diamonds is going to hurt you
2021-06-02 12:12:15,wallstreetbets,This would be reasonable if you set a strike date years from now😂
2021-06-02 12:04:33,wallstreetbets,i think your chance is very slim.
2021-06-02 12:32:49,wallstreetbets,"congrats on your lambo!

2021-06-02 11:45:50,wallstreetbets,With all these calls outside the money you would think people would need to buy shares to lift the price.. everybody's relying on others to buy shares meanwhile half are just calls!
2021-06-02 11:43:04,wallstreetbets,I got 50c @20 6/18 but those $43s got me drooling
2021-06-02 14:55:11,wallstreetbets,BB is the next squeeze. AMC is hitting already BB is the next move. Going in this Friday with my next paycheck. GODSPEED.
2021-06-02 13:23:09,wallstreetbets,"Boy, if that $43 call hits, you'll be able to afford a Sim Card."
2021-06-02 11:55:20,wallstreetbets,Does that call say 43$ or do I still have my uncle’s cum on my eyes?
2021-06-02 12:58:15,wallstreetbets,Let's fucking goooooo! $BB > AMC

2021-06-02 11:44:39,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck.
2021-06-02 12:52:27,wallstreetbets,Im getting fucked for those 40 calls expiring 6/18 but fuck bb to moon
2021-06-02 13:56:43,wallstreetbets,"MIGHTY APES - please help me understand

Alright, so I have been trying to wrap my head around options so do I have all this right? For the $43 call, OP just bought the rights to 70,000 shares at a cost of $43 each for a premium of $23,800? IE, the max amount lost is $23,800 (that money is gone instantly) BUT - and a big but, if the stock goes to say $44, he could theoretically buy and sell 70,000 shares at $1/share profit so a $43k profit? ($70k minus the $23.8k premium?). If if this was a buy to sell, and it went to the end of the option and expired as a higher share price than $43, OP pockets the difference over $43 \* 70,000 shares?

I am basically trying to understand how an option works as some of them look like they're destined to tank. For example, the $17 call, if that stock was $18, it's a $1/share profit at 10k shares which doesn't even cover the $13,800 premium. So it needs to be several $'s above $17 for that gamble to pay off? 

Am I understanding any of this?"
2021-06-02 14:55:16,wallstreetbets,I somehow have this feeling that BB will hit $50 this time 🤞💎🙌🚀
2021-06-02 12:32:53,wallstreetbets,BB to the mooooooooon i’m in at 14 LOL hopefully not the top
2021-06-02 13:11:12,wallstreetbets,I just got some bb options tooo 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-02 13:18:26,wallstreetbets,"The good news is either you or I will make some good money on 06/18. We can't possibly both lose.

Too lazy to post a screenshot but I sold $4000 of naked 10.50 06/18 calls."
2021-06-02 13:51:21,wallstreetbets,"I would honestly GTFO of that $43 call...you have 700 of them, the pain you're going to feel trying to sell 700 OOTM calls is going to ruin you, I have 2k shares and this is retarded"
2021-06-02 13:30:03,wallstreetbets,I made $7k off a $1400 option on amc
2021-06-02 15:01:32,wallstreetbets,$43 dollar call. This mans balls are so big he needs a wheelbarrow to haul around his balls
2021-06-02 14:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Goddamn that $43 tho, godspeed you beautiful tard, got my own $43 but for 2023"

2021-06-02 14:17:58,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-02 14:01:00,wallstreetbets,"So what your missing is implied volatility. Yes to have a 43$ call 2 weeks away is fucking stupid. But I did it because in 1 day the option went up 700% because of implied volatility. Which basically is an idea that since the option is 2 weeks away and it’s gaining momentum it has a chance to get there theoretically making it worth more than what it is. So I made 60k profit off this (sold all the options but a few) and now I’m cheesing. The key is you don’t have to wait the whole time of the option

Correct me if I’m wrong anyone"
2021-06-02 18:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Many people buy the contracts and sell them long before expiration. The price can go way up with volatility, but there is also a time factor. If you buy ITM calls and it goes up a few dollars you can sell the contract for a higher premium than you paid. If you risk the deep OTM contracts and the price goes up you can make a lot of money even if the price never reaches the strike price."
2021-06-02 12:50:32,wallstreetbets,This retard is up 50 k ina day
2021-06-02 13:52:26,wallstreetbets,Already have bro. I sold all them except 200 and I put 100% of the profits into bb stock to help bump it up!

2021-06-02 13:55:42,wallstreetbets,My strat was to buy the most and cheapest option there was available. And ride the hype and then take the profits from the hype and put it toward actual bb stocks

2021-06-02 11:52:52,wallstreetbets,I just look up youtube vids about options trading. I haven’t dared do it yet because it appears to be super risky. But very lucrative if done correctly. Tread carefully
2021-06-02 12:12:42,wallstreetbets,You buy one then watch all your money disappear
2021-06-02 12:50:00,wallstreetbets,Basically if it doesnt hit higher than 43 he is sleeping at wifes boyfriend basement.
2021-06-02 11:51:08,wallstreetbets,Basically paying a premium to buy 100 shares at a certain price and day. If you think the stocks going up but you wanna buy it for a lower price you can purchase a contract guaranteeing the price on a specific day

2021-06-02 17:27:23,wallstreetbets,I'm longing for some vagine
2021-06-02 13:33:14,wallstreetbets,Yes. Going long on a call gives you the right to purchase at the strike price. These calls are in the money at share price of 43.01 or above.
2021-06-02 13:37:12,wallstreetbets,Basically yes lol. Depending he might start to get in the money before the stock hits 43 if someone else is willing to buy it thinking that it will go to 43
2021-06-02 19:05:07,wallstreetbets,Only if another retard buys them
2021-06-02 17:49:52,wallstreetbets,Praise Jesus! See what I did there.

2021-06-02 14:18:22,wallstreetbets,"Im more looking at the short term options as they seem to carry a very expensive premium and the stock needs to go up VERY fast to cover. I think I'm missing a basic principal somewhere as I'm looking at it like you paid $13,800 and that's just money that's gone and you have to wait out the option and hope it increases past $18 enough to cover that? (at any point during the option, IE an hour in, if it went to $20 you could exercise it but I didn't know you could sell the option I guess?). I'm a total noob who is just buying stock outright and I am clearly not messing with options."
2021-06-02 12:52:06,wallstreetbets,"You haven’t sold so you don’t have any of that money (plus this post doesn’t show a 50k gain), and in the event RH goes under you’re A) on margin and your account can be liquidated by them even if you don’t owe money and B) you don’t even have a customer service line you can call"
2021-06-02 13:58:42,wallstreetbets,"well done, glad you didnt get greedy and fucked with a worthless call and lose 24K.  Welcome to the club"

2021-06-02 14:59:35,wallstreetbets,"I'd actually rather BB and AMC weren't correlated at all, BB's fundamentals make more sense to me in justifying higher share prices than what we're currently seeing. I feel like I can't say the same for AMC"

2021-06-02 19:16:27,wallstreetbets,Don't sleep on the bobs... Or do if they're big enough.
2021-06-02 13:44:45,wallstreetbets,So he’s buying the rights to purchase the stock at 43$ by that date. Which means he expect it to be much higher than that ? But wait what’s the 0.34 then?
2021-06-02 18:11:16,wallstreetbets,😑
2021-06-02 18:59:12,wallstreetbets,"That’s actually a smart play, you get the best of both worlds lol."
2021-06-02 15:15:33,wallstreetbets,"What you’re missing is the money is not instantly gone. Sorry if you understand this all but here it is in simplest terms: So you buy a call for June 18th at a strike if $44 for 30 dollars in premium. that means that you paid 30 dollars for the right to buy 100 of that stock on June 18th at that price. If it’s over that price you pay the 100* 44, if it’s under you’re out of the 30 since the deal was I’ll buy It if it hits this price. Now the money is not instantly gone. You can sell that contract, that right for someone else to buy 100 of the stock at 44 at ANY TIME up to that date. As the stock goes up in value, and gets closer to 44 the chances of the contract being “in the money” and exsible increases and therefore so does the value of the contract. So he bought 700 contacts when bb was say at 10 dollars, the price of the stock increased to 15 and he sold the contracts a higher price because the value of that call contract was worth more now."
2021-06-02 13:28:49,wallstreetbets,That's why it's better to invest with a bank. IMO the added security is worth the $10 commission per trade.
2021-06-02 12:54:27,wallstreetbets,"1. I have a margin account yes. Everything used for options is personal money. 
2. Fuck a service line, Im the service line.
3. I’ve sold 200 options already so all my money in it is safe plus like 8 k. The rest yes is not mine yet, but I’m holding it just like everyone brother"
2021-06-02 14:01:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother
2021-06-02 19:15:17,wallstreetbets,Annnnnd I'm dead💀💀💀💀
2021-06-02 15:01:38,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but that just shows that BB with the fundamentals should blow that $24bn out of the water and actually be able to be considered at value."
2021-06-02 16:23:00,wallstreetbets,What rubbish are you uttering? Who cares about fundamentals? It's about apes getting together and shoving our options up Griffin's ass. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
2021-06-02 19:43:30,wallstreetbets,"I went to an AMC Dine In this weekend - those fundamentals may explode in the next few quarters. I enjoyed it so much and so did my kids, that we literally turned around and said, ""Should we get dessert now and see something else?""

But there was nothing else playing that we wanted to see! Even so, we've already decided to go see Raya and the Last Dragon this weekend... just to go again. Really waiting for Black Widow, Shang Chi, Ghostbusters, etc. 

We just wanna be out and have experiences again. I gather most people are feeling the same and I REALLY missed the movies, especially dine-in theaters. 

I bought one share of AMC today to honor apes. Now I'm looking at Blackberry to honor the last phone that I truly loved... besides the MyTouch Slide. 

Always hated my iPhones cause Apple can't make a battery worth a shit. 

No clue, btw, if Blackberry plans on making phones again... it's about honor. 

And feeding the apes. My favorite movie as a kid was the 1933 King Kong."
2021-06-02 15:13:50,wallstreetbets,Especially considering AMC had a stock split at 4-1 didn't they?
2021-06-02 18:35:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah thats why i invested a decent bit in bb and havent gone into gme or amc because i can be perfectly fine bagholding bb. Respect to all the gme and amc apes out there for throttling hedge funds and making tendies (that shits hilarious for me and probably everyone of us) but bb is the only one out of the 3 with real future value
2021-06-02 17:55:33,wallstreetbets,Depends on what ethnicity you are i guess
2021-06-02 13:54:17,wallstreetbets,"He paid $34 for his coupon for a chance to buy 100 shares, per coupon, IF if its $43 by that date.

2021-06-02 13:47:44,wallstreetbets,$0.34 corresponds to the premium he has to pay (to the seller) per stock to exercise this option.

2021-06-02 14:54:13,wallstreetbets,"What i don’t understand is, who is giving him to option to buy it. Is it someone “shorting” the stock? Or just someone “floating” the stock, it that’s the correct term? 

I’m thinking shorting and longing are opposite actions that both exist due to someone doing something with their existing stock. Is that somewhat correct?"
2021-06-02 12:57:53,wallstreetbets,All good points homie! I’ll take that in to consideration. Fr. I enjoy using margin tho. So if you suggest another free brokerage that allows margin I’ll fr switch

2021-06-02 13:00:04,wallstreetbets,"You just shouldn’t use margin because it allows brokerages to lend your shares out without your consent, and they can change margin rates at any time, like requiring you to have 300% more than your position on hand in cash or they’ll liquidate you. Imagine waking up after being up 100k and they change the rules, and even though you’re making money you still owe. That’s the reality of margin. Use Fidelity or TDA"

2021-06-02 13:01:20,wallstreetbets,Okay didn’t know that either thanks for the education. Is fidelity free?
2021-06-02 13:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Yup Fidelity is free, but they actually vet their customers to make sure they know what they’re doing. Another thing robinhood does is route buy orders through dark pools to eliminate upward movement from all retail traders on their platform which is literally market manipulation, and it’s been widely speculated that you don’t own any shares you purchase through them simply because they choose not to buy anything until a major dip. This is commonly known as payment for order contract which is super illegal"
2021-06-02 15:43:30,wallstreetbets,Financial expert here; just so you're aware; none of the brokerages are actually free. Some might feel more free than others but you pay for it all in a round about way.
2021-06-02 13:06:36,wallstreetbets,Sheesh... yeah I’ll look into fidelity right now lmao

But  $NOK was completely out of favor by Wall Street and that’s one of the things that has me so excited. Now that Wall Street recognized NOK as #1 company to benefit from 5G, the stock will have an exponential growth.

It is predicted that shipments for 5G devices in 2021 will exceed 500 million. And that’s when 5G will start to get really exciting and 5G networks will be live in hundreds of cities around the world.

2021-06-02 15:00:05,wallstreetbets,About time.  I bought into NOK last February and have been waiting for it to take off.

2021-06-02 11:30:52,wallstreetbets,"Still needs some time, all focus is on AMC, now BB starting up, next should be Nok!"

2021-06-02 11:36:44,wallstreetbets,"I've always loved Nokia.  Solid products, solid earnings.  Next paycheck I'm going all in for this launch!"

2021-06-02 15:56:23,wallstreetbets,NOK peeps let's get it.
2021-06-02 17:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Reason to invest in NOK: They have been there from 1865, pivoting at times and pride of Finland"
2021-06-02 16:57:57,wallstreetbets,I have 200 $12 calls ready and waiting
2021-06-02 18:03:34,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't wait until I got home to see what the retards were saying about NOK. 

God speed, ye fellow heathens."
2021-06-02 18:25:14,wallstreetbets,NOK is extremely undervalued.  It’s one of the only tickers aswell that initially followed this meme stock trend but didn’t pick back up. Jan 5.5 calls for next year are a big buy here.
2021-06-02 11:50:21,wallstreetbets,BB mooooon
2021-06-02 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,Go

2021-06-02 13:08:07,wallstreetbets,"I sold my position a weeks ago to buy some AMC, goodness i did, but definitely would be again in my portfolio for the next years"
2021-06-02 18:02:37,wallstreetbets,"""The year is 2070 and Nok is setting up Comms/Data networks on Europa.""   


Pretty much how I feel about it."
2021-06-02 18:51:35,wallstreetbets,Just bought 200 more shares
2021-06-02 11:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Here we go again, a company's stock hits it's highest price in months or years, ""DD"" suddenly starts appearing on WSB."
2021-06-02 11:41:53,wallstreetbets,Market cap at $30B and share price of $5 - not much room for it to move significantly given the market cap retard
2021-06-02 12:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh goodie... time for our daily ""NOK is the 5G play"" post. 

Nokia was on track to take off last summer too. And it'll be on track to take off next summer too."
2021-06-02 11:40:23,wallstreetbets,"NOK is still the same shitty company it was back in the 90s, they gonna get stooomped by competition sooner or later."
2021-06-02 12:47:22,wallstreetbets,"NOK sucks my hairly asshole, buy ACB calls oh ape"
2021-06-02 13:37:14,wallstreetbets,For some reason my UK broker can only buy BB from the Canadian market and cba filling out another form so fuck it I'm skipping straight to NOK and planting some seeds
2021-06-02 12:34:12,wallstreetbets,"It’s me, $$$$"

2021-06-02 13:58:58,wallstreetbets,"NOK isn’t really shorted though.  Which I think could hurt it’s rise.

It’s less than 1% correct? 

Palantir has 5% and the company is legit making multimillion dollar deals left and right."
2021-06-02 15:33:07,wallstreetbets,🚀BANG🚀
2021-06-02 17:10:01,wallstreetbets,"NOK has always been a long term bet, had them since 2018 but I like how they've been restructuring.  basically, i like the stock"
2021-06-02 15:32:28,wallstreetbets,Nice from $4.20 tp $420 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 14:58:32,wallstreetbets,4.2069?
2021-06-02 15:21:04,wallstreetbets,similar position. let's go!
2021-06-02 15:15:49,wallstreetbets,EOM! How about EOD! Only if we understood it’s real potential. Let’s go NOK!
2021-06-02 13:25:54,wallstreetbets,"900 shares is like actually nothing. Normally 900 is nothing, but its even nothinger with a float as large as theirs"
2021-06-02 17:22:46,wallstreetbets,900? Must of been a janitor.
2021-06-02 14:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Bagholder spotted.

2021-06-02 17:09:07,wallstreetbets,"lol i bought nok in 2018 and still waiting, but looking good right now"
2021-06-02 12:11:38,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t hurt to throw a small % on NOK to get in on the ground floor.
2021-06-02 11:52:47,wallstreetbets,I miss their phones
2021-06-02 12:41:44,wallstreetbets,But... but I like the stock...
2021-06-02 12:18:10,wallstreetbets,"If you go back to \~March (and maybe even soon) there has been multiple posts on WSB and other NOK specific threads regarding NOK the the utter market failure to recognize the long term value here. Amazing balance sheet, at the tail-end of the turnaround/reorg. 

Go back and read the long form DD that many of us have worked long and hard on before deciding to dive in deep with NOK. Then, and only THEN, when you've actually considered everything, come back and give some legitimate criticism to the DD. Otherwise you have no idea what you're talking about and just being an ass-clown"
2021-06-02 13:56:06,wallstreetbets,"Speak for yourself, some of us have been sitting on dozens of $5 calls for a month now waiting for this thing to rally. DD was around back then, but it wasn’t getting upvotes."
2021-06-02 12:20:22,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. Those of us who have done the research know that NOK is superior in quality and product offerings than, say, ERIC. and yet Ericsson has been rewarded with a \~48bill market cap. Mean reversion shows that just being on PAR with Ericsson gives a share valuation of around $8, plus the  uptick in 5G adoption, potential share buy-backs, and other catalysts show that there is quite a bit of meat left on the bones."
2021-06-02 11:56:07,wallstreetbets,Shhhh that'll destroy their silly narrative! They don't like truth here..
2021-06-02 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,"That's fair.

If you actually can elaborate as to who this ""competition"" is (non-Huawei), would love to hear it."
2021-06-02 12:49:41,wallstreetbets,Me 170 shares
2021-06-02 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,I looked up around 14% of shares outstanding shorted as of yesterday. That’s actual shares and not options so it could be much worse
2021-06-02 17:11:00,wallstreetbets,"had them since 2018, they've always been a long term bet, but falling in with the WSB picks, can only help as far as I understand it"
2021-06-02 17:23:15,wallstreetbets,906 means it’s at least a full-time janitor.
2021-06-02 12:16:02,wallstreetbets,Forreal. A Nokia flip phone prevented me from breaking my hip when I was a young idiot. Took all the force of being thrown off a moving car and that mf just kept working
2021-06-02 12:27:30,wallstreetbets,"They still makes phones…just probably not like the Finnish tanks they used to be.

https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_us"
2021-06-02 17:58:09,wallstreetbets,"Dude I'm rocking the Nokia Pureview right now X)

Edit: Had the blue Lumia 920, too.  Just solid phones!"
2021-06-02 12:21:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm just laughing about how this happens, I've got nothing against NOK, no valid criticism or anything, it just strikes me as funny how much DD pops up at the highs."
2021-06-02 14:05:49,wallstreetbets,"I liked the DD months ago, i still do. I'm just joking about how DD comes out in droves as soon as there's a huge run up."
2021-06-02 13:05:35,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 I wasn’t arguing the business retard. I’m saying the market cap is $30B - it would take a massive investment to move the stock price even a dollar
2021-06-02 12:20:55,wallstreetbets,"Bring some truth and maybe it will be recognized. Bring ignorance, and get ignored."
2021-06-02 15:22:48,wallstreetbets,"there is no competition, and NOK apparently sold their phone division according to another crayon eater in this sub so right now theyre just signing deals regarding their 5G advancement aka NOK is the producer of SAO VR products in the future 

not advice though"
2021-06-02 16:45:13,wallstreetbets,"I’m so confused.  Maybe I am just retarded.  I see a float rate of .9%, is that not the short position?"
2021-06-02 12:16:49,wallstreetbets,Damnnn 🙏 glad you're ok!!!
2021-06-02 12:46:42,wallstreetbets,I didn't know I'm definitely buying one lol
2021-06-02 18:16:19,wallstreetbets,DUDE! The LUMIA 920! That phone was fire!
2021-06-02 12:56:02,wallstreetbets,"It’s a validation marker. That said, there’s far more IRL long term potential here than GME ... which may be the reason that NOK doesn’t pop like GME did - bc there’s real Value to it"
2021-06-02 14:10:01,wallstreetbets,"This sub is fueled by FOMO, anyone who has been on here long enough knows that.

NOK is one of the few meme stocks that I think he true underlying value beyond their current valuations. They aren’t a brick and mortar theater company that was silently dying for the past decade. They’re the leader in 5G and innovation surrounding it. The next Gen of the world’s tech systems and data speed processing. Yes they have a LOT of shares outstanding, but I see deeper valuations in them than other meme stocks. Well, TLRY too but that’s another dollar for another day."
2021-06-02 13:20:41,wallstreetbets,"You said ""not much room for it to move"", which is an argument on the price of the stock not the volume needed to move it. I clarified that based on the fundamentals and the market environment, there is MORE than enough room for it to move. Make your argument better."
2021-06-02 14:24:10,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure I read awhile back that Nokia sold their phone division a long time ago. Nokia phones are made by someone else I believe
2021-06-02 13:27:45,wallstreetbets,⭐️ for having the most retarded response I’ve ever seen that makes absolutely 0 sense lol
2021-06-02 13:31:30,wallstreetbets,But again you’d have to be extremely retarded to invest in a company with a low share price and not pay any mind to the market cap 😎🔥
2021-06-02 14:24:55,wallstreetbets,I gotta read up on that
2021-06-02 13:44:55,wallstreetbets,"No...wrong again sir. You simply have to have done you research and know the catalysts that are needed to move the stock higher, realize that the company is on an obvious climb back from the depths, and recognize that the necessary catalysts are here or around the corner. In short....actually do the work and not just blindly YOLO because you think low floats = free tendies. This isn't a casino. Go to GME for that crap."

2021-06-02 10:56:42,wallstreetbets,"Contracts were bought May 19th on the dip as an earnings play.  Little did I know Big Brain Jensen would flop his dong out and announce a stock split.  As per the rule, I sold 4 of the contracts shortly after the image for 70.8.  A clean 11x trade.  I plan on exercising 1 of them and riding the bull a bit longer."
2021-06-02 11:15:00,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. Congrats bro
2021-06-02 11:24:26,wallstreetbets,"Right when I heard of the split I jumped in

2021-06-02 11:33:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, not gonna lie, I got real lucky at first, but holding was a no brainer.  Despite the ""chip shortage"" bullshit, the sector is on fire right now.  If the indexes permit, and the rest of the ER's from the sector pan out, this thing could smash 700 pre split."

2021-06-02 11:16:23,wallstreetbets,You gonna cry when it drops back down to $10
2021-06-02 11:20:43,wallstreetbets,If it’s good enough to screenshot it’s good enough to sell. From experience the worst feeling is watching a great position get slowly fucked by either theta or a move against you. If you’re happy now don’t fuck it up and at least sell the option.
2021-06-02 11:15:10,wallstreetbets,Helluva drug
2021-06-02 11:20:29,wallstreetbets,Why for love of god are you still using robinhood
2021-06-02 11:42:37,wallstreetbets,Almost as good as roadracing motorcycles.
2021-06-02 13:06:23,wallstreetbets,I sold this morning at 37 fml
2021-06-02 16:08:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I have replaced my habitual viewings of step sisters getting stuck and fucked under tables with stocking off.
2021-06-02 16:22:22,wallstreetbets,If you like this you should try heroin!
2021-06-02 11:28:45,wallstreetbets,"Wasent really sure how that works lol, what’s a 1 dollar call mean if I bought it at 10 dollars"
2021-06-02 11:32:05,wallstreetbets,I was dying seeing that too lol. He auto lost the premium but hey I wouldn’t mind having it
2021-06-02 11:17:04,wallstreetbets,"No, I will buy more"
2021-06-02 11:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the advice brotha, learned that one the hard way before, I already took out some profits I’m happy with making, the rest is turning to diamonds baby"
2021-06-02 11:21:58,wallstreetbets,"All my buddies ask me the same question, just too lazy to start the process of an asset transfer, it’s gonna bite me in the ass though I know it."
2021-06-02 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,Why not? It's got an easy to use gorgeous interface. You get emojis when you sell. It's so quick to buy and sell assets. Can execute a trade mid meeting. I recently got td Ameritrade to go along with RH. Pros there are I can trade options in 1ct increment while RH makes me do 5 cents under $3. But like if you want to buy an option that cost 63 cents are you going to quiver over 2 more cents to make it 65 cents if you're hoping for 1.7 at the opening bell? I like td Ameritrade because like any real brokerage you can trade OTC.. Not so much with RH
2021-06-02 12:19:40,wallstreetbets,"God I really should put less effort into learning this shit, it doesn’t matter lmao"
2021-06-02 13:17:00,wallstreetbets,"It means if it doesn't hit $10 by the end of the day you're going to owe about $10,000. I'm just kidding I don't know either."
2021-06-02 14:05:56,wallstreetbets,you just hurt so many feelings lmao.
2021-06-02 11:52:24,wallstreetbets,"What premium did I lose lol, still learning options"
2021-06-02 11:18:49,wallstreetbets,Me to. This price fluctuation has me cautious cause those whales are about to dump their positions.
2021-06-02 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Smart, taking out at least initial investment (or that plus a lil bit) is always the smart move"
2021-06-02 11:49:49,wallstreetbets,I just transferred to fidelity. If ur gonna transfer prolly do it today bc it takes 3-7 business days for most brokerages I think. Not financial advice lol
2021-06-02 15:48:43,wallstreetbets,It took me 3 days to transfer just for it the squeeze will take days anyways it’s not like you are just going to hodl anyway ha just don’t want my fellow ape to miss out on his tendies man
2021-06-02 12:28:19,wallstreetbets,"The point of options is to leverage your money. You might as well have just bought regular shares. Still, great job! Congrats!"
2021-06-02 12:56:30,wallstreetbets,As options go deeper in the money they slide mostly to intrinsic value (value is between strike and current share price). You still get some premium from theta but you lose most of the extrinsic value deep ITM. Just look at any options chain for same expiration and compare premiums (cost on top of intrinsic value) from deep ITM to At the money to out of the money.
2021-06-02 11:20:41,wallstreetbets,"I don’t even think about them, my brain is too small for that, all I know is hold and buy dip"

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Atari (ATA) is my pick for the moon **Company background**

This is a company I've heard of - they've made some games in the 1980s. I'm not sure what they've done since other then being based in France.
  
**Financials**

Their price has fallen from nearly $0.90 to $0.50 over the last year or so. This shows there's lots of room for growth.

**Meme-ability**
  
If I've heard of them then probably lots of other people have as well and maybe they will also buy it.
  
**Target price**

$20 a share. 
  
**Justification**

If it goes to $20 a share then I'll have made $1,200. This is a lot more than the $40 I've invested and so I would like this to be the price.

Edit: ATA is the French ticker, which is the only one I can buy. PONGF is the US ticker."
2021-06-02 11:10:57,wallstreetbets,"what is the short interest? That's the only metric i trade on.

2021-06-02 11:26:44,wallstreetbets,Not a bad idea. Even if it doesn't become a meme stock bc they do have a modern console that came out for backers only and now just waiting for them to release it to the public so if it is that cheap for shares and this system does well big gains
2021-06-02 11:54:34,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely financial advice. Thanks OP, I'm going big!"
2021-06-02 13:32:53,wallstreetbets,"I missed AMC, I'm not missing this one. My children thank you for this advice."
2021-06-02 12:34:45,wallstreetbets,Ya know what?  $300 to help you get to your $20 price.  You totally convinced me with that detailed and well thought out analysis.
2021-06-02 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,"Actually. This isn't really a meme stock.
Atari has plans to open a hotel in Vegas 2022.
I think Denver is on the list as well.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Form 20F not filed in time, company does not respond to requests It seems to be „not unusual“ that a NASDAQ company is late with filing the annual report in time at the end of April.

I read somewhere that this year about 30% of NASDAQ companies missed the deadline.

It is possible to file for a 15 days extension. If the company missed also that deadline, the NASDAQ will send a letter and grant another 60 days to create a plan how the company will fix the issue.

So far, so good. But what if there was a short report blaming the company of fraud, the company missed all that deadlines and also don’t reply to requests (and just post a generic message like „we could not file because we need more time“).

All this happened, the corresponding company is EHang Holdings.

As a result of the short report and also the missing report, companies share price went down from 124 USD to currently 27. 

So do other companies in similar situations explain something in detail or is it kind of „normal“ that the company remains silent ?

If everything is okay, there is a huge upside potential for the share price."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Puts on Moderna [MRNA] DD Why Mods delete? Positions added and any questionable sources removed. Worked hard on this DD damnit.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope this reads like a breath of fresh air from the bullshit monkeying around we’ve been seeing here lately.

There are few sectors of the market which are as privy to radical change in reaction to breaking news as the biotech/pharma sector. “X drug getting FDA approval”? – people pile in and the stock price sextuples. “X drug fails some tests”? – you know the drill. <<our boy>> Martin Shkreli, who never failed to return the tendies, took advantage of this predictable chaos and earned his claim to fame by correctly predicting that Regeneron would dump. He later graduated to price manipulation. What does this have to do with MRNA? I don’t desire his fame, the Wu Tang, or the subsequent jail… but Moderna (MRNA) is going to dump. I’ll begin with the fundamentals, then point out the obvious TA.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Prices and dates](https://preview.redd.it/mv6lqg3aav271.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=3227649db4e4ca6c56305fc4e49ca229fc58ce4d)

MRNA current price: $192, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

[Figure 2 Market Cap](https://preview.redd.it/18tnp92dav271.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52c075aca1b4183cfbca03797e692c650c7fc21)

This price is too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). This is the kicker. Do you think you, your friends/family/relatives will be eating up Moderna booster shots like fucking lucky charms for the next many years? And that billions of people around the world will do so? That Jpow will run the printer to the tune of $30 billion so that Oaxaca can eat their MRNA charms?

The answer is no, but before I explain why let’s look at a few other important notes. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought, has resulted in a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position is incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )!!!

[Figure 3: Volatile roof](https://preview.redd.it/7qi53pefav271.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=eec91c5689b313a4648f175de6d996680da72475)

So it looks like it might be going to dump – now. You’re a lucky autist, you might finally get to buy high and sell low – puts that is. And the reason it would dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along. Why’d yall have to pump into oblivion, why couldn’t you be chill like Pfizer (PFE)? Well, then we wouldn’t have this opportunity to move outta the wife’s closet.

But there’s more, and this is where it actually gets juicy. There’s a really, really, really big catalyst coming up. Something that could knock Moderna back down to $50 or $60 a share. This is a real FD opportunity… the catalyst is Ivermectin. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic. Read: cheap as hell, easy to mass produce, old technology with impeccable safety record.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

[Figure 4: IVM metrics](https://preview.redd.it/92eg3fpmav271.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2905cb79c85aba0ebf88e779e2bd072508b8924)

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] Meanwhile the latest from MRNA bulls is that 12-15 year olds can take the vaccine \[17\].. hooray? Hordes of people chomping at the bit for that one. Lol, gl m8.

So, the MRNA bubble is going to pop either way and it’s going to pop any second. Just how far down it can go is anyone’s guess. Price targets: $110 with zero Ivermectin news (unlikely). $70 to $90 if they’re competing with WELL TESTED (for forty years…) over the counter meds.., $35 to $50 if EUA is revoked due to there being alternative treatment pathways. However, Moderna and Pfizer both have recently applied for full FDA approval (and will likely get it), making the $35 the wettest of FD dreams, and $70 to $110 the realistic range this thing could drop to. After you place your bet or whatever you do, you can watch the data on Ivermectin roll in live here [https://ivmmeta.com/](https://ivmmeta.com/) as it prints and prints

TA: Just look at that chart, I don’t even need to draw it. It’s a perfect Baby Eagle Hatching from Golden Egg – i.e. bout to drop another curve to complete the egg.

TLDR:

Puts puts puts on MRNA. It’s about to dump a minimum of 40%, but likely more as other covid drugs enter the market. All of the above are merely the dreams of a retard and are not to be construed as financial advice.

MRNA $145 P 7/16

2021-06-02 12:07:27,wallstreetbets,You failed to mention the drop last month was due to Grandpa Joe saying it supported taking away the IP protections.   Why did you narrowing in on the vaccine and left out their entire pipeline?   5 of your sources you removed because they weren’t grade a sources and didn’t want to get banned.    It’s sounds to me that you are really trying to get people to sell so you can’t try to get in at a lower price and using ours as a disguise and for that reason I’m out.

Your write up seems to only consider covid.

Again, I don't think you're wrong because there are plenty of other factors are working in your favor, but that seems like a big oversight."

2021-06-02 12:41:13,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t really funny. The fact that you would do this to your Dads savings is sickening. He probably trusted your dumbass to help him with his retirement and you are doing something that you know isn’t in his best interest. 

My mother has to take care of her Mom everyday in addition to working 40 hours because my grandmother had no retirement savings. She now has no life and has to spend every free moment with her. Hopefully this happens to you as a lesson. Although I think it’s a fair assumption if you’re willing to YOLO your Dads savings on meme stocks you fit more of the type to dump the responsibility of taking care of him later in life on your siblings. 

But hey “bErS R fUK” !"

2021-06-02 14:39:23,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC took out their all time highs. $147.56 would take out BB all time high [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]

That's the point. He convinced his dad to do it. God speed you lovable retard. Your entire genetic line is fucked all the way down but hopefully you cunts can be rich with downs.

2021-06-02 13:51:50,wallstreetbets,I usually agree for yolo plays with your own money. However putting someone life saving on the line is not cool.......
2021-06-02 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,your dads wife's boyfriend is gonna really upset when he reads this
2021-06-02 14:44:09,wallstreetbets,Need a update to see if you made that loss back yet.
2021-06-02 14:51:41,wallstreetbets,You’re def lying. But if you’re not lying. You’re a shit tier person
2021-06-02 15:19:18,wallstreetbets,What’s price did he yolo at?
2021-06-02 15:21:03,wallstreetbets,I remember you
2021-06-02 15:48:36,wallstreetbets,I'd never do that even if I knew the trade had 1% chance of failing. I mean it's your dad's entire life's work. Don't make him regret not sleeping that night.
2021-06-02 16:04:00,wallstreetbets,This is why I'm not pro life
2021-06-02 16:17:01,wallstreetbets,I just want your dad to make back his savings with a little extra on top. You truly are an asshole for doing this to him. You deserve no praise for any of this and you seem to care more about clout and upvotes than your own father’s retirement.
2021-06-02 16:49:44,wallstreetbets,You gambled your parents life savings and that's supposed to be a good thing? Huh...

2021-06-02 13:16:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for dumb plays, but it's sickening seeing someone using their parents money but not their own. This should not be encouraged. Get rich or starve trying with your own paychecks"

2021-06-02 14:21:09,wallstreetbets,I believe at first he yolod it into GME too.
2021-06-02 15:41:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is so stupid...
2021-06-02 14:15:53,wallstreetbets,Plot twist: OP is suicidal and was calling it his father's savings because he's planning on bequeathing it all to him.
2021-06-02 13:36:40,wallstreetbets,It’s just a caption to gain more attention. Stop taking everything so seriously jeez
2021-06-02 18:36:13,wallstreetbets,Not a strong enough word to describe this
2021-06-02 18:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, ultra dick."
2021-06-02 15:22:26,wallstreetbets,what if his dad is dead and its his inheritance?

2021-06-02 14:58:36,wallstreetbets,The fact that he didn’t average down is irresponsible

2021-06-02 13:44:18,wallstreetbets,"In the original post he said it was a conscious choice he made with his dad. He didn't just yeet his dad's money away. Everyone was pretty supportive at the time, didn't realise we were now r/investing"

2021-06-02 13:23:44,wallstreetbets,Chill. I think it is kind of this sub's language. I don't think his dad really let him play with his money. I hope so.
2021-06-02 13:32:30,wallstreetbets,"1) Y’all really falling for these captions aren’t you

2) Not your money, stop crying"

2021-06-02 13:24:17,wallstreetbets,did you sell? then you didn't turn it into anything.
2021-06-02 13:55:48,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me like I’m a smooth brained retard. Thank

2021-06-02 19:33:30,wallstreetbets,"they let you use the cash you put in instantly, kinda like a loan, put it in, use the money now, pay them in the week when its fully deposited simple really"
2021-06-02 12:32:34,wallstreetbets,Hell no anything under $100 is a total bargain
2021-06-02 12:36:21,wallstreetbets,Definitely not
2021-06-02 13:04:05,wallstreetbets,">Definitely not

Keep f\*cking buying until we reach the moon"
2021-06-02 12:28:49,wallstreetbets,Idk :(
2021-06-02 12:10:14,wallstreetbets,Transferring out of meme stocks right now is a dangerous proposition though. You just never know when it’s gonna moon.
2021-06-02 11:24:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ve seen this a lot, what broker do you recommend? I no longer want to be a hoodrat 😢"
2021-06-02 13:09:53,wallstreetbets,"NVSTR is where its at, homie."
2021-06-02 13:09:53,wallstreetbets,"NVSTR is where its at, homie."
2021-06-02 14:05:46,wallstreetbets,Look at the (avg. cost).
2021-06-02 16:26:14,wallstreetbets,Are you using options? He bought 7 contracts

2021-06-02 14:23:11,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a call and it expires worthless, you’ll lose whatever you paid for it"
2021-06-02 19:48:04,wallstreetbets,I bought the first one May 14th at 1.37
2021-06-02 18:32:51,wallstreetbets,U got a class for det or something?
2021-06-02 19:34:11,wallstreetbets,Not for options :( only to buy shares
2021-06-02 13:32:12,wallstreetbets,are you saying this as a wsb style yolo thing or does this stock actually have potential to go huge like gme?
2021-06-02 14:00:04,wallstreetbets,"I transferred from Robinhood to fidelity and to went through overnight, so if anyone’s considering it go ahead!"
2021-06-02 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity

Active Trader Pro is the shit."
2021-06-02 11:30:24,wallstreetbets,Ameritrade anything other than RH
2021-06-02 19:34:45,wallstreetbets,im a simp for webull only cause ive had it for a while already
2021-06-02 11:29:43,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks
2021-06-02 13:30:09,wallstreetbets,"then you didn't turn $871 into $15,000. Come back when you realize that gain porn cause i'd love to see your success. seriously!"
2021-06-02 15:36:59,wallstreetbets,Thank
2021-06-02 14:24:16,wallstreetbets,"Bet thanks, so I don’t even need to hit the strike price to make money as long as the price is higher than what I paid too?"
2021-06-02 15:39:01,wallstreetbets,Lol potential is there. But it’s all a risk at this point. Personally I wouldn’t buy in at this price. But fomo might kick in if it continues to rise.
2021-06-02 14:40:41,wallstreetbets,"No matter what the price is, there will be someone saying anything less than CurrentPrice*1.5 “is a bargain”

Buy what you’re comfortable with. For me, 60+ which is over the all time high, is way too risky"
2021-06-02 13:56:30,wallstreetbets,"Hes trolling your ass, dont take financial advice from retards"
2021-06-02 14:07:46,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah it does they're from the same community. AMC is LEADING for every other Meme stock including GME. Compare the charts in real time and see who reacts to who and you will know what I mean. APES gonna go big! We'll break $100 Eaasyy
2021-06-02 13:36:31,wallstreetbets,"It absolutely can and WILL go bigger than GME. It is way more undervalued and the squeeze has not even started yet because the shorts haven’t covered yet.

If you’re having doubts feel free to Google, Read, Research, everything you can from many sources about this upcoming squeeze until you’re convinced. $1000 is no longer a joke or a meme if people hold long enough. The only thing you will wish is that you didn’t get in sooner once this takes off!"
2021-06-02 12:43:38,wallstreetbets,"I just started with Fidelity because my HSA account was already there.

I should have also taken that money, that I use for medical expenses, and put into AMC.  Fuck me."
2021-06-02 18:05:01,wallstreetbets,You
2021-06-02 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,"The stock price going up doesn’t guarantee your call will increase in value, but no, you don’t need to hit the strike price to make money"
2021-06-02 17:10:07,wallstreetbets,"If it doesn't hit the strike price when it expires, then it's worthless. Why exercise a $40 call if you could just buy at market of $39? You don't make money unless the price is the strike price plus the premium. The upside is unlimited, the downside is limited to the premium you paid."
2021-06-02 13:38:29,wallstreetbets,"my only worry is that i buy now and everyone gets out with their profits, but i'll definitely look into it"
2021-06-02 14:12:31,wallstreetbets,"Dudes feeding you crap, that’s why he’s getting downvoted"
2021-06-02 14:26:48,wallstreetbets,"I'd pass. the market cap is already well above where gme is currently at, and not far off where gme was when it hit $500. I don't think amc will go past $100. of course I could always be wrong but I'd be willing to bet that it doesn't."
2021-06-02 13:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha you really don’t have to worry - we have your back. The vast majority of us are refusing to sell until it reaches a certain price, it’s already had a few dips from people paperhanding and losing faith in the movement but when that happens the rest of us just buy up what they sell and keep holding. This is like a snowball rolling down a hill at this point I really don’t think just buying a single share or two and watch where it takes you is a risky play."
2021-06-02 17:05:54,wallstreetbets,"It's interesting that the AMC gang is more realistic than the GME gang about what stock prices will do in the future; which is, in essence, ""fuck if we know, we just like the stock.""

Sold my AMC yesterday, very sad panda."
2021-06-02 17:25:22,wallstreetbets,"That’s because the situation GME is already in is not realistic. This should’ve never happened or been allowed to happen and the results will absolutely be unrealistic. 

AMC has a more realistic possible outcome. We’ve seen these types of things before and yes they’re crazy but they’re still a part of the typical market. 

Gme is not the same."
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,2 weeks ago these contracts were worth 1 dollar each. Diamond hands holding through the dippiest dip. 💎 
2021-06-02 11:44:08,wallstreetbets,Ive been holding on to my BB lottery tickets -  Jan 22 $40 for almost 6 months now.

2021-06-02 13:55:17,wallstreetbets,LET's GO! I invested in AMC because the pandemic was closing out and I love going to the movies. Thank you @wallstreetbets for pointing me in this direction.
2021-06-02 12:10:57,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my AMC at $30 and I'm a turd muffin.  That is all.  I'll continue to cry in the corner while the rest of you bang hot models by the pool.

2021-06-02 13:20:12,wallstreetbets,"I've only got 17 shares, but I bought at $13 like 4 months ago, after all that time in the red, it's nice to see AMC finally breaking out. Cheers apes, let's ride to the moon."
2021-06-02 11:02:35,wallstreetbets,A true retard. Confirmed by holding his phone the wrong way. One of us.
2021-06-02 10:45:56,wallstreetbets,I can’t lie. This made me want to invest in AMC.
2021-06-02 14:04:08,wallstreetbets,"So some retard blew his money on hookers and cocaine? 

Definitely one of us."
2021-06-02 12:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Everyone HOLD, yes we all have made lots of money, but we can make more if we hold together"
2021-06-02 13:58:13,wallstreetbets,"I was gonna sell once it hit 2k, but took a nap. Now it’s at 3.4k. That was the best nap I’ve ever taken in my life."
2021-06-02 12:25:49,wallstreetbets,"I just checked my portfolio, sent my husband a screenshot of AMC and said ""what the fuck is happening?!""

2021-06-02 15:38:35,wallstreetbets,I'm trying not to cry honestly. I'm the only one working in my house to pay the bills. I bought 9 shares at $13 and it crashed. I sat on it hoping. Thing got worse money wise and I just wanted out. When it started to finally come back up I was excited to just get out and made $4 on it when it got to $14ish. I was just happy to have made a little profit. And now I've been staring at it rise and how I lost out of $500 because I have paper hands.  I'm really sorry guys. It's just heartbreaking for me
2021-06-02 15:54:55,wallstreetbets,In at 8$ NEVER CASHING OUT

2021-06-02 13:35:18,wallstreetbets,who else noticed the girl twerking in front of the signs
2021-06-02 13:39:02,wallstreetbets,God I'm so proud of every single ape.  Y'all deserve sandwiches and foot rubs.
2021-06-02 13:41:32,wallstreetbets,Don't let the twerking at the end distract you from our mission.
2021-06-02 13:42:57,wallstreetbets,They just put a freeze on us.    🦍🦍.  Wow

2021-06-02 13:59:33,wallstreetbets,Even though it keeps going up should I buy some more? I’m a poor broke bitch but a few extra bucks would be nice right about now considering my boyfriend left me yesterday.
2021-06-02 14:00:34,wallstreetbets,When are the shorts due?
2021-06-02 14:00:53,wallstreetbets,I don’t see no shorts covering! Not SELLIN
2021-06-02 14:04:28,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $29, feared I might hold the bag, got mentioned in Reuters. Sold at $36, bought back at $67.... I wanted to get in at $40...

This could be very good. I don’t know if it will, but it could do what $GME did and that would be phenomenal.

/I have no idea what is going to happen, but in the real world I see that a lot of shorts went out of the money today and if they have to cover, insofar as they have not already done so, they’re going to get a serious haircut."
2021-06-02 14:08:30,wallstreetbets,florida? …florida.
2021-06-02 14:09:21,wallstreetbets,"From an AMC holder to the GME holders, you all got this, remember your mission and stay your course! #gme2damoon"
2021-06-02 14:10:50,wallstreetbets,Just for context I am in no way expecting down payment money it was just an easy example. It's just hard not to get excited with so many comments talking thousands.
2021-06-02 14:11:35,wallstreetbets,When it hit 60 I shit myself let's go to that moon

2021-06-02 14:24:17,wallstreetbets,I have like eight stonks in AMC but I am still really excited for what’s to come!  To the moon!
2021-06-02 14:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Bought AMC at the 16.11 peak before it fell down to bellow 10, highest it reached was 14 for 3 months so I sold at a loss to focus on GME, as soon as I did a week later the boom happened and now we're at 60 a pop, Fml haha, that's what you get for not following your gut and paper handing."
2021-06-02 14:35:35,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding since March, I'm not selling yet....I could easily sell for a massive profit but I'm being greedy."
2021-06-02 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,My notifications on stock price movements are going off like crazy today.
2021-06-02 14:36:38,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 did u pay for this??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how much does shit like this cost?
2021-06-02 14:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Two shares, HODLing strong."
2021-06-02 14:37:26,wallstreetbets,That’s a fat ass
2021-06-02 14:43:50,wallstreetbets,I FOMO back when it was 17$. Got mad and bought the dip bringing my average down to like 9 or 10. I'm hard as a rock right now. Sold a few to protect my initial investment and now I'm looking at my stocks thinking of ways I'm going to tell my coworkers to fuck themselves.
2021-06-02 14:47:50,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah been holding even during the dip now it went up 300% !! TO THE FUCKING MOON 🌙🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-02 15:00:48,wallstreetbets,"w00t. had to get back my investment so I partially dumped, now everything left over is where i'm holding and never selling."
2021-06-02 15:02:23,wallstreetbets,I’ve had some. Sold 10. Bought back a month ago or so. Still like the “other one” more but in terms of a quick buck I think AMC is great. I won’t screw you all over by selling again early.
2021-06-02 15:03:10,wallstreetbets,I bought 7 shares at $8/ea. Still dying inside I can't just buy more right now for instant win. Also I will forever use these 7 shares as proof I am responsible with money and know what I am doing.
2021-06-02 15:10:28,wallstreetbets,My aunt bought 40 at 30$$ HOLD
2021-06-02 15:14:59,wallstreetbets,lol I have to wonder what those pussy hedge fund retards are thinking in their nice office in shitty downtown manhattan
2021-06-02 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,"Interesting how all of a sudden nobody is bashing AMC anymore, but now everyone is sharing how they wished they had sold at 60 dollars or how they cashed in at around that price range. 

Sure. Sure. Sure. 

That shit is gonna fall back down and then rise up again even higher. We are not buying your shit; only your shares."
2021-06-02 15:18:03,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!
2021-06-02 15:24:50,wallstreetbets,I’m in at $10.55 and still holding xxx shares

2021-06-02 15:53:31,wallstreetbets,6-minutes until AMC close. Let’s close at $70 😅
2021-06-02 16:07:15,wallstreetbets,"They are trying their hardest. There is absolutely no way possible (organically) that not a single wsb thread is on my feed. Yet, here we are. How much did shitadel pay to fuck with the algorithms?"

2021-06-02 17:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Strange I just posted a topic and it got pulled down, who is sick to death of only hearing MEME stocks and no one coming out with the truth that major market makers and large HF and what they have been up to for months shorting companies till they go bankrupt and now getting caught out. I am getting really pissed off with all the media and professional not even mentioning what really is going on ."
2021-06-02 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,Been holding since Feb! It might only be 5 shares but I’m holding!
2021-06-02 17:48:29,wallstreetbets,This Friday is Go to the Movies any Movie theater that Apes 🦍 Support 95% in 1 day! I like the stock ;)

2021-06-02 18:08:37,wallstreetbets,Y’all are so fucking cringe
2021-06-02 18:53:08,wallstreetbets,Someone probably had to spell AMC for them
2021-06-02 18:54:55,wallstreetbets,Cringe
2021-06-02 19:39:16,wallstreetbets,A lot of paper hands in here! Roll your calls and buy shares! 💎🙌🏼 Not financial advice.🚀🌒
2021-06-02 12:28:10,wallstreetbets,LOL. The fact that wallstreetbets (now owned by shitadel) is letting this stay up lets me know amc is a distraction from GME. And i will be banned after this comment.
2021-06-02 12:33:03,wallstreetbets,"TOTAL BS!!!!!!!!

2021-06-02 13:07:49,wallstreetbets,I wonder what short hedge funds are getting destroyed right now...
2021-06-02 13:08:32,wallstreetbets,3000k on calls.
2021-06-02 13:12:33,wallstreetbets,"I missed the AMC rocket... Go on without me...

Next one is BB right?"
2021-06-02 14:33:15,wallstreetbets,Is it still worth it to buy in? currently around 65$
2021-06-02 15:22:40,wallstreetbets,"It’s not too late to get in. By Friday it will over $100 and once the media notice, it should in $200 for few weeks before dropping due to fears"
2021-06-02 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Shitadel owns 2% of AMC. You are giving them funds both on the up and the down. Shitadel owns wallstreetbets now and that's why these posts are allowed to stay. But that's ok, because they are just going to use those funds to buy back GME."
2021-06-02 14:09:55,wallstreetbets,"All these comments here remind my why Wall Street bets missed the point of the AMC movement. It was never about making a quick buck, it was always about holding to send a message, we won’t stand by while Wall Street decimate businesses affected by the pandemic, we won’t stand by and watch them bust up established companies that employ thousand of peoples across the globe. I hold my xxxx shares became those fuckers want them, and they can have them when they pay me 100k a share. I want to see them bent over licking my god damn boots pleading with me to sell. I still won’t though, cause fuck em. I’m a true ape,  I averaged 10.53, I’ve seen xxxxx gains today alone, still not selling, I’m a retard, I eat crayons and poop rainbows."
2021-06-02 10:59:28,wallstreetbets,You really remixed master P 😂

2021-06-02 12:34:48,wallstreetbets,"Unmuted the video, very disappointed to hear that they aren’t blasting Make ‘Em Say Ugh."
2021-06-02 13:03:14,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand all of you paperhanders. You invest and don’t think about it again until it’s stupid high. Why invest if y’all are gonna get scared? Only invest what you can afford and don’t look back.
2021-06-02 13:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Guys! Any idea of a ceiling here? 🤔
Trying to find my parachute! 🏃‍♂️💨"
2021-06-02 13:33:41,wallstreetbets,If AMC goes above 73 today market makers will be forced to cover. Go!
2021-06-02 13:43:01,wallstreetbets,Come on guys let’s pump it up and dump.
2021-06-02 13:46:18,wallstreetbets,People stop selling let’s get this higher. Bought at 13 and holding out
2021-06-02 13:49:13,wallstreetbets,Ok first time asking a question and I still have no idea what I'm doing but is it realistic to think the 3 shares we bought at $8 months ago could possibly get us our house down-payment if we hold long enough?
2021-06-02 13:51:03,wallstreetbets,I had to sell this morning at open to pay for my car repairs.  You're welcome everyone :(
2021-06-02 13:53:07,wallstreetbets,Hold guys!!!!! Don't let them win
2021-06-02 13:57:21,wallstreetbets,3 cheers for Mainstreet. Infinite fuck yous to Wall Street.
2021-06-02 14:07:54,wallstreetbets,These girls look so depressed to have to do this. But I supposed they were paid.

2021-06-02 12:36:25,wallstreetbets,Why’d they halt trade of AMC
2021-06-02 13:45:11,wallstreetbets,I just bought 100 $BB. Trying to catch this one early. Not selling like I did with AMC
2021-06-02 14:08:05,wallstreetbets,These prices make no sense. AMC stock is 20+ then it has been in the past 5 years. That's pre pandemic and during Marvel and Star Wars releases. The valuations make no sense.
2021-06-02 11:46:50,wallstreetbets,God DAMN how do those T H O T S afford to go on vacation every weekend???
2021-06-02 12:59:08,wallstreetbets,If we’re on Robinhood they can stop us. Get. Offfffffdfffffjxiejeisjchdiwurkndoapqjrf

2021-06-02 13:29:11,wallstreetbets,I have not one lick of sympathy for all the paper hands crying about selling in this group. You get what you deserve.

2021-06-02 13:07:49,wallstreetbets,"I had 30 shares of amc after rebuying last year ( had sold in 2019). The other day I did my first call which was interesting 😳 I made 2.5k in 2 days and I'm intrigued to know if it will get any better.

 Obviously I did my research but honestly it still doesn't make sense to me so I only invested $600 to see if I can learn by doing in addition to research. Low key wish I did a little more and a little more aggressively. But this was a great first time experience.

Thankful to the tards who have posted their gains (and losses)  for inspiration and Guidance. Wish I had it like that to drop 20k or 40k into one investment (but I historically invested in properties), hoping to get there soon."
2021-06-02 13:07:59,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding my 20 shares of amc since day 1. I woke up today up 500% up. It’s insane. I knew it’s gonna short squeeze weeks ago.

2021-06-02 14:48:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm a fucking idiot. 

I've had 50 shares for months. Yesterday I had the bright idea to close my AMC stocks that I bought through Ameritrade and repurchase them on WeBull, because I liked the interface better.

So I closed my Ameritrade stocks only to discover that they take a couple days to transfer the money to my bank account. NBD, if the stock goes up a little while I'm waiting, only a few bucks lost, amirite?!

Well fuck....

I only had enough credit on WeBull to buy 6 stocks before everything went Mt. St. Fucking Helens.

BRB, gonna jump off a bridge."

2021-06-02 14:23:10,wallstreetbets,nkla will be next.
2021-06-02 14:31:00,wallstreetbets,"I just sold all my shares, at almost exactly a 300% gain. Hadn’t checked in weeks.

Before anyone says I’ve got paper hands, I put it all in VACQ, one of the few stocks that can literally go to the moon, and I’m holding onto that until at least I’ve got grandkids (my daughter is an infant)."
2021-06-02 12:32:39,wallstreetbets,Theu just stopped you autist
2021-06-02 17:11:34,wallstreetbets,To late to buy into AMC ?
2021-06-02 17:47:28,wallstreetbets,amc squeeze is happening! You can’t be worth more with 6 billion in debt the biggest float ever and be worth more then pre pandemic smaller float best revenue years. Lol 100k?? Hahahah your guesstimate of shorts have closed in the last two weeks. But good for you don’t end up holding the bag!!!
2021-06-02 14:32:26,wallstreetbets,AMC isn’t the only thing going up with every butt shake
2021-06-02 15:47:24,wallstreetbets,Me too ;)

2021-06-02 13:16:56,wallstreetbets,"I told my boss to buy leaps in February. He bought $1000 of 12 calls I didn’t buy anything. He made $$45,000 and laughed at me."
2021-06-02 12:53:47,wallstreetbets,"Few months back I was in at $8 and sold at $15. 

Came very close to getting back in at $14 last week. Dont know why i keep torturing myself looking at the price."
2021-06-02 12:22:05,wallstreetbets,I’m not quite as retarded as you but I sold all my AMC yesterday at $30. Seeing $52 right now is making me realize I’m great at this!
2021-06-02 12:44:27,wallstreetbets,And here I am with 10 shares @ 12.76. Im enjoying this roller coaster of a ride
2021-06-02 13:16:35,wallstreetbets,That’s tuff I got 2000 shares in AMC I’m basically cumming in my pants right now
2021-06-02 12:37:07,wallstreetbets,"I can't fuck you in the face, but I can tell you to buy back in."
2021-06-02 12:52:01,wallstreetbets,Ape rule no1: You don't sell unless its a lifechanging gain!
2021-06-02 13:21:22,wallstreetbets,Sold mine at 35. Bought again at 66. This is the way.
2021-06-02 13:03:51,wallstreetbets,"I sold 100 @19 a day right before the main takeoff. I’ve been holding AMC since last year. It went from my biggest loser (I still held) to one of my best. I made some profit.

Doesn’t matter because I bought more under $30 and won’t make that mistake again cause this time I’m holding to the 🚀🚀"
2021-06-02 12:25:40,wallstreetbets,Imagine every one of you that paper handed were actually diamonds and didn’t sell. This price might be 60-70 right now. And every dollar this thing goes up will put pressure on the hedge funds to cover.
2021-06-02 12:35:02,wallstreetbets,Did you pay 25 ?
2021-06-02 13:39:43,wallstreetbets,You’re gonna feel real dumb when it’s sitting on $100k
2021-06-02 12:23:52,wallstreetbets,You goddamned retard.

2021-06-02 12:37:05,wallstreetbets,"I sold my 58 at 10 but I needed to pay rent, but I got two a twenty so fuck it you live and you learn"
2021-06-02 12:37:22,wallstreetbets,"I have 100 shares at 7.30$ , sold a call at 14$ 2 weeks ago... so I guess I just sit here and beat my head against the desk."
2021-06-02 13:20:08,wallstreetbets,I sold at $42. I need a kick in the nuts!!!!!!
2021-06-02 13:43:24,wallstreetbets,Paper handed bitch.
2021-06-02 13:09:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm crying. I put 30 shares in a brokerage account I don't normally use because RH had shut down AMC trades at the time, and I just hodled. Finally, I decided the squeeze had squozen and it was time to get out of that other account. I sold at $17ish, for a couple hundred dollars. I thought I was happy.

Two days later, the rocket took off, and all I could do was watch. My funds hadn't even settled yet"
2021-06-02 13:16:56,wallstreetbets,"i don't even want to remember what i sold at...all i can say is, holy shitballs!!!"
2021-06-02 13:23:31,wallstreetbets,It's ok brother. I'm going to lose this opportunity because of a legal regulation that only applies to poor people on certain brokers. Brought with unsettled funds...
2021-06-02 13:37:43,wallstreetbets,"Havnt you read a singel fukking Word of this amc stonk? Truly a fukking moron. You never sell, only 💎🙌 🚀 to moon"
2021-06-02 12:37:43,wallstreetbets,I sold my 12 shares at $14 before all this happened 😅😅  Good thing I didn't have more shares....
2021-06-02 12:54:19,wallstreetbets,"no offense to you guys, but i thought this was wallstreet BETS. seems to me what's best for AMC is best for GME at this point, this is THE bet. and i'm literally smooth as an egg up there, so listen to me and make some fucking bets retards (again no offense lol, money is serious and i'm retarded)"
2021-06-02 12:55:32,wallstreetbets,Buy back bro. There is room.
2021-06-02 12:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Did you gain? If so, you won. I sold at 19 with a 13 buy in. Gains a gain bud"

2021-06-02 13:01:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I bought 50 at like 9.XX and sold at 10.XX after it looked like it had fizzled a month later. Made a whopping $20 or something.

Could've made $2000. Tiny amounts of money, but still funny."
2021-06-02 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,I had a $24 call that I bought for .20 and sold for 1.98. Worth over 3k today.
2021-06-02 13:05:32,wallstreetbets,Sold a third covering my initial investment. I‘ll ride the other two thirds to the moon.

2021-06-02 13:09:01,wallstreetbets,Least it wasn't for a $4 per share loss....
2021-06-02 13:14:34,wallstreetbets,I sold 65 shares at 39 because I needed the money to buy a house. Should've left it. Kicking myself now.

2021-06-02 13:55:52,wallstreetbets,"Literally the worst thing you can do in the market is dwell on or calculate money you missed out on. Take it on the chin and learn from it, but don't dwell on it. Always look ahead for the next move."
2021-06-02 12:33:50,wallstreetbets,I sold at $9 so I can break even. I feel you bro you’re not alone

2021-06-02 13:01:42,wallstreetbets,"Damn. Rip to that extra 10k profit. But hey man, some profit is better than none. You can't time the market, so as long as you made some tendies, it's all good"

2021-06-02 13:47:09,wallstreetbets,Did you at least turn around and invest into something that might actually go somewhere?
2021-06-02 13:49:41,wallstreetbets,For reals. Can you apes mass sell so it can go back down and I can buy back in? 🥺🥲
2021-06-02 13:54:39,wallstreetbets,"In at 14, out at 64. I may still lose the moon, but I'm not getting GME'd again."
2021-06-02 13:56:53,wallstreetbets,Same 263 @18
2021-06-02 13:58:19,wallstreetbets,"It’s okay, I bought 50 shares at $15 in Jan and sold them at a 55% loss two weeks later"

2021-06-02 14:14:58,wallstreetbets,I made 7 times my profit. I should have flipped that stimmy
2021-06-02 14:15:20,wallstreetbets,I'll do it for you. My case is much much worse. Add 2 zeros and I still had more.🤯
2021-06-02 14:18:07,wallstreetbets,I sold at 16. I bought initially at 14 and it dipped so I waited to at least break even lol

&#x200B;

Does your face hurt?"
2021-06-02 14:27:49,wallstreetbets,How’s this one: I had amc pre-Covid. Sold at $3 when I realized this wasn’t a flu that was going to go away and I should take my loss and go. Bought back in a few weeks ago on a bunch because “mOvIe ThEaTeRs ArE oPeNiNg BrO” at like $10. Sold at $16 thinking “I’m about to lose money this is too good right now”. And here I sit staring at $65 on my watch list at work crying into my coffee cup.
2021-06-02 14:27:49,wallstreetbets,My stoploss was at 25.  Kept going up so raised it to 25.50.  It hit the .50 and sold and I missed out on 8k

2021-06-02 14:37:09,wallstreetbets,this is why the move is to sell half your shares and let the rest ride.
2021-06-02 14:41:08,wallstreetbets,I sold them at ca 6$ I think. At least I’m still diamond handing GME...
2021-06-02 14:42:18,wallstreetbets,I had 20ish shares for like 6 months that constantly fluctuated and I was like “ok I’ll just get rid of them when they break even (13$).” I do truly want to kill myself

2021-06-02 13:53:14,wallstreetbets,"OG residents here care about gains, not so much about fighting corruption. GME was shut out for a while too after the Jan dip"

2021-06-02 13:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I don't have a crystal ball (which is obvious as I sold my AMC position when it hit 30) but selling apple just before a WDC is not exactly a sound financial decision. But, again, what the fuck would I know?"

2021-06-02 15:09:39,wallstreetbets,I've read in a few places that you should sell when you are up 20% or more on a short term gain so that wasn't a bad move really. But meme stocks are different...

2021-06-02 14:23:07,wallstreetbets,Selling before the peak makes you a full retard unless you sold for a life changing amount of money.
2021-06-02 14:25:49,wallstreetbets,I did worse. Sold at 17. The pain is real.
2021-06-02 13:00:24,wallstreetbets,We call this the monkey barrel gang!  Cuz there always a few that falls off on the  way to the top.  Im a paper handed bitch too its okay.
2021-06-02 13:18:38,wallstreetbets,"I did this with gme.
Sold 70 shares at $90 after buying in at $30 and invested in penny stocks that all crashed. Then gme jumped. I give up."
2021-06-02 13:15:25,wallstreetbets,This makes me feel better
2021-06-02 13:16:22,wallstreetbets,$67 now
2021-06-02 13:17:49,wallstreetbets,Don't look now then...

2021-06-02 13:57:16,wallstreetbets,Are your hands better yet?
2021-06-02 13:58:41,wallstreetbets,I sold 35 dollars covered calls on mine yesterday thinking I was good for this week. They expire Friday but I’ve basically ducked myself
2021-06-02 14:00:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you brother. I bought yesterday at 30. Now my losses from the week are wiped clean and I'm in the green again.
2021-06-02 14:12:17,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $16 a share back in Jan, have held this whole time... do I keep holding? I need your wisdom 
u/ignore_my_typo"
2021-06-02 14:12:52,wallstreetbets,i'll do YOU all one better!  WHY IS GAMORA
2021-06-02 14:13:23,wallstreetbets,This is why I only sell 1/2 my shares now. Lesson learned from NIO.
2021-06-02 14:23:54,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-02 14:56:43,wallstreetbets,I sold at $13 cause I thought no way it would keep going up
2021-06-02 15:23:00,wallstreetbets,Literally same
2021-06-02 18:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m like you. I have been holding since the stock was 10 bucks. I sold yesterday at 30. I got mad that the CEO issues 8 million new stocks and sold out of anger. 

I’m having a few regrets today! At least I still made some cash."
2021-06-02 18:31:02,wallstreetbets,Dammit me too!!! I keep shitting on myself and use paper hands to wipe

2021-06-02 14:16:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad I'm not the only one at just 10 shares. (In @ like $9) Woulda been nice to invest more back when it was super low, but I ain't sellin' yet."

2021-06-02 12:42:06,wallstreetbets,So when can I sell cause im getting excited been sitting on these shares for months
2021-06-02 12:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Just sold at 50 profits are profits, holding 1 share tough haha"
2021-06-02 13:33:27,wallstreetbets,"it's already there despite a few circuit breaks, amazing volatility explosion"
2021-06-02 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,I didn’t sell. Mainly because I was too lazy to figure out where to put the money. Laziness pays off folks.
2021-06-02 13:28:55,wallstreetbets,Just sold my $10 share for $68. I’m paper hands but that rate of return was worth it for me.
2021-06-02 13:08:03,wallstreetbets,"I actually don’t mind the paper hands rn, I could use another dip"
2021-06-02 13:16:13,wallstreetbets,you were saying?

2021-06-02 14:28:42,wallstreetbets,Fuck you and everyone else in this sub who sold mvis for a quick buck. AMC is a shit company and a pump and dump scheme. Fuck off with this dIaMoNd hAnDs shit if you can’t hold anything other than amc and gme.

2021-06-02 14:19:20,wallstreetbets,I always buy at least 2 options now.  I'll sell one if timing is right if it covers the cost of both options plus a little momentum... and keep the other for the god damned 🌕🌕🌕🌕!
2021-06-02 14:05:48,wallstreetbets,Sold June 18 $25 calls.....FML
2021-06-02 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,Roll your calls when it is still climbing! I can’t believe how many are saying they sold already.
2021-06-02 13:06:35,wallstreetbets,You’ll just sell and miss out again it’s a mentality
2021-06-02 13:06:18,wallstreetbets,It won't lol. Buy Cardano.

2021-06-02 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,BB is my next AMC 🧨
2021-06-02 16:55:04,wallstreetbets,Same. I bought one GME at 300 to say I had it. The rest went to AMC and now some BB as well. Apes stronk together 🦍 🚀 🌕

2021-06-02 16:17:36,wallstreetbets,Don't ask me i am just watching with popcorn from the side
2021-06-02 17:12:34,wallstreetbets,Sir ..  stonks only goes up

2021-06-02 15:42:00,wallstreetbets,"Lol looks very different during the day, only use to it at night. Will say, one of the best views of the strip at Drais"
2021-06-02 14:27:09,wallstreetbets,So what happens? You walk up and buy a ticket and have the best day ever? Or invites or what? I want to be there.
2021-06-02 12:18:30,wallstreetbets,It’s actually Drai’s rooftop beach club in Vegas
2021-06-02 12:12:58,wallstreetbets,Smooth brain headquarters.
2021-06-02 13:59:09,wallstreetbets,i had notes from 2/3/21 about the about the SI (from finviz) of AMC and GME. AMC has a SI of 44% and GME has a 122%. if AMC can explode this much with a SI of 44% imagine GME
2021-06-02 13:44:02,wallstreetbets,AMC has proven to be a great way to pull apes away from GME. Buy. Hold. Vote. everything else is a distraction.
2021-06-02 13:36:08,wallstreetbets,I was one of them!
2021-06-02 14:35:58,wallstreetbets,"NGL GME kinda ruined this sub. Every post is about holding GME, DFV and the squeeze. I miss when retards would pick random ass stocks and yolo their life savings into it. I'd then take these stocks and bet a casino level amount of money (500) on these stocks and lose it because I was only slightly retarded.

Yes I have a $7 cost average on AMC and am holding for over 700% gains but the sub just isn't as fun anymore"
2021-06-02 15:22:22,wallstreetbets,I still rather buy GME than bail out China AMC
2021-06-02 15:21:08,wallstreetbets,"In this sub???  Bullshit.

This place has been gargling AMC balls for at least the past 3 weeks."
2021-06-02 14:52:13,wallstreetbets,Obviously not much considering your AMC exit
2021-06-02 13:43:43,wallstreetbets,Does Apple usually go up after WWDC?
2021-06-02 14:31:51,wallstreetbets,AMC looks like it will at least double just today - what will Apple do in one day ( or even one week/month) post WDC?
2021-06-02 15:12:19,wallstreetbets,You're a paperhand bitch but you still made 400% profit so swing that dick with swag
2021-06-02 13:30:31,wallstreetbets,😂😂paperhand aka a mudrick
2021-06-02 15:38:00,wallstreetbets,When was it 2$?
2021-06-02 14:27:14,wallstreetbets,I like the way you think.
2021-06-02 13:30:23,wallstreetbets,new to this shit... can you explain why is it hodl and not hold?
2021-06-02 17:28:25,wallstreetbets,"I've read loads of DD on GME and are commited. Have no idea about AMC, and now I dunno what to do about it haha"
2021-06-02 15:27:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it was amc back when it’s was $3😂
2021-06-02 13:12:20,wallstreetbets,Bonk

2021-06-02 11:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Tits down, ass up."
2021-06-02 12:06:43,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah it can go butt ballistic too 😂
2021-06-02 12:32:35,wallstreetbets,"I am on the AMC ape train, but threw in some extra bananas for you BB apes"
2021-06-02 14:03:06,wallstreetbets,"BB is looking good tho. Folks in AMC (me included) are riding a razors edge right now. There have been 4 halts today so far, 2 on the way up, and 2 of them on the downward."
2021-06-02 13:17:38,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with making money.
2021-06-02 14:22:18,wallstreetbets,"im seriously thinking about getting some BB calls, i feel like thats going to be the next one after AMC"
2021-06-02 14:06:26,wallstreetbets,"yup, but I'm greedy..."
2021-06-02 14:44:30,wallstreetbets,I needed to hear this so thank you lol
2021-06-02 14:47:00,wallstreetbets,"As long as you don't sell, you're one of us."
2021-06-02 15:44:28,wallstreetbets,Ahh you lucky bastard!
2021-06-02 12:41:06,wallstreetbets,That’s true.  Almost no one complains about vertical vids anymore.  We’ve officially flipped the script.  I mean I get it.  It’s a 5 second clip not a feature film.
2021-06-02 13:49:28,wallstreetbets,New rumor is that AMC is going to come out with a TikTok theater
2021-06-02 13:23:33,wallstreetbets,You're too nice. Call him a boomer fuck
2021-06-02 13:42:56,wallstreetbets,"LIFE HAPPENS HORIZONTALLY, NOT VERTICALLY"

2021-06-02 12:18:07,wallstreetbets,It’s $50 rn
2021-06-02 12:14:08,wallstreetbets,I said the same thing with $GME in January.
2021-06-02 12:18:39,wallstreetbets,I said the same at $24
2021-06-02 12:03:08,wallstreetbets,Not at 10 not at 20 not at 30…
2021-06-02 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,Why not get in at 40? It's about to hit 50.
2021-06-02 12:07:45,wallstreetbets,"You gotta jump in right in.. coz its not going down ..Its only rocketing. 🚀🚀🚀
Glad, I jumped in this morning.. had my orders set last night @37. Money is great but you know whats greater ???

2021-06-02 13:06:53,wallstreetbets,This didnt age well
2021-06-02 14:00:30,wallstreetbets,"U in yet ???? 
😂🤣😂"
2021-06-02 12:59:32,wallstreetbets,Mine is kicking himself for getting out of the market last fall lol
2021-06-02 14:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Sit on your fucking hands, buy the dips and sit back and just watch. I had a shit load of holdings from last year and I’m not selling, no matter what."
2021-06-02 15:25:32,wallstreetbets,Then $150 is the next target. 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-02 17:26:24,wallstreetbets,"$100 then $1k, then $10k!"
2021-06-02 13:30:14,wallstreetbets,That's OK. I averaged up over 31.00 from my original average of 8.08.
2021-06-02 14:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Was in @14, bought more yesterday @33. To the moon!"
2021-06-02 13:01:43,wallstreetbets,I bought 250 more at 45.00 and I am not regretting it.
2021-06-02 14:17:08,wallstreetbets,"This is the attitude that keeps you down, regardless of financial success."

2021-06-02 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,I got pretty cringe for me when the girl who was a relative whale (size wise) decided to start twerking in front of 6 pristine barbie dolls like she could distract me from them with her slightly-too-fat-ass.
2021-06-02 12:38:26,wallstreetbets,"Short attacks and trading halts can stop momentum, but if enough of us hodl or buy more, the shorts have to cover eventually, so nothing is stopping the rocket. They just might slow it down."
2021-06-02 12:11:24,wallstreetbets,wsb is completely sold out. so sad
2021-06-02 13:09:50,wallstreetbets,Because it's more than a 5% rise. It always halts trading on +- 5%.
2021-06-02 12:36:56,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-02 15:07:26,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣
2021-06-02 11:03:30,wallstreetbets,This the way 🚀. I’m here for it 😉
2021-06-02 13:24:46,wallstreetbets,"Oh Yeah, for sure. I was just  talking about the ones were they pulled out when it only went up a couple of bucks."
2021-06-02 13:54:31,wallstreetbets,I would make more than $200 if I sold right this moment though so is this as high as it will go and everyone should sell or will it still go up?
2021-06-02 13:05:08,wallstreetbets,Thatll do pig  that'll do
2021-06-02 11:57:49,wallstreetbets,Fuck. I need to make those gains do I can clap cheeks like that chick at the bottom right
2021-06-02 13:39:35,wallstreetbets,7.70
2021-06-02 15:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I started to get to that point as well and after a while the mindset just changed to “ok if I can get my money back I’ll be happy.” A few weeks later it just barely spiked above my buy in price, and I took it. I didn’t have enough in it to get dummy rich anyway, but another grand or 2 in my bank account would’ve been nice to see. Still, I’m glad for everyone who got their nuggeys."
2021-06-02 14:09:09,wallstreetbets,It does matter. You need to know what you're doing. Maybe I'll invest when it becomes commonplace to go to the theater again.
2021-06-02 13:59:56,wallstreetbets,"I stand corrected. They narrowly escaped bankruptcy during the pandemic. We should be investing not.just on stocks we like, but on fundamentals as well."
2021-06-02 14:00:15,wallstreetbets,"So yes, they were doing pretty shitty."
2021-06-02 14:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm not scared of money. I just don't see the point of throwing my life savings into 1 or 2 stocks, especially those that are currently suffering. Gotta look at the fundamentals."

2021-06-02 15:02:03,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahahahahaha, I'm his boss and it's true"
2021-06-02 14:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Serious, I hope he at least got off on that FOMO. Why you no take own advice?"
2021-06-02 14:48:18,wallstreetbets,touché
2021-06-02 13:57:30,wallstreetbets,No I jokingly asked for a little kick back but that’s when he laughed.
2021-06-02 14:05:08,wallstreetbets,Almost bought today at $34.  Shoot me now.
2021-06-02 15:00:20,wallstreetbets,Good decision imo. Could have gone either way.
2021-06-02 14:40:38,wallstreetbets,In @ 9 still holding. 🚀
2021-06-02 19:38:27,wallstreetbets,In at 16 out at 33. The volume was too high and I was happy for 24 hours.
2021-06-02 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,"In at $9, out at $13. 300 Shares, I thought I did well... My sister bought it at $13 and I thought she was crazy."
2021-06-02 17:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Why not sell half the position at $20, so that the rest is gravy?"
2021-06-02 14:32:01,wallstreetbets,only... wait a couple hours more...
2021-06-02 13:50:06,wallstreetbets,Some ppl pay extra for dick punches
2021-06-02 13:28:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know. Got to start thinking in terms of profits instead of what it could have been."
2021-06-02 15:08:17,wallstreetbets,I’m glad someone is making some cash! Good luck
2021-06-02 13:30:38,wallstreetbets,My PP IS ERECT!!!
2021-06-02 13:24:21,wallstreetbets,$150 is desirable..
2021-06-02 13:41:12,wallstreetbets,Better over $100 just stay strong hold it 💪
2021-06-02 13:49:25,wallstreetbets,Even more special brained.
2021-06-02 13:37:55,wallstreetbets,$69 DUDE!!!!
2021-06-02 13:35:29,wallstreetbets,I sold at 38. I’m pissed
2021-06-02 14:19:39,wallstreetbets,It's at 65 right now and still climbing 😂
2021-06-02 13:01:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m better than all of you, I sold 27 shares at $6......"
2021-06-02 14:29:51,wallstreetbets,This is what I keep saying to myself after selling at 52.

2021-06-02 14:16:37,wallstreetbets,I sold at 40... bought more at 42... finger hovered at $70.... and holding at 64... dunno what I'm waiting for... oh yeah... 🌕🌕🌕
2021-06-02 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,I usually sell at dips when I panic but this time I'm riding it since I already lost on a $9k crypto rug-pull.  Ass can't get any more sore
2021-06-02 15:22:27,wallstreetbets,So true! At least you made a profit and didn’t lose any

2021-06-02 12:52:15,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands till the shorts cover! Which who knows when that'll be... not today though
2021-06-02 13:08:57,wallstreetbets,I’m not selling a single share til I see the squeeze happen. I will not profit off other retailers. I want that hedgie money.
2021-06-02 12:53:20,wallstreetbets,Sell 30% of it let the rest ride if you want ! Profit the key but I could hit a 100 it or not

2021-06-02 19:35:46,wallstreetbets,Because if I’m wrong I lose everything I have.  I’d have to pay a huge debit to roll my calls up. I have a very small portfolio and unfortunately I can’t risk it.  The move AMC has had is already insane I can’t count on it to keep going lol.
2021-06-02 13:08:57,wallstreetbets,Lmfao. I just gotta stick to my goal of the return I want to see :)

I would have a realistic expectation that 80-100/share is the max and be excited you’ve turned 24 into over 200 currently."
2021-06-02 14:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, when I see a company poised to corner the market who were struggling but got a huge multi billion dollar influx of cash eliminating the threat of bankruptcy I jumped in.

For me it’s fundamental to make money. Hence why I’ve doubld my money…today alone…"

2021-06-02 15:04:22,wallstreetbets,I sold at 28 but bought back at 30 (option) because I didn't want to risk saying I should have stayed in

2021-06-02 14:25:28,wallstreetbets,It's not a belief. It's a fact that they got hit hard during the pandemic. They had estimated time frames on how much time they had thought they had left before declaring bankruptcy. What is wrong with doing due diligence before investing in a stock? You know I wish people would invest as wildy in ESG companies as they did with these companies.

In situations where normal Strategies based on fundamentals can be applied you have to be in a normal situation. Individual investors own 100% of the company… and then there are institutions. So it’s definitely not conservative or safe investing. But I turned 800 to 10000 after holding based on my understanding due to my research. Obviously I spent an unnecessary amount of time reading, and I couldn’t even begin to explain in a small response.

2021-06-02 17:02:09,wallstreetbets,"That's probably not a bad play. People on this subreddit love to jack off to ""never sell GME, diamond hands"" memes but your growth potential on BB would be much higher. GME won't last forever."
2021-06-02 16:45:14,wallstreetbets,This is not the way.

2021-06-02 10:56:46,wallstreetbets,Ok hold my brain I'm In!
2021-06-02 15:29:26,wallstreetbets,"Who is the boss then, hein"
2021-06-02 17:36:20,wallstreetbets,Down 20%? Down 90% or up >100% only.
2021-06-02 15:20:01,wallstreetbets,I agree. BB has positive cash flow and will only get better.
2021-06-02 15:54:05,wallstreetbets,That's why God invented trailing stop loss. I already have profit locked and can only go up. I'm fine with not taking 100% of the unrealized gains. Once it triggers again I'll be out and roll it into other stocks.
2021-06-02 13:20:51,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-02 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, you look fucking dumb right now. What did you sell at? $29?

Hold my fucking balls."

2021-06-02 17:39:08,wallstreetbets,"If you read it, I am down 20 percent. The gain was today prior to posting, however, my overall unrealized loss is the 20 percent."
2021-06-02 17:40:03,wallstreetbets,Obviously not now thanks to all you good folks.
2021-06-02 19:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC at $16.40 and sat so long I. The red that I sold when it hit $18.50.  I also have BB at $21.95 and will likely do the same if it ever hits that price.

I didn’t buy much as this is all new due to the hype trains I jumped in on for GME but have learned a lot.  Mostly that I am far too late if these damn things."
2021-06-02 14:04:48,wallstreetbets,"Sold at $34 and rolled $100k into $14 bb calls. 
Who’s fucking dumb?"
2021-06-02 17:40:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah 20% is normal. It needs to be a loss, or a huge gain. Or else it’s just part of the other BB spam that showed up today."
2021-06-02 14:07:40,wallstreetbets,"You, stupid. It's $62 since I said it wasn't done and touched $70. Damn, you're fucking dumb."
2021-06-02 17:41:21,wallstreetbets,I can send another snapshot now. I am no spammer.
2021-06-02 14:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh you can’t do math, poor thing. Welcome to stocks and good luck"
2021-06-02 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Doing great without you, thanks. When my trailing stop is $20 more than you sold for I think I made the right choice. I'll improve my position in BB when AMC is actually done. Good luck."

2021-06-02 19:22:52,wallstreetbets,"If I'm toxic, what do you call a condescending twat who doubles down even when they're wrong. I said AMC wasn't done yet at $36. I was right. I wasn't even shitting on him. He basically told me to hold bags. He can eat shit for all I care."
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I converted Burry's book recommendation ""Dying Of Money"" into a audiobook.  Did my best adjusting the voice. I found this book very informative. Hope it helps those autist's who have trouble reading like me. GUH!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&t=5318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&t=5318s)

 

The cover motif is a piece of old German money. It is a Reichsbanknote issued on August 22, 1923 for one hundred million marks. Nine years earlier, that many marks would have been about 5 percent of all the German marks in the world, worth 23 million American dollars. On the day it was issued, it was worth about twenty dollars. Three months later, it was worth only a few thousandths of an American cent. The process by which this occurs is known as inflation.  


A few years before, in 1920 and 1921, Germany had enjoyed a remarkable prosperity envied by the rest of the world. Prices were steady, business was humming, everyone was working, the stock market was skyrocketing. The Germans were swimming in easy money. Within the year, they were drowning in it. Until it was all over, no one seemed to notice any connection between the earlier false boom and the later inflationary bust.  


In this book, Jens O. Parsson performs the neat trick of transforming the dry economic subject of inflation into a white-knuckles kind of blood-chiller. He begins with a freewheeling account of the spectacular inflation that all but destroyed Germany in 1923, taking it apart to find out both what made it tick and what made it finally end. He goes on to look at the American inflation that was steadily gaining force after 1962. In terms clear and fascinating enough for any layman, but with technical validity enough for any economist, he applies the lessons gleaned from the German inflation to find that too much about the American inflation was the same, lacking only the inexorable further deterioration that time would bring. The book concludes by charting out all the possible future prognoses for the American inflation, none easy but some much less catastrophic than others.  


Mr. Parsson brings much new light to bear on this subject. He lays on the line in tough, spare language exactly how and why the American inflation was caused, exactly who was responsible for causing it, exactly who unjustly benefited and who suffered from the inflation, exactly why the government could not permit the inflation to stop or even to cease growing worse, exactly who was going to pay the ultimate price, and exactly what would have to be done to avert the ultimate conclusion.  


This book packs a wallop. It is not for the timid, and it spares no tender sensibilities. The conclusions it reaches are shocking and are bound to provoke endless dispute. If they proved to approximate even remotely the correct analysis of the American inflation, hardly any American citizen could escape being the prey of inflation and no one could afford not to know where the inflation was taking him. In the economic daily lives of everyone, nothing will be the same after this book as it was before."
2021-06-02 11:02:53,wallstreetbets,"I hope Jens is a Communist, since isn’t this a copyright violation?"
2021-06-02 12:18:19,wallstreetbets,Check your “watch later” list
2021-06-02 10:41:12,wallstreetbets,Fuck him
2021-06-02 11:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, I found the full PDF of the book free to view after a quick google search.  Also, only 1,000 copies of this book were actually printed."
2021-06-02 11:47:11,wallstreetbets,Jens Parsson is a pseudonym for Ronald H. Marcks.  Good chance of him being a communist with a last name like that.

It is doing more than anyone to clean up  environmental impact and the CEO is a pro-worker as he knows paying  people better keeps turnover and retraining costs down.

But I didn't sell it all!  Managed to keep $5k @ 16.50.  Better than on the original run.  Let's see if bb can top its $28 original run price now!

The key is when to sell, before it tanks back to $10, because it absolutely will"

Now we know that not all short gets squeeze, Shorting is a good way to bankrupt bad companies. But It's twinkies, my nephew has diabetes and eats it everyday still.

Company Hostess Brands revenues Increased by 15 and 18% the last two quarters
EPS estimates are higher for next two years (seriously...people really eat this huh)

The weekly chart shows breakout past multi year resistance above $15

And recently it just climbed above 16. The stock is clearly on an UPTREND. And all these institution shorts are NOT making money at all and they're being greedy because:

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twnk/institutional-holdings 

If you look at this, Institutional Ownership	116.39 %
AND they're still adding more to their short positions!

Once again, more than 100% of the stocks are being hold hostage.

2021-06-02 15:51:59,wallstreetbets,I'm in. First timer here. Been lurking til now. Let's do this thing.
2021-06-02 16:01:19,wallstreetbets,Would it be wise to buy tomorrow when the markets open
2021-06-02 16:19:30,wallstreetbets,"BB is going to 130.  Some real DD here guys, so listen up.  Here's my thinking:  BB is a terrible company, but it is only half as terrible as AMC.  BB doesn't make any profits, but the balance sheet is clean, and it has some potential in its patent portfolio and future cybersecurity and IoT business segments.  Will probably get clobbered by real companies like GOOG, but still, there's a story, and potential.  

AMC, on the other hand, is a borderline bankrupt company with a business model that didn't even look good in 2019.  Balance sheet is bad and they have massively diluted.  Anyone with money put a theater in their own house last year; no one needs to worry about parking and show times anymore.  But hey, AMC is $65 AH!  

So:  AMC = 65.  65/.5 = 130.  Q.E.D., BB to 130.  Ask your wife's boyfriend for your allowance now, before it's too late."
2021-06-02 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,Sold my AMC to dump into BB LESSSGOOOOO

2021-06-02 15:36:50,wallstreetbets,"Please do what you do wsb and send this to the 🌝. I don’t hold as much as many of you do, but this would really help with my sons hospital bills for leukemia treatment since I missed out on GME and AMC. Do what you do apes!"
2021-06-02 10:19:47,wallstreetbets,Why??
2021-06-02 11:47:45,wallstreetbets,My average is at $23 so now I'm only -42% down which is nice
2021-06-02 12:55:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm starting small and don't have too much skin in the game, but I picked up a few shares at $12.87 this morning. I'm hoping to ride the wave. I missed the boat on AMC, but my brother is profiting nicely on his AMC investment."
2021-06-02 15:12:21,wallstreetbets,I think it's funny that all these sideshow stocks are being pumped on wsb but you can't even mention gme
2021-06-02 17:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Really limited after hours movement. Short position on BB was smaller than AMC, we have some work to do. 

Literally tapped out...no more cash to support the BB cause. Mortgage, kids, someone please pick up my slack."
2021-06-02 11:44:11,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, do you apes really like this stock, or are you just hopping on the bandwagon? What new, innovative, or even good things has blackberry done in the last... decade?"
2021-06-02 14:51:11,wallstreetbets,How does something like this have 700 upvotes? Also how did this sub go from actual investment talk to bottom of the barrel lemmings chanting the same thing over and over to re-affirm eachother?
2021-06-02 12:15:12,wallstreetbets,This is not the way. All these Distraction stocks
2021-06-02 13:12:50,wallstreetbets,"BB is like the retarded brother of amc, amc shoots 100% bb shoots 10% amc drops 20% bb drops to 0% 😂"

2021-06-02 14:19:11,wallstreetbets,"What is it that makes BB a more attractive short squeeze target than other stocks that are more highly shorted? Legit question, please don't downvote me too bad lol.  I have a little bit of money in BB, but looking at other shorted opportunities, I can't figure out why BB is more hype, especially since the short interest is relatively low compared to other targets that have been squeezed, like AMC."

2021-06-02 13:43:41,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been buying steadily … imma buy more today !!

2021-06-02 16:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing, if AMC got there why BB can't!"
2021-06-02 15:51:10,wallstreetbets,was BB ever shorted? i dont see why it would go that high like AMC or GME
2021-06-02 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,"I haven't been following BB for a while but my QT just said it was increasing the margin requirements to 65%, should I buy more today? do you apes believe it will continue to rise??"
2021-06-02 19:15:23,wallstreetbets,Never happens

2021-06-02 10:43:26,wallstreetbets,This is what I’m hoping for!
2021-06-02 11:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, with the way the business is setting itself up, I can see it reaching a much higher valuation than that. This is assuming their product in AWS is actually use and becomes the defacto solution for developers who work on IoT cars."
2021-06-02 13:03:25,wallstreetbets,Feeling Bullish... just bought 100 more.... LETTER RIP TATER CHIP!!!!
2021-06-02 11:28:11,wallstreetbets,Wow. I hope we'll see a repeat. 🤩

2021-06-02 13:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Let’s go! I even added a little NKLA, if I need a boost. Haha"

2021-06-02 14:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Better be, daddy wants that ps5"
2021-06-02 12:18:24,wallstreetbets,"I did as well! Well, I only had 5k, but that’s a lot to me lol."

2021-06-02 17:48:57,wallstreetbets,"If You are retarded, I am retarded as well, I’m doing the exact same thing."
2021-06-02 14:38:04,wallstreetbets,"dude same everytime i check my account it fills me with dread, and it's not stopping now, idk if I should put more in now or wait for another dip THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME IM SCARED"

2021-06-02 11:29:40,wallstreetbets,"I will not, BB is going to the moon!!!"
2021-06-02 12:14:26,wallstreetbets,It's on track to go way above that
2021-06-02 12:41:00,wallstreetbets,Hold!
2021-06-02 12:39:07,wallstreetbets,Just do what you feel comfortable with doing.
2021-06-02 11:41:54,wallstreetbets,I wish I have a contract I’m trying to print money off from
2021-06-02 15:19:41,wallstreetbets,Already there

2021-06-02 15:09:25,wallstreetbets,I wish. Maybe 20?
2021-06-02 11:16:44,wallstreetbets,Same! I felt like a forgotten child after the restrictions were lifted and it was all about gme and amc in this sub.
2021-06-02 11:42:29,wallstreetbets,Do it. Join me. Print money with me off our contracts!
2021-06-02 16:20:04,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my PLTR for BB 14c at open, up 110% at close"
2021-06-02 16:36:30,wallstreetbets,I bought the 15c last week. Up over 10x already lol
2021-06-02 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,Damn
2021-06-02 16:37:47,wallstreetbets,Im buying more bb tomorrow!
2021-06-02 17:13:50,wallstreetbets,"I made the same move today.

What will we buy when we sell our $BB?"
2021-06-02 16:30:11,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, do you not think amc will continue to rise? I’m debating on buying amc and later bb or just skip straight to bb"
2021-06-02 17:18:49,wallstreetbets,Right here with you with my 300 shares also :)
2021-06-02 18:01:29,wallstreetbets,I just did the same thing with my amc monies!

2021-06-02 12:40:17,wallstreetbets,It's never a loss until you sell
2021-06-02 14:53:57,wallstreetbets,I only bought 300 :(
2021-06-02 15:52:11,wallstreetbets,"yes , look at amc. BB can hit $40-$50"
2021-06-02 12:26:52,wallstreetbets,"A bunch of us are trying to pump it to 25 by eow next week.  No idea how high this will go this time, but BB was already undervalued. The long term future is bright for BB also as it partnered with Amazon to create a secure vehicle platform called Ivy. These vehicles are expected to start shipping in 2023."
2021-06-02 15:23:29,wallstreetbets,$60+ easy
2021-06-02 14:21:05,wallstreetbets,EOD baby
2021-06-02 19:42:52,wallstreetbets,I'm wondering too
2021-06-02 11:04:30,wallstreetbets,It's only fueling right now. Preboards are complete. Going to the fucking MOON.
2021-06-02 11:11:26,wallstreetbets,"I think you still have time to get in.  BB is lagging behind AMC mooning by about 2 days, this happened the last time also (jan 2020).  Problem is, they both tank the same day, so choose your exit wisely."
2021-06-02 10:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Now should be a fine time. Heck you even have time for AMC, that sucker is going to break 50"
2021-06-02 12:19:57,wallstreetbets,Pretty much.  That's why it's so weird but I'm not complaining.

2021-06-02 15:46:49,wallstreetbets,Did the exact same. Relax buddy. Next stop: the moon!
2021-06-02 15:53:29,wallstreetbets,"dont worry, it will hit $30-$40 easily.
AMC , i bought at $36 and it dropped all the way down to $25, and 2 days later (today), AMC hit $70.."

2021-06-02 11:32:19,wallstreetbets,Well I bought because my company decided to use the blackberry mobile client - with 80k employees
2021-06-02 15:10:35,wallstreetbets,"If AMC is at 60's, BB can go to at least 50 easily."
2021-06-02 19:47:40,wallstreetbets,"based on recent Technicals I believe $30-35, but if volume pushes up even higher tomorrow let's look at AMC and their marketcap compared to BB, think we easy can get BB ↑↑ leggooo"
2021-06-02 17:41:46,wallstreetbets,Every mountain begins with a single stone <3
2021-06-02 12:17:53,wallstreetbets,They don't let you transfer money out for 60 days citing money laundering so I have some stuff stuck there for a bit longer.
2021-06-02 12:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Both. Squeeze play and long term value.
The long term future is bright for BB as it partnered with Amazon to create a secure vehicle platform called Ivy. These vehicles are expected to start shipping in 2023."
2021-06-02 12:28:13,wallstreetbets,Qnx
2021-06-02 14:54:12,wallstreetbets,low price entry and fuck wall st thats why
2021-06-02 14:43:25,wallstreetbets,I think looking at Market Cap and the short schedule makes it attractive... Lets take this to the moon!!!!! check out some of videos on youtube on the short sale schedules so you can see.. legggooo
2021-06-02 14:53:37,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry is heavily shorted and earnings come out end of June. It's all about the short squeeze and forcing short sellers to cover by buying shares, forcing the price up higher."

2021-06-02 16:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Same,  also in nokia, which is nit a bas stock, nit a meme, and if it turns into a meme omg, so nokia not to the moon now,  but solid growth. It even we t up 4 procent, which is oeanuts, but i ll take that every day"

Edit: omg 29 apparently"
2021-06-02 13:18:09,wallstreetbets,I got sad I had paper hands and sold my 11 amc shares at 15 thinking it wouldn’t gain anymore. Realized I still have 7 amc shares on my sofi account I never sold

2021-06-02 16:43:28,wallstreetbets,I googled BB stock on my phone right at close and it showed me $18.10 (CAD) and I about freaked out.
2021-06-02 16:44:26,wallstreetbets,No but I now spell baby Bbby after today. My poor bf is getting “hey bbby!!!” On the regular
2021-06-02 19:21:59,wallstreetbets,Bed Bath and Beyond is also up 62% on the day... Sort of odd.
2021-06-02 13:55:18,wallstreetbets,So ELI5....is the case for BB as strong as it was for GME and AMC? I might say fuck it and throw some at it

2021-06-02 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah seems like it. So should I just sell as soon as I break even or is it expected to run to like $20? I don’t want to be too greedy and then end up bag holding like last time

2021-06-02 11:19:29,wallstreetbets,Lol are you me? Ive kept my bb the past few months as a reminder to never go full retard. I am honestly shocked the hype around bb is back. Hopefully it continues this trend so my portfolio doesnt look like a slaugtherhouse anymore..
2021-06-02 11:28:23,wallstreetbets,We got pushed into the closet in jan/feb
2021-06-02 11:04:41,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Hopefully we'll come pick you up soon!
2021-06-02 11:16:57,wallstreetbets,Try 60% in 12 minutes
2021-06-02 12:50:12,wallstreetbets,well i think you have to make an excursion to the crypto world to learn what loses and trauma means. Diamond hands will maybe form with enough pressure.
2021-06-02 13:01:22,wallstreetbets,"Nice, keep holding we got this!"
2021-06-02 16:33:38,wallstreetbets,Damn lol
2021-06-02 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,Right in the pussy?
2021-06-02 16:52:32,wallstreetbets,Yup. My comment is 6 hours old. I did not think we would see 30% today
2021-06-02 15:44:35,wallstreetbets,I am up 400 percent since last week ...
2021-06-02 15:26:17,wallstreetbets,I get my info from the Amazon blog on Blackberry tools they are integrating into AWS. That is why I invested. I don't pay much attention to the DD posted here.
2021-06-02 14:32:41,wallstreetbets,"OR, sister... but who's countin'? WE ALL APES... HEART YOU"
2021-06-02 12:54:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s amazing that for a moment BB was synonymous with smartphones in the mid to late 2000s with its own proprietary messaging system that like iMessage later served as a walled garden to attract people who wanted to use it to communicate with friends already on it…and totally bottled that head start by refusing to give in to the reality that touchscreen phones were going to take over physical keyboard smartphones.

I remember in college in that time iPhones had just come out and weren’t really more than iPod touches with phone abilities, and Blackberry was the cool new thing to have that was shown being used in shows like Entourage. BBM was like from the future and was “cooler” than texting was. 

Then within a year or two Apple and Android after it just totally displaced BB from the market."
2021-06-02 14:18:20,wallstreetbets,$AMC/$BB/$BBBY are all moving together.
2021-06-02 14:21:46,wallstreetbets,"Because some smooth brained, paper handed apes will sell their sick AMC gains and buy into BB, hoping for more sick gains, making the stock go to the moon.

That's what I hope will happen anyways"
2021-06-02 15:14:11,wallstreetbets,Paper handed bitch. This is climbing to 20 EOW i reckon
2021-06-02 17:50:12,wallstreetbets,just using a trailing stop loss
2021-06-02 13:14:47,wallstreetbets,"If you sold, then good for you, thats not what these retards are doing though"
2021-06-02 15:00:08,wallstreetbets,"Damn, wish I had 600-share money =) Good Fortune Find You!"
2021-06-02 14:54:20,wallstreetbets,"I literally can't even afford that many lmao, gotta start somewhere though"
2021-06-02 10:51:11,wallstreetbets,So what’s that?  About 75 cents?
2021-06-02 11:59:04,wallstreetbets,Gainz are gainz i started with 20 bucks a months ago and I'm up to 240. Any gains help
2021-06-02 10:51:37,wallstreetbets,Get those gainz and keep it rolling dude/ete!
2021-06-02 14:23:31,wallstreetbets,Ok ok. Sounds good I’m in.
2021-06-02 17:56:08,wallstreetbets,Classic
2021-06-02 12:38:53,wallstreetbets,Just buy any of the calls that are 2 to 3 months out... they will double in price daily.
2021-06-02 14:19:29,wallstreetbets,Yup I have a call for June 18 and bought one for Jan 2022. It’s gonna produce.
2021-06-02 17:33:24,wallstreetbets,It has gone up 2 bucks since I bought it. Why skip out on profit?
2021-06-02 12:35:12,wallstreetbets,"I really can't give you an answer to that, sorry.  You may want to break even or exit at $15 if you want to play it safe."
2021-06-02 15:06:48,wallstreetbets,"no, the amount of volume that needs to be purchased is not like 1k stocks.. go look at the short volumes we are talking 20MM.. BB to the moon legggooo!"
2021-06-02 17:47:43,wallstreetbets,At least you profited *some*.
2021-06-02 19:37:12,wallstreetbets,What's the point of paper handsing for a few hundred bucks? Investing with money you can't afford to lose?
2021-06-02 17:49:46,wallstreetbets,"I'll never understand selling in the red, unless some huge news comes out about the company and it starts to tank. At least wait long enough to break even.

Prepandemic, it was like $40 something I think, now that it's almost over, you didn't think it would ay least go above $17?

Not trying to put you down, just genuinely curious."
2021-06-02 13:30:12,wallstreetbets,"Listen, if AMC can be in the fucking mid-60s, BB can do at least $50."
2021-06-02 13:13:01,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I'm in 200 @ 8.55.  It would be good to see BB go since I sold my 200 AMC too early :(
2021-06-02 14:09:06,wallstreetbets,Is that actually possible for it to pass 50?
2021-06-02 19:16:44,wallstreetbets,Impossible
2021-06-02 11:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Anything is possible.

At this point it'd be a pattern, not a surprise. Meme stocks > traditional trading."
2021-06-02 13:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Don’t wish, just fucking HOLD!"
2021-06-02 10:58:04,wallstreetbets,"I also wish

If we wish hard enough together then it may be so"
2021-06-02 12:40:46,wallstreetbets,AMC is doing it. 34 to 62.
2021-06-02 12:02:25,wallstreetbets,Same. 1200+ shares here.
2021-06-02 13:09:15,wallstreetbets,I bought in late on all of em and for the first time ever Im seeing green and it's very confusing
2021-06-02 14:47:35,wallstreetbets,Lol hi I am also you
2021-06-02 15:54:56,wallstreetbets,This is also me. I would open up my account and see red as a reminder of what an idiot I was spending so much on meme stocks. Now I regret selling amc at 20 and am still holding bb
2021-06-02 13:07:15,wallstreetbets,Apes Stronger together
2021-06-02 16:53:20,wallstreetbets,Wild!! Nobody thought this would see 15 or 10 period!! Look at it now! Fly high baby bird! What do you think this could truly hit)
2021-06-02 14:43:06,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly right. They're almost behaving like an ETF. All three had a big drop at 1230 today, followed by a bounce."
2021-06-02 14:44:18,wallstreetbets,"That's what the smart dumb money is doing: liquidating AMC, buying big positions in BB and then writing covered calls at the end of the week."
2021-06-02 14:36:34,wallstreetbets,That’s what I just did
2021-06-02 15:14:28,wallstreetbets,yahooooooooooooooooooooo
2021-06-02 14:20:26,wallstreetbets,"I did, I unloadedmy stock with 300% profit. A lot of these guys will sell the next days as well. It’s kinda hard to say no to good money, when you know the boble might burst any day."
2021-06-02 14:20:49,wallstreetbets,Unloaded*
2021-06-02 10:52:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah 😂
2021-06-02 13:03:23,wallstreetbets,Okok
2021-06-02 15:27:26,wallstreetbets,as compared to the ones closer in they will do better? Or just less risk if it doesnt pop off quite yet?
2021-06-02 14:34:04,wallstreetbets,My Jan 2023 12C is looking good right now
2021-06-02 15:05:45,wallstreetbets,"Whats your strike?

What should I be targeting"
2021-06-02 15:07:50,wallstreetbets,"I did but I don't speak that language, hence this attempt at translation cuz real world learning disabilities are a real-world cunt that real world Apes do not understand"
2021-06-02 15:08:19,wallstreetbets,I see but I am illiterate therefore I cannot read images
2021-06-02 18:11:39,wallstreetbets,"some sell in the red to avoid a margin call, but I don't know if it's the case with him"
2021-06-02 17:51:39,wallstreetbets," we’re talking about three or four months ago. 

We had no idea how close to over it was."
2021-06-02 13:45:54,wallstreetbets,"Is there any short pressure on BB? Honestly I bought a while back cause it cause it looks like a solid company, and I think it’ll get to 30 at least, but I think it’ll take a lot longer if there isn’t short interest like with AMC"
2021-06-02 18:16:09,wallstreetbets,There is massive short interest in 15c eow
2021-06-02 17:33:28,wallstreetbets,"BB is up because amc is moving, don't get it twisted"
2021-06-02 13:30:51,wallstreetbets,"I sold 1200 amc at 16 back in feb, and should have rebought when it dropped. My heart hurts today."
2021-06-02 14:04:45,wallstreetbets,"My $11 call got assigned on May 21st, literally the day before the rocket took off."
2021-06-02 16:09:46,wallstreetbets,Exact same situation as you. Sold my AMC early and I am missing the squeeze and got 200 @ 8.61. What a shame.
2021-06-02 13:38:18,wallstreetbets,I'm sitting on 200 of AMC and its only like 1100 bucks rn
2021-06-02 14:19:13,wallstreetbets,$AMC $100 tomorrow
2021-06-02 14:34:33,wallstreetbets,You can only blame yourself if you're omnipotent
2021-06-02 17:30:51,wallstreetbets,me too ...
2021-06-02 14:17:08,wallstreetbets,Hell yes Brother. Hold strong!
2021-06-02 19:37:02,wallstreetbets,Short in then....
2021-06-02 13:10:37,wallstreetbets,I was the 69th vote. It's a sign. Maybe when amc hits 100 I'll sell and invest it all in bb
2021-06-02 12:52:39,wallstreetbets,"So far it's been working for me. Invested 300 dollars based off some bullshit. Lost 80 bucks, then rebounded 80 investing in BB after selling off clov."
2021-06-02 11:33:20,wallstreetbets,we just need to wish upon a star
2021-06-02 13:17:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean, look at the movie gang"
2021-06-02 13:19:11,wallstreetbets,No need to wish m8. It's coming.
2021-06-02 14:21:01,wallstreetbets,"Ya amc took off!  I'm buying more bb though, cuz its still early"
2021-06-02 14:22:15,wallstreetbets,"Ya amc took off!  I'm buying more bb though, cuz its still early"
2021-06-02 13:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Same here, accumulating a bit everyday, BB the next GME or AMC, at least based on WSB stats"
2021-06-02 15:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that sell out was massive, and they seem stepped."
2021-06-02 18:33:15,wallstreetbets,Where can i buy this $Reddit ETF?
2021-06-02 14:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Good shit my man, up to 15.59 because of your efforts!"
2021-06-02 11:32:59,wallstreetbets,75 cents more than you had yesterday
2021-06-02 15:31:49,wallstreetbets,I always buy the out of money calls like $40-$50 on BB
2021-06-02 14:37:16,wallstreetbets,Hell yes!!! Congrats on your ATM you’re going to start printing $100s
2021-06-02 15:15:45,wallstreetbets,I bought an $11 call for 6/18 I think the break even price was 14.10!
2021-06-02 15:27:32,wallstreetbets,"If I were you I would buy one for a few months out, just so you can profit off it. I haven’t checked yet because I’m working, but after the insane movement of the stock I bet the contracts are really expensive. I would stick around the $18-20 call area because it likely will hit that in next week and you’ll profit heavily off it if it continues growing. *~this is not financial advice~*"
2021-06-02 15:14:05,wallstreetbets,"If a stock is shorted at $10, but the price goes above that, the people shorting it are forced to buy the stock at the current price. This in turn means that they are buying stocks at the current price, which in turn raises the stock price because of the demand. By overloading into the stock, you force people who are suppressing the price to buy it. This is what's happening with Gamestop and AMC."
2021-06-02 15:09:56,wallstreetbets,"all gravy, go check out some videos on BB stock on YT so you can see yourself, look at the resistance levels in pricing and also the short sellers positions and when they expire.. LEGGOO BB, lets ride to the moon!"
2021-06-02 17:06:14,wallstreetbets,"as of 5/28/21 alone there was 25,251,671 in Short Volume with a Short Volume Ratio of 21.72 (# of days for short seller to cover their position).... BB to the MOON! along with Technicals!!!"
2021-06-02 15:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Lol, it looks like a solid company? STONKS"
2021-06-02 14:17:56,wallstreetbets,There are about 50 million shares sold short
2021-06-02 17:53:19,wallstreetbets,BB is probably decent short term but much better long term.
2021-06-02 16:21:54,wallstreetbets,"I believe there is some short on BB, but not enough and definitely not nearly enough retail diamond hands for shorting to be a factor like it is for AMC and GME.

Hold BB in the old fashion way, with the old fashion expectations"
2021-06-02 16:56:40,wallstreetbets,"It is a solid company with a good future, but like the other meme stocks it doesn’t justify these prices. It certainly deserves this price more than AMC or GME based on fundamentals though."
2021-06-02 18:29:27,wallstreetbets,That was true up to 1:30 this afternoon. $BB broke away from $AMC trendline right then. Take a look at the 1 day comparison of the two.
2021-06-02 13:35:14,wallstreetbets,"Sold last week when I was up 20%, I'm very unhappy"
2021-06-02 15:01:28,wallstreetbets,You can't think like that. A gain is a gain
2021-06-02 14:52:49,wallstreetbets,Sameeee sold 361 $11 shares at $15 and now want to walk into some quicksand
2021-06-02 13:52:06,wallstreetbets,this is crazy! Hold strong
2021-06-02 16:14:10,wallstreetbets,You were told to hold.   What happened?
2021-06-02 17:26:28,wallstreetbets,1121 at 14 here I feel your pain
2021-06-02 14:24:38,wallstreetbets,"AMC going to 100k, you can still buy"
2021-06-02 15:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I just sold some weekly BB options (for profit) when it started dipping. Should have held. I still have shares and some longer dated options though. My head hurts as well. It still won't quite enough to pay off my debt, BIDEN."
2021-06-02 13:46:04,wallstreetbets,"??? AMC hit a $72 high just now.  you're at $14,000 mate."
2021-06-02 17:32:58,wallstreetbets,CLOV sux
2021-06-02 13:31:19,wallstreetbets,Nothing is the next GME.
2021-06-02 15:21:24,wallstreetbets,I only bought 10 AMC but secured myself 70 BB. Wouldn't mind BB doing decent.
2021-06-02 18:09:27,wallstreetbets,Hahaha were all in this together!
2021-06-02 15:16:49,wallstreetbets,Nice nice
2021-06-02 15:54:35,wallstreetbets,"See, im worried because I don't know my next move from here and I'm struggling money wise. Lol. Too much debt, not enough saved. Sure, I got 330 on ribinhood right now in stocks. So im thinking, do I sell and do a single 20 dollar call in bb, or keep what I have in BB and sell when it soars"
2021-06-02 15:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Im sorry im a noob, is that a lot? In comparison to say AMC or GME"
2021-06-02 15:10:41,wallstreetbets,Dang you guys are brave for admitting on wsb that you sold AMC before it hit 100k a share lol.
2021-06-02 13:42:27,wallstreetbets,Exact same boat I'm in.... Fuck
2021-06-02 15:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Bought at $9.96, sold at $19.50, still basically doubled my money but feels bad man."
2021-06-02 15:29:14,wallstreetbets,Lol gainz are gainz - I sold up 50% last Friday and what are you gonna do?
2021-06-02 15:47:52,wallstreetbets,"I sold early last week on Tuesday, locking in a solid 50 percent loss, lol. Then well ... you see what it is today. That same set of contracts would have worth 35k easily at this point, lol"
2021-06-02 15:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Exact same!! But no regrets with AMC, at least we got some profits! Definitely not going to make the same mistake with BB though - this time we all should HODL!!! 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-02 16:23:00,wallstreetbets,"I hadn’t even seen wsb at that point. I bought at about $2 in 2020 and at 8x, it seemed irresponsible to not take profit with as volatile as it was, and they I didn’t have access to my phone during work hours at that time.

If I had been on here, I would have probably done differently."
2021-06-02 15:01:43,wallstreetbets,No it's not
2021-06-02 16:47:27,wallstreetbets,9% enough for a small squeeze.
2021-06-02 16:35:50,wallstreetbets,Looking at the Google it looks like the float is 510.85 million.
2021-06-02 13:47:12,wallstreetbets,I’m in ALL the boats. I looked at AMC when it was at 13 and did nothing. Now it’s at 60 fml
2021-06-02 16:34:11,wallstreetbets,"And I'm here crying over part of AMC I sold at 44.69 to reinvest it in BB 😅, let me clear the tears with 💵🤡"
2021-06-02 15:03:32,wallstreetbets,Whatever you say month old account.
2021-06-02 18:15:37,wallstreetbets,So we shouldnt be expecting as much pop as AMC you would say?
2021-06-02 15:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I've been in the market for over a decade and Reddit for half that, but sure, keep telling yourself a movie company stock is going to hit 100 grand. You're an idiot."
2021-06-02 15:20:40,wallstreetbets,No it's not
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Ape don’t know sell button 
2021-06-02 10:07:32,wallstreetbets,At least you found the volume button

2021-06-02 09:58:45,wallstreetbets,Damn son. Options scare and confuse me

Edit: NOW IN PROFIT! ~~LETS GET TO 50 BY FRIDAY~~
 
Edit II: LETS GET TO 100 BY FRIDAY"
2021-06-02 10:24:08,wallstreetbets,Sell half exercise the other half
2021-06-02 10:51:50,wallstreetbets,BB to 20 today
2021-06-02 10:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Be real ape, exercise them and drive the price up further"
2021-06-02 10:18:48,wallstreetbets,Grond will breach it...
2021-06-02 11:01:26,wallstreetbets,You know the volume button tho
2021-06-02 13:33:53,wallstreetbets,Why are people still using Robinhood? They need to be canceled for sucking the hedge funds during the gme saga
2021-06-02 10:23:30,wallstreetbets,Buy some damn stocks ya ass
2021-06-02 11:20:59,wallstreetbets,Why the FUCK does everyone have Robinhood!!!

2021-06-02 11:35:03,wallstreetbets,You guys have a sell button?
2021-06-02 11:45:09,wallstreetbets,"Wait, is there a sell button???"
2021-06-02 11:50:59,wallstreetbets,Congrats and 🖕

2021-06-02 19:10:57,wallstreetbets,Ey. Update.
2021-06-02 10:49:06,wallstreetbets,YouTube Projectfinance. He explains how options work.
2021-06-02 09:59:47,wallstreetbets,\+1 We need some big head apes to show us the way of the options

The 50 may be due before sundown brethren."
2021-06-02 12:19:39,wallstreetbets,By Friday? It's 50+ now!
2021-06-02 12:19:08,wallstreetbets,50 by today is more like it
2021-06-02 10:13:35,wallstreetbets,He needs that amount of equivalent cash to exercise them.
2021-06-02 10:27:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry bra ape has 300 shares of AMC
2021-06-02 11:07:22,wallstreetbets,"If he did he’d still be poor.

We trade options on this sub you poor fuck"
2021-06-02 12:00:41,wallstreetbets,ITM options create more buying pressure than just buying a couple of shares does.
2021-06-02 11:12:32,wallstreetbets,Hold till the comma
2021-06-02 12:19:50,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-06-02 10:56:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-06-02 11:38:33,wallstreetbets,"Calls make money if stock goes up

Puts make money if stock goes down

These have expiration dates like food

If stock doesn't go your way you lose 100%

Unlimited gains if it goes your way tho"
2021-06-02 10:00:48,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what cause we already made 20k+ if we knew how options etc work would would blow this joint! Just hodling now
2021-06-02 10:18:51,wallstreetbets,1 option = 100 shares. They expire on the listed date. It's cost/value/worth is per share. It's really not too hard I believe in you
2021-06-02 10:11:42,wallstreetbets,How is this getting up votes? Go do some rudimentary research.
2021-06-02 11:02:39,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-02 10:08:45,wallstreetbets,I’ve explained what an option is.
2021-06-02 10:52:17,wallstreetbets,Options aren’t complex at all lol. If you googled it you would understand it in 5 minutes flat
2021-06-02 10:09:39,wallstreetbets,I refuse. No gambling for me lol it seems more on the gambling side than just straight investing
2021-06-02 10:14:25,wallstreetbets,Cuz I mean I don't kind putting money in a stock I believe in.. But timing the price and date of when it will be high or low seems too risky

2021-06-02 11:14:15,wallstreetbets,Ur options are worth ass if you don’t have the price above them dippy
2021-06-02 13:21:11,wallstreetbets,Bruh these option close in two weeks that’s not comparable to buying shares now. The pressure is there but it is less than the outstanding shares shortage and buying up that supply.
2021-06-02 11:18:33,wallstreetbets,Anytime bud. Hope it helps you understand how things work. Be ready tho cuz it’s a 2 1/2 hrs long video lol

No, but seriously, that's a lot of money."
2021-06-02 12:48:14,wallstreetbets,And you think normal people have 23k cash just sitting around to exercise calls that were meant to simply make profit and not obtain the shares?
2021-06-02 11:22:58,wallstreetbets,That’s why we let poors buy the shares
2021-06-02 13:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yes it is. Do you think MMs only hedge ar the last second or something?"
2021-06-02 11:22:51,wallstreetbets,lol it’s cool. I’ve spent 27 years w/o knowing so 2 1/2hrs of learning will not kill me
2021-06-02 10:12:39,wallstreetbets,"You can read all you want, comprehension and then feeling the confidence to execute that gamble is another thing. Don’t be a douche 🙄"
2021-06-02 11:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Google will never supply you with the “it” factor that is lacking on your Robinhood account. Some apes have it, majority don’t. All the analysis in the world won’t equip you with the outer body experience of just knowing that this time your option position is literally going to the moon"
2021-06-02 10:12:21,wallstreetbets,To an extent. There is strategy in some gambling. Having the knowledge to count cards and play well seems the same to me as having knowledge or news on a stock to know if it will go up or down. Either situation something can always go wrong or right?
2021-06-02 13:42:20,wallstreetbets,Today is a good day
2021-06-02 10:55:12,wallstreetbets,No one is being a douche. You’re asking for actual investing advice from a sub full of apes. If you want someone to hold your hand and explain options go to r/options
2021-06-02 10:15:05,wallstreetbets,Paper trade?    There’s ways to learn if you actually want to.   It’s a fairly simple concept
2021-06-02 11:01:23,wallstreetbets,"I don’t get when people get so tense when it comes to a situation like this, but yet people are showing their gains and we’re a “community” who are collectively trying to push a stock. If someone doesn’t understand something someone screams Google and because one says it isn’t Efficient u cry stop asking for advice. You could’ve kept quiet or sent a link. But I digress #AMC500k"
2021-06-02 10:59:15,wallstreetbets,Who asked for advice? Never asked anyone for advice on here ever. All I “stated” was I don’t get options.
2021-06-02 10:31:21,wallstreetbets,"Since you’re an ape amongst fellow apes and we did indeed ask someone because we said we already used Google. It appears it comes fairly easy or simple to u, so y don’t u enlighten us ? 🙄"
2021-06-02 11:03:31,wallstreetbets,You could have simply used google and I wouldn’t have said a word
2021-06-02 19:08:34,wallstreetbets,"Just so you understand that talk about community is from people trend investing, they're not really together except in their memes and lack of knowledge about what they're doing.

I personally would suggest taking a look at the trading platform you use, and see what resources for learning they offer."
2021-06-02 11:02:35,wallstreetbets,You don’t get options because you haven’t tried to. They are extremely simple.
2021-06-02 10:52:59,wallstreetbets,Options are quite simple. If you can’t find out how they work from using google you probably shouldn’t be investing
2021-06-02 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,"Google.com then go to investopedia.com 
This is WSB not r/Options"
2021-06-02 11:15:06,wallstreetbets,Tomato Tuh motto #amc500k

Then I settled into thinking hey, AMC is going to be fine after the pandemic, so I'll hold onto them for 10 years if necessary (the jokey saying about ""you don't lose if you don't sell"" goes through my head a lot when I'm thinking about stonks). And now I'm thinking that I'm really happy this is happening as I'm closing on my first home next Tuesday because I expected to be moving into an empty house with nothing, no cash, no assets, just a shitty car and a PC, to my name for a long time and I might actually be able to furnish it sooner rather than later.

It promptly crapped out the next day, but I'm traditionally a buy and holder and its sitting in my IRA so I said hell with it and stopped looking at. I'm now at $782 gains. Enjoying watching it go up today so I went and bought some BB too. I bought 100 shares of SNDL yesterday. Not touching GME. Too rich for my blood and I like to hold more than one share :)"

2021-06-02 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,Bought 70 shares for $2 back in January on one account (and 25 more for my mom on another account) -- i just wish i had bought more lol
2021-06-02 17:05:16,wallstreetbets,"Had ten at 14, sold at 20. Bought back at 35 to have it in the ticker (felt empty). The rest is history, ain’t selling and pushing the gme Boulder."
2021-06-02 17:11:39,wallstreetbets,I didn’t notice I had set a sell limit instead of an alert. Sold at 20 but still thought I had it because TDA app sucks
2021-06-02 17:12:58,wallstreetbets,Bought at $9.37 so I'm pretty happy 🚀
2021-06-02 17:28:32,wallstreetbets,I only had 20 shares. CB was like $13 so I sold at $33 like a true retard. Might take the gains to BB.

2021-06-02 12:34:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought 1000 shares at $8, feels good. I'm not selling until $200+"
2021-06-02 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,Retard on robinhood
2021-06-02 12:54:53,wallstreetbets,"I had about 75 shares with a $7 average. When it hit $33 and dropped down to like $26 I set a sell limit for 15 shares @ $33 which basically refunded what I invested. Everything else from here on out is pure profit.

This morning I put a sell of 10 shares for $50. With yesterday's close being $32 I never thought it would actually trigger. That was a nice surprise. 

I don't think AMC will moon like GME, I think the big money guys are pumping it up because it's white hot right now, but I think it's going to burst soon. Not sure when that is. Just in case I've got another sell limit at $75 but I'm watching it closely in case it starts to plummet. Might put in a sell order in the opposite direction too.

If it hits $100 I'm selling everything. $5k profit off a $500 investment is more than enough for me to feel like a winner. Hell, I already feel like a winner, but most importantly I don't want to feel like a loser."
2021-06-02 11:11:12,wallstreetbets,I’m so tempted but nervous to raise my $11 average
2021-06-02 11:50:05,wallstreetbets,"I listened to to many people who told me AMC was a distraction. 

Bought a mere 5 shares."

2021-06-02 12:49:07,wallstreetbets,Being a retard means selling low... what this board doesn't understand is that hodling is how you make money. Why call it being a retard I will never know. I guess real retards are trading cause they have no fffing clue what they are actually doing lol
2021-06-02 13:00:22,wallstreetbets,I’m fucking glad for you man. Good shit and i hop it keeps sky rocketing

2021-06-02 12:00:36,wallstreetbets,To the moon 🌚
2021-06-02 11:56:27,wallstreetbets,"Stop loss bad! 

Reason: those are visible to the hedge funds. If they know they’re out there, they can and do manipulate the price to dip to capture those. I mean they don’t target you specifically, but they see you and the many others who have stop loss and they factor that into their strategies."
2021-06-02 11:32:12,wallstreetbets,How do I do that?
2021-06-02 13:20:29,wallstreetbets,Delete that stop loss and move it up to $60!!!
2021-06-02 09:56:54,wallstreetbets,I’m that guy
2021-06-02 09:57:23,wallstreetbets,Never too late
2021-06-02 10:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Wait for the sell dip when the US wakes up to see what's going on. West coast apes are maybe still asleep. *Not that I'm assuming the apes will sell, but the huMans yes."
2021-06-02 10:35:10,wallstreetbets,It’s better to invest in now before it gets any higher. I’m hoping it goes to $60 soon.
2021-06-02 13:38:18,wallstreetbets,Somebody's gotta hold the bag brother! Go for it!
2021-06-02 11:58:35,wallstreetbets,Can you go back in time and tell me?
2021-06-02 10:04:20,wallstreetbets,The contract expires on June 4th it would need to jump a lot on price for him to make 100k
2021-06-02 12:20:26,wallstreetbets,Requesting proof
2021-06-02 10:02:38,wallstreetbets,"lol judging by the current price of **$41.63**, I would say he is talking out of his ass and go check to see if his comment is deleted like the bitch he is for spreading misinformation fucking asshole bye."
2021-06-02 10:05:40,wallstreetbets,Dumbass probably bought $40 puts. Jokes on him.

2021-06-02 12:27:10,wallstreetbets,If he would have bought at $40 he’d be up 50% right now
2021-06-02 12:46:54,wallstreetbets,"Anyone citing market cap as a limitation for 40 bucks is fucking retarded. Just looking at mkt cap 100 is possible.

100k is where mkt cap runs against retards. Aint ever hitting that"
2021-06-02 10:31:21,wallstreetbets,I couldn't THINK of selling before it approached 400. And that's just thinking 🤔

Maybe some institutions are restrictive but my Roth IRA with Schwab has all the same options in the app as my brokerage account.

Bonus to full retard plays in Roth is that you don't pay taxes if you strike it rich (provided you are willing to wait until retirement age to enjoy your gains)."

2021-06-02 10:39:00,wallstreetbets,"I agree completely, but I can't buy Calls (premium) and can't buy Puts (premium) so the best option (no pun intended) is to SELL a Put and collect the premium.  I don't know how long you've been investing but there's an old statistic that I'm sure is still accurate or off by 1-2 percentage points:

85% of people who BUY options (Calls or Puts) lose money, when I've told clients/friends this stat they can't believe it, however when I then point out that 85% of those who SELL options make money it becomes clearer.   Who do you think makes 10's of millions a week/month then?  The market makers (net sellers) of both sides.  I've made more money in the last 15 years just SELLING naked Puts.  Other than meme stocks the option requirement is pretty low and there are several ways to profit vs lose if you know what you're doing."

2021-06-02 16:35:43,wallstreetbets,Plenty of people in Reddit were saying it's a distraction lol

2021-06-02 13:17:06,wallstreetbets,"ill have to check with fidelity.  this is all new to me. but Q on the gains,.   


if you sell within the Roth account, but dont transfer out, you are not taxed capital gains?"
2021-06-02 13:25:38,wallstreetbets,I can't answer that
2021-06-02 12:48:32,wallstreetbets,"You can still do that, just don’t show your cards to the enemy. 💎🙌"

I LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK M8"

2021-06-02 15:22:36,wallstreetbets,Pot.
2021-06-02 14:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Correct, the magic of Roth means gains are tax exempt as long as you don't withdraw until retirement."
2021-06-02 16:00:39,wallstreetbets,I did it mostly as a joke between my friends. I’ve made 50k in one day. Couldn’t happier
2021-06-02 12:08:32,wallstreetbets,"The thing is AMC is just not a long play. You can’t really argue that like you could at least try to with gme. It’s 5 year high previous to this was sub $40. I think it’s new floor could be $20 range so it’s not a complete disaster of a floor but I don’t see it holding this price long term. 

If we’re honest here amc is a pure squeeze play."
2021-06-02 14:00:55,wallstreetbets,Think for a second. Why was the stock doing poorly even before covid hit and now suddenly it's worth twice as much? It's a squeeze and pump play. Nothing more
2021-06-02 12:50:15,wallstreetbets,"on gme it was 1.2 million shares bought in five minutes, on amc it should be proportional. I don't think that's happening again today."
2021-06-02 12:25:46,wallstreetbets,You got a nice $600ish dinner right now.
2021-06-02 14:52:10,wallstreetbets,If I sold my 9 shares right now I could feed my family for 2 months off my profits. Every dollar counts to some people
2021-06-02 12:38:05,wallstreetbets,10 @ 10 right now. Dinner it is!
2021-06-02 13:28:08,wallstreetbets,Good for you 😂 Still don’t understand why there’s no point in having five shares.
2021-06-02 17:00:48,wallstreetbets,since commenting my $60 gain is now $125. no complaints from this little ape
2021-06-02 14:49:31,wallstreetbets,Can you transfer stock into a Roth?
2021-06-02 13:08:54,wallstreetbets,And what a squeeze it could be!
2021-06-02 13:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Could shoot myself in the leg, bought 102 shares at 15€ sold at 24€ now it’s at 47€ because I was sure that they were dropping. Sshhiiittt I’m a true retard"
2021-06-02 13:53:57,wallstreetbets,"That’s just it, there was a REASON amc was shorted to hell. 

Streaming has devastated theaters. And it will again. People are jazzed to see movies and be OUT.

But Disney, amazon and Netflix are the new studio grease. We retail investors shocked the world and made a stand it was great. But let’s be honest. Things are opening  back up and once they are fully. The gleam will ware off and we’ll be all back to our SM complaining about the high price of popcorn. 

Theaters reopening is not what’s filling the surge, it’s retail folks making a stand. That’s it...."
2021-06-02 14:15:32,wallstreetbets,Plus AMC selling all those shares earlier this week just seems shitty to me.
2021-06-02 14:59:31,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Michael Burry, Tesla short, sold POAHY. Electric vehicle maker Volkswagen is still going up. Michael Burry, who is shorting Tesla, sold POAHY, apparently.

Despite this, shares of electric vehicle maker Volkswagen are still going up.

It looks like those who were ""long-short"" Volkswagen to short Tesla have left, and have now been replaced by true long investors looking for the next electric vehicle play, or opportunity.

Could it have something to do with Cathie Wood and ARK?

[VW Outlines the Math Behind Its Autonomous Service Plans](https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-271/?utm_content=168006531&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084)

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK’s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW’s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW’s progress."
2021-06-02 12:55:46,wallstreetbets,How do we know he sold POAHY?
2021-06-02 10:18:14,wallstreetbets,"Long on VW and Porsche as well, still extremely undervalued IMO"
2021-06-02 09:53:11,wallstreetbets,Cathie Wood is praying to god inflation doesn’t stick otherwise her fund will tank like titanic.
2021-06-02 09:40:03,wallstreetbets,Idk but I’m long Volkswagen so yay me
2021-06-02 14:43:23,wallstreetbets,"Look at his recent filing.  He has Tesla puts and a bunch of other stuff.

POAHY doesn't appear among his other holdings."
2021-06-02 15:12:11,wallstreetbets,isnt that a foreign holding. not sure if its captured elsewhere.

Is it just me or is the SP500 die for a correction ? I can’t see why it would keep going up with inflation blazing the way it is ...
2021-06-02 09:17:29,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I’ll definitely look more into this! Your charts have been an eye opener and helpful! Bonus that you answer questions as well :)

2021-06-02 13:40:26,wallstreetbets,really hope volatility comes back. This 30 cent swing bullshit is infuriating.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WISH Institutional Share Increase with Open Puts. I heard you like DD and bear hunting so here's the big reveal. >!Sometimes the bear is the bull.!<

**Source:** reading through 13F Filings of hedgies

**On this episode of Who Owns These Puts?**

Our robot Edgar or Marvin, whatever you want to call him... dropped us GOLD! Through some digging on all 13F filings recently, there is only 1 big owner for the over 9000 $WISH puts that expire very soon. From there we find the inner workings of a rocket in assembly that we must sit in on before they launch. Talk about free lunch.

**Current short float:** \>10%

**Who do you think it is?** Melvin? Citadel? Guess again, it's >!Sus-quana (SIG)!<

**Who else would hold this ""sus"" position?**

**Exhibit A:** Who owns $16m in puts?

&#x200B;

**Exhibit B:** 5/17 filing over 9000 OI, the only possible culprit for 6/18 expirations

https://preview.redd.it/ozzqetdjlu271.png?width=2175&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3375750adab580e2cc4d97c4b14e7cdc06584f

&#x200B;

**Exhibit C:** 3/26/2021 Sus owns 420,000 shares and around 2000 puts to hedge possibly (Not sure who bought those shares but he/she probably likes 420.)

3/26 13F Filing (At the time \~$16/share)

https://preview.redd.it/vmjt8aqklu271.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6c72c9ce3b788b3762f2d3712b78366a7db13a

&#x200B;

**Exhibit D:** 5/17 Sus now owns 1,188,000 shares, up 2.2x or 768,000 shares in 3 months.

5/17 13F Filing (At the time \~$9/share)

https://preview.redd.it/y9huakfllu271.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=598e1ec8166776cd06ad17a4a7490e4e85753a9c

&#x200B;

**Questions?**

But wait didn't they buy from $16 to $9, and $15 put with 9000 contracts open? So are they long or are they short?

**1.**) Sus is now a bag holder of WISH at \~ $12, trading at $7.74, that would mean a $4m+ loss on paper if they were to close out. (LONG BAG HOLDER)

**2.**) $15put with 9000 contracts. What a coincidence, owning shares at \~$16. Did someone open a position to push the price down?

It's quite possible that they shorted the price down to buy more shares while holding puts. (Long bag holder and accumulating more shares.)

**3.**)Let's see what hedgy friend is doing. \*enters Citadel

**Exhibit E**: 2/16 Citadel owns roughly 69,000 shares (Price at time $25)

https://preview.redd.it/kkqxrz5mlu271.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06df0e7273958c79a5bb4eea63e0c7fbd2790a6

&#x200B;

**Exhibit F:** 5/17 Citadel owns roughly 926,000 shares, 13x increase or +857000 shares(Price at time $8.74)

https://preview.redd.it/ofz102kmlu271.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d18321317657b88376a7967c4edffffb7dce0e7

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**: Maybe hedgies just made a bad investment and they averaged down? (Sure it's possible, but what are they going to do with all the shares?) Wrong! Push down price, buy more shares, rocketship, profit. Hedgies are about to lift off a rocket secretly but we just got **access to the sneak peak before it goes!**

**TLDR**: When bulls wear bear clothing. Ride them. Wish pummeled so shares can be acquired.

**Position:** 5000 shares @ $7.8

2021-06-02 16:12:20,wallstreetbets,The short interest doesn’t bother me here since it’s only 8% of float. But the buying activity as well as tradable float does make a bullish case.

2021-06-02 16:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Yep, my calls are covered with shares, so today was about 15k gains. 

I rolled my put spreads to next week since they were essentially worthless.

If Gme stays over $250 next week, I will make another $35k. If it goes as low as $215, I will still make $19k.

I didn’t want to update yet bc amc is the real winner!"

2021-06-02 17:26:26,wallstreetbets,The graph is still going up!!
2021-06-02 14:39:13,wallstreetbets,/r/thetagang would accept you with welcoming arms.
2021-06-02 16:15:59,wallstreetbets,Half a wheel you say
2021-06-02 18:09:14,wallstreetbets,Smart as fuck.
2021-06-02 14:51:45,wallstreetbets,OP's name is GME_200K. Nuff said.
2021-06-02 18:52:00,wallstreetbets,Because you can't sell a handful of options with ~5 DTE and make such a large gain in a short amount of time from theta alone.
2021-06-02 13:11:58,wallstreetbets,".... It's a term for traders profiting from theta-decay you uneducated cuck, you can trade options without playing theta."
2021-06-02 12:48:10,wallstreetbets,"Fuck off. OP never mentioned anything about thetagang. He just said this was a theta play, which it is not."
2021-06-02 12:01:19,wallstreetbets,I'm crying on all these $AMC gains today
2021-06-02 12:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Just watch projectoption's videos, write everything down that you do not understand, then research those topics.

If you spend like 2 hours a night for 6 months you will have a fairly decent grasp on how theta gang works."
2021-06-02 14:11:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes absolutely. If you sell options on memes, don't sell naked calls. Although some users of /r/thetagang like to do exactly that on out-sized moves like the one we are seeing now to sell super-far-otm calls to dumb money. Think selling 500 strike calls on AMC with short expiry (that strike is probably not available yet though). But that's just playing with fire and asking to get burned eventually.

In my opinion there is a much much better risk/reward to sell super-far-otm puts (cash secured, so you can take assigment) when memes start crashing with 1000%IV on puts even super far down the chain. Think 10 dollar AMC puts, maybe even lower than that. You can probably earn a relatively save 10% in one month that way. Worst case you own AMC at 10, that shouldn't be too bad. But to each his own, there are certainly much more beginner friendly stocks to write options on."
2021-06-02 16:53:10,wallstreetbets,"Essentially you sell puts on stocks you want to own, at a strike you want to buy 100 shares at, at a range of 30-45 days for optimal theta decay. 

So meme stocks are generally frowned on since do you really want to hold 100 shares of AMC at $60 when it comes crashing down? Or 100 shares of GME at $250? You would also need cash security to do this usually unless you're on margin, which is even more retarded."
2021-06-02 14:52:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes but you get compensated for danger in the form of implied volatility/vega. 

I think a short volatility play on AMC right now is the play but that's just me"

2021-06-02 10:29:19,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you overdrew yourself more than once.
2021-06-02 09:47:41,wallstreetbets,Took one day for me to get approved for options. Now I just need to learn how to use options so I don’t go tits up

2021-06-02 11:14:04,wallstreetbets,"This is the answer, RH unusable for stocks because of bad trading hours, but for options it's the cats ass. I have money in 5 different brokers and RH is my de facto options platform."
2021-06-02 14:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I’ve saved thousands by using Boomer Fidelity that has gotten me better pricing on stocks and options. Move the fuck over all your RHoodRats."
2021-06-02 10:30:55,wallstreetbets,"Transferred to fidelity, it took a few days but they helped out every step of the way. I called them and the guy just explained what he was doing and what to look out for to make the transition seamless. Do it!"
2021-06-02 12:02:40,wallstreetbets,"I am still using Robinhood because every other trading app looks and functions like absolute donkey dick.  It’s like all of the other companies are trying with all of their might to make their apps as clunky and stupid as possible.  We’re talking about Wall Street colossus mega corporations here with billions of dollars at their disposal and the apps they’re putting out look like they were designed on purpose to inflict abject misery upon their users.  How, after watching RH gain huge market share over the years, these companies haven’t tried to mimic their user experience is a complete mystery to me.  RH literally made a multi-billion dollar company by simply creating app that doesn’t give you an aneurism when you try to use it, and it seems like everyone else is like “wow how did they possibly do it”.  Guh.

That said, I transferred my GME to Fidelity because RH has shown they can’t be trusted in a squeeze.  It literally took 1 day, not even.  Happened overnight for me.  Just had to upload one form that Robinhood has available on the account page of their app."
2021-06-02 09:20:26,wallstreetbets,I recommend gtfo with a little side of BAN
2021-06-02 09:23:26,wallstreetbets,"Use Robinhood. Fidelity options approval is a mess and their UI is terrible.

I know RH gets a bad rap, but it is the easiest to use and roll options when you miss-step."

2021-06-02 10:50:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I will. Was there a transfer fee? And if so, do they charge me on the spot or do I have to have that money in my Fidelity/ RH account?"

While they were struggling in the pandemic, they cleared their debt and have a lot of runway now. They're definitely in no position to fail, only succeed or perform mediocre right now, but the turn around seems strong. Also has an insane cult following. Of course, boomers living in the 70ies don't understand half the stuff that's in play right now, so they'll reduce GME to brick and mortar reseller, so they'll never see any value in the play."

2021-06-02 12:56:37,wallstreetbets,"I know, but actually most of the posts there these days aren't true theta plays. Most of selling options isn't true theta anyway - you always have to consider all of the greeks together."
2021-06-02 12:59:06,wallstreetbets,Who the fuc is theta an what dose she do
2021-06-02 10:26:25,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn’t you want the card. It’s instant funds the second you sell… can be withdrawn or swiped
2021-06-02 12:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't worry about it. Just watch the tape and write notes on how it trades and the moves you would make. 

Then compare the moves after the fact and see how your decision stacked up, then figure out what you could have done better.

If anything not being able to jump on this would be far more motivating to get money."
2021-06-02 11:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Not even a little. It's selling or buying a promise to purchase a minimum of 100 shares (1 contract = 100 shares of x stock) at a designated date and price per share for a premium you pay now. As a stock's price fluctuates you can either make a bunch of money due to the increased premium or lose the entire amount of premium you paid. The premium is 100x, due to the contract being equal to a future purchase/sale of 100 shares. 

Ex. You buy a contract for a premium of $0.25 of x share with the stock price at $30 (also referred to as strike price), so for $25.00 total, due to come up/expire July 2. But in a week it goes up to $0.50/share, because the underlying share price is approaching the $30 strike price, meaning the share value is getting close to what you were betting it would be in a month. So, in this case your contract will have doubled in value, a 100% return. You could sell it then and there for the return or continue to hold it if you believe it's got room to go before its expiration. However, if, as the date approaches, the stock value remains roughly the same as when you purchased the contract OR has decreased, your value of the contract will decrease through the premium value. BUT even if the price of the stock starts to increase, albeit gradually, you are losing value every day through theta decay, as the stock is less likely to hit the strike price by the date you specified, so your premium decreases as well.

TL;DR options are complicated with a lot of risk and a lot of reward. Definitely do some research and trial plays before just jumping in. With the downward pressure of the market starting in February pretty much all my gains that I made in January, enough for a year's salary, were wiped out, partly through getting into options with little background and at the wrong time. Slowly recovering now and took most money out as a result of the see sawing going on for the past months, but looking better and better now! Be careful and have fun!"

2021-06-02 11:00:49,wallstreetbets,"honestly, if they have a transfer fee, go with another broker. there's way too much competition for these people to be scalping fees. fucking paypal tried to give me a $40 late fee on my credit card, i called them and explained, i just made $1000 in payments last month and you're charging me a late fee for missing the min payment? cocksuckers!"
2021-06-02 11:09:29,wallstreetbets,$75 fee. Fidelity will reimburse this as well as many other reputable brokers ex TD and Schwab
2021-06-02 11:33:29,wallstreetbets,I did it. Took few days to happen. No charge fees. But to transfer the cost basis it took few months. Or you can use the RH statement and work it out with Fidelity. I just happened to wait. RH automatically closed my account after the transfer was completed. 😂

2021-06-02 10:04:11,wallstreetbets,I'm going to ride it out and if price hits 14$ I'll close out a few contracts to take my initial investment and ride the rest. If it crashes before that then oh well.
2021-06-02 10:23:49,wallstreetbets,Same. Wanted to stay but the very weak volume made me reconsider. I have 500 shares but I’ll just hold these
2021-06-02 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,I think you don't stand under
2021-06-02 09:16:32,wallstreetbets,Not lately
2021-06-02 10:28:13,wallstreetbets,None of what you said gives me any reason to believe they will hit $500. At their absolute peak they never even sniffed anything close to that. I’m not sure how they’d be able to do better today than their prime unless they drastically change the business model
2021-06-02 14:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Ok, that's like your opinion,  man"

2021-06-02 12:34:06,wallstreetbets,It’s not Fidelity charging the fee - RH charges the fee to the account before the account transfers to Fidelity and it is sent as a debit along with whatever other assets/cash are in the account.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What is the real potential market for treatments against covid in light of massive vaccination?  **Before tackling this subject using a comparison**, let's define what that comparison is meant for: evaluating the potential need for covid treatments in the near and not so near future.  


I decided to look into this because many people think that companies (not only Sorrento, but many others) working on drugs, treatments, technology for covid treatment are wasting their time. The logic is that with vaccines doing a great job, these treatments become dispensable and these companies are going to lose value because their pipelines or products have no market value.  


**To put that potential into perspective** I offer a comparison with measles. It isn't meant to compare the entire spectrum of similarities and differences between these illnesses. Only to decide whether the potential for covid treatments is high and profitable.  


The vaccination for measles started in the late 1960's' as a stand-alone vaccine and later (early 70's) as part of the MMR vaccine ( includes rubella and mumps).  


**By 1980, there were over 2.5 million deaths caused by measles worldwide**. Just to get a notion of just how crazy this is on many levels: more than ten years after the vaccine started being given, measles was killing considerably more people per year than covid has in its peak!  


By 1980, the distribution of the measles vaccine was already significant. Not comparable to the ability to distribute vaccines today, but by the 1980's in most regions of the world, people who wanted that vaccine had access to it.  


Nonetheless, by 2010 there were still more than 100,000 deaths per year as a result of measles.  


Put this into perspective: measles is a much less aggressive virus than covid, it's mechanism is much simpler, it's ability to create variants is null. And still, 30 years after the vaccine was widespread and readily available, there was a significant amount of deaths per year. Since measles always was less severe, this obviously means that the amount of cases was much, much larger.  


Just how much larger? Nowadays, **more than FIFTY years after the approval of a vaccine**, more than 40 years after worldwide distribution of that vaccine, **there are more than 20,000,000 cases of measles per year** worldwide!!  


Yep, that is an official number. Fifty years after a vaccine approval, for a virus which does not create variants, for an illness that is comparatively significantly milder, there are still more than 20 million cases per year.  


As for covid: let’s use the most successful story of vaccination worldwide, Israel. **63% of all Israeli citizens have been vaccinated so far**. That is far, far more than any other country. But....  


When Israel reached 60% vaccination, United States was at 25%, France and Germany at 10%, Brazil at 5%. Anyone in Israel over the age of 16 can get a vaccine at any time.  


But, since moving from 60% to 63% (in terms of Israeli population that means a mere 270,000 people), USA has grown from 25% to 50%, Germany from 10% to 45%, France from 10% to 40% and Brazil from 5% to 22%. **In other words, the rate of vaccination in Israel flatlined. Why?**  


**There are three main reasons:**  
1. The Israeli government stopped pressing. By now, all covid restrictions have been lifted. ALL OF THEM (except wearing masks indoors at public places). Anyone, vaccinated or not, has access to any service or activity. Companies and institutions can no longer demand that their workers or students present a vaccine certificate.  
2. Many people refuse to take a vaccine that was issued under an EUA provision, that hasn't been properly verified in a multi-year trial and study. BTW, that number of people only increases when you move to Europe, where the number of people unwilling to receive the vaccine is at 30% or more in several countries.  
3. Children are not receiving the vaccine, and there is no current justification to give it to them. There is pretty much a scientific consensus on that.  


In other words, even after a massive and extremely aggressive vaccination campaign, such as had never been seen before, countries will not succeed in going beyond a 65% vaccination level, and using Israel as measurement, apparently governments will not push for more than that.  


Take into consideration that we are still only starting to learn the mechanisms of Covid, it’s long term impact, the long term impact of the vaccine, the complexity of variants and the novelty of the treatments and technologies being developed to tackle it, and it becomes pretty clear **we still have at the very least a couple of decades worth** of dealing with massive, massive amounts of cases worldwide.  


Of course, more evidence can be given in favor or against developing solutions for covid. But I think that as a current investment, it is very very safe to say that companies who get products approved for this virus will find an eager market, a huge demand, and a sharp increase in market value."

2021-06-02 07:46:06,wallstreetbets,"Great anecdotal feedback, I think their rate competiveness is going to increase soon after they complete their acquisition of a bank and secure their banking charter. This deal should be completing very soon."
2021-06-02 12:27:56,wallstreetbets,"The reason for this is because SOFI DOES NOT YET have a federal banking charter. This federal charter allows banks(JPM, BOA, C, etc...) to borrow money from the fed at a lower rate, which in turn allows them to offer lower rates for refinancing. It also allows them to open FDIC insured accounts for their customers ....however, SOFI realized this and applied for a Bank Charter Application in 2020(bank charters can take years for approval when new applicants apply). In early 2021, SOFI bought out Pacific Northwest bank(already have their federal banking charter) and applied for a change of ownership for the banking charter(takes process from years to months). Therefore, once SOFI gets their banking charter approved, they no longer will have to borrow money at higher rates than JPM, BOA, etc... they don’t have to change their business model or anything and they reap the benefits of borrowing at lower rates.

I believe this stock is a firm buy.

 In other news, I just read another one of those  pieces  titled  ""Let this be a lesson to you"" ( retail jagoffs).    it was about NAKD.   I read a similar one about GME and AMC two months ago.    BB article about how stupid retards are coming soon to an AMC theatre.

I do enjoy how frustrated the financial media gets when the people don't do what they think they should do.

Speaking of which,   how much less of a spaz is the *haughty* Andrew Ross Sorkin when Joe Kernan is back on set?     Geezus it's like someone sewed the kid's vagina shut."

2021-06-02 13:24:57,wallstreetbets,Thise who bought AMC at 60+ dont worry this is just a normal pullback.
2021-06-02 13:26:00,wallstreetbets,Every halt just adds another $15 to the price.
2021-06-02 13:26:07,wallstreetbets,The clowns with the $69 sell limits are why we can't have nice things.

2021-06-02 13:58:24,wallstreetbets,"One of two things is going to happen to AMC today and it's going to take an iron stomach to ride through it.

1. After hours, it blows up in price like it did yesterday as more shorts cover and margin calls come in. Drop in the AM as people take profits, and then the ride to the moon continues.
2. Massive dump and the price crashes going into tomorrow. We all sell for half of what we could've gotten today. 

Either way, nerve wracking ride."

2021-06-02 13:29:00,wallstreetbets,"Money is so weird. I can make more than I usually do in a week and then still feel mostly bad because I lost a lot of unrealized gains or missed a huge play. If you're good at the mental side of trading, hats off to you. That shit is hard"

2021-06-02 15:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Weak bounce on BB, trading tight at $15.18. Looks like the dip scared some who bought today into closing out with -5 or +20% and dumping their shares into harder hands. Same thing with GME and AMC: both trading flat with 13 minutes left before market close.  

You can smell the indecision and weakness."

2021-06-02 06:38:21,wallstreetbets,"Not much doing in stocks so far, with S&P 500 futures pointing to a flat open. Dow Industrials are up about 0.1% with the Nasdaq down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a pretty blah day where not much happened either. Small caps did rally yesterday though, with the Russell 2000 up 1.1%.

There are other pockets of rallies. I ~~probably~~ obviously don’t need to tell you about AMC, which was up 22% yesterday. Reopening names are doing well along with energy stocks.

Not much on the economic calendar today. The Fed Beige Book is out this afternoon. These are anecdotes of economic activity reported by the Fed’s various districts. There are only eight of these a year and they come 15 days or so before the Fed meets to decide interest rate policy. 

You’ll be hearing a lot more about that as we move out of earnings season. The rate decision itself is already baked in but any talk of inflation could spook markets.

Failing that (or even with that) we should see risk assets move higher."

I sold half my position around $32.00, thus allowing me to recoup my original investment

I am now ""playing with house money""

Now I don't care what happens to AMC. If it moons, I don't feel FOMO. Once the volatility begins to die out, I'll gradually pull out. 

That's how I'm playing this without being fully retarded"
2021-06-02 11:53:34,wallstreetbets,Told yall only 12 more mins till $BB hits $14 🤫

This is how you get back, America.  They took it all from us.  If every American held AMC/GME to bleed them dry, and every American said “no more bailouts for the 1%” we would decimate them.  When the market tanked, it wouldn’t be us hurting, it would just be them.  We The People have the right to hold the power, not just pretend we do.  

LFG and WATCH THEM BURN!!!!!"

The best quote, of course is DFV's when asked if he would buy the stock at $44... he said, ""For me personally, YES""   Thanks big guy!  I raised that 10x when purchasing my 100 shares at $437 from kenny the kocksucker on Jan 27th b4 he broke it off in our collective arses... learning a lot from Apes...

2021-06-02 00:57:21,wallstreetbets,"Easiest explanation.... call options, you’re expecting the price of the stock to rise, put options you expect it to fall.

You pay a premium for these options. Each option is essentially 100 shares. 

So let’s say you wanted to buy a house for 300k, and you think the housing market will boom in 6 months .... I sell you a contract for 10k ( the purchase price) to guarantee you can buy that house for 300k in the next 6 months... 2 months later that house is worth 450k, so you exercise that option and make 140k .... 150k profit - the 10k purchase price ....that’s how a call option works.... a put option is the opposite, you think the price will drop"

2021-06-02 01:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Oof, lots to go on here.

1) you can exercise whenever you want up to closing time on the expiry of the option.

2) you choose the expiration date - it varies by stock (some weekly, some monthly, some daily).

3) a call/put is the RIGHT to buy the stock, not the OBLIGATION. 90% of them never get exercised, they get sold back for profit (or loss if your bet missed lol).

4) you need a ""better than regular ass cash account"" to trade options, and any site that lets you buy micro shares is a site you shouldn't (probably can't) buy options on anyways. You do NOT, however, have to have the cash on hand for the call/put, until you exercise.

5) if it doesn't go the way you want, you can either sell for a loss (you'll recoup whatever the current premium is, a bunch of factors go into this) or you can hold it til the day it expires, hoping for a miracle.


Edit: all of this assumes you don't already have 100 shares of something and are buying/selling calls and puts with your shares as the leverage."
2021-06-02 01:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Buy calls and puts, experiment with very small ones to learn, like pltr 9/17c35 for around .55 for for a 100 share contract, totaling $55. This .55 price will decay over time as the implied volatility fades (chance for big changes decreases as your near the 9/17 expiration).

 Do not sell calls or puts until you understand the risks, which can be severe.

To fit in here you hold your calls until they expire worthless."

2021-06-02 07:23:51,wallstreetbets,"So if I do a call on AMC for $40 and it goes up to $40, I have to have capital in my account to cover the shares?

 I can't just sell at that point? I thought all you needed for options was the premium. I've seen one guy on here turn $400 into $25K if I'm not mistaken (extremely lucky). He would have needed more than $400 at some point in there?"
2021-06-02 07:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Not OP but can you expand on how selling covered calls works? I understand you’re using your own 100 shares a leverage but I don’t get why it’s considered “Level 1” of options trading because to me it seems more complicated than simply buying calls/puts

If I have 100 shares of something, would I only sell a covered call if I think it’ll go down? Do I get to choose the strike price and expiry date? What is the potential gain and when is it better than just selling my shares at what I think is the peak?"

I'm not so much for fitting in... I'd rather be part of the team that makes the tendies.

2021-06-02 07:44:00,wallstreetbets,"You can sell the option right up to close of the expiration date.  Yes you have to have the money to pay for the shares in order to exercise the option.  If you can't exercise,  you sell to someone who can.  One option contract for AMC at 40 would need $4,000 to exercise,  for example."
2021-06-02 07:41:22,wallstreetbets,"No, you just sell the call option to someone else before the expiration date and then you no longer have the right to buy those shares. 

Not sure what happens if you hold calls that are in-the-money all the way to expiry but you don’t have the money to purchase them"
2021-06-02 09:34:38,wallstreetbets,">If I have 100 shares of something, would I only sell a covered call if I think it’ll go down? 

Either down or stagnate.  You keep the premium if it doesn't go up.  Sell a put for the opposite result.

>Do I get to choose the strike price and expiry date? 

Yes.

>What is the potential gain and when is it better than just selling my shares at what I think is the peak? 

You get the premium if you're right.  If you're wrong, you have defined risk in that you own the underlying.  It's a bad idea to sell naked calls because, in theory, you have unlimited risk."
2021-06-02 12:12:48,wallstreetbets,"To expand on that, if your calls never get assigned, you constantly get to sell the covered call every time it expires.

It's basically free income. That's the long term goal, own enough shares of something that i can use the covered call income as my investment $$."

So I guess my hopes of turning a little bit of money into a lot (as extremely rare as it is) are crushed."
2021-06-02 07:47:07,wallstreetbets,"If you hold a call that becomes ITM all the way through expiration, if you have enough capital to exercise and purchase 100 shares at whatever strike, the call will automatically be exercised and you’ll be assigned 100 shares. 

If you don’t have the capital, the call will automatically get sold at whatever the price an hour or so before market close."
2021-06-02 08:20:39,wallstreetbets,"I turned 300 into 2k last week. Then lost it. Now at opening I'm looking to be back at 1k. You can for sure get very wealthy off of options, but it's a huge ass risk and you gotta be willing to lose it all. Which most likely will happen at some point in time."
2021-06-02 08:28:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm completely fine gambling the whole amount I put in, as long as it's the most you can lose.

Did you sell the contract for 2K or exercise the option? Is one a lot more profitable than the other? I'm gonna watch a video on options when I get home."
2021-06-02 10:28:58,wallstreetbets,So I should have sold it but I was going to exercise it when it expired the price dropped 7 dollars in one day and rip all my profit. So moral of the story take profits when you can you can always get back in on a dip.

Youve got no chance. Don't ever put yourself in that situation.  
I am in no way against drugs of any kind as long as folk take care of themselves (first) and each other. Personally I gave up every substance over time, dont drink or smoke cigarettes, since years now. - Extreme nature,  so I  go rock climbing instead but that's purely my problem, aint it?

You can do whatever you like with your life and body that is not my affair - as long as you don't damage me or mine. I'm pointing out there is a legal dimension in civil life, and this is particularly relevant when you are at that time engaged in paid employment.  
You know this.  
So my advice is similar to:  ""Don't take a concealed weapon on a plane, it's a bad idea""  
It has very little to do with the overall legality of gun ownership in your State. I am not against gun ownership. I am against people getting hurt, getting other people hurt, or through ignorance or stupidity being blamed for causing hurt.

Calling me a Beta is silly, because you admit that you yourself work in insurance. I have never met anyone as high up the human scale as Beta involved in car insurance. Nobody has."

The thing you need to consider is that Amazon as itself does not make much profit. How do you think they do 2-day shipping on everything. They lose money/break even/make very little on almost every transaction made. They are basically just trying to aggressively cut out competition by offering prices and shipping times so absurd nobody can compete. They do this by losing tons and tons of money, money they can afford to lose because AWS comes in to save the day. Why do we hear so much about tech these days, partly because it is incredible profitable by nature.  

They treat the other employees like shit, well because they don't matter to Amazon. They aren't making Amazon money, they are the main reason they are losing money. Since labor is usually the most expensive part of any operation. They treat the other employees like shit, well because they don't matter to A.

They work their warehouse workers hard and give them crappy contracts because they can. The demand for labor is very low relative to the supply. There's too many workers relative to jobs (partly because of amazon destroying a lot of jobs but also other larger reasons) and so companies like Amazon don't have to compete for workers."
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NIO - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Great Breakout Today  **TL;DR -** NIO broke out of a descending wedge on the daily chart

It's targeting **47.23, 49.86** within **2 weeks - 1 month**

Stop loss under **40.00**

**Position -** NIO 45 Call @ 2.11

\---

What's up guys - with $EEM breaking out big I've been looking at a rotation into Chinese stocks and one I always keep on my radar is **$NIO.**

It was working on a gorgeous **descending wedge** for about three months - and broke out just today:

[$NIO 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/afewbvmcpr271.png?width=2238&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d4473f4a2335b68e65e1ae07a48f0d89f5d2d0)

The main price targets for this setup are **47.23, 49.86** and it should take about 2 weeks - 1 month to play out. $NIO is a fast moving stock so you can expect a move sooner rather than later.

I also want to be mindful of some resistance @ **43.51 -** breaking this would provide a nice foothold to tag those higher targets.

The only support below is sitting at **40.00 -** below there I'll be stopping out (daily close).

Lastly - we got a nice uptick in volume today which is always a good sign on a breakout candle.

*Not Financial Advice*"

\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going, continuing so on and so forth.

\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week.

\- 🚀🌑🚀🌑🚀🌑

# DD

The past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a contract to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at investment banks and financial institutions, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week

[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k96sf790s271.jpg?width=1327&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bf3ccff9fc9a91c18dbf10af372fa488a89b5fd)

If we look at the 2nd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay ""delta neutral"". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a ""Gamma squeeze"", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...

Gamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are **borrowing** AMC shares in hopes AMC will go down so they can buy back the share at a cheaper price, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago.

[Short interest a month ago from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yc81t36v0s271.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80da820a287bc54ef2b20a905effe62f60bae4a)

We can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom.

[Short interest 2 weeks ago from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/a8xq2ws71s271.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=535e4ba376352ffc0e6f86ae37434372ce204faf)

We can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math....

Total shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))

Float % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)

Shares shorted = 80.6million

80.6 \* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b

.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb.

This is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed/did something wrong

# Reversal

I'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is **we don't know exactly when the short holders will cover**. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up.

This is not financial advice. Please do your own research and please... don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑

# Exit

I dont' want people to bag hold in case this thing pops like a lot of people did during GME. My plan to exit is to monitor when the volume on the option chain starts becoming low. You can check the [option volume here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/options?p=AMC). Once the option volume becomes thin, there's not enough potential for a gamma squeeze. If the short interest becomes low, there's no chance for a short squeeze. If any of these happens, that's when i plan to stop buying weekly calls and sell my shares. Or if robinhood decides to ban AMC trading again....

# Update

Its happening, we goin to the moon bois! 🚀🌑🚀🌑

Now that we've hit in the money for all strikes (when it hit 70), short squeeze **probably** sqoze (this doesn't mean all shorts covered, just the immediate ones such as hedge funds that are too far in the red or can't afford the premiums) I exited all my call options and taking profits. To those who are indoubtedly gonna say something about being paper handed, it's a good idea to constantly take profits and protect yourself. DFV took profits periodically himself. Take care of yourself and don't get too greedy. With that being said I still have a few hundred shares in AMC and gonna wait for another opportunity to play more options again. Congrats to everyone that followed and profitted!!! "

I'm so glad this post made me double check after hours price because we both planned to sell half our stock at $35 to ensure we didn't lose our original investment after holding so long

Bumped that order to $42 which seems a  pretty safe bet to hit tbh

Our other half we're going to ride as far as we can

And yeah I know, that seems conservative, but I want to make sure my kid wins either way on his first ever stock play

EDIT: ended up bumping our sell order to $45 after posting and it just got filled 

We've locked in a decent 40% profit so far, and have half our shares left to gamble with

2021-06-01 23:01:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC has no qualms selling large blocks of shares. They did it today and if the price keeps going up they will do it again. This one may go higher for a day or two but it will be back down to earth by end of next week. Be greedy, but not too greedy."

2021-06-02 01:08:37,wallstreetbets,"It's like everyone forgot about gme . Amc has nothing the shorts that gme has.

Amc cannot be short squeezed it never had more then 100% shorts like gme.. 
Enjoy your gains though, nothing makes sense anymore anyways"
2021-06-02 01:22:51,wallstreetbets,AEMC just sold 8.5 million shares to HFs and they sold it immediately for 400 million dollar profit. Amc does not care about us
2021-06-01 22:33:52,wallstreetbets,So I should keep my $11.5 and $16 calls a little bit longer? Thanks for the confirmation bias.
2021-06-02 00:23:05,wallstreetbets,All I heard was BUY.
2021-06-02 01:55:41,wallstreetbets,"The OI on the June monthly $40 call has been over 200,000 since Thursday. If we cross that, market makers might have to buy up close to 20mil shares.
Till last week the option chain was ending at $40.
Going past 40 could be a really big deal
This is not financial advice. Just something I noticed"
2021-06-02 08:54:03,wallstreetbets,it will continue to grow because AMC just announced plans to provide free popcorn to shareholders: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/amc-plans-to-reward-retail-investors-with-free-popcorn-and-exclusives.html
2021-06-02 00:54:48,wallstreetbets,Didn’t they just dilute their shares by a further 2% after saying they wouldn’t sell anymore shares for the rest of the year?  What a bunch of dopes.
2021-06-01 21:44:57,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-02 00:12:09,wallstreetbets,"This just sounds retarded enough to where it’s going to work, I’m all in 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-02 00:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Well... I farted, soooooo.... there’s that."
2021-06-01 22:49:46,wallstreetbets,I sold $70 calls to some of you degenerates.. thanks for the premium
2021-06-02 00:03:09,wallstreetbets,Adding 100 shares daily until 350$
2021-06-01 23:59:42,wallstreetbets,"Listen 👂 don’t fuck this up 🆙 ,and don’t get excited 😛 yet  ✋🏽 hold it and just move on with your day we are just getting started .. these fat grease balls of hedge fund guys are gonna be  eating cock soup 🍲 by the time WE THE PEOPLE are done with them."
2021-06-01 22:19:49,wallstreetbets,Ive never seen Ortex on here I love this
2021-06-01 23:20:25,wallstreetbets,Buy both AMC and GME!
2021-06-01 23:26:55,wallstreetbets,You som of a bitch om in
2021-06-02 09:22:51,wallstreetbets,"Grab your helmets, apes. We're moonin' this bitch"
2021-06-02 10:03:56,wallstreetbets,"After seeing Mudrick spending so many millions to get out, selling and AMC only increasing despite that move... and that long list of HF that must cover their obligations in the following days, the one that panics when it goes a bit down (if it does again) simply doesn’t get it! This is REALLY going to the moon! 💎🦍💎🙌🚀 500k is the floor."
2021-06-02 10:05:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you 🚀🚀🚀 let’s get this short squeeze going I hope we see AMC at least at $500 per share this round!
2021-06-02 12:29:18,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood has halted AMC. Any other apps I can use that would allow me to buy more?

I’m a noob. So still learning."
2021-06-01 22:36:58,wallstreetbets,"25 shares deep and holding on with my greasy fat paws, just like I would be with an XXL popcorn while sitting alone at the theater"
2021-06-01 23:06:26,wallstreetbets,Read AMCs 13D Filing on March 21st
2021-06-01 23:58:08,wallstreetbets,"is there a way to check the percentages of calls exercised itm? i'm guessing there's a deteriorating correlation with price... but do you think (does anyone know) if there's any consideration of this as far as covering requirements?

is there the same potential for deep itm cover manipulation with ftd's?"
2021-06-02 00:02:33,wallstreetbets,Who’s going to habitually post the short interest and the Option Volumes?
2021-06-02 00:03:51,wallstreetbets,All right buying in top just like PLTR in 40s
2021-06-02 00:19:39,wallstreetbets,So my 12c should be safe?
2021-06-02 00:38:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 00:45:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-02 01:05:55,wallstreetbets,How do I buy TLDR?
2021-06-02 01:49:11,wallstreetbets,definitely bullish
2021-06-02 01:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Why AMC?
It is not the top of short interest list
Ie. 
WKHS is
Workhorse Group Inc.
@ 41.93% float shorted.

https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest

I wonder who is consistently exiting at the top of these memes stocks? I wonder which IPs are methodically spreading the frenzy?"
2021-06-02 02:00:08,wallstreetbets,Options volume may make AMC dip hard. Retards need to execute their options otherwise the MM will sell the hedged stocks back in the open market. Same BS like last friday
2021-06-02 02:16:22,wallstreetbets,"The X factor is usually these halts when it moons. We saw it during the first big GME runs very few people try to sell while it's mooning but once it freezes panic sets in and the price often takes a quick violent dip at reopen as stops get filled.

Haven't been watching all day this time around but it seems like GME is more steady and AMC is more like an upward trending EKG."
2021-06-02 02:25:06,wallstreetbets,Just bought $500 more.  It's small I know but funds are short when vacation is next week 🤣
2021-06-02 03:01:41,wallstreetbets,Poor effort Brutus
2021-06-02 03:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Bag holding GME? Everybody holding that one is up at this point in the game. Plenty of time to average down and average back up.

For AMC I still have my old ones from FOMOing in January like an idiot thinking the recovery play is popping off faster than expected so let’s see where this goes"
2021-06-02 03:06:10,wallstreetbets,Does anyone really trust the Short interest from Perez any more? It’s pretty much proven to be terrible data.
2021-06-02 03:33:50,wallstreetbets,Good advice but don’t ever say “do your own research “ that’s Qanon voodoo
2021-06-02 04:23:35,wallstreetbets,Am I to late for the squeeze? Should I be waiting for a dip before apping in. I have just seen videos about AMC gonna be the next GME. Already made big losses on GME and BB previously. I don't want to miss the boat again but I feel like I already have. Not gonna lie FOMOing hard atm. Need some solid not financial advice. TY.
2021-06-02 04:45:32,wallstreetbets,but isn't AMC just selling more shares which undermines this process?
2021-06-02 05:34:15,wallstreetbets,My wife’s looking for a real man to impregnate her. You keen?
2021-06-02 05:52:23,wallstreetbets,You guys still use RobinHood ?
2021-06-02 06:15:01,wallstreetbets,Im 400% up but in put only 30$ in it...fuck

2021-06-02 06:39:12,wallstreetbets,bought 5 stocks right now. doing my part from europe
2021-06-02 07:27:44,wallstreetbets,Definitely won't continue much longer. RSI over 90 on almost all time frames. Very few stocks stay in that range for more than a day or two. Then big DUMP. Institutional selling at 9:30 open today will be epic.
2021-06-02 09:55:55,wallstreetbets,I like this infinite money glitch
2021-06-02 10:08:32,wallstreetbets,I like this post more than a titty.
2021-06-02 10:39:54,wallstreetbets,I hope to see that 100k a share I'm holding!
2021-06-02 10:59:37,wallstreetbets,How long are you holding AMC for?
2021-06-02 11:05:48,wallstreetbets,I like green crayons so I upvoted and awarded
2021-06-02 11:07:27,wallstreetbets,I can't read but bought more.

2021-06-02 12:19:53,wallstreetbets,What is the best platform to buy options in Canada? I want to get in on the stupidity but not sure where to start
2021-06-02 12:24:53,wallstreetbets,Holy jesus. My stock just went up higher than ever. I only do amc stock.  I'm new at this. This is wonderful 👏
2021-06-02 12:25:21,wallstreetbets,I'll just buy more because I'm retarded!!!  🚀 🚀
2021-06-02 12:36:08,wallstreetbets,And what do we do when they halt trading?
2021-06-02 12:37:33,wallstreetbets,This aged well
2021-06-02 12:42:12,wallstreetbets,it was halted for some minutes
2021-06-02 12:58:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that. Can you please explain how to know whether option volume is big or small? How to read these numbers on Yahoo Finance? Thank you
2021-06-02 13:03:43,wallstreetbets,This $hit is real.
2021-06-02 13:53:01,wallstreetbets,Can you give us updates on the state of the option trading volume and the short interests even tho you sold most of your shares... 😜
2021-06-02 14:33:17,wallstreetbets,So let me get this straight? I help by buying calls?
2021-06-02 14:38:03,wallstreetbets,It worked‼️👏🏼
2021-06-02 16:35:03,wallstreetbets,Volume on the option chain is still strong...lot of room to grow

2021-06-01 22:37:04,wallstreetbets,This sounds like FUD in disguise.
2021-06-01 22:05:56,wallstreetbets,"This post in no way even acknowledges the fact that there are literally billions upon billions of synthetic shares that will need to be bought out of the market. All this takes into account are reported “on the books” short positions. I see people on this sub talking about 100 dollars lol. I don’t see any possible way in holy hell that this stock doesn’t surpass 1000, and in my opinion can realistically see it surpassing 10k. The general consensus among the amc apes is 100k-500k floor. Now, we can argue all day about how realistic that is but I don’t think it’s a bad thing for people trying to take this to the limits. And by god, depending on how many naked shorts and IOUs there are out there, who fuckin knows."
2021-06-02 09:59:29,wallstreetbets,"So, buy more AMC? Got it. 💎🙌"
2021-06-02 12:28:29,wallstreetbets,Robinhood at it again just halted AMC trading
2021-06-02 01:13:08,wallstreetbets,Hey so this made me feel a lot better and I have done my research! And I feel very confident in what it’s going to become so now I just really hope everyone else is all in cause I bought ETC at 12.23 and sold it around $127i took those earnings and dumped it all on AMC SOOOO I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE READY TO GO BALLS TO THE WALL BABY!!!!!! LETS STICK IT TO THESE BIG WIGS!!!!
2021-06-02 07:36:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm ashamed to say I pulled out today. I'm a poor ass student who should not have bought in the first place, so seeing i could suddenly make an 80% profit, i paper handed.

I am sorry brothers.

2021-06-02 07:25:16,wallstreetbets,The real catalyst that no one seems to mention is that the feds are doing a share count right now….apparently we are going to hear in the next 3-5 days what the feds come up with.  If it comes back that there are more shares shorted than is being reported this thing is going full bazooka rocket mode.  Place your bets…

2021-06-02 01:08:52,wallstreetbets,"My Ape interpretation:

No 💎 🙌 bagholders exist because ATH

🧻 🙌 Are bagholders

Buy more options around the 40 strike for gama squeeze.  Don't buy too far from the strike or the gamma squeeze won't happen.

Maybe $10 idk havent dug into it yet. My biggest worry is for people who will hold for infinity and see massive gains turn into massive losses. It's sheer stupidity. Up 100%?

2021-06-02 08:35:19,wallstreetbets,"> There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going, continuing so on and so forth.

This is a large oversimplification. Call options do not force a gamma squeeze unless the SP approaches said call option strikes. If what you said had any bearing in reality GME would have hit and exceeded 800 a long time ago."

From what I gather, the open interest means these calls haven't been actioned yet and therefore the rise in aftermarket yesterday means they likely started to get delta hedged?

If that's right, that would then explain the $40 strike calls with 75k volume and 28k open interest starting to get delta hedged as well? Hence price jumping up to the current pre market price.

2021-06-02 08:49:47,wallstreetbets,You asking about what it might break today? (Yes)
2021-06-02 11:39:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm hearing that number as a minimum on the streets but I ain't selling 'til $100,000, personally. Same for GME - I expect both to make me a millionaire, nothing less before selling."
2021-06-02 00:21:45,wallstreetbets,Are you? Bc that would be foolish if so.
2021-06-01 22:10:43,wallstreetbets,market makers are. they do it because its an actual job for them. they provide supply for the demand of options. they profit by scalping the bid/ask of the option price. so u know how u buy an option and theres a bid for like $1 and an ask for like $1.5? market makers are the ones who decide that and they buy at 1 and sell at 1.5 so they profit 5c per contract.
2021-06-02 04:57:56,wallstreetbets,You can compare the Volume with the average volume which averages the last three months. Additionally you can look at the volume compared to the float which is 448m shares as stated in the post. For amc I personally would say anything above 200m is pretty high but we’ve seen numbers above 600m already.
2021-06-02 01:12:20,wallstreetbets,This is why it is no GME
2021-06-02 05:44:25,wallstreetbets,They didn’t though. The agreement was already made in Dec/Jan in exchange for a loan of cash to aid cashflow. The shares were already owned by Black rock as well they weren’t new shares
2021-06-01 23:05:00,wallstreetbets,Banning amc trading on any platform will affect the stock price no matter what platform youre on.

2021-06-02 11:16:43,wallstreetbets,"second this. Noob, but this is a good opportunity to learn. i'm on the options page of AMC. But not sure how to interrupt the volume data. Do i need to feed it to a graph and look for up/down trends?

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/options?p=AMC"
2021-06-02 13:10:49,wallstreetbets,"I understood everything he said but at what amount is option volume considered low and how low would the short interest need to be for the peak to occur.

Also how long would the peak develop based off these indicators. That day? The next weeks opening?

I know if the price gets to he 250-300 range i’ll be looking intently for the peak

We gotta be smart enough to learn from what happened with gme.

At that price i’ll be making about 5k from my 150 investment at 8 dollars months ago during the gme meme hype"
2021-06-02 14:14:27,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah man! Glad you made hella money!
2021-06-01 23:09:29,wallstreetbets,I pissed my pants laughing at the last sentence
2021-06-02 02:15:07,wallstreetbets,Yes your stop may have to be a little wider due to the crazy volatility so you don’t get kicked out too soon I prefer trailing stops so if it moons the stop will follow it up effectively securing profits at the top
2021-06-02 06:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes definitely put a safety net, stoploss or a trail, just in case. I'm riding this with a stop at my entry. It's nothing more than bag avoidance right now.

This is my own experience: One holds bag a lot longer than the time it takes for another great play to appear.

Meaning, it's better to cut your profits a bit short on the current play and have free cash for the next one.(instead of having it tied up in a huge bag that will take years to recover)"
2021-06-02 12:35:01,wallstreetbets,So what now?
2021-06-02 01:23:01,wallstreetbets,How many shares do you own and at what price did you purchase? Did you use a call option if so what strike price by what date?
2021-06-01 22:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Casino."
2021-06-01 22:15:48,wallstreetbets,"AMC big call options placed, potential gamma squeeze, shorts forced to cover, stock soars

Or, you know, you could just read the tl;dr at the top of the page"
2021-06-02 07:19:27,wallstreetbets,And they have good reason to believe that.
2021-06-02 08:12:17,wallstreetbets,No the HF are just letting everyone buy at the top before they short it again and make everyone panic and sell for a loss/trigger stop loss so they don’t buy into it again
2021-06-02 11:42:26,wallstreetbets,Somebody correct me if I'm wrong but I think it is actually has a higher short percentage of float than GME.
2021-06-02 12:19:55,wallstreetbets,55$ now lol 😂
2021-06-02 06:39:35,wallstreetbets,Guaranteed. But I wouldn't buy weekly puts. Yet.
2021-06-02 03:14:46,wallstreetbets,"RKT gama squeezed but it didn't have a short squeeze therefore it fell right after. Along with that, RKT doesn't have the same salience as AMC does. GME/AMC they squeezed and dropped afterwards. For GME it was because robinhood locked up trading which killed the other meme stocks. But look at GME/AMC now, even though they were already thrown down they're climbing back up which shows that it's fairly resiliant"
2021-06-02 02:10:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm skeptical now because AMC already hit mid 30s so most of the hedging should have already occurred through $30-40 options. 

But if enough Apes are believing it can be self fulfilling at a certain point so might take a look at some calls in the 40s."
2021-06-01 23:58:25,wallstreetbets,It was a sale to mudroch (close enough name)for like 8.5 million shares which was then sold on the market causing the morning drop from $33 to $31 ish
2021-06-02 03:49:55,wallstreetbets,GME never squeezed
2021-06-02 04:26:59,wallstreetbets,June 4 or 11?

2021-06-02 14:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Right i said he took profits, didn't specify how. The entire point was just that it's good to keep profits periodically, along with that i did say in my post i exited all calls and am holding shares. Mind telling me what i said that's incorrect?"
2021-06-02 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Ima scared of that so I just buy and sell shares so far

2021-06-02 03:15:33,wallstreetbets,No it's because WSB is compromised. This guy only has one post and somehow this is on front page. They want people to sell gme and fomo into AMC.
2021-06-02 03:17:06,wallstreetbets,Also DFV returned to twitter after over a month and not a single post was made about it on this sub. That's fucking insane. Remember the 25 new mods or whatever? Yeah someone got bought out. This sub is over.

2021-06-01 22:27:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah I read the stock dipped a couple dollars and then immediately recovered within a minute.
2021-06-01 22:13:27,wallstreetbets,That's actually very interesting... Either way I guess we just weathered through it because AMC skyrocketted instead of fell. The gamma squeeze was stronger than the sell off
2021-06-02 03:08:36,wallstreetbets,Citadel owns 5% of mudrick (read that somewhere) so theres that. I think it just sparked more people to double down.
2021-06-02 01:09:32,wallstreetbets,Just because you sell at a massive profit doesn't make you an ally to the shorters. It makes you a smart businessman. People act all butt hurt when a CEO or a company sells their shares if they see a long term overvaluation and need the cash injection. Boo hoo.

2021-06-02 09:53:32,wallstreetbets,Better dump that short position or get ready for that margin call
2021-06-02 05:02:47,wallstreetbets,"No i doubt it. GME was a special case in which there was something called an ""infinite short squeeze"" which means that over 100% of shares were floated, meaning that short holders could never cover if all shares are bought up. But AMC going to 100 or 2 might be possible."
2021-06-02 09:27:44,wallstreetbets,I did exactly this yesterday.
2021-06-02 15:27:08,wallstreetbets,The squeeze hasn't happened yet. Short interest% is still high and rising (check Ortex)
2021-06-02 03:39:33,wallstreetbets,That's what I said when I sold call credit spreads at 20/21 for June 25th 2 weeks back
2021-06-02 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Why would anyone do something so stupid?

Not advice just wondering."
2021-06-02 05:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Never said I was. I use Interactive Brokers for algo trading, TDAmeritrade for normal trading, and fidelity for a roth, but i know a lot of people still use RH so if RH shuts it down again id imagine it'd cause another scare and still prevent a large number of people from trading."
2021-06-02 08:44:22,wallstreetbets,"While it is an oversimplification, i believe explaining the way the greeks functioned and how market makers stayed delta neutral based off of if was beyond the scope of this post. GME didn't exceed 800 because unfortunately...

1. A lot of people paper handed and sold when GME earnings were bad which caused it to drop to 160$
2. Options are incredibly expensive relative to what AMC is at
3. market was fairly bearish due to inflation fears which influences all stocks across the board generally

But recently GME option volume has seen a sharp increase along with AMC, hence it rallying up to 250$/share. While GME is great and i'm still a tard bag holding it because i believe this phenomenon will continue, a bit comparison would be Tesla. Tesla over the course of a year just kept shooting up and up and up, most likely because of multiple Gamma and short squeezes. And now a ""fair value price"" is 400$ pre split, but it's sitting comfy at a 500-700$ value post 1-4 split."

2021-06-02 18:58:50,wallstreetbets,Same! I bought back in January for an average $13.50 then paper handed at $30 after it hit $36 and went back down. I bought back in at $43. Wish I got more when it was still $30.

2021-06-02 14:17:35,wallstreetbets,Your post literally saved my portfolio from going to shit. Thank you seriously

2021-06-02 01:27:38,wallstreetbets,He was dumb enough to sell those batches of shares at 9 instead of waiting. This is why he has to do all of this sneaky underhanded stuff now. His own ape community believes in his company more than he does.
2021-06-02 05:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Because this is misinformation and the guy who wrote this doesn't even understand what a ""synthetic share"" is."
2021-06-02 16:44:39,wallstreetbets,"That's why it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.  There a 'big fish' group im in that are all talking about the feds doing a share count on AMC to see if the dtcc is doing their job or if they are pulling the same shit they pulled with GME.  By the sounds of it, they expect there to be an announcement or PR in the coming \~24 hours.  If it comes out that this bitch is shorted anywhere near 75% this thing is going to go into a feeding frenzy.  Like I said, place your bets tomorrow am.  All of these people are predicting the count is fukt and insiders know this is coming and obviously the volume velocity right now is only helping the situation.

I really have no proof or link so you will just have to take some strangers word for it but I first got this info on May 13th....right when this all started and they've been right all along and they are saying the way this is going $100 is not crazy.

Honestly have no fucking clue how they know all this as this has to be close to impossible to predict but they've been right so far so i'm gonna keep riding this train and my avg. cost basis is $11.75 so obviously i'm in a great position."
2021-06-02 10:25:08,wallstreetbets,😳🧐🤔 soooo weird being in the green
2021-06-02 10:23:25,wallstreetbets,It is surprisingly. For some odd reason today my portfolio is in the green and not red 🤔🤔 I guess for once I didn’t buy high and sell low
2021-06-02 10:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Don’t have a short position lol. I sold my $39c earlier and that’s why the price shot up to over $41😂 made a little bit of profit, definitely not used to that"

2021-06-02 07:46:19,wallstreetbets,Did you roll them or close them
2021-06-02 08:14:33,wallstreetbets,You are selling like 40 deltas at that price. Very high probability of touch and breach. I am in the boonies. If it does 300% I will adjust. Rather play the math at this point for a company going to 0.
2021-06-02 05:04:49,wallstreetbets,"Ah okay, good. Scared me there for a sec. But yes, fair point, although millions of RH users have switched out by now, so will probably have a lot less impact if they try that shit again."
2021-06-02 08:50:01,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Just felt it was worth mentioning that it's not an inevitable domino effect, just a possibility provided people continue to buy/don't sell."
2021-06-02 01:32:18,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply!
I’m more of a long term kinda guy, but if there’s opportunities to make quick loot by buying & selling in a smaller timeframe, etc. I’d definitely be interested."
2021-06-02 01:45:15,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking about investing a little bit into AMC, is this a stock you guys think gets the green light to buy right now?
Sorry, I know I’m new to this subreddit and haven’t invested too much in any one stock for quite a bit (I regret that, lol)."

2021-06-02 01:20:24,wallstreetbets,Hold on to $Tell and you will be rewarded for your patience. There will be several more deals announced in the next few weeks and months. This is just the beginning. I’ve been in since 2019 and have followed every move of the company since.

2021-06-02 02:09:51,wallstreetbets,"It's working out for me. As soon as my stimulus check hit, I threw another 500 in AMC because I was baked and thought it was a good idea at the time ($12/share) and turns out it was legit the best idea I've ever had whilst high."
2021-06-02 16:46:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is the way. Make more irrational decisions high, and while sober make good judgments on when to sell, swing or play the other side.... Look at it this way, if you didn’t get high....you would t have bought those shares that were worth $36,500 today....smoke the grass and get the cash!! 🤣"

2021-06-02 08:37:57,wallstreetbets,At this point you do the opposite imo.  Buy OTM puts that don't expire until next year or later.  I would never recommend buying calls when something has already blown up.

2021-06-02 03:57:34,wallstreetbets,I think I get what options are at this point but ehat makes puts or calls better than straight out buying shares?
2021-06-02 12:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I bought 50 shares in January (should have did the 200 I said I was). Today I decided to sell 15 of those shares which gave me double my money back.

The rest I'm just going to wait and see if this goes up like gme did.

Either way I made more than my money back."

2021-06-02 02:48:31,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it depends on your specific risk tolerance just in general for any volatile meme stock I’d say between 25-35%, which imo is a good balance between letting the stock move freely without stopping you out and being too loose to where you aren’t securing a great amount of profits at the top wherever the top may be. Again all depends on your personal risk tolerance this is just how I do it others experience may vary."
2021-06-02 09:09:01,wallstreetbets,No that's what costs the idiot redditors you use memes to place money you don't have to help something you offer on a call option sell
2021-06-01 22:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Buy and hold, good sir, buy and hold"
2021-06-02 11:46:51,wallstreetbets,If there is enough buying pressure to keep this up than there is a chance that it will shoot up like GME did. How high? Who knows.
2021-06-02 11:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Right now AMC is gonna keep going up because of all of that. So if you have it, continue to hold. If you don't, buy the small dips and keep demand up."

2021-06-02 12:43:19,wallstreetbets,Nope and I’m sure as hell glad it didn’t. Tried reverse psychology for once and it worked lol
2021-06-02 10:25:44,wallstreetbets,I've got a stop limit set at $32 juuuuuuust in case but I'm very happy with the stock today so far 😁

2021-06-02 09:08:05,wallstreetbets,If you don't sell today at the precise time I believe this will be a very sad stock until six months to a year from now
2021-06-02 02:55:14,wallstreetbets,You’re not wrong.  But the word I used to describe the post was ‘classic’ - consistent with what you described:  ‘serving as a model’.  OP nailed it.
2021-06-02 12:37:48,wallstreetbets,"""...when she **thought** you that..."" Fucking idiot."
2021-06-02 10:09:01,wallstreetbets,"140 shares at $14 on January, still holding"
2021-06-02 01:28:49,wallstreetbets,You think this stock is going to continue to rip from here? It looks like there is leg room for some major movement still and the CEO means business. I think it could head to maybe $10 in the short term.
2021-06-02 12:09:58,wallstreetbets,But if it doesnt dip how will I sell at a loss?!?!
2021-06-02 05:10:01,wallstreetbets,What does that mean?
2021-06-02 08:39:02,wallstreetbets,For sure. I don’t know enough about puts and calls to even trust myself managing them lol. I need to read up
2021-06-02 14:30:02,wallstreetbets,Won't the premium be expensive for such a long ass put?

2021-06-02 12:04:53,wallstreetbets,"They literally just mentioned the fact that there are people who got in at the peak and have been holding in the red ever since, and that they don't want that to be the case with people who fomo into amc (so they're arguable making the same argument about amc). Has nothing to do with whether it's over or gme will hit that ath again, just that it hasn't yet. Y'all scream FUD anytime anything isn't overwhelmingly optimistic about gme even when it's tangential. No one's shitting on the stock. If they were they'd be shitting on both amc and gme by this logic.

Edit: typos"

2021-06-02 02:53:54,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the insight.

Based on that, I think I'll try being a little more ballsy and set mine to 20% trail so that I can still get out around $30 if for whatever reason it starts to collapse at market open.


Also, I'll probably be still awake around the market opening time, so if the pre-market activity starts looking too ominous I'll just adjust accordingly."
2021-06-02 11:48:21,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! I have 200 that I bought I January and have been holding, I just wasn’t sure if I should treat it like gme and hold forever or if it’ll pop soon"

2021-06-02 12:23:55,wallstreetbets,Hahaha me too. Up over 500% on this shit
2021-06-02 09:59:31,wallstreetbets,"I only bought $12 worth on Stash, so I’m not so worried about losing that, lol. But thanks for your reply because I wanted someone’s opinion about it before I actually invested “real money” into it. Now I’m just going to stick with that $12, haha."
2021-06-02 11:19:47,wallstreetbets,How much do you expect it to reach before falling again? I have no experience in stocks at all but wanna get in seeing as I have some money to burn. I had the chance to buy at $26 a few days ago and I regret passing on it ffs.
2021-06-02 13:29:57,wallstreetbets,"8.7 shares at 9.50, can I come on the ship too?"
2021-06-02 07:20:47,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I think there is a lot of room left for it to run, even in the short term. The next catalyst will be the next deal announcement within a few weeks time. And then within a year I could see it being $20+."
2021-06-02 05:16:16,wallstreetbets,Other Wall Street firms can sense that the end is near for Citadel and they are about to be margin called. Institutions aren't lending them out any shares to short today.

2021-06-02 16:58:32,wallstreetbets,Yes but once it moves back that premium should go up. There’s always risk that IV dries up but a good broker has tools to model that stuff. I’m no expert though
2021-06-02 16:59:25,wallstreetbets,No clue. Seems like a safe bet to me but I’m also wrong about half the time 🤷🏻‍♂️

2021-06-01 22:10:02,wallstreetbets,That fuzzy picture with just a boob is oddly always a good wank. Probably because of the desperation. Desperation wanks are always good. Like trying to pull one out before your wife/girlfriend gets home and you know you’re cutting it close.

2021-06-02 05:21:06,wallstreetbets,"BB is the better company. BB has a mkt cap of $6.7B vs AMC’s $14.4B. 
AMC owns and operates movies theaters, while BB is an EV play and is in cybersecurity. This is an area I see the running room for massive growth - spending by both governments and corporations will be a driver. So from a growth perspective one of these companies is the clear winner."
2021-06-02 05:40:06,wallstreetbets,AMC is higher risk greater reward. BB is a long term play. You could probably get in on BB after AMC.

2021-06-02 07:15:09,wallstreetbets,"If amc tanks, bb tanks."
2021-06-02 09:13:03,wallstreetbets,Amc has the most upside over the next few weeks. I’m in both plays.
2021-06-02 05:48:58,wallstreetbets,"I have 400 that *SHOULD* hit my account today. If it does, it’s BB time. Save me a bunk on the rocket, would you? I’m comin’ too!"
2021-06-02 13:51:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Haha yeah I allocate 5% of my portfolio to meme stocks so no worries. I’ve got the 💎 🙌
2021-06-02 07:15:39,wallstreetbets,Why this?
2021-06-02 10:43:53,wallstreetbets,You sure? Or is there a chance that AMC will drop completely over the next few days?
2021-06-02 14:03:54,wallstreetbets,"LOL, was just looking at this move for amc & gme & if BB does something similar, could very well see $50."
2021-06-02 07:25:11,wallstreetbets,Their movements are correlated
2021-06-02 10:55:55,wallstreetbets,If you are unsure do your own DD. There’s plenty out there
2021-06-02 07:38:22,wallstreetbets,But dont they are completely different stocks? Why are they correlated?
2021-06-02 11:43:26,wallstreetbets,I just collect some thoughts of the members here.... so let me get your thought about the journey with AMC
2021-06-02 07:43:40,wallstreetbets,Meme stocks move together
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,AMC 40c yolo it’s going to bust tomorrow gg 
2021-06-01 22:25:58,wallstreetbets,"Up some $5 after hours.  I'm not waiting until tomorrow, I just sent the wife over to your house.  She is on fire, I diddled her a little before she left."
2021-06-01 21:22:26,wallstreetbets,That shit bout to be BUSSSSSIN! May AMC bless you with enough tendies to enjoy hookers and blow daily for life.
2021-06-01 21:43:11,wallstreetbets,Lambos or food stamps
2021-06-01 23:37:15,wallstreetbets,"GL! I tried posting my positions but it keeps getting deleted. Closed over $1,000,000 for the first time today, mostly thanks to AMC. 🚀"
2021-06-01 22:21:14,wallstreetbets,I’ve got 413 $34 calls for Friday exp. Can anyone tell me what those are worth now with AMC @ $38? Thx
2021-06-01 21:32:42,wallstreetbets,I don’t know why I still can’t understand what I’m looking at ? I really need to figure out how to trade options...
2021-06-01 21:23:32,wallstreetbets,You're thinking too low. HIGHER.
2021-06-01 21:29:29,wallstreetbets,I got 100 33c for friday exp.
2021-06-01 21:38:01,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping my 40c for June 6 are in play.
2021-06-02 05:35:06,wallstreetbets,This aged well
2021-06-02 02:00:35,wallstreetbets,I think you're using the word bust wrong. Bust has a negative connotation in the markets
2021-06-01 21:34:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm his wife's boyfriend, and okay with that deal...Prestige tell your wife I said heeeeyyyyyyyy👅👅👅"

2021-06-01 22:30:39,wallstreetbets,I'd sell early no matter what you've already made a good chunk
2021-06-01 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Exp is September, this aint a yolo. Sell these and buy for this friday and then u can sleep with my wifes boyfriend."

2021-06-02 08:13:10,wallstreetbets,"You can use the option delta as an approximation. If the delta is 0.50, the option will move $0.50 for every $1 the stock moves. The delta is also moving all the time, as the option gets closer/farther from being ITM (delta is close to 1 if ITM)."

2021-06-01 22:06:49,wallstreetbets,I’m with you
2021-06-02 02:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Idk at least he can learn, honestly like a true retard I learned most I know about stocks here. I've been helping a few other people get into and learn about it too"

2021-06-01 22:32:00,wallstreetbets,"I would guess you about over 1,600$"
2021-06-01 22:03:20,wallstreetbets,"I dont really factor in pre/post market, shit changes over night, sometimes for the better. Sometimes for the worse."
2021-06-01 22:24:31,wallstreetbets,You should take aftermarket and pre-market prices with a grain of salt. Volume is way to low to reflect anything.
2021-06-02 07:19:49,wallstreetbets,Thank you for outing yourself. This is not a place to learn. Plz leave.

2021-06-01 22:05:33,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely true
2021-06-02 01:12:24,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t change price of options
2021-06-02 10:11:07,wallstreetbets,Lol I already know plenty but nice job gatekeeping
2021-06-02 05:57:48,wallstreetbets,I think your wrong well see 🙂
2021-06-02 15:17:51,wallstreetbets,"AH will be awesome 200% easily, confidence is key!"
2021-06-01 22:44:03,wallstreetbets,"For those bad at math, 413 x 100 x $3.85 = $159,005"
2021-06-01 22:07:41,wallstreetbets,I primarily trade options so I have to put my phone down after 4 so I dont get too excited
2021-06-02 08:50:31,wallstreetbets,It’s a good sign premarket is up 20% so it technically means something I understand the option price won’t change till 930am but again it’s value is growing.
2021-06-02 09:10:58,wallstreetbets,All I heard was “re-entry into atmosphere at 33 before liftoff resumes. “
2021-06-01 23:01:52,wallstreetbets,Holy shit
2021-06-02 00:27:43,wallstreetbets,I need to do this. I always get so excited pre and post when I have calls but it crazy how much all the meme stocks move every opening
2021-06-02 09:27:33,wallstreetbets,Well i guess you could be right 😆
2021-06-02 09:43:07,wallstreetbets,Ow haha im just looking what is happening and it appears not to be so
2021-06-02 18:11:30,wallstreetbets,"Update I’m so happy I was wrong, my 4.65 @32 call option is up 4 grand. My 61 shares at 9$ is now up right over four grand"

""The Beige Book is one of the many inputs to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that helps the Committee to formulate monetary policy—mainly through adjustments to the federal funds interest rate target.""

""**Big Picture and Key Sectors**Not only do the National Summary and the District Summaries provide an overview of economic conditions, they also include information on key sectors and industries. For example, in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, the survey results are typically organized to begin with an overview that is followed by paragraphs that report on conditions in the following key sectors and industries:

* Prices and Wages
* Retail Trade and the Services
* Manufacturing
* Real Estate and Construction
* Agricultural and Resource-related Industries
* Financial Services""

* Best case for bulls is to gap above 420.48.
* 421.21 will act as new resistance level before more upside to 422.
* Best case for bears is that they hold 419.76 - 420.48

Weekly Timeframe - bear porn (i'm not calling top or CrAsH) - Just pointing out major levels here. We do have some upside potential still.

* I did point out a healthy correction bearish pt since iNfLaTiON is still on everyone's mind. This does not indicate that I'm calling a cRaSh!!!

2021-06-02 01:15:12,wallstreetbets,This will print HARD
2021-06-02 02:05:25,wallstreetbets,This aged well congrats
2021-06-02 05:07:30,wallstreetbets,Where is the journey going to? Will it touch the $100 mark or more or maybe less just $20? what do you think?
2021-06-02 12:20:35,wallstreetbets,Will AMC follow GME to the multiple hundreds?
2021-06-02 00:40:37,wallstreetbets,Would a 51$ call that expires June 18th @ 3.18 cent be a bad “idea” to look at 👀👀
2021-06-01 22:03:16,wallstreetbets,The $6.05 is the strike price right? But what is the $32?

2021-06-01 20:20:57,wallstreetbets,So do y’all actually have that much money to pay for that shit or how do you profit / cover expenses? New to calls / puts
2021-06-02 02:06:38,wallstreetbets,I got $36 $37 and $49 calls and I think they all might hit.
2021-06-02 07:46:56,wallstreetbets,Sei g pre market hit $44 ape think $100
2021-06-01 22:45:42,wallstreetbets,"32 is the strike price, the 6.05 is the value of the contract - if you wanted to buy that contract rn it would cost you $6.05 per share (or $605 per contract)"

2021-06-02 09:24:40,wallstreetbets,"In the money options are more likely to expire at profit.

Out of the money has a cheaper premium, but less likely to turn a profit. They are more risky essentially, but can offer a greater profit if the share price moves in your favour."
2021-06-02 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,"30,000"
2021-06-02 12:38:46,wallstreetbets,BOOM. closed all call positions at $60. Massive haul!!
2021-06-01 22:29:53,wallstreetbets,You just sell the option back to the market before it expires if you don’t want to exercise.
2021-06-01 21:21:46,wallstreetbets,I have enough to actually exercise my calls if it comes down too it
2021-06-02 07:51:57,wallstreetbets,"When it touchs $100, when would it be?"
2021-06-01 23:01:22,wallstreetbets,"
Thank you for the clarification! ❤️ 

So basically, l could buy this option contract which says that I could at anytime until the expiration date buy AMC share for $32 no matter what the market price is. However, I need to pay $605 to purchase this contact. 

And you purchased this contract because you believe that within the set expiration date AMC will skyrocket?😉

So if we supposed that within this period the share goes to $100 then you will have the right to buy it for $32 due to the contact which makes you a profit of $68 per share with a total of $6,800 😍 deducting the option price which is $605 you will exactly have $6,195 😍 

Im I getting this right?"
2021-06-02 17:39:47,wallstreetbets,Amazing.
2021-06-02 09:40:16,wallstreetbets,So if it’s started to drop in price you just sell your option back and just lose the premiums you paid?
2021-06-02 00:08:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-01 23:40:59,wallstreetbets,Yes you're exactly correct.
2021-06-02 09:41:56,wallstreetbets,"It’s not that you lose the premium. It’s that you bought the option for a certain price ($2.00).

If the price drops and you try to sell it back, who is still going to buy the same option you bought for 2.00 now?

No one. They might buy it off you for 1.50 or something

Or the price of the underlying stock goes up, now your option is more valuable and you can sell the option itself for more."

2021-06-01 20:56:51,wallstreetbets,You're insane in a good way. You got bawls
2021-06-01 21:48:05,wallstreetbets,This should make you some gains... Two weeks ago was I think the last time this stock dipped and I bought in more.  Solid recovery business and they had so much less cash burn than their competition.  Should hit 45 November.
2021-06-01 20:24:29,wallstreetbets,"If it breaks 33.12, 40.00 should be the next stop by Sept"
2021-06-02 05:25:19,wallstreetbets,"All the dumb nay sayers were saying not to invest in NCLH because of dilution and maybe things would never recover after COVID, but look at where this is now vs. March 2020. My common sense told me to go into this stock and other travel related ones, but I kept buying into the ""be cautious"" nonsense."
2021-06-02 08:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Hope you win, cuz if you do I win!

&#x200B;

Though I only win like $1700... Maybe i'm doing this wrong."

2021-06-02 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone have a view on their corporate bonds? I’m holding 500 calls in the money, and am wondering what their corporate bonds are trading at now. Anyone have a view on that? Also why is the CDC not approving Alaska sailing, as they promised Del Rio a 5 day turn around."
2021-06-01 21:04:35,wallstreetbets,This will print big time
2021-06-01 21:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree, among the big 3 cruise lines NCLH is the most well positioned and well run imo."
2021-06-01 20:29:25,wallstreetbets,"AH looks good, I'm hoping tomorrow we hit 52 week high. My plan is to hold until December or roll the calls to a further expiration date.

I believe the underlying covid risk for cruise industry is almost eliminated and we should see increasing demand reflected on q3 with the Alaska cruises.

Unless we see some unexpected COVID variant, I think cruises is well positioned to rocket up to +40."
2021-06-02 08:32:57,wallstreetbets,Yup. I originally started with my life savings in covid plays over a year ago. Basically psyched myself out of holding from reading shit online so i sold and started trading options. Oh mannnn...
2021-06-01 20:37:27,wallstreetbets,"Im in heavy, too.  Holding until at least November.  I understand the dilution argument but fundamentals dont seem to matter in 2021"
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$AMC Lol. I might have gone a little overboard. Another bet that might work out. What’s the phrase? Good Luck Apes?

2021-06-01 20:12:07,wallstreetbets,Lol you are going to have tits so jacked tomorrow you won’t be able to wear a shirt.
2021-06-01 21:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Great questions. Here are some answers 

1) I live in the US. Beautiful country and has given me so much. Thank you 🇺🇸 

2) I didn’t grow up here though so from time to time I purchase unlocked fruit company phones from a country in a different part of the world. I guess that’s how the expirations show up as 4/6 instead of 6/4. 

3) Full disclosure: of the 520* contracts about 110 are call writes: I.e. $47 and $50 calls expiring this Friday. If AMC doubles in a massive squeeze, I’ve got a different problem to sort out. Not a bad one just a bothersome one. Likely gotta buy to close or exercise (unlikely) but open to ideas.

4) I think RH does this thing where if you close a position intraday it updates the gain/loss. My gain for AMC today was about 60k. positions now ITM were partly closed while the rest remain open as you can see. 

Apologies for any confusion and/or sloppy posting  and thank you for point out some great things!"
2021-06-02 13:38:30,wallstreetbets,"UPDATE @ 10.40am Pacific Time on June 2nd 2021.

2021-06-01 20:20:38,wallstreetbets,It's crazy how much implied volatility these calls had. Those $32 calls will probably barely double if the price holds at open and that's after the stock went up almost $7 after hours.
2021-06-02 03:05:12,wallstreetbets,Don't sell.  Diamond hands to expiration date like a true ape.

2021-06-02 10:47:41,wallstreetbets,"you should reduce some risk, you don't need both the $25 & $26 strikes just the $25's work, and same with the $32 and $31 calls, just the $31's suffice.  For the small difference in strikes, the potential profit does NOT equal the amount of risk you have.  Hell, sell the $26 and $32's or at least 1/2 of each, and even at $100 you're only making $1 more for each contract.  I understand the whole YOLO, etc. stuff but this is still a financial transaction and your long-term goal should be booking substantial gains."

2021-06-01 22:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Great this country is starting to finally become more sensible. While weed should be legalized there should be better education on it and proper usage. Even if you’re a medical patient there’s not much you really learn until you’ve been smoking for a couple years.

 There also needs to be a ton more coverage on CHS or Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, a deadly disease some can develop after years of smoking but others have in just months or even just single usage of 5mg edible has caused a woman to have a 6hr vomiting episode. Other more intense symptoms for people who have larger episodes are the vomiting from hours to months where it is uncontrollable and impossible to keep down anything. Then after that there’s nausea, indigestion and difficulty with certain foods, seizures, fainting, acid reflux, kidney failure from dehydration, inability to regulate temperature with sweating tons while you sleep and constantly being freezing while awake, diarrhea and stomach pain for what could be a few days to months or even over a year for those who have it extremely bad. 

There’s not much information about this to most of the public and I believe that it’s causing many more people problems but they’re not as severe so they don’t tie it together with weed. After all “weed is harmless”. I would like to see weed legalized all over and destigmatized along with more education on usage such as recommending use of a log journal to track your experience, amount used and then it would make for a better way to find strains that you really enjoy. There should also be some information in the dispensaries on walls that talks about it. They should also talk about how higher thc percentage does not equal better and ends up worse for your tolerance making smoking in the future less of an experience and more mundane. There should be a shift in the growing community to start pushing out lower thc strains under 20% rather than trying to push out artificial numbers from 35-42% like some of the growers in the medical program."

Thought I'd add also socially they're pretty damn progressive.  I've got the most diverse team I've ever worked with (1/3rd of my trainees don't even speak English), there's affinity groups for every minority, veterans,  and LGBT. Just don't try to unionize lmao

We did have a meeting once with the technical teams and one of the executives. He was having a conversation with someone just before the meeting started and it turned to drug testing. He jokingly told the tech he was talking to ""yup, thats why you are here"". I turned to him and with an excited voice asked ""What sort of drugs are we testing?"". not something you expect someone to say to an Exec, but he laughed pretty solidly at it.

Amazons cornering of this market comes at enormous costs despite their improvements in some areas. When a company gets that large you have to know that it wasn‘t because they were ethically sound and looking out for the little guy."

You can argue this point and it’s a straw man point but a perfect example of this is Cg Kid on YouTube who talks about how terrible his weed withdrawals were and how he used other drugs to cope for a while. I’ve heard 3-4 other peoples stories that are similar in that they turned to opiates to ease the pain and ended up dead. All I’m saying is how many people living on the street do you think suffer from this and turned to heroin to ease the pain?"

2021-06-01 23:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Where are you getting your facts? CHS symptoms cease upon cannabis usage cessation. It’s absolutely not lethal. Weed literally cannot kill you. Your brainstem has no cannabinoid receptors in it. If someone smokes enough weed to trigger CHS, and then chooses to start mainlining heroin instead of just laying off the weed, that’s a reflection on that individual’s capacity to make good choices, not on the deadliness of weed. There are still to this day a grand total of zero recorded cannabis overdose deaths. Ever."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Literally a DD on investing in a shit in the box and why it will make you tendies. (EXAS) Hello fellow autists, 

I have an opportunity you will love in a sector that is not covered as much as it should be. The diagnostic medicine sector is booming and with crazy advances in technology is growing exponentially and by getting into the industry leaders now the gains will be immaculate. 

Exact Sciences Corp. (EXAS) is the play. 

&#x200B;

**What is the company and what do they do?**  They are a molecular diagnostics company specializing in the detection of early stage cancers. The company's initial focus was on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer and in 2014 it launched Cologuard the first stool DNA test for colorectal cancer. 

Cologuard is the only stool-DNA screening test for detecting colon cancer that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It looks for changes in your DNA that could indicate the presence of colon cancer or precancerous polyps that might be present in your colon. **Cologuard is gaining popularity because it’s far less invasive, and more convenient, than the traditional** **colonoscopy** **test.**

You've probably seen their commercials about where you shit in the box and the mail man has to pick it up and send it to the lab. 

&#x200B;

[Recognize it now from TV?](https://preview.redd.it/yjw50kptlq271.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ada1cb21b69b7e814f345079960b03f9b430076)

**Why Cologuard?** 

Right now the company if it can capture just a 10% share of the projected $30 billion U.S. pan-cancer liquid biopsy market it would double revenue. With Exact one of two companies actively pursuing the market, there is potential to gain a significantly larger slice of the pie. And by them having a product that caters to potentially every 50+ year old that is less invasive and is easy as shitting in a box it will be easier. Plus all you gay bears out there, your buttholes after getting fucked in the biggest bull market will be real stretched out to fill those boxes when you're ready.

 The market is underestimating Cologuard’s staying power. It could take years for liquid biopsy to steal share, and Cologuard’s market share could soar past 10%. 

Their competitor is if a future liquid bioposy is made which could be more convenient but the technology still is not there yet and ether way they are making their own. A liquid biopsy works by detecting tumor DNA that has broken free of the cancer and is circulating in the blood and, to a lesser extent, has collected in the urine. 

Exact is positioned for growth regardless of how liquid biopsy plays out, and the firm’s pan-cancer initiative is a good hedge in case Cologuard feels competitive pressures. 

The firm is moving to other types of cancers now including lung cancer which all the kids who vaped will be getting early diagnosis and their lives saved while we make tendies. 

Conclusion: This company has crazy technology involving DNA stability, biomarker detection, hemoglobin detection/stability. You may not know anything I am saying but I took organic chem in college and made an A so I know maybe only one percent more then you cause I am a fellow autist too, but this shit is going to the moon. The healthcare sector is growing and technology is advancing and insurance companies are going to be paying for this by the shitload (No pun included). This sector is undervalued and under watched. Instead Shitty companies like Nikola and Ridestown motors that are gonna go out of business are taking air time on CNBC instead of this innovative company that only trades at a 18 billion dollar market cap that has multiple products, fighting multiple cancers, patents, and a much larger market share to grow into.

**Every Wall Street Analyst who covers this sector has a positive price target for this company using the ETRADE analyst research tab. It is currently trading at $108 and the PT range is from 115$ (6% upside) to 170.00$ (57% upside)**. Because this stock is literally investing in the act of shitting in a box it automatically gets a meme boost from wall street analysts so just add 20% more to that. 

And because gay bears who are tired of getting fucked in the ass will no longer want a coloscopy they will go to cologuard. 

 

Literally Can't go tits up. 🚀🚀

2021-06-01 23:45:49,wallstreetbets,"This is somewhat anecdotal, so take it as you will. [Back in 2018](https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21457), the ACS made a qualified recommendation that the age for screenings be moved back from 50 to 45. I had my annual this morning and brought this up to my doc. She said just two weeks ago it went from qualified ACS advice to national medical advice in the U.S. And in fact, [that appears to be true](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-45-wellness/index.html). 

Colorectal screenings will become slightly more frequent, presumably. I’m going with an old school colonoscopy this month rather than Cologuard, but I expect more Cologuard tests to be performed based upon this guidance change. YMMV."

2021-06-02 02:08:37,wallstreetbets,"Cologuard is definitely easier to get people to do than a colonoscopy. It’s also been available to patients and providers for 7+ years. Barriers to use include cost/lack of coverage by some insurance companies (less of a barrier now as some cover it) and provider/patient knowledge of it as a preferential option to simple iFOBT (the most common but less accurate put-your-poopsmear-on-a-piece-of-cardboard test which only detects blood—which, if you have colon cancer, is likely to show up, but not always, and if you have hemorrhoids or a stomach ulcer will cause a positive test too).
At this point, there will be no excuse for insurance companies to NOT cover this. The onus will be on the company to get more physicians to order it!"

2021-06-02 18:55:07,wallstreetbets,It is cheaper than a colonoscopy & covered by medicaid and other insurers. If that's all true it would be a good tool for doctors to do a screen for clients who don't have a family history or other high-risk indicators. It's a relatively low investment of time and effort for the patient and if it's covered by insurance than they don't lose any money. Then they can prevent costlier procedures in the future. Good ROI for the customer atleast.

2021-06-01 20:42:33,wallstreetbets,Anything under 140 is a dip retards
2021-06-01 21:09:02,wallstreetbets,Easily hits $100 over the next 10 years but it’ll be up to $20 by next week.
2021-06-02 00:39:34,wallstreetbets,Bought more shares! Go BB!

2021-06-01 21:36:13,wallstreetbets,I can imagine it at $140 because it's been there before.
2021-06-01 20:16:43,wallstreetbets,"It could happen, imo. The thing that differentiates BB from AMC and GME, is the fact that it's offering some pretty game changing tech, and is getting adopted pretty heavily. This rush + its own organic growth, means it's high time for it to climb back."
2021-06-01 21:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Exactly I've been saying. If they said gme is overvalued but did nothing, then they sell AMC shares because suits thinks its overvalued, then CEO add shares to AMC??!??!!

This is bullshit to the highest degree. They're getting away with crimes"
2021-06-02 09:19:27,wallstreetbets,Nope the CEO would fuck it up way before it got that high.

2021-06-02 10:22:40,wallstreetbets,When has BB been @ 140?
2021-06-01 20:40:45,wallstreetbets,"Diff between GME is GME is about to start a turnaround while BB is already a few years into said turnaround, but just overlooked so far."
2021-06-01 22:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the confirmation bias.

Sincerely,

Very very long $BB."
2021-06-01 20:24:18,wallstreetbets,Agree. BB is silently hitting it out of the park q after q under John Chen's able leadership. Its actually an amazing turnaround story in the making.
2021-06-02 05:15:10,wallstreetbets,BB is deep fucking value.
2021-06-02 00:23:13,wallstreetbets,"What growth? Their sales are not increasing at all… Maybe it will in the future but don’t lie saying that it’s getting adopted pretty heavily when their financials show that isn’t true. Lots of new partnerships, yes but sales no."

2021-06-01 22:00:46,wallstreetbets,I'd pay to watch that.
2021-06-02 01:58:58,wallstreetbets,Put the phone down…. you have 12 seconds ….. and go watch Robocop (80s kid here you have to)

2021-06-02 01:07:33,wallstreetbets,I’m fairly new to all this. Why does there seem to be a competition? Shouldn’t it be AMC and GameStop all working cohesively against Wall Street rather than working against each other?
2021-06-01 21:04:46,wallstreetbets,Plz stop.

2021-06-01 21:38:13,wallstreetbets,One had a daily discussion for 2 months
2021-06-01 21:03:52,wallstreetbets,"Be wary of the BB stuff. The message has been consistent for months now. GME is #1, AMC is #2 somewhat distantly... everything else you need to do your own due diligence on.

I threw some cash into GME and AMC early feb when GME was at 59 and AMC was at 9. I’m feeling ok today.

This is not financial advice."
2021-06-02 00:31:19,wallstreetbets,"GME bro.

BB has no squeeze."
2021-06-02 01:09:15,wallstreetbets,GME is the only way.
2021-06-02 07:18:07,wallstreetbets,"$GME HAS THE HARDEST 💎👐🦍 THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

2021-06-02 10:15:15,wallstreetbets,"if you are a bag holder, wtf are you asking to what to buy now instead of buying AMC when it was at 6 bucks last month.

Maybe don't FOMO in and lose more money?"
2021-06-01 22:59:03,wallstreetbets,Bb is at a good price !
2021-06-02 03:02:52,wallstreetbets,"'cause WSB sucks now...

2021-06-02 01:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Law of equivalent exchange?

Probably not going to be anything equivalent about this though."
2021-06-01 21:37:07,wallstreetbets,"There’s only one train, just because some asshole spray painted another name on the outside doesn’t mean it’s sharing the momentum."
2021-06-02 07:21:03,wallstreetbets,you only buy AMC to time the T+21 and dump your gains into GME

I was in shock because a gun just blew up in my arms, so I took a couple steps backwards, looking down in my arms as I did.

Some old guy at the range has the audacity to yell at me that there are no guns behind the line, and I sort of stammered out ""it's not a gun.."""

Idk people seemed more concerned w clean asses in the US 
Well done countryman. Shiny hiney !!"

by 9 million delusional populist idiots that think the stock market is only about GME, AMC, BB, Melvin capitol and Citadel.

Its fucking terrible and I can not wait for these company's stocks to crash to the ground so it can go back to the way it was in 2017-2020"
2021-06-02 00:09:20,wallstreetbets,Right lol. Concept of tendieman in general cracks me up 🤣
2021-06-02 03:59:04,wallstreetbets,"GME was the original play. DFV only posted about it. Michael Burry, the guy that predicted and made it big off of the 2008 crash, literally said there is no other stock similar to GME. It is highly speculated that AMC was a scenario to divert the main retail investment from the stock with the highest short interest (GME). I think a lot of people like it because it’s been paraded as “the other GME” when it has almost 10x the float of GME, which means it’s harder to dictate the price when there is literally billions of shares outstanding, and is a company with no long term potential. The fact that it is a low price ticker is what drives people to it and being a “similar” short play to GME."
2021-06-02 02:39:51,wallstreetbets,AMC is/has been a diversion that is actually helping the shorts.

2021-06-02 00:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the time left. 
Let’s say you have a 1/21/22 call on GME $300. And it hits $300 next week. You believe GME will continue to climb. Hold it. You can only lose your original invest with an option. If you buy 100 shares (exercise) at $300, you’d spend $30k. Let’s say you exercise @300 and the stock drops to $150. You just lost $15k, but if the stock drops while you still own the option you will only lose the original invest. 

Now, if the stock jumps to $350-$400 you’ll have made a sizable amount of cash and can sell at any time you want before the expiry.

Edit: add year"

2021-06-02 05:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Id rather win once, BIG. AMC simply doesnt have remotely near the same potential, and is honestly quite sus. They have been diluting shares and padding execs with fat bonuses. They also reserve the right to cut short sellers backroom deals to close out of their positions should they choose (Gamestop does not - their policy is ""tough shit"" for shorts). Aka AMC has the power to kill the squeeze from ever happening. Hope they do not go that route for everyone elses sake, but I already closed out my position."

2021-06-02 00:24:29,wallstreetbets,"Hmm I see, the reason I am asking is because .. I bought 6 call options last month for AMC  @ 40$ for 6/18. Amc is currently at 37.69 so I feel that the 40$ will be met before my expiration date. From what I understand from you is that this might be something good ? My real concern is how do I sell a call option at a strike price of  40$ if the stock price is going to be 40$+. Who buys the call option back , the common person or Robinhood ?

2021-06-01 23:56:00,wallstreetbets,"It’s not because it is an AR-15 or “assault rifle” as some people mistakenly call it, but in those states the round it fires is legally too small to hunt with."
2021-06-01 22:36:50,wallstreetbets,It's too small for a deer.  It's not likely to kill it and it'll be running around wounded for hours.  The .223 (or 5.56x45mm) is used for coyote and small game
2021-06-02 03:44:07,wallstreetbets,I thought that's that's it meant and it was a meme meaning to team up.
2021-06-02 09:45:46,wallstreetbets,"AMC I thought said they will now create any more shares in the year 2021? Also, are there any links talking about executive bonuses and such?"

Selling options is usually covered with cash. Therefore you, the buyer, have complete control of selling or exercising. The person on the other end of the contract is the one “paying” you the money.

Your case is similar to mine. 
I have NOK $5.00 6/18 calls. (Break even is 5.35)
I’ll sell mine the week they expire unless the price rockets or drops. If it drops below my strike I’ll let it expire and lose my original investment ($35). If it goes up I’ll hold and sell day or two before."

2021-06-01 23:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Both of these comments are both ballistically and practically incorrect. Thousands of deer are taken every year with a .223/5.56x45 chambered AR-15 with high margins of success. In fact it’s perfectly legal to hunt over 78% of the total United States landmass with the aforementioned calibers. I would much rather take a 140lb doe with a single well placed 60 grain soft point .223 than blowing the entire shoulder out of it with a 300WSM and losing a large portion of useable meat. 

Shot placement > Caliber. Hit a buck in the ass with a .7MM Mag and it’ll run around for days until it finally dies. Hit a buck in the lungs with a well placed .223 and it’s the quickest, cleanest death in nature."
2021-06-02 11:35:45,wallstreetbets,"That was said, yet AA tweeted about the sell off just yesterday. They went to Mudrick capital, who then turned around and sold the shares. They both turned a profit at retails expense.

It could come crashing down just as quickly as it has taken off, but time will tell. Best of luck."

2021-06-01 21:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Yea ambidextrous mag releases were a horrible idea. It’s even easier than most pistols in that you can easily use your thumb and trigger finger to pinch it almost to release. Or you can have a glock where most put an aftermarket, larger release on. Good luck if you’re a left handed shooter there."

2021-06-02 01:13:43,wallstreetbets,Quickest? Wouldn't a bullet to the head be quickest? Take out the lungs and the animal would have to live through brain and body failure before it finally dies from asphyxiation wouldn't it?
2021-06-02 14:30:06,wallstreetbets,"All squeezes come crashing down. AMC’s been squeezing in many different ways over the last couple weeks through gamma, shorts closing early before more shorts come on, options rolling keeping the pressure on, rinse and repeat. Take a look at the one month chart and tell me that’s not squeezing. Many millionaires made today. How many realized tho? Best of luck"

2021-06-01 21:22:18,wallstreetbets,"I havent been to one since deer season. Ive heard since pandemic they have gotten real gnarly in PA. No respect, no one cleans up their paper and shells. Oh i miss when only respectful gun people had guns and used them weekly."
2021-06-02 02:51:50,wallstreetbets,Much more difficult to hit the brain of a deer (roughly the size of a grapefruit) than to hit the lungs. More protection around the skull as well. Exsanguination from a shot to the lungs would result in a loss of consciousness in a matter of seconds anyway.
2021-06-02 05:14:42,wallstreetbets,"From the way the deer stands the lungs, heart and major veins and arteries that carry blood between then are all lined up. So a perfect shot can in theory hit all 3 (two lungs + heart) in that case the deer pretty much just drops. There is also the liver slightly lower that if you hit the blood supply artery it will bleed out the deer very quickly. So if you hit the correct area right behind the shoulder it is all over very quickly. Going for a headshot is way too risky. You are aiming for a tiny target protected by a skull, which means a slight miss will graze off and just blow a chunk of the deer's head or face off without killing it. That is far crueler than a slight miss to the chest which still has the chance to kill them just in minutes rather than seconds."
2021-06-01 21:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully we can see some of that come back with all of the new gun owners this past year, but of course I won't be holding my breath."
2021-06-02 07:41:39,wallstreetbets,I think you mean grape?  Grape fruits are fairly large.  I’d be surprised if a deer’s brain was that big.
2021-06-02 10:44:00,wallstreetbets,"No, a [normal sized grapefruit](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/portrait-of-a-girl-holding-red-grapefruit-plus-size-model-picture-id1296736932?s=170667a) is fairly [accurate](http://neurosciencelibrary.org/specimens/artiodactyla/deer/brain/WhitetaildeerL6clr.jpg).  Grapes are incredibly tiny in comparison, with even 'dumb' animals like squirrels and slow lori having larger brains.  A white-tail in [comparison](https://labrigger.com/blog/2014/02/11/mammalian-brains/) has a brain of roughly the same size of a black bear."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GameStop Board of Directors Compensation - June 1st Update tl;dr: The Board of Director's receive compensation based on the GameStop average price from the 30 trading days preceding the annual shareholder meeting (April 27th to June 8th). Based on the current-to-date average closing price of GME, **director's will receive \~1,109 shares of GameStop stock as their annual compensation**

&#x200B;

In the 2021 proxy vote, director compensation is now 100% equity as described below:

""Commencing with the annual meeting, the Board has decided to reduce the amount and alter the structure of non-employee director compensation. Each non-employee director elected at the annual meeting will receive a restricted stock unit (RSU) award with respect to a number of shares determined by dividing $200,000 by the average closing price of our common stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the annual meeting. Such RSUs will vest upon the earlier of the next regularly scheduled annual meeting following the award date or the grantee’s death. One share of common stock will be distributed in respect of each vested RSU within 60 days following the relevant vesting date or event. Under this revised structure, no cash compensation will be paid to our non-employee directors. Messrs. Cohen and Sherman have declined to receive compensation as non-employee directors""

So the price over the next several trading days leading up to the annual shareholder meeting will determine how many GME shares the board of directors will receive as compensation. 

[30 Trading Days Prior to GameStop's Annual Share Holder Meeting](https://preview.redd.it/rfet9f448q271.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=2535041b84eadf51ca1dc017efe670990eabbf72)

Based on the closing price of GameStop over the preceding 30 trading days (April 27th to June 8th), GameStop currently has an average share price of $180.18

$200,000 / $180.18 = 1,109 GME shares

tl;dr: The Board of Director's receive compensation based on the GameStop average price from the 30 trading days preceding the annual shareholder meeting (April 27th to June 8th). Based on the current-to-date average closing price of GME, **director's will receive \~1,109 shares of GameStop stock as their annual compensation**

2021-06-02 04:51:56,wallstreetbets,Wait. $200k?! I’d like to apply for the Director job please!
2021-06-02 08:33:57,wallstreetbets,board of directors really like the stock
2021-06-02 09:16:16,wallstreetbets,"1/4B+ payday, not bad"
2021-06-01 21:17:56,wallstreetbets,"This is clear leadership, amazing Cohen. 👏"
2021-06-01 23:54:57,wallstreetbets,That’s my Chairman.
2021-06-02 04:06:14,wallstreetbets,"He's already fucking loaded after loading up at 16$, he already owns 13% of Game stop at $1.9 Billion, so why would he want some pocket change when he can show leadership and boost the share price further."
2021-06-02 02:11:43,wallstreetbets,Why would he even bother about 1000shares when he can get publicity. He is a freakin billionaire
2021-06-02 06:38:54,wallstreetbets,Can u explain why
2021-06-01 22:11:09,wallstreetbets,GME is my only winner this year
2021-06-01 23:16:55,wallstreetbets,In RC we trust
2021-06-02 14:06:09,wallstreetbets,Honestly this dude should be president when he's done fixing the economy
2021-06-02 05:43:32,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't want an odd number of shares either. 9,001,000 was clearly on purpose!!"
2021-06-02 08:07:04,wallstreetbets,"A director sees so much value in the stock that they are essentially buying in with $200,000 of their own cash at these high prices."
2021-06-02 00:55:00,wallstreetbets,Just blow on the cartridge and put it back in.
2021-06-01 20:18:14,wallstreetbets,why?
2021-06-01 20:02:59,wallstreetbets,"I prefer a ""Y"" between the nips in keyboard boobs autistically...I mean artistically speaking."
2021-06-01 20:05:06,wallstreetbets,Hahaha that's awesome
2021-06-02 04:53:13,wallstreetbets,Beautiful!
2021-06-01 21:10:10,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded why is it in the company's best interest to give the directors a smaller package the higher the stock price?
2021-06-01 21:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Yup, hoping someone gives the dip machine a good boot one last time so I can load up once more."
2021-06-02 18:16:47,wallstreetbets,"When it goes up to 1000 we can collectively suck his dick, daddy needs his 2000% profit."
2021-06-02 15:03:29,wallstreetbets,"RSUs are a payment from the company, in this case of $200K, with a vesting schedule.  none of these directors are paying in."
2021-06-01 21:24:09,wallstreetbets,more money than our entire bloodline has earned
2021-06-02 03:16:48,wallstreetbets,Im crying
2021-06-02 00:31:18,wallstreetbets,They get $200k worth of stock no matter what. If it's lower they get more shares.
2021-06-02 00:56:35,wallstreetbets,"Because the amount of shares they get is determined by 200,000 / average price of GME share over 30 days pending the meeting.

If GME is trading for an average of 1$ at the end of 30 days, all the directors get 200k shares."
2021-06-01 20:08:30,wallstreetbets,Baghold deez nuts

2021-06-02 08:13:08,wallstreetbets,It took my wife's tits like a year to not feel like rocks after she had them done. 😅
2021-06-01 20:46:04,wallstreetbets,Basically.
2021-06-01 22:33:00,wallstreetbets,"They receive $200,000 worth of shares based on the average price, so if GME is higher leading up to the meeting the average price is higher and so they get less shares.

Average price $100, they get $200,000 / $100 = 2,000 shares 

Average price $200, they get $200,000 / $200 = 1,000 shares"
2021-06-02 16:19:18,wallstreetbets,"They are paying in with their time. Most directors receive substantial compensation for their experience, connections, and time. These people could go anywhere and make much more $$$ than what Gme is offering.

They are buying shares by spending their time. They are so much value in the stock that they would rather have stock in Gme than $200K"
2021-06-02 06:04:18,wallstreetbets,"Or just 2 shares if it’s share price is $100,000 - less is more !💰💰"

2021-06-01 21:31:50,wallstreetbets,Nah close at 219.99 please help the board and my covered call close otm
2021-06-02 00:17:19,wallstreetbets,"I know that but why would a company incentivize having a lower stock price, wouldn't it make sense to offer bigger bonuses as the stock price gets higher? Is it this way to stop big-wigs from jumping ship when the going gets tough?"
2021-06-02 02:34:55,wallstreetbets,"""Oh yeah. When you feel it, and it feels like ...  a ... bag of sand ... when you're touching it ..."""
2021-06-02 09:25:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah They're amazing now. Her boyfriend is very happy.
2021-06-01 22:24:08,wallstreetbets,Your decimal point is about 2 spots to the left for my liking.
2021-06-02 00:26:24,wallstreetbets,The stock is awarded at the beginning of their term so the idea is they will want to work hard over the next year to increase the price of the stock so their compensation is worth more
2021-06-01 22:35:21,wallstreetbets,Hey I want it to be there the day after your birthday if that makes you feel any better
2021-06-02 15:34:31,wallstreetbets,I guess the part i don't understand too well is why the company would want to encourage the directors to keep the stock price lower during the 30 day period.
2021-06-02 00:35:22,wallstreetbets,"If it's worth more when they get it wouldn't they need to work even harder to get the same payoff? They would need to push the price even higher to get the same gain which is good for other people holding the stock. If they have a lot of stock they may only work for a year or so, cash in at the top and bounce."
2021-06-01 22:58:39,wallstreetbets,I'll happily accept this.
2021-06-02 16:05:22,wallstreetbets,"It’s alright, I’ll try and help explain.

So the directors get compensated in $200,000 worth of shares. But to determine what stock price to use, it’s standard to take the average price from the month prior to establish as the stock price. If they just chose the stock price the day of the meeting it would be too volatile and would be prone to manipulation. So instead the company gathers the average over the previous month and establishes the average price. That price is now used to issue out their $200,000 worth of shares and is also the price that they need to beat if they want to make more money"
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,YOLO on AMC Options

2021-06-02 04:15:15,wallstreetbets,I'm almost at break even but won't sell. I have so little shares that it'll not make a difference. I can't buy other stocks anyways atm

2021-06-02 08:03:49,wallstreetbets,"BB was always the play, but it was a long play, same as AMC.

So therefore short sellers are genocidal!"
2021-06-02 19:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Spent way too long this morning trying to guess how high E\*Trade would let me set my sell price for BB, as they kept rejecting my limit orders.  I wish they would have let investors know that they can't just pick any sell price to set it and forget it at E\*Trade.  It would also be nice if they published their range of acceptable prices for limit orders."

2021-06-02 07:58:03,wallstreetbets,It's not a loss until you sell.
2021-06-02 05:52:10,wallstreetbets,"Why would you sell though, the DD is there and its been hyped as a long term play anyway and not a short term gain like AMC and GME"
2021-06-02 09:10:53,wallstreetbets,I read these things and I just think why? Why sell at 8.50? Did you think it would go to 6 or something?
2021-06-01 22:38:34,wallstreetbets,"No, no I don't diamond hands.  I try to make profitable trades, I'm just bad at it."

2021-06-01 23:53:34,wallstreetbets,"I don't agree exactly.  Blackberry has arguably the staunchest fanbase of die hard supporters for its brand, hardware, and more if BB would commit to full phone dev as well.  I agree with you on the market share with Apple, but that's not the point.  For the same reason that Porsche exists, it's the fan base with BB that carries the product."

2021-06-01 20:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm holding shares for this reason. Just didn't know if there was some news that I missed which caused it to jump or if it's riding the energy from AMC/GME."

2021-06-02 09:49:36,wallstreetbets,Why would you sell AMC knowing people will eventually go back to the movies?
2021-06-02 13:47:44,wallstreetbets,because Im an idiot
2021-06-02 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,"i thought it would drop in the short term, and needed money for a house. figured i would just sell so i can still have enough for the down payment."

2021-06-02 13:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah. Exactly that. Also i needed the money to buy a house and thought in the short term it would drop more."

Well not enough of a dip for me to risk it. It was my first time being in the green. Honestly I just lucked into it.

2021-06-01 21:22:42,wallstreetbets,Bro you needed to average that down when it was 8ish
2021-06-01 20:37:35,wallstreetbets,I'm not unhappy with my decision.
2021-06-02 14:43:38,wallstreetbets,BINGO
2021-06-02 00:13:30,wallstreetbets,That's a fair point. I respect it

2021-06-01 20:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Eh that's kinda the only reason. There are cyber attacks like weekly nowadays and their security platform Cylance isn't very useful in preventing ransomware or the more detrimental breaches. 

What we're seeing at the moment is meme stock hype, but that's still more than enough to push it to 15 in the next few weeks"
2021-06-02 02:03:45,wallstreetbets,Always know why you bought.  I bought it expecting it to be decent a year or two out.

2021-06-01 23:36:29,wallstreetbets,BB only has 9% short interest though so not sure how this will fly
2021-06-02 09:22:17,wallstreetbets,None of these stocks are worth their current SP...... hope you get out before the bubble bursts......

2021-06-01 20:58:04,wallstreetbets,BB is much more efficient at blocking ransomware then you are at blocking your wife boyfriend from spending money from your account and banging your wife.
2021-06-02 01:10:11,wallstreetbets,"memehype is so fucking real.  As long as the masses of individual retail traders keep trading based off of social media sentiment, those numbers of traders will continue to grow and have more affect.

2021-06-02 09:24:42,wallstreetbets,Just so you know.... stocks only maintain a SP that is attributed to earnings and cost of sales.... NOT a bunch of retail investors who pile money into it artificially driving the price up..... all you guys are doing is creating a bubble.... hope you get out before it bursts.... people lost tons in march when that very thing happened...... gl....

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMRS Morgan Stanley Conference Call Highlights/Analysis **Highlight:** Amyris will soon be producing pure CBG at UNDER $500/kg in 220k Liter tanks (with no trace of THC). Amyris is also involved with sweeteners, vaccines, plant based proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and more...

**Summary:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic bio company - they are a platform for programming the DNA of micro organisms to make them into living machines. These organisms consume sugar and convert it to virtually any molecule - cannabinoids, proteins, mRNA, vaccine adjuvants, vanillin, etc. They sell rare molecules to companies as a manufacturer.

In less romantic terms and extremely simplified: Yeast breaks down sugars from grain to make beer (yeah, beer is yeast poop). Beer is relatively low value. Amyris twiddles yeast DNA so that when the yeast eat sugar they will poop PURE CBG out of those micro booty holes. CBG is a rare and high value molecule. Where Amyris sets itself apart is that it has perfected optimization. Every iteration of the fermentation cycle gets cheaper and cheaper and that data is used in a feedback loop.

Its modern day alchemy, instead of turning lead to gold - they turn sugar into rare molecules.

**Why are they worth so little if they are so magical?**

To the market, Amyris looks like an old broken down synbio company that is grasping at skincare and clean beauty for life. No analyst would give a dead company such a deep dive... It would be absolutely retarded of anyone to look at that balance sheet and decide to do constant research on a dying company for 6 years - and that's where I come in.

&#x200B;

The market is focused on new synbio companies that are going public which have a focus on cellular programming + machine learning (Ginkgo and Zymergen). Amy was one of the original older synbio companies that was focusing on biofuels 10+ years ago. It wasn't profitable and then they went silent. During their silence they were burning a hole in their pockets by dumping in $70M into research *every* year. And then they solved it... They made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in modern history - they could repeatedly program and optimize yeast to produce molecules at ""true commercial scale"" (where the production cost approaches the price of sugar). Their science was amazing but they got stuck because the company was in a -$2B hole from all the research. They have been clawing their way up since. **The market is completely unaware** of this giant who is 8-10 years ahead of its competition and valued the lowest of the three. They are unaware of Amy's technological might because on the outside it looks like a washed up biofuel company trying to do skincare. This is a chance to beat the market to an extremely undervalued stock. Ginkgo and Zymergen are the only true comparable competitors (even if though they are years behind). Look at their valuations and how undervalued Amyris is compared to them.

Amyris is turning the corner to profitability and is already producing 13 molecules at commercial scale, CBG being one of them.

&#x200B;

\*\*FAQ: Why are they so focused on Skincare/Clean Beauty?\*\* It has disgusting margins for them, they make so much profit from it because it is high value and low volume. The fermentation game is all about capacity, by choosing skincare they maximized the money their single fermentation plant could make. They are using these margins to claw themselves out of debt and it will eventually fully fund their operation.

&#x200B;

If you are interested, you can follow along the Conference Call breakdown below where I will summarize the call. If people like this sort of thing I may do more in the future.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**Morgan Stanley + Amyris (CEO John Melo) Conference Call Breakdown + Highlights** Link: [https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1460586&tp\_key=2ae2690d24](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1460586&tp_key=2ae2690d24)

**2:35** \- 13 commercialized molecules, 24 in the pipeline. 250 molecules where they have already engineered yeast to produce the molecule effectively.

**07:00** \- Amyris and Ingredion join in a $100M deal to produce RebM and other sweeteners - Amy steals Ingredion's heart by being so darn sweet. **Info:** RebM is a rare molecule found in Stevia, its sweetness profile is the closest to real sugar. RebA is a shittier version of RebM that has some bitterness but is more available in the plant. PureCircle produces RebA and RebM via plant extraction and is the dominant player in that market. Ingredion bought 75% of PureCircle for \~$263M in 2020. One day, Ingredion notices that it is losing customers to Amyris a ""skincare company"". They find out Amy is producing RebM at 30% lower cost than the plant extraction method from AND at a higher purity (less bitter taste). Ingredion offers Amyris $100M to manufacture RebM and develop other sweeteners for them. They forked out that $100M a year after they bought PureCircle for $263M, you know they weren't happy lol.

This is how disruptive Amyris is... Ingredion benched PureCircle for Amy. Amy turned one of the market leading producers of RebM into what will probably be only a RebM sales/distribution channel for Ingredion. I'm sure PureCircle has some useful data that Amy can use too.

**16:00** \- On the left is Amyris' Sandalwood derived from fermentation and on the right is plant extracted Sandalwood. The discoloration is due to ""impurities"" that oxidize and create off notes in the scent. Fermentation derived Sandal wood is cheaper to make, more pure, and easier to formulate due to its purity. The scent also lasts 2x longer.

&#x200B;

Amyris partners with Industry leaders who already know the market and demand for rare molecules. Amyris manufactures the molecules through fermentation and the Industry leaders market it or formulate it into a product.

Amyris expects its business to generate 60-70% gross margins in a sustainable way into the future.

**20:35** \- Throwing shade on competitors - Because Ginkgo and Zymergen are going public, more data on them is public. Amyris claims to be 8-10 years ahead of any synbio company across the world. Gingko and Zymergen are not really making any product yet and they don't have Amyris' experience in scaling. John wants to step on the gas more to keep the lead. They have been investing $70M into their core platform since 2011 even while everyone thought they were going out of business.Amyris' goal is a single design of a target chemical to commercial production in a single step. It currently takes them 12 months or less to get a molecule to commercial scale and it costs $1M - (side note: they did CBG in 9 months).

&#x200B;

**31:15** \- CBD is only mainstream because it is available at a lower cost. In the same way RebA is a shitty version of RebM, we are seeing that CBD is a shitty version of CBG when it comes to inflammatory properties. Amyris is currently producing more volume of CBG at scale than any one else in the world. They plan on going after the other minor cannabinoids as well. Amy is producing CBG at the market cost of CBD currently, and will soon be producing it at under $500/kg. Amyris uses directed evolution, they are constantly optimizing their yeast (or other micro organisms) to have higher yields which improves their costs over time. They can get their prices extremely low due to their experience with biofuels. Cannabinoids produced by precision fermentation have no detectable amounts of THC making it easier to get by regulatory hurdles.

They will be using this CBG to create a breakthrough new acne treatment. Their plan is to own the CBG market before they open up and supply CBG to the rest of the world.

**note:** how low can the cost go?

As of 2015, Amyris produced farnesene at $1.75/L - it originally cost $16/L. I have a hunch they produce farnesene at under a dollar by now. A few months ago Amyris was producing CBG at \~$1500/L and they have already improved to the $500 range.

&#x200B;

If you would like more information on Amyris, here is some more DD.

We've taken a piece of their presentation and decoded it to figure out what sort of pathways they have unlocked to show they are not a one trick pony.

2021-06-02 01:52:09,wallstreetbets,"400m$ revenue guidance for 2021, so they're trading at a forward P/S of 10? Hard to say undervalued at that point?

Or can you show us your DCF? :D"
2021-06-02 12:17:09,wallstreetbets,Why did the price drop suddenly in April? What was the reason behind that?
2021-06-02 14:13:44,wallstreetbets,can you comment more on the 15 chemical classes from that diagram and what that potentially means?
2021-06-02 14:44:33,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
2021-06-02 18:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Small position but my 125 shares at $16 have been bleeding, close to seeing that elusive color."
2021-06-01 21:59:27,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly
2021-06-02 02:26:15,wallstreetbets,"I added an image of related companies and competitors in the post. The P/S ranges from 14 - 250. The point being that these companies that are at the ""forefront"" are actually 8-10 years behind Amyris. So what will Amyris' P/S correct to when it is matched with peers? That is the play."
2021-06-02 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,"Because I invested in it, it was only natural for the price to go down"
2021-06-02 14:22:15,wallstreetbets,"The 15 chemical classes is meant for a few things...

1) show flexibility in the platform it's hard to make some of these molecules via fermentation. Example: RebM is supposedly very difficult because it required glycosylation?? - don't take this last sentence as fact I'm spouting some stuff I don't understand from memory.


2) they are showing how far their patents go, you cant patent a naturally occurring molecule like RebM but you can patent the genetic pathway you took to get there. Amy has hundreds of pathways already mapped."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, & ASO 😎 from one dork to a bunch of retards First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)÷initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGE🚀🚀💯😃"
2021-06-01 21:43:19,wallstreetbets,Aso. This is the way. Look at the chart.
2021-06-01 23:28:54,wallstreetbets,"ASO is a fucking powder keg and I have no idea why everyone isn’t jumping on it. My smooth brain yahoo sourced data shows that 100% of the shares are owned by institutions or insiders, so… made up short shares? Pretty sure retail owns at least 15-20% of this from other sources. 

The downside is even more limited here too, they just paid off a chunk of debt, are growing solidly, and have tons of room for expansion into more states.

Can some smart ape with access to a fancy trading tool crayon this shit up for us please?"
2021-06-02 05:07:47,wallstreetbets,"GME only topped out at 483 because RH stopped letting people buy, would have gone higher. How high? No one knows."

2021-06-02 08:48:23,wallstreetbets,"I mean you are retarded and the math is retarded as well but hey, at least you tried so i'll grab a few shares of ASO"
2021-06-02 13:15:03,wallstreetbets,It is 6/2/2021 and AMC just hit $67. Does that mean your math is wrong or that what you were using as a peak for GME wasn’t the true peak? If you use your analysis what does the GME peak come out to be?
2021-06-01 20:08:04,wallstreetbets,Your math is all sorts of fucked up man
2021-06-01 21:13:59,wallstreetbets,Anything under 140 is a dip
2021-06-01 23:17:31,wallstreetbets,You’re like that guy who told DFV to sell all his GME back in July of 2020. This will not age well.
2021-06-02 14:12:20,wallstreetbets,These predictions did not age well.
2021-06-02 16:49:05,wallstreetbets,It took less than 24 hours to make this absolutely stupid and not the WSB stupid. The kind of stupid where you see a car crash and say “I wanna be apart of that” then drive your car into it.
2021-06-02 19:17:26,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, unlike chemistry, in Finance there are almost always unknown variables. All we can do when we are trained in finance is use our best judgment based on historical examples to give an educated guess at what those variable values may be. In my first example I used what happened historically to show how AMC may react to a squeeze based on how another company's stocks did (GME). Several people pointed out however that the markets were flawed in that squeeze due to throttled upside by large financial institutions to slow thier losses. Whether that was intentional or not, i do believe it did in fact happen to slow the rise of GME. VW on the other hand was able to skyrocket in 2008 with no resistance so it only seemed fair to use those variables to calculate the rise for AMC. What I can say is that there are still variables Un accounted for. The most important probably being the %of short float. Another is the overall size different of the market as a whole from 2008 until now. I will humbly say that basically if the math proves to be wrong it is simply because there is no equation that I am capable of putting together that wouldn't take a professor of calculus to solve. I have a very humble masters in finance and was in no way a brilliant student. My numbers are simply my best educated ""hypothesis"" if you will, of where I think the top will be for the stocks at hand based on the variables I could find from 2008. Best of luck!"
2021-06-01 21:08:41,wallstreetbets,"This is comparing apples to oranges, GME had >100% short interest before the big run up, none of these stocks have even close to that level of short interest. What makes you think all these other stocks are gonna have the exact same return as GME? Sounds like wishful thinking to me"
2021-06-01 22:23:52,wallstreetbets,this is straight FUD bro

2021-06-01 21:31:17,wallstreetbets,"Heres the problems with your post:

1. GME- Had 140%+ short interest, relatively small float (54mil~ in January, 57mil~ now), and a huge amount of people who saw this as both a squeeze play as well as a value play. There has been nothing like GME before, and wont be after. Also, GME is debt free, has $900mil cash on hand, and is doing admirably in transforming the business. 

2. AMC- small short interest around 20%, very large float (450-500mil). This might squeeze a bit, but its mostly FOMO and institutions driving the price action right now. They haven’t even hit a single circuit breaker yet AFAIK. AmC still had a load of debt. This looks like a media hype play.

3. Blackberry- exact same situation as #2, AMC..

4. ASO- never even fucking heard of this company, but a quick glance at their 8-K shows Credit Suisse is their lender. Wouldnt surprise me if this is a media pulp and dump, I wouldnt touch any fucking thing Credit Suisse is tied to right now. Also has loads of debt. Whats their float look like?"

2021-06-02 19:48:41,wallstreetbets,Im starting to feel like by the time I notice the patterns the patterns change lol. Considering the last few rodeos the last couple weeks. Does this mean good news is good again.

2021-06-01 21:23:31,wallstreetbets,So we didn't even squeeze yet?
2021-06-02 13:48:11,wallstreetbets,Go read my updated post with forecasted earnings..
2021-06-01 21:51:22,wallstreetbets,"ASO is a well run company who crushes earnings and has a viable longterm business model. Squeeze or no squeeze it will be a $100 stock on its own performance in a year. However, with its high enough short interest and higher starting price it could squeeze hard enough to make GME look silly."

2021-06-02 13:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Well thats stupid, I edited my numbers based on VW 2008 squeeze and predicted AMC could go to 87 BB could hit like 53$ I think and ASO could go to like 1300.."
2021-06-02 19:34:18,wallstreetbets,See below.
2021-06-01 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Have you actually found a person saying it's already squeezed?

You'll know when it squeezes. It'll be a fucking worldwide event when a bunch of hedgefunds go out of business and a bunch of goons like us become millionaires."
2021-06-02 16:49:32,wallstreetbets,Shut up pussy.
2021-06-01 22:37:15,wallstreetbets,Whats their float?
2021-06-02 17:00:03,wallstreetbets,"Point is, if it aint 6 digits I dont want to hear it"
2021-06-02 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,Yea I read through the comments to pick up some of it. Still curious if you used the current or even you projected moon of AMC where does the but GME using your analysis.
2021-06-02 07:44:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a bot lmao look at my comment history if you want, I just have more than 6 brain cells"
2021-06-02 08:10:59,wallstreetbets,"1500% percent is a squeeze imo, your just a bias confirmation bot then, name a single stock in history that has squeezed more than 1500%… I’ll wait"
2021-06-01 22:22:10,wallstreetbets,You sound like someone I need to fallow then.

2021-06-01 22:47:52,wallstreetbets,It’s literally still being heavily shorted so full send
2021-06-02 07:43:27,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it’s being heavily shorted, short interest is at like 14% last time I checked"
2021-06-02 07:55:34,wallstreetbets,Idk but its over 40$ so who really cares lmao im rich
2021-06-02 08:09:35,wallstreetbets,Did you sell? Because if you didn’t sell then you’re not rich yet
2021-06-02 08:11:43,wallstreetbets,The classic salty response from someone not in the action :P
2021-06-02 08:19:45,wallstreetbets,"I bought GME at the beginning for 20$, sold at 330, bought the 50 dip sold at 220 and then bought the 120 dip sold at 260 you said you bought at 40? So you either missies out on ATH or bought in fomo after the first dip and missed out on a whole lot of profit from selling and buying the dip. Yes I’m so salty with my 2300% gain so salty."
2021-06-02 08:20:26,wallstreetbets,Same lol

2021-06-01 21:55:47,wallstreetbets,So NIO 2023 LEAPS?
2021-06-01 20:10:52,wallstreetbets,About two months ago I bought $100 strike options expiring 01/2022. I’m still down quite a bit but it went up significantly today. I’m hoping this shit goes to the moon. I’m thinking of longer leaps. Late 2022 or later i think will be even better
2021-06-01 22:05:29,wallstreetbets,Holding 500 shares and 10 35$ calls jan 2023 let’s go🚀🚀
2021-06-02 00:13:38,wallstreetbets,"Ya know why NIO went up? I sold out at 20% loss to buy AMC 2 days ago

You welcome."
2021-06-01 22:04:42,wallstreetbets,Have been in...printing
2021-06-01 22:49:04,wallstreetbets,NIO has an amazing chart as well 😉

2021-06-01 22:35:23,wallstreetbets,If I know anything it’s that the Chinese will stand behind their country at all cost Nio 🚀
2021-06-02 06:20:36,wallstreetbets,My cost is $3.96 !!!!
2021-06-01 23:13:23,wallstreetbets,My 55 bags are getting lighter
2021-06-01 20:04:09,wallstreetbets,Xpev had increased sales in May while Nio sales fell…..although I think both companies will do well. I own Xpev.
2021-06-01 23:13:45,wallstreetbets,Holding 700 shares at $32 AVG letsgooooo
2021-06-01 21:00:40,wallstreetbets,"The overall view in America (I can't speak for Europe) is that Chinese made products are pieces of shit. Vehicles are the one thing that most people are astronomically particular about & I can tell you right now that a Chinese car company will FAIL in the USA. This is BEFORE considering the animosity that lots of people have against the Chinese government. They won't do well in Japan, Australia, or South Korea  either. Furthermore, the competition from western & other Asian companies is already fierce. They'll obviously have a foothold within China, but globally.....it's an uphill battle. I'd steer clear of this one."
2021-06-01 23:44:19,wallstreetbets,"Ive played nio many times, always makes me a buck or two. Good china"
2021-06-02 04:49:15,wallstreetbets,None of their cars are beautiful or amazing.
2021-06-02 11:01:41,wallstreetbets,Why are we putting money into anything Chinese owned?
2021-06-01 21:51:15,wallstreetbets,We’ve all seen what comes out of China. No thanks.
2021-06-02 02:32:34,wallstreetbets,I bought 710 shares of NIO at one dollar but I sold them before the last rally at ten dollars. I sold all but 50 🤢 however I think the Chinese EV market is crowded and the battery swapping model will hurt their sales and growth. Look for battery technology not sexy body styles.
2021-06-02 07:09:31,wallstreetbets,Prefer Tesla tbh
2021-06-02 15:07:07,wallstreetbets,Classic Apple clickbait
2021-06-01 23:47:22,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 9 and sold enough to cover a little more than my original at close to 60 so I could buy in again if it dropped. It did, I didn't and I still couldn't be happier with how things went."
2021-06-01 21:35:03,wallstreetbets,You bought yesterday?
2021-06-02 10:17:34,wallstreetbets,Still worth it though.
2021-06-01 21:27:52,wallstreetbets,Don't forget NioFoodlab and Wine. They do it all.
2021-06-02 14:08:20,wallstreetbets,I know right! Anyone who can't do basic English speaking talk must be good ape! I'm in!
2021-06-02 02:36:06,wallstreetbets,That’s a fair criticism regarding regulatory compliance however as at least 1/9th of the worlds population is there you will be missing out on tremendous money making opportunities. US and Chinese business is invariably tethered there’s really no way around it as an investor.
2021-06-01 23:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know...the way the dollar looks, I’d rather have foreign stocks moving forward."
2021-06-01 20:35:51,wallstreetbets,"They’re poised to compete with Tesla’s booty shorts, I wouldn’t risk shorting a company so well positioned to dominate the market"
2021-06-02 02:39:24,wallstreetbets,They’ve been having trouble rolling out their battery swapping stations and they cost a lot. If you do some long puts you should come out okay.
2021-06-01 23:00:45,wallstreetbets,"why? they've gone down in past months, now is buy time"
2021-06-01 22:41:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah once upon a time we believed this now everyone would rather have a Toyota 😂

2021-06-01 21:24:57,wallstreetbets,"branding is huge in tesla's favor, look at shit like huawei they would never buy that in the USA over apple just off of branding alone, no one seems to care if the specs are better"
2021-06-02 02:42:53,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think they are. Tesla has some of the best engineers and are the precipice of unprecedented battery life and recharging technology. Elon Musk is the Henry Ford of this time plus his key man factor alone is extremely good for the trading price. There are at least three comparable Chinese EV companies, NIO is riding on design and its lack or utility will become relevant at some point."
2021-06-02 00:25:38,wallstreetbets,"The Japanese are our allies. The Chinese are not. Secondly, the Japanese people do not like China either.  Again, the Chinese will have a very tough time finding customers outside of China."
2021-06-01 23:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Toyota is Japanese, mot Chinese."

2021-06-02 04:40:01,wallstreetbets,Aren't banks and %APY the epitome of capitalism though?
2021-06-01 20:32:19,wallstreetbets,disclaimer: im genuinely not informed or have an opinion. But isnt there an argument to pointing out the distinction of business principles of an American company using chinese manufacturing vs a purely chinese company?
2021-06-01 20:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Okay big brain. Tell me. 

Who designs the phone? Who assembles the components to make sure they're compatible and we get a quality product? Is it a Chinese company or is it Apple? 

I understand that the phone is put together in China just as a Ikea cupboard is, but what you guys are creaming your selves over is Chinese PRODUCED products. Not just built in China.

Tell me more about the great automobiles of the Chinese. Tell me more how they haven't copied every single engineering marvel of the west. 

Nio is a garbage stock and has no other value to you guys other than trying to offload those heavy as hell bags"

2021-06-01 21:02:05,wallstreetbets,Well the regulations they broke were investigated and they ended up shutting down. Isnt China notorious for not having that type of regulation?

2021-06-01 22:09:30,wallstreetbets,"Those of you going ham on SNDl. What is it about that company that makes you so interested in it vs something like Tilray?

From what i can tell all 3 companies that SNDl has only sell smokeable items. Buds, pre-roll, vape fluids, and rosin. 1 seems to be trying to sell a premium look. 1 seems to be going more for the hippy vibe, and the last one is more sort of less tie dye and trippy mushroom imagery.

Tilray on the other hand has all the stuff Sundial has, but they also have everyday hemp products, edibles, drinks, supplements, and oils. Both are canadian companies, but Tilray has a more global reach, including already selling items in the US. So why Sundial over Tilray?


Edit: Just a heads up, I do have a stake in Tilray, just trying to see the appeal of Sundial."

2021-06-01 20:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Well those subs aren't nearly as active yet as the gme ones, I personally think a rift grew between gme and wsb and that's why you don't see the mentions here as often"
2021-06-01 20:53:39,wallstreetbets,"I don't necessarily agree with this...when everything popped off in Jan., GME was obviously the big dog of the group. It has the most DD to support the current circumstances, as well as the greatest chance at a really successful turnaround long term.

I think anyone that diamond handed their GME position, has just gained more confidence in the stock / company from the substantial amount of crowd-sourced info, and the support of a community. To me, it just made the most sense and continues to be the unicorn imo."

Seems/seemed pretty reasonable to me. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
2021-06-01 21:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I meant that I don't think anyone minds that the GME crowd migrated to their own sub(s).

The 24/7 GME obsession kind of always belonged in it's own sub, especially after a few months. After all, it's not like WSB members can't go to other subs or anything. But now there's a dedicated zone for GME, rather than an out-of-place GME-ghetto megathread in WSB."
2021-06-01 21:32:06,wallstreetbets,"It was a legendary price move from a memestock, and will always be a legend. But GME doesn't always have to have the largest price movement. Times have changed, and the meme stocks story has evolved"

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SoFi is undervalued (based on market caps of other NFL stadiums) I was bored and looked up market caps of other companies that own naming rights to NFL stadiums.

SoFi is the 3rd lowest market cap, coming in behind NRG and Allegiant. 

The average market cap for a public company that owns naming rights for an NFL stadium is 95 Billion, SoFi is at 8.7B

This is not financial advice as this is a stupid way of valuing a company. 

Here is the spreadsheet with my findings https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17tlr2fCgEjv2_wY3zib3m1c5RSWcWcBkz0RVk-h60Xo/edit?usp=sharing"
2021-06-01 21:50:26,wallstreetbets,"From a good Article on SoFi
SOFI COULD BE THE NEXT PAYPAL OR SQUARE. 

""SoFi, a personal finance company offering a suite of financial products including investing, credit cards, insurance, and loans. At first glance, they are already offering more services than a bank, and the best part is, everything can be accessed directly in the palm of your hand, not waiting in line for a teller.""
""SoFi is structured around 3 key segments, Lending, Financial Services, & Its Technology platform.

Its lending platform offers student loan refinancing, personal loans, home loans, and school loans.

Its financial services include its stock
trading app and the recently launched
SoFi credit card. All of these businesses
offer a huge advantage in that they can
cross-sell multiple financial products in
order to boost revenue while lowering
churn. This has been highlighted by its
multi-product member growth going
from 74k in Q2'19 to 400k today and a
plan to get that to 775k by the end of
2021.

One of my favorite parts of Sofi and why
lam bullish on the company is its
Technology Platform. This includes a
product called Galileo, which powers
Sofi Money and companies like Chime,
Transferwise, and even Robinhood.
Galileo is an API and white-labeled
payments platform. This means that
other companies looking to build
financial services products can build on
this technology, creating an alternative
revenue stream for SoFi."
2021-06-02 03:32:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm convinced, all in!"

2021-06-02 07:16:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m convinced this is an easy multi bagger. Hoping it doesn’t take off to crazy but seems this stock is primed to explode short term
2021-06-02 09:52:31,wallstreetbets,"So if I invest in SoFi, I’ll be able to buy my own stadium in the future? Sounds good, going all in."
2021-06-02 13:26:25,wallstreetbets,"I’m more of a Buffet value investor. Which stadium had the lowest priced soft pretzels, that is my stock pick. Sofi is solid though"
2021-06-01 21:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Regarding Valuation:
Consider the valuation of some of the fin-techs that primarily are in only 1 segment of the market (brokerage, or banking, or auto ins, or homeowners/ renters ins, mortgage, etc). These will be at a disadvantage due to a much higher customer acquisition cost, and lower customer retention control & percentage. just to name 2 of them (& their Market Caps):
Robinhood: up to 40B (as of 2/21).. planning to go public this summer (so will prob rise to $60B on 1st day of a trading).
$RKT : $35 Billion

Then compare to SoFi ... We already have more revenue and  make more money than Robinhood.  (we actually make money off of Robinhood via Galileo!)... 
.. then compare to SoFi market cap (which will include over $2Billion in cash after merger).  And Sofi will be profitable next year... a lot of room to run!"

2021-06-02 13:11:22,wallstreetbets,Not to sound stupid but I'm really new to this and I jumped on the GME and AMC bandwagon a few months ago.  When you research companies to invest in what do you look for?  I avoid the news for obvious reasons.

2021-06-01 21:33:23,wallstreetbets,I’m heavy in the warrants and agree the commons have ran away from the warrants.  There’s always a lag between the common and warrants pricing so you can take advantage of the difference.

2021-06-02 05:11:25,wallstreetbets,Isn't the price of the warrant the difference between the stock and the commons?
2021-06-01 22:11:53,wallstreetbets,SOFIW is the ticker for warrants
2021-06-02 05:20:37,wallstreetbets,It's supposed to be but right now there's a premium with the common over the warrant.  23 - 11.50 = 11.50 per warrant and warrants are currently priced at 8.09. It may catch up today.
2021-06-02 02:04:10,wallstreetbets,Seems as if you are here and they denied you loan they are worth investing in :)
2021-06-02 09:01:29,wallstreetbets,The SOFI website says the strike price is usually 11.50 and there are fees associated with converting the warrants. So far the warrant prices plus strike price has floated around 3 dollars less than the share price.
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SNDL 1$ Floor Established Hey Peeps,

Many of you are probably looking at today's price action as a WTF. I get it. I've been watching it periodically in ThinkorSwim. If you've been watching the level 2 you see the obnoxious bids / asks sitting between 1 and 1.02. Over150M (near 50% volume) shares traded hands at these prices.If you are checking the borrow rates [here](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/sndl), then you know the cost to borrow has gotten a bit more expensive as the day went on.

Personally I think this looks a lot like we have a solid $1 floor as the price line was tried 3 solid times, each time we broke the $1 line we saw a massive bid back up to $1. The shorts on SNDL don't have a lot of days to cover as shown [here](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sndl&submit=Short+Quote). Short interest still looks around 15%. Nothing crazy, but has potential given any hype news.

The fact that the $1 floor seems to have held solidly is fantastic. Honestly I'm surprised. It has held the up channel very very well. Because of the lack of volatility (IV) you may have saw your options slightly decrease in value today. To me it was a good day to roll out my options. I took gains from the Jan 11 1.5s and rolled them into the Jan 18 1.5s on the drops near $1. I still don't meet the minimum for the side bar but I'm now the proud owner of 225 Jan 18 1.5 calls (just over 2k at my .09125 cost basis).

The rocket fuel here is the push towards Federal Legalization. Keep that in mind. I noticed a number of calls being written for $2 and $3 strikes today at the 18th expiration. That's a big move to hit that. I saw the $9 calls being written for Jul 16th. Again these are big moves, I'd stay modest in the 1$ - $2 range to be realistic.

Edit: Amazon is onboard https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amazon-backs-federal-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-.html"

Companies like Trulieve & GTI are similar in size and already profitable... the list goes on and they keep expanding too.

When we long, fall, and crash for the wrong things as we often do, both aspirations and people can be the most elegant vultures. From a distance, they glide with the poise and grace of an eagle. But as soon as they sense that you are vulnerable, that you’ve been crippled by the weight of your own expectations and maimed by the rusted jagged edges of reality, they descend in one final sweeping display of grandeur. From thereon, there is no more grace or beauty. They will tear through your hide, and pick you apart, flesh by flesh, ligament by ligament, until all that is left is but a shell of hollow promises of a tomorrow that will never come. He remains perched on your skeleton for a while, in a sluggish food coma, as if bored of his conquest and entirely dissatisfied with his afternoon snack."

Her parents sat me down and offered me the keys to the kingdom, I'd never want for money again, just put on these clothes and submit to a life of nepotism and take care of our crazy daughter. I was with her for 5 years and almost did it, but I had too much pride and turned it all down and left.

She married some dick that met at a Phish show a few years ago. Today she just barely survived a heroin overdose. She texted me some pictures of cats she's been drawing in coloring books. It's like talking to a shell of the person I remember.

Fun 2019 interview here with CNBC anchor who thinks TSLA is worth nothing: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/04/tesla-could-go-even-higher-than-our-4000-price-target-fund-manager.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/04/tesla-could-go-even-higher-than-our-4000-price-target-fund-manager.html)

Seeing the same comments about ARK and Cathie today as 2 years ago: ARK portfolio looks like a meme, her fund getting blown up, Cathie is crazy and her TSLA target is wack.

Yeah after reading these comments from 2 years ago my conviction in ARK has greatly increased. We going to the moon."

11:52 PM

66F cloudy

I live in the American Gardens Building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is CUM-CEO. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a CUM-CEO. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there."

- BB current market cap = $6.55 Billion
- ($10.425 billion/$6.55 billion) - 1 = 59.16%

I think there will be a lot of people like you who see what BB is set up to do and don’t want to miss out like they did on AMC.  The next 2-3 days will likely be very interesting."
2021-06-01 21:02:41,wallstreetbets,Nope hop on 🚀

2021-06-01 20:24:59,wallstreetbets,"Look at the charts for the last few days. AMC runs up the first 30-45 minutes, then dips, trades flats through midday, then runs up or down into close."
2021-06-01 20:33:41,wallstreetbets,Damn…..interesting push of TELL today. Shit traded sideways from 2017 to 2020. Plummeted to middle earth and has been a day traders scalping delight since. I know I know the merger blah blah. Be careful with this one.

GME is not even into a gamma squeeze yet, just a steady climb that seems more organic than a squeeze."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIRT - a short and concise DD on Virtu Financial This will be a brief and concise DD on Virtu Financial **(Ticker: VIRT)**, exploring the opportunities this stock provides investors in such uncertain times in the market.

&#x200B;

**Brief introduction to what Virtu is:**

Virtu Financial is a market maker, utilizing HFT (high frequency trading). They currently trade at a positive ratio every day, utilizing highly efficient trading algorithms that have been shown to thrive off of market volatility. This property in and of itself, is highly unusual amongst peers - where other banking stocks suffer under volatility, Virtu thrives as their algorithms execute precise trades exploiting every major market move.

&#x200B;

In our current inflationary climate, and after a long brutal bull-run from march 2020, there are major gaps in valuations and real value in the market. Either if you are bearish overall on the market, worried about inflation, or looking for a place to exploit off of volatility without being exposed and losing money to VIX derivatives, then Virtu is a stock to consider. As the algorithm earns more during increased market volatility, **the stock can be considered as a long trade on volatility itself**. The company has shown to be extremely resilient to market corrections, and some financial metrics point to it's stability - more on this later. As a market maker, they deal in every asset type on the most popular exchanges, including options, etfs and other derivatives. With the large number of new retail investors that flooded in after the 2020 crash, the market seems rigged for proper volatility in any event that inflation starts to affect the markets. Overall, it is also cheaper to own than so-called long-volatility funds that charge you interest - as Virtu already pays a dividend! Imagine that, getting paid to hold a long-volatility asset?

&#x200B;

If you believe that we are headed for turbulence after the summer, then the current timing seems to be appropriate to get some Virtu:

&#x200B;

Financials point to undervalued:

&#x200B;

[EPS: Actual vs. estimates - approx 40&#37; higher than estimates for Q1](https://preview.redd.it/cg94ug1qjp271.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc2cb2a021ba7c353d1a24f8ab1e9998ab4f7f7f)

P/E = \~3.3

P/B = \~3.5

EPS = 5.3

P/S = 1.2

Beta = 0.08

Dividend yield = 3.15%

&#x200B;

Earnings took a hike north during 2020 crash, and EPS for Q1 2021 beat analyst estimates by \~40%. Meanwhile, short interest has grown to $150M after Q1 earnings, all the while the stock has continued a positive upwards trend. It is currently approaching 2018 ATH levels at 37 (current 31), and timed well with increased market volatility and continued earnings growth, I believe the shorts will have to consider covering. Current breakout target at 32, next up ATH.

**Overall, the stock is unpopular and hidden away, at really cheap multiples and an interesting property related to long-volatility.** I'm not shying away from the possibility of an ATH breakout due to it's aggressive earnings growth, current low valuation and highly defensive position against both inflation and market volatility - **an aggressive hedge all-in-all**.

2021-06-02 05:14:02,wallstreetbets,"Right - because there exists charities in the market, who are not trying to profit? I think the majority of the newcomers here have a mixup with regards to MMs and their role in the market, especially after the GME media scandal with Citadel.

The reason you are able to buy or sell so many options, etfs, certificates, ETNs etc. are all due to MMs. They are only the facilitators, and in regards to the underclass, I'd even say they lean in our favor more than the ""upperclass"" - without derivatives, and **leverage**, the average joe would never be able to go from piss-poor to rich in a few well-placed, well-analyzed trades.

And that's the key; being able to do analysis and due diligence on your own. If you crash and burn your portfolio, it is never the MMs fault. They only allow trades to take place. Truth is, and you know it, is that the majority of retail traders do minimal DD, if any at all, on their trades. You can't blame your casino for losing money :)"

In January 2020, Citadel paid a 670 million-yuan ($97 million) settlement for alleged trading irregularities dating from 2015.\[68\]  
Citadel Securities was fined $700,000 by FINRA in July 2020 for trading ahead of customer orders.\[69\]  
 They delayed certain equity orders from clients to buy or sell shares   
while continuing to trade the same stocks in its own account as part of   
its market-making activities, according to FINRA.  
In 2020, Citadel Securities was censured by FINRA a total of 19   
times for a variety of misconduct, including failing to close   
failure-to-deliver positions, naked short selling, inaccurate reporting   
of short sale indicators, executing trades during circuit-breaker halts,  
 and failing to offer its clients best prices on the bid-ask spread.\[70\]  
On March 25, 2021, Citadel agreed to a censure by FINRA and a   
$275,000 fine for improperly reporting nearly 500,000 Treasury   
transactions between 2017 and 2019, revealing a systemic failure in   
Citadel's compliance systems."
2021-06-02 05:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Sure, Citadel are scumbags, but they pay the price for that now. My guess is they'll be neck deep in legal issues with brokers by the end of 2022, and that serves as a warning sign to other MMs, as well as new regulations.

It will be a race to the bottom with the US dollar going lower and lower. There is a worldwide effect from a weaker US Dollar that will trickle down to all currencies.

2021-06-01 21:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this comment!  


It inspired me to look back to the specifics of how my positions came to be.  


I became aware of Chamath making this move (having seen him live at LAUNCH festival on stage chatting with Jason Calacanis and it was clear to me ""WOW this dude gets it"") so once I did my DD and discovered the absolute unit & future-actualizing locomotive that is Noto & SoFi, I was like, ""YUP, this is my highest conviction play in 2021 and foreseeably beyond.""  


I expected rip-roaring growth in early March and, whoops, the market hadn't yet seen what I saw (it still hasn't lol)... I deleted $95k (\~25% of my portfolio ATH).  


Lesson RE-learned: ""Give yourself long enough to be right."" (My own investing rule #2; rule #1 is ""Be right."")  


So, I doubled down.  


And yeah, baby, yeah, TODAY WAS THE DAY those 400 calls from March went green.  


I am feeling QUITE GOOD about holding and buying more $SOFI optimism as I get cash thru the summer, to say the least.  


Oh, and, I don't have a financial background haha and I don't know what I don't know, so I'm open to coaching / mentorship / idea exchange, so hit me up if we might be able to help each other learn and grow!

Platinum is of course at a historic very cheap price in relation to gold and other precious metals and in relation to it own ATH ($2 270). I believe PPLT offers an even more significant discounted price point to enter in to a Platinum position.

Other than a sudden $ strengthening all likely hidden dangers (Covid out of control in South Africa etc) along with positive tail winds of inflation, increased automotive demand etc all appear to point to positive price pressure. Anyone who has studied this care to educate me further?"

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A reminder that CEOs are not WSB'ers On April 15, 2021 the CEO of AMC pledged:

"" We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can’t announce intentions and then not carry through it, **we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one**. ""

Today, only 45 days, (45 days later!):

"" AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (“AMC” or “the Company”), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to raise $230.5 million of cash from the sale of equity to Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. in exchange for 8.5 million shares of AMC’s Class A Common stock. ""

&#x200B;

Now, certainly, in a technical sense, AMC could argue that these new shares that were issued were actually authorized in 2013, but that is just in a way a bit of legal wrangling. The fact is that when the CEO was boasting about not selling new shares, they were likely at the exact same time in talks with Mudrick Capital to sell shares (230M deals don't just happen overnight).

&#x200B;

Now, it may be good for AMC to get some cash, but we shouldn't overlook the duplicity here. Mudrick is a hedge fund, and if you think for a second they are going to have diamond hands, I would look yourself in a mirror. As soon as the squeeze is pushing shorts, Mudrick will be right there to help them close all their positions.

Edit: As several users have pointed out, it appears Mudrick has already sold their entire stake. This is BAD for a squeeze, as it means all the shares are trading on the market. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mudrick-sells-entire-amc-stake-173526983.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mudrick-sells-entire-amc-stake-173526983.html)

2021-06-02 07:56:24,wallstreetbets,"but there is no self respecting company on earth that would do stock deals with AMC at anything that assumes AMC shares are worth more than probably $10 or $15/share.

were there other methods to raise money? yes. Were there other methods that were as low risk as just issuing more shares? no.

AMC was in an unjustified runup. for all they knew by tuesday morning when the market opened they would have dropped $10, or whatever time it took to do a ATM offering could have had their stock back into the teens.

you make it sound like their current price would have been considered sustainable enough to truly sit and come up with a good plan and create strong value from, whereas their current price happened unexpectedly as a flash in the pan and noone could really have known what could happen in the next hour.

Optics are definitely bad, but c'mon, do you think any sane rational person is buying AMC for $28 right now to hold for 1 year. i will bet decent money that if you have people an option right now (AMC is trading at $39 premarket) and told them you'd sell them AMC shares for $28 if they are willing to hold until 2022, 9 times out of 10 you'd get a pass."

I bought PLTR at 11 and sold it at 27 and I can guarantee you it wasn't worth 27. The profit I got from it, didn't need it to be worth 27 tho. The same money arrived in my account.

Let's not be obtuse because ""the market is cheating!!! moooommm!"" If you can make money, it doesnt matter how real the fundamentals."

2021-06-02 07:19:04,wallstreetbets,"retail investors weren't investing in AMC, they were investing in a short squeeze and volatility. it just so happened that the medium for investment was AMC.

Loo at AMC posts and GME posts. Barely a mention of AMC when it was down. None of the ""investors"" (as you call them) get highly visible posts talking about AMC's future prospects. Whereas people continually hyping up GME for not just a short squeeze, but actual growth.

AMC since the start of the squeeze was never a ""in a few years this price may be justified"" or ""look at growth potential"", it was always ""how quickly can i double/triple my money and get out""."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is AirBnb ($ABNB) Ready to Moon Post Covid? Wanted to share some thoughts on AirBnB, as we just talked about this on our latest Podcast.

$ABNB is going to be turning into a juggernaut post-Covid and be the service type of company people thought UBER was going to be. Not only does $ABNB want to be the leader in vacation stays but also be the company to take care of you during your whole vacation from flights/Rail, ridesharing, drinks/food/goods with delivery.

Did you forget your toothpaste? $ABNB has someone deliver it to our door within an hour. Want some wine and dinner waiting for you at your Airbnb stay the moment you arrive? Boom done… If Airbnb got into the airline's space they would do a thing called wet-leasing which If Airbnb decided to wet-lease aircraft, they would not necessarily see the same startup costs a traditional airline would see and it would allow for them to ‘proof’ their concept before buying planes for themselves. $ABNB has the cash to make all this happen with 3.5B cash on hand to potentially create a vacation/outlet super app that is only just going to keep growing post-Covid. They even have the cash to buy YELP for 3.5B with YELP market cap at 3B so $ABNB can get into the reviews space and make it better by putting it on the Airbnb app while running ads creating a new revenue stream and cornering the review market forcing people to go into the Airbnb app where they could end up booking dinner even near home using the app while seeing Airbnb ads making them think they could use a vacation and book it while they are having dinner.

The thing they can work on is the Airbnb experiences and scale this up to be a big part of the revenue. Try the Amazon prime model with a membership to get “discounts” on food/stays and also these experiences to entice users to try it out. Flat discounts on products, probably additional bundled discounts for multiple services. Perks can be things like discounted ridesharing and goods delivered anywhere in the world as ABNB potentially partners with the major players in ridesharing/delivery as well as airline space. The reward program is easy; you can already establish a hotel-style reward program and layer in other benefits as you expand into other industries. Many companies will still be paying for employees to travel in the future.

Locking in big corporations with a membership that gives them prime pricing on flights, hospitality, etc. will yield big, consistent revenues - and make Travel & Expenses (T&E) much better. Also speaking of hospitality, ABNB could partner with some hotels and retrofit some better rooms and charge a high price than have the hotel take care of the cleaning and collect the cleaning fee so both parties win in this and hotels know ABNB can kill their business long term so join forces and not get wiped out.

Overall I think YELP acquisition would be the smartest move they can make in the short term and forget about wet-leasing planes for a few years until the balance sheet gets healthier post-Covid and fully recover but the acquisition of YELP with the cash wouldn't add debt and would increase user base numbers while providing extra revenue streams. One key stat to pay attention to is the average stay on Airbnb is now 28 days so it is not just weekend getaways/vacations but for living as well. Now that the lockup period expired and those who wanted to get out shares have done so, now the selling pressure should dry up in the mid 100s and we go back to the 200s.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HRTX Summer Marketing DD TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery. 

UPDATE AS OF 6/3

New Motley Fool commentary.

“Entering last month, Heron Therapeutics had two FDA-approved drugs on the market. Both were designed to treat nausea in cancer patients. But in mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Heron's post-surgical pain relief drug Zynrelef. The therapy combines a local anesthetic with an anti-inflammatory drug, and is administered as part of the surgical process. The delayed-release medication provides pain relief for 72 hours after surgery. Heron management believes this is key in helping post-surgical patients avoid the use of opioid pain medications.

The FDA approval was given for a limited set of surgeries: bunionectomy, total knee replacement, and a type of hernia repair. Those account for more than 2.1 million procedures annually, with 60% of those performed in an outpatient setting. Management has indicated it sees the potential for Zynrelef to hit $450 million in annual sales. Heron's other pain management candidate, HTX-034, recently entered phase 2 clinical trials. It aims to extend the pain relief to five to seven days. 

Given a boost from a federal budget that includes significant funds for research and raising awareness about addiction, Heron's opioid alternatives could quickly gain wide adoption in the medical community. Beyond public service campaigns and a speedier approval process, agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could create incentives for surgeons to use opioid alternatives like Zynrelef. There could also be regulatory support for its use in additional indications. There is already a precedent for Zynrelef's use beyond those initial surgeries approved by the FDA. The drug is authorized in 31 European countries for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. All of this adds up to a significant opportunity for Heron Therapeutics to grow its sales.”

You do your own research, as I take no responsibility for any of your decisions. Good luck

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Goldman Sachs DD **Introduction**

Goldman Sachs is one of the largest investment banks in the world and just posted a record quarter. This is just some calculations I made to see where I think the stock price will go.

[Goldman Sachs Stock Price](https://preview.redd.it/6gj3jb0fao271.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=739272802521d5f54e4343758e8ee272475c1273)

[Goldman Sachs PE Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/y359ggeiao271.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce7777a7303513bc38de04c6f2a832a10587259)

Despite Goldman's stock price reaching new all time highs their PE ratio has not expanded along with the stock price. As well according to Investopedia the average PE ratio in the financial industry is 13.5 which is higher than Goldman Sachs PE ratio. ([Link](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/gross-margin))

[2020 Revenue vs Q1 2021 Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/gow7iqo5bo271.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4c43f1fd60acf099d3deb9b21ae45ba21d1694)

[2019 Revenue per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/z755b5rjbo271.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2458a1e687d60d68921db8b27a218eeab5f47a0)

Using the above tables we can see that historically GS revenue is usually similar per quarter. (I used 2019 data because 2020 was skewed due to covid)

From this we can come to the conclusion that Goldman Sachs is roughly on pace to record $70.816B in revenue in 2021. This represents a predicted 59% increase in revenue from 2020.

&#x200B;

[2020 Net Income vs Q1 2021 Net Income](https://preview.redd.it/l37sx4lwho271.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91be2ee85b6c9b4b24683468f8a5624534a4b6e)

In the first quarter Goldman Sachs has already made 75.3% of their 2020 net income.

[2018 Net Income Per Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/o3fplv0eio271.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6fabe8218dea5c71c84f68025c7bf39118ddb11)

[2019 Net Income per Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/gyg6ycc9io271.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f123cec455272721b2aa9044b29a3f1ea2a6515)

From these tables we can see in Q2 Goldman typically averages 93.2% of their Q1 net income, in Q3 86% of Q1 income and in Q4 they average 82% of Q1 net income. From this historical data we can conclude that:

Q1: $6.711B

Q2: $6.24123B

Q3: $5.77146B

Q4: $5.50302B

2021: $17.51571B

This is a 96% increase from 2020 Net Income.

**Calculations**

Predicted EPS: 17.51571/0.361(Shares Outstanding) = $48.52 vs $24.74 (2020 EPS)

YTD the stock has gained 44.13%

Based off the increase in EPS of 96% if we take the cost per share at the start of 2021 which was $265 and multiply it by 1.96119532 (Predicted Gain in EPS) we come to a stock price of $519.72 by the end of 2021 without an increase in the PE ratio (which is already below the industry average).

If the stock reaches the industry average PE Ratio of 13.5 then the share price will be $655.02. (This probably won't happen though)

**Disclaimer**

I am not an expert on this and these numbers could be wildly off so feel free to correct me in the comments and I own only 3 shares because thats all I could afford."

2021-06-01 20:58:26,wallstreetbets,The position is still open. I have a margin call that I can not meet so Schwab will close my position in the next few days if the price doesn't retreat.

Look on the bright side - you can always start over next week."
2021-06-01 21:34:41,wallstreetbets,I've never found myself in this position. So what happens if you can't cover your margin call? I know they can liquidate your positions but what happens if you don't have the cash to cover?
2021-06-02 07:34:19,wallstreetbets,They can't do anything if you don't put more money in. It's not like they can come after you.
2021-06-01 21:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Damn.

Again, I'm very new to this.  Just started messing around with stocks, last month.

I still don't understand how you're losing money if you sold.  When people speak of: options, puts, shorting, etc. ... I have no clue.

Guess I need to read up more.

Thanks for the reply.

Sorry for your losses.  Best of luck, moving forward."
2021-06-01 20:37:41,wallstreetbets,The infinity button is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be.....unnatural
2021-06-01 23:36:52,wallstreetbets,Why would I give a fuck? Martin  Shkrieli should be in jail or worse!
2021-06-02 00:05:33,wallstreetbets,"In simple terms trading in margin is similar to most other kinds of loans (credit cards, mortgage, auto, etc...) and are handled in a similar way (though each broker may handle specifics differently). 

You can expect them to give you a negative balance with some time to deposit funds. You can expect that if you don't pay up they will give you a negative credit filling. If it's a very large amount they will probably take legal action to get you to pay."
2021-06-02 03:20:43,wallstreetbets,"He sells someone else stocks and when he wants to exit his position he needs to buy them back. 
So if the price rises he needs to buy them back higher and makes a loss. But when the stock price falls he buys them back for less and makes profit."
2021-06-01 20:49:12,wallstreetbets,I would say they’re more qualified than any of us with this kind of play
2021-06-02 04:18:27,wallstreetbets,Actually he fits right in bro
2021-06-01 23:37:15,wallstreetbets,he is dumbass
2021-06-02 02:50:35,wallstreetbets,"Legal action and ultimately a judgement is one thing but collecting that money is another thing entirely. If a person just doesn't have the money, brokers aren't getting anything for a while, if ever.

If I'm getting this right, brokers are able to give clients margin accounts and if the client gets margin called because of a loss, like OP's, and they can't pay, brokers are taking a loss? Now multiply this times how ever many people are trading on margin and are at a loss.... Holy shit every level of Wall Street is a house of cards built on sand."
2021-06-02 03:25:46,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the explanation.

Every time I feel I learn something new, I realize there's 5-10 more things I don't understand."
2021-06-02 04:25:20,wallstreetbets,Woosh
2021-06-01 23:39:23,wallstreetbets,I know that stupid
2021-06-02 09:30:55,wallstreetbets,"If the OP can't pay his remaining balance, Schwab can just put a lien on his house if it decides to take a legal action. Unless you tell me OP is a hobo, OP lives at his mom's basement, then mom's house gonna get a lien.

When you get a lien on your house, you can't sell your house or get a new loan on your house until all the liens are clear."
2021-06-02 09:55:03,wallstreetbets,What if OP is a renter?
2021-06-02 10:10:43,wallstreetbets,"They will try to put a lien on his other properties, like his car.

This is if the broker would use possible legal means to try to collect the debts. The most immediate action is filing a negative credit report to the bureau, thus a bad credit rating makes you difficult to apply for future loans."
2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Are you selling today?

People telling you otherwise are just bagholding and wishing their stock doesn’t drop further in price. Fuck the noise do what’s financially best for yourself."

2021-06-02 11:44:38,wallstreetbets,"Amazing movie.  During filming Jack Nicholson repeatedly fucked with people on camera.  For example, During a pretty big scene in the middle he pulled a gun on Leo.  Nobody knew he had a gun and it wasn't in the script."

2021-06-01 21:19:52,wallstreetbets,It's been my all time favorite since 2008. I watch it twice a year.
2021-06-01 21:21:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah Freddy Got Fingered is Martin Scorsese's best film in my opinion!
2021-06-01 22:19:49,wallstreetbets,It’s actually based off a HK movie Infernal Affairs

2021-06-01 22:35:00,wallstreetbets,I waited until tonight to check in on the audio. Best part of the movie. Duck mark Wahlberg though.

2021-06-02 12:44:26,wallstreetbets,Oh man you lucky duck. I wish I could watch the departed for the first time again
2021-06-01 21:44:58,wallstreetbets,"In the boston located crime genre, there's The Town, The Boondock Saints, Mystic River.

In the crime genre there's Heat, Goodfellas, The Usual Suspects, The Godfather Trilogy, Se7en, Scarface. You can look at pretty much any movie starring Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino or Joe Pesci and find something great.

If you go a bit older there's great Al Pacino movies like Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. Taxi Driver is a classic with Robert DeNiro as well."
2021-06-01 20:58:16,wallstreetbets,"One of my other favourite movies is American Hustle. Slightly different tone, not so grave and serious, but a friggin stellar cast. De Niro has a small part as the big mob boss, but Christian Bale is in it, Jennifer ""science oven!"" Lawrence, Amy Adams, etc.

This one is about a pair of con artists that get busted by the FBI and roped into doing a big undercover sting. But like... EPIC 😍😍😍"

They already tried this at an epic level a couple of months ago. It dropped so fast there were multiple trading halts. No one sold and the price was almost back to pre-dip levels by EOD.

2021-06-01 20:51:24,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-02 09:56:45,wallstreetbets,You guys should check out Infernal Affairs (2002).  It's the movie The Departed is inspired by.  Some sequences happen exactly the same as Scorsese was such a huge fan of the original he mirrored certain scenes.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ASO you ignorant slut!! So I'm putting it out there because you people seem small minded enough that real discussion doesn't work so I'll try abuse.  

ASO is actively climbing now after for weeks I've been trying to wake you idiots up.  I said they were great because their p/e was good and I was called a boomer. I said it was shorted 40 percent and I was told it's not amc. I said DKS blew it out and my posts were autofiltered.  

So....

Aso has a P/E of 9.7 you goddamned idiots. 
Aso is small compared to Dick's and has enormous room to grow you shmuck.
Aso is the go to for team sports, outdoor sports, grilling, camping,  just about everything outdoor.
Dick's sporting goods blew out their earnings causing their PE to go from 16 to 9. ASO is likely about to blow theirs out, and when they do it's could bring the PE from 9.7 to 5. Given the fact that they can take so much more profit share, well you see the logic

You are small minded cowards who can't think outside the herd consciousness of WSB. You respond almost exclusively to negative reinforcement. If I were a ring master with a whip you might listen, but the closest thing you're going to have to the whip is FOMO and you're about to get that.

I don't know if The admins only allow through the ticker symbols that they hold or what, but the idea that this stock has to sit and flounder when it has an easy 60% upside without even a short squeeze or gamma squeeze just blows my mind.
So let's just forget about the idea that the company has tremendous potential for growth, has The opportunity for his short squeeze and a gamma squeeze, or could attain the status of meme stock.
Still, as a value stock it is way way way undervalued. You can buy and sell it till the cows come home, when earnings come out this stock is likely going to shoot up just like Dicks did. I'm giving you a suggested play is all.

So there you have it. I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah blah blah you fucking fools.

300 shares aso,
35 and 40 calls June exp"
2021-06-01 22:20:18,wallstreetbets,"The problem with ASO is the fucker never meaningfully dips.  Just keeps chugging upwards.  Growth and tech sell off... doesn't blink chugs along.  Reopening and media do their thing... it just keeps chugging.  I had a bunch of August calls that I just keep selling one by one and taking profit.

I refuse to buy unless it's a dip or a discount.  Traded options sideways for 3 months in a heater of a market because I kept buying shit at ATH...  fuck that.

Maybe you meant Q4, hopefully, but still you need to realize the seasonal nature to a sports and outdoors store, last spring season and summer season everything was shutdown, now it’s wide open.

Franchise brick and morter retail is dead for about everyone other than home depot, bass pro, academy/dicks and a few others.

Sporting goods, outdoors, home improvement needs brick and morter.  A small video game retailer... nope.

Same thing with AMC.  My AMC calls is printing like a mofo.  Last time I went to an AMC was a depressing event.  Lady in front of me was returning her candy because it was so out of date.  A tired ass manager tried to help her, but every candy in the theater on the rack, was at least 2 years expired.  It was a ghost town pre pandemic, and a nasty ass mall where the ""J"" on JCPennys was burned out and the VCT flooring had been polished so many times it was this grayish brown.

Good enough for you. This is what I used when I bought calls earlier in the year (sold for a nice profit).

April and May have a significant drop-off in interest compared to last year. Going into the beginning of June interest is picking up (still a little lower than last year), so depending on the next few weeks you will be able to have an idea how June this year will look.

Long-term trends I think are for sales to go online, so would think long-term investors are going to be cautious here unless they are confident that sales figures are sustainable. Right now it seems very likely that last years strong sales were a fluke and other than seasonal boosts (e.g. people stocking up for summer) sales will revert to lower levels."
2021-06-02 07:41:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you on all of this. Gme could pivot to online or something but that would be tough.  AMC will have a tough time because people watch movies at home now.

I see your point and can see how that would make someone skeptical about their sales this quarter, but if that is the metric you want to use then fine. Explain this, why does ""Dicks Sporting Goods"" have the same exact trend line and also have the same slump you mentioned in comparison to this time last year, yet they just beat big on earnings and popped for almost 20%??"
2021-06-01 20:35:31,wallstreetbets,Everyone asks for DD and TLDR
2021-06-02 03:13:09,wallstreetbets,"For DKS, the recent report was for the period Feb-Apr 2021, which the trend compared to that period in 2019 (and 2020... Q1 2020 might not be the best comparison for the disruption of the initial impact of the pandemic) is way up still. If you look at the trend data from May and onwards and compare to 2020, it is down and compared to 2019 it is flat. My assumption would be that Q2 2021 might be comparable to Q2 2019.

Might be wrong, but the pandemic changed lots of behavior last year and that is over now. People were taking up golf or various other activities (e.g. maybe buying home exercise equipment and so on) and that is simply over. Whatever the specifics, it is pretty clear that sales are reverting back to normal levels and profits will be impacted accordingly.

Actually I will take a look at DKS since it had that jump and depending on how the numbers look if it repots at 2019 levels for Q2, will maybe just buy Puts on them for that. No way for me to know for certain, but I feel this is a move based on facts and assumptions not aligning.

Re, ASO, I think the drop-off in sales was in April already, so might be more readily apparent when they report numbers now (or maybe not till they report next time... not sure).

Edit - looking at DKS briefly, seriously considering opening Puts for Sep and maybe Dec in the $60-$70 strike range. The simple fact is that people are not suddenly going to permanently be buying more sports stuff, rather the significant increases ASO and DKS had were flukes and we are going back to normal soon. Main risk is they raise money (given the high share price) and do some acquisition or changes to the business that ups the enterprise value."

2021-06-02 06:46:23,wallstreetbets,"PLTR made a comeback from $18 to $23 within just two weeks, trend still unbroken and OBV is on record level since Feb. Why of all times sell *now*?"

2021-06-02 09:28:19,wallstreetbets,Pray to the one that's up or down?
2021-06-02 02:54:12,wallstreetbets,"I like Opendoor, they have good fundamentals. But its hard to not just put your money in Zillow."
2021-06-02 13:59:39,wallstreetbets,What I've understood is that the marketreach of Opendoor bigger is than Zillow's.
2021-06-01 20:21:47,wallstreetbets,This aged well.
2021-06-01 21:18:46,wallstreetbets,Time to get United on AMC.  It’s a about to blow the lid off!  🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-01 21:41:31,wallstreetbets,"went up to $39.41, retards should have diamond handed, but im pretty sure they wanted to make it appear to be a selloff, maybe even add shares to be able to short. either way, didnt work \*DerP\*"
2021-06-01 22:25:59,wallstreetbets,I just shorted my britches.
2021-06-01 23:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Screw mudick, but I have another question. Why did AA give Fudrick the shares, even though it is known that kG owns 4% of that company? Selling to a company thats associated to one of the people responsible for tanking your stock price in hopes to demolish your company IS NOT THE WAY"
2021-06-01 20:12:28,wallstreetbets,I've held my AMC since the first GME run up. Thanks for saving me 😁
2021-06-01 20:36:40,wallstreetbets,And guess what that mean more shares for us Apes! Fuck AA Ron
2021-06-01 21:16:05,wallstreetbets,This is loss of rocket fuel. Ken has a stake in Murdock and the shares were essentially in his control. Fuck you Adam aaron quit with the fkn handouts.
2021-06-01 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,40 percent
2021-06-02 01:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Just another way they’ve screwed retail. But hey, wtf do I know? 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-02 05:53:46,wallstreetbets,I think there is no stopping the train. Within a month it will squeeze. More than likely within a week.
2021-06-02 08:09:33,wallstreetbets,"It's probably pretty insignificant, but this sort of behaviour is why I'm more confident in GME than AMC tbh.
Hopefully I'm wrong though."
2021-06-02 11:07:38,wallstreetbets,I just got three tickets to see Cruella at my local AMC!
2021-06-02 15:26:34,wallstreetbets,Today is a good day
2021-06-01 20:26:15,wallstreetbets,"This says a floor has been built for AMC--just as at GME.  Do the 'rithmetic, 28/sh for AMC, just like 157/sh for GME. What did AMC do with the money?  GME did GOOD with the money; they're now debt-free with 300mil remaining to build their new business with people who know what they're doing.  GME will be the ODFL of the video game industry. What will AMC do to the movie theater business?"
2021-06-01 21:38:19,wallstreetbets,That's because AMC is a dying company. Execs capitalizing on the apes
2021-06-02 13:16:20,wallstreetbets,"Fuck!!
I sold at that last consolidation.  
Out at $51. Surges to $71"
2021-06-01 20:04:06,wallstreetbets,AMC hit the lottery and they needed to.
2021-06-01 20:20:24,wallstreetbets,"Let’s goooo!!!!!!🦍🦍🦍🦍

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE"
2021-06-01 21:31:44,wallstreetbets,Awesome. Saved my ass when I bought at 18 thx to all the GME mania and it promptly crashed.

Thoughts about tomorrow?"
2021-06-02 01:52:21,wallstreetbets,So I have heard the float is 450M shares. This company tweeted the 8 million was only 1~2% of their AMC investment. How many shares do they own and what's the float?
2021-06-02 02:28:36,wallstreetbets,So what.....amc made some money they deserve to it's not gonna affect the squeeze that's small fries

2021-06-02 13:32:38,wallstreetbets,Only 30%?
2021-06-01 22:35:52,wallstreetbets,"apes, please for your own sake buy ACB r/auroracannabis"
2021-06-02 00:21:33,wallstreetbets,I saw AMC at 37 in after-market.. and back down to 32 now. Is this still a hold?
2021-06-01 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,Shady move in my opinion but can you blame the guy?  If its allowed ofcourse he will take advantage. Anyone would for that kind of $$$.
2021-06-01 23:00:13,wallstreetbets,But they missed out on another $59 million if they held
2021-06-01 23:36:33,wallstreetbets,"It’s absolutely unreal to me how if you have the capital, a 1$ gain can “change your life”

2021-06-02 03:38:04,wallstreetbets,Sounds like the shorts got this hf to make a deal w AMC and then bought the shares immediately from the HF. So whoever the big short is took those 8m shares.

2021-06-02 12:37:59,wallstreetbets,So GLAD THE IDIOT MISSED out the opportunity and prob GOT BURNT shorting it by saying it was overvalued!!! LOL
2021-06-02 03:07:14,wallstreetbets,"When MUDS bought AMC stock at a premium of 27/share, that confirmed to those still at the fence that the stock is worth more than 27. When MUDS sold its stocks for a 50million gain, that sent a signal to whales and institutions the profitability of the movement. When TOPPS rejected MUDS acquisition and went for its rival, that shows the market sentiment of fear about crossing the apes.

MUDS is partly owned by Shitadel and all of stocks are now tanking into penny stocks. Whatever gain it made from the AMC deal, MUDS had lost it all and then more. It's reputation is now in the mud. 

Ironically,  MUDS has been that catalyst that gave investors more confident to FOMO on AMC."
2021-06-02 07:07:14,wallstreetbets,"230mil divided by 8.5mill shares in not 28$ a share its 27.

Why are people on here trying to make it look like the hedge fund made less money than they did?"
2021-06-01 21:40:08,wallstreetbets,He just called AMC overvalued. But keep drinking the kool aid
2021-06-01 21:59:02,wallstreetbets,So is marketwatch....
2021-06-01 23:16:26,wallstreetbets,Still think that?
2021-06-02 01:27:15,wallstreetbets,Yes but they prolly feared the backlash of potentially selling 8 million shares to shorters
2021-06-01 23:59:00,wallstreetbets,This
2021-06-01 21:33:42,wallstreetbets,"There was a vote to introduce 500 million new shares, which he pledged not to introduce any of in 2021. There were existing shares that he never made any such statement about. This was always a possibility and not something we were worried about."

2021-06-01 23:37:03,wallstreetbets,Definitely not surprised just another short tactic that didn’t work

I'm really debating on selling as I don't think this is sustainable. We'll see, I'm up pretty nice right now and don't want to lose it all. Anyway, wish I'd have gotten on the bandwagon when it was like $3."
2021-06-01 20:47:08,wallstreetbets,"It may have been me. I have no clue what I'm doing. I tried buying at $26.50? I think, but then Everything became a blur of whatthehellishappeningI'veneverdoneanythinglikethis!WhatthefuckdidIjustdo?DidIbuy?FUCK?!?!?!!!!. I think I bought at $30? something.

  Now I'm just going to forget this whole thing happened and maybe someone in the future will be able to make some sense of my shares and fears.

Edit: a couple of word.

Edit2: I just opened an account last night. I really mean I don't know what I'm doing. I do know that my account says I have some open shares, so I do have some?"
2021-06-02 01:15:31,wallstreetbets,They didn’t create the shares. Those where company held shares not from the float. They didn’t dilute the shares at all. Ultimately it just added more shares from the company shares overs to the to the float is all.
2021-06-01 22:18:18,wallstreetbets,Always wanted to know how to spell fshizzle.....Thanks a quadrillion
2021-06-02 01:22:09,wallstreetbets,I think the biggest issue is that they’re adding more stock to the float. The more stock there is in the float the easier it is for the shorts to find stocks to borrow. They now are short a lower percentage of the float than they were before.
2021-06-01 20:58:10,wallstreetbets,Einhorn is Finkle!
2021-06-01 22:01:46,wallstreetbets,Did we sell marketwatch shares?

2021-06-02 00:38:44,wallstreetbets,"Luckily I locked in my new build right before building materials went BRRRRR. If we waited 2 more weeks the price would have gone up over 10 grand. My wife (+ her boyfriend) and I could probably turn around and sell the house as soon as we move in for about 50 grand more than we payed for it. Something we might consider since our homebuilder is such a fuckshow. 

I'm a framer myself so I know how new homes are built here. We said we wanted a late summer possession date so we needed a start date around early March. They straight up lied to our faces and said it would start framing beginning of March, so  I asked if my crew could frame it. They said we couldn't because they already had a framer for the job. Then we didn't hear from them for 2 months despite constant emails and phone calls. Thought we got scammed. Well now we finally hear that framing is starting on June 15th and the delay was because they ""couldn't find a framer."" BRO I LITERALLY ASKED IF I COULD BUILD IT MYSELF! It became pretty obvious that they had no intention on excavating, pouring the foundation or doing weeping tile or any of that shit for months and just said they would start right away to get our non refundable $20k deposit. They probably hoped we would just say fuck it and back out so they could sell it to some other cuck 2 months later for $40k more. 

So anyways my crew is eyeballs deep in work rn and couldn't do it now anyways, so we're probably getting some fuckin clown to build it and it will probably be done poorly. But fuck it, better than being homeless I guess. 

Moral of the story: homebuilders are a bunch of crooks, especially now when everyone and their fucking dog is trying to build a new house. Bedrock homes can still go take a long walk off a short pier wearing concrete shoes tho. Fuck 'em."
2021-06-01 20:50:39,wallstreetbets,"The party will end relatively soon. Housing will continue to go up for a bit, and then when prices take the slightest dip or properties begin selling for list as opposed to over, the market will be flooded with properties owned by those who were trying to ride the wave to the top but are now afraid the top is already in.  At the same time, those who were getting ready to buy will decide to wait longer because of a market that is seemingly turning around.  Demand will shrink, and supply will increase.

2021-06-01 23:15:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm a General Contractor.

The wholesale retail spread in my market is very WIDE.  I think there is ALOT of runway left on the housing uptrend and we are a couple years away from a correction.  I think the trends will be more localized.  I can say with some local knowledge and experience that San Antonio, New Braunfels, Austin MSA, Dallas DFW Metroplex and MSA and Houston MSA, are RED HOT!   I'm seeing increases of 100% per square foot YoY with nice finishes and realtors are showing me deals with offers $30k over asking in the right areas in my city.

Correction will occur when rates go up, regulations go up, lumber and drywall supply is shot, GC's and trades are so backlogged that KY jelly lube is included in our quotes and the hedge funds saturate the hard money loan pools with capital, everywhere you look flipping seminars will also be advertised, so much so your mom and your wife's boyfriend are flipping houses.

Then the bottom drops out, when the marks are all roped in.

In the near future, I'm going to be on the lookout for wholesale deals where projects are abandoned, have permit issues and contractors that screwed the bag-holder/flipper to the point where they wish they never even bought the house in the first place or ever even heard about flipping."
2021-06-02 02:34:34,wallstreetbets,SPY is in a bigger bubble than housing.  There are no credit checks for margin accounts and options.  Housing is actually quite affordable when priced in assets not denominated in fiat currency.
2021-06-02 09:17:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying because houses in the price range that I'm looking at didn't go up nearly as much as the house I'm selling. Sure I'll pay maybe10% more for my new house than I would have a year ago($350ish instead of $315-$325ish), but I'm making 40% more on the sale of my house than I ever could have dreamed of before this($250k instead of $180k)."
2021-06-02 13:24:23,wallstreetbets,Ive been trying to buy land and build and looking at houses.  They'll post a house for sale and it's sold within hours for over the asking price.  It's really crazy right now.
2021-06-02 13:51:01,wallstreetbets,its because cost of materials is going up
2021-06-02 15:48:15,wallstreetbets,"I believe we would have to see the following happen before the housing market crashes:

\-The supply chain disruption returning back to normal. It's not rocket science to figure out that anyone profiting from lumber or other construction materials is going to want to sell as much as possible right now. 

\-Foreclosure protection and other government aid being stopped

\-Inflation running hot and interest rates being adjusted upwards by 2-2.5%. This would really screw over most businesses investing in residential real estate. The ones with manageable debt (50% or less than total equity) will be fine.

It's definitely retarded to buy or build anything right now. My guess is we'll still see a lot of buying from the upper middle class tech boys working for globalcorp for the coming months. My bet is that within 1 year of moving in they'll get screwed over the same way people got screwed over in '08 and the banks are going to get fined another 69$. Maybe less foreclosures, but more of seeing home values drop, monthly payments going up and salaries not keeping up.

I could also be wrong and housing could go up another 500x in the next 6-9months forcing me to trade stocks from under a bridge.

Tl;dr: Neutral to bullish view short term, bearish mid-long term. I could also be retarded."
2021-06-01 20:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Just because housing prices are high and bound to fall doesn't mean it is a bubble. Before 2008 there was a fundamental issue in housing in which they gave mortgages to any hobo on the street, but would always be able to accept a foreclosure and refinance, and would turn profits on it because housing constantly went up. When it finally stopped going up the bubble burst and it crashed. There isn't any need for housing prices to continue to go up in this scenario, if it pauses or corrects heavily, it won't cause the implosion of some of the biggest banks in America which is what happened in 2008, causing the financial crisis. They're frankly completely different scenarios. Also a sign that the great Michael Burry isn't betting against housing right now, but he's hedging against major inflation, which is what housing and many other industries are going through right now."

2021-06-01 22:18:30,wallstreetbets,"> Yes the housing market is overpriced but it is not a bubble.

Buying a house in March and listing it in May for 6% is absolutely indicative of a bubble. Real estate appreciation is not the same as a meme stock chart.

> LOOK AT THE CMBS and CLO markets to find the real BUBBLE

This is correct. The thing is that the total amount of debt in those markets was $19.5T pre-COVID. That is nearly double the entire mortgage market. When the corporate debt bubble blows, everyone who thought their job was secure and bought into $400/square foot at 3% with a 40% back-end DTI will find out just how little big companies give a shit about their people."

2021-06-01 23:19:29,wallstreetbets,"I’m in Denmark and it’s pretty much the same here. The national bank issued a press release last week with a warning about the housing market situation. Prices are soaring. There has also been speak of increasing the current minimum down payment of 5% all the way up to 15% before being able to be approved of a mortgage loan. 

Meanwhile I just bought an apartment 1 month ago. GUH 

I’d say I got a pretty good deal tho. The lady selling was looking for a quick deal as she was looking to buy a new apartment herself. This meant that I got it way cheaper than the apartments in the surrounding area even though this one was in wayyy better shape. Completely new bathroom and such."

2021-06-02 02:04:10,wallstreetbets,"We have 0% rates here, had negative for almost a decade. This means its possible to take a massive loan in a small income. Its also Very very easy to get a morgage as Long as you have a downpayment and none check IF you take a private loan to get the downpayment. This is not really supposed to happen but is standard. This means that i know LOTS of People Paying more the 1/3 of their entire income on interest for morgage + private loan. That works until rates go Up slightly and the all these People are fucked.

Om top of that demands comes from foreign investers, mainly chinese and Qatari, buying Up property.

On top of that, we have massive immigration, and these People cant House themselves, so government comes in and buy Up property att insane rates for taxpayers money to house migrants.

On top of that the government pays insane amounts of housing subsidies to People struggling with rent, this has basically removed the downward pressure on rents since everyone can Always manager rent with governments help, this in turn makes it very attractive to buy Up property in order to rent it out since government helps people to pay the high rents. 

The whole system is so fucked..."
2021-06-02 02:16:02,wallstreetbets,"Lumber and Cooper went Up in Europe aswell but not as much as in US. Food is not very inflated yet, prorobably because EU is very farming/agruculture focused, One of its primary pupouses was to ensure there would never be starvation in Europe again after ww2.

The thing about rising commodity prices is that Swedens biggest raw material exports is lumber, Cooper and Steel. So the massive increase in the prices of these commodities Will likely put quite a bit of well needed money into Sweden. At least as Long as our Green party don't fuck Up our industry more then they already have.

That said, reported inflation is not that high, but comparing how much food you get for 500 SEK today compared to 5 years ago feels very different. But that is also likely due to the SEK getting weaker and we import like 60% of all food we consume.

But no. Most of Sweden's inflation goes straight to housing market. Except possibly farming land. We don't have much of that in Sweden and the Price of it is of the charts. It would take a century for farming land to break even.

2021-06-02 02:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Yes Stockholm, Lund and Uppsala were defenatly worst. But since 2020 rest of country is catching Up. People move out of citys. Citys are mainly growing due to immigration since last 5 years. But that also causes lots of problems, here in Skåne we have massive middleclass flight from Malmö (what Americans call White flight) pushing Up prices in all towns with a train station all over Skåne. I havent looked into it but its likely the same around Stockholm and Göteborg."
2021-06-02 17:13:26,wallstreetbets,">rom what I've heard of the swedish housing market, you guys are weird with your lifetime mortgages and decade of waiting for a rental.

its indeed insane here. Although mainly in citys. But you are not wrong on either of those points. I live in Lund (like swedish version of oxford or cambridge) and there is 7 years + wait for a rental with more then 2 rooms. Buying is not really an option anymore unless you also have a house to sell. Most mortgages pans are 40 or 50 years long yes and this has transformed swedish public to the most endebted population in the world. We had 7 years with -0.5% federal interest rate.   


This will hurt when inflation start to spread out of housing sector and rates have to start go back up."

I'm not sure what the rules are around in different parts of the world when it comes to foreclosures. But in one Canadian province, the lender sells the home at best value and any loss (negative balance between owed amount and home sale price)  gets hammered down to the borrower. 

This loss can and will easily be 6 figure. Some cities in Canada have had quite the hot market since COVID hit. If thousands of people suddenly go into 6 figure toxic debt (just gonna say mortgage debt is good debt lol), this could really hit the economy hard.

2021-06-02 13:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the perspective.

We are in the throws of a hysterical market here in America.People with no jobs are out buying furniture, laptops, and gaming consoles at 2x-3x the normal  costing. People with tenuous career stability are out buying RV's, Boats, or new homes at +20% asking price.

The retired or the jobless are literally taking their 'stimulus checks' to pour into a new bathroom, or unneeded home remodeling.

It's a frenzy, drunken, and unyielding. The music will stop soon. Trying to convince  as many people I know and love to not be left on the dance floor when it does.

All that said, I sold 3000 shares of AMC at near $150k profit today.Reality is getting illusory. I've never been more frightened of a coming year.

In regards to the insanity, my instincts are shouting melt up! But they have for 3-4 years now and I too have been trying to warn loved ones. Dont mortgage yourself into oblivion for 40 years for a house, you can wait until the crash to buy. But when that crash never comes you kinda lose some credibility...  


An other thing to mention when it comes to Swedens state is that in 2014 we had the 4th lowest unemployment in EU. 2021 we have the 5th highest in all of OECD. This during a raging bullmarket. Its our current government shattering industry and entrepreneurship while constantly increasing taxes so that the average swede now pays 58% tax. 62% if you earn more then $4200/month.  
Couple that with the highest private debt in the world, potential for increased rates and a possible recession pushing up unemployment further and you have a lot of potential mortgages defaulting.

I used to always think that the crash was imminent, but the whole ""the market can remain irrational longer then you can remain solvant""-thing has really sunken in. My guess is that we can print ourself through this year, maybe even the next one, but only time will tell. I'm not getting into any market except precious metals without proper stop losses or hedging. This is the wrong forum for those attitudes though!"
2021-06-02 19:42:19,wallstreetbets,It's going to depend on what companies are going to do going forward.

2021-06-02 04:10:06,wallstreetbets,"The government does less. For example, the government of Texas make winterization optional because they didn't want to regulate it, well that didn't work well this summer.

Texas also has a bunch of stipulations on stuff like Medicaid.No matter how poor you are, if you aren't a parent, pregnant, disabled, 65+ and don't have a disabled person you have to take care of you are not getting health insurance[source](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1640). Meanwhile California let's those with snap apply for medi-cal [source](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Pages/DoYouQualifyForMedi-Cal.aspx). Texas ranks 41st in per student k-12 spending [source](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics#education-spending-by-state) which may be fine if you are an adult without children, but what business wants to hire locals if they are not well educated?  

Texas and frankly most other red states are not a nice place to live in unless you basically already have everything and know for sure you will continue to do so. 

Sure school funding doesn't really matter if you send your kids to private school, but for the majority of people higher tax areas are better when the money is spent well.

I don't see how this is a big surprise that rich people don't prioritize the same things the rest of us do? I am not against living in higher tax areas because they generally have better social safety nets, better worker protections, and a higher quality of life to make up for it.

Rich people can buy all of that for themselves and couldn't give a damn if they are in a state that requires companies to give you breaks."

2021-06-02 17:57:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to write a long-winded diatribe. Feel free to ignore.Yes - I am in California, and the housing market has reached levels of retardation that are hard to imagine. The amount of remodeling occurring specifically is shocking. Wasteful and luxurious spending. I see new boats, jet skis, and RV's popping up outside of my neighbors houses at alarming pace. As an aside, my neighbor received somewhere around $600k in PPP loans from the initial government stimulus. He is already bankrupt and divorced a year later. And their house is up for sale. Reality comes at you FAST. It's all just bizarre at this point. The traditional 'excuses' for many market inflationary changes do not 'track' overseas -- ie: Canadian Beetles and Mill construction taking 2 years causing lumber pricing to increase 400%. Then why do we see similar in comparative but disconnected markets? Ultimately, I am bullish on two things - Vietnam and Singapore. For opposite reasons. But I think collectivley, worldwide we are about to experience a gigantic 'reality check' the likes of which 2008 only gave us a slight taste of. I can smell it in the air. A generation of 20-30 yearolds, have no idea what is about to hit them.

Eh, maybe I'm just chicken little.

To preface:I've been to Sweden a handful of times. I used to live in the Nederlands and was involved in the oil/gas industry for many years.

I can tell you one thing, from an outsiders perspective -- I thought it was paradise in 1994. When I was there last in 2015 -- I thought the opposite.

For a small country, rich in natural resources, with a highly educated, mono-cultural and healthy people -- that churns out technically proficient engineers, capable of manufacturing cars, machinery and aerospace sectors -- you guys kinda 'threw away' your future. I'm not savvy enough to understand exactly why, but I felt a vacuum effect happening across most of your manufacturing endeavors. I'm partial to a pretty elementary viewpoint that a mixture of 'Green Party' nuttery mixed with very irresponsible immigration principles (Somali's do not 'add value' in a small country with incredible (but expensive) social welfare systems).

But again, I'm ignorant of the day to day realities of life in Sweden.

Either way, your quote remains valid. Irrational markets remains irrational longer than your own solvency. I am not 'betting' against the markets. Puts or Shorts are a dangerous game that should only be implemented by a handful of people in the world, touched by a mixture of genius and balls of steel. I'm smart, and my balls are big, but I possess neither. I'm just an old man, trying to further diversify against what I see as inevitable transitionary times in Ameria/W.Europe.

From an investment perspective, I am heavily invested in a few undervalued European Banks, Polish ETF's and Polish companies, oil and gas at large, and about 50-60 equities that I feel like are overvalued, but not by THAT much.

But I am 'preparing' so to speak for the inevitable since about January.

In California, this means, I am lowering all personal income through my businesses to make sure to remain under a \~$350K ($400K per annum) rough target. There's incredibly unconstitutional talks of California State being able to 'tax' any residents that leave for damn near a decade.

I'm seriously considering moving my entire family and businesses out of State, if not outright closure and retirement, and just sitting on the remaining assets until a more favourable period.

I'm very interested in purchasing land outside of developing areas, as well as looking into living overseas again. With eyes on Singapore, or a post-Covid 19 Thailand -- depending on the lifestyle and business aspirations in the twilight of my life.

All I can say is despite making more in the markets in the last year, than in any other year in my life -- none of this feels 'real'. All a fever-pitched illusory dream. Usually the fever-induced dreams and dellusions, turn to nightmares.

Good luck out there!"

I'm not sure I understand this. 

From my understanding, most brokerages give you about 2:1 leverage overnight. They can also change that amount depending on how concentrated or risky they view your positions.

\----

IANAL and this isn't financial advice but margin is already something really risky to play with... please rethink using the amount of margin that you're using right now. The market barely moved and you got margin called. Can you imagine if there was a flash crash? You wouldn't be able to get any of your money back when the market recovers."

He may have shorted and bought puts in the 900s and covered in the 500s. PS. TSLA Powerwalls are 9 month wait time so demand is off the charts.

2021-06-01 21:09:17,wallstreetbets,always start off playing with 1 dollar or less stocks but do a bit of DD so it's not just a random guess. Then you can get a feel for what to expect. you can buy cheap options plays for less than 20 bucks
2021-06-02 00:22:59,wallstreetbets,"This is the video that turned on the lightbulb for me.  Weekly covered calls are the way.  After I watched it I did a small value one so I could learn in real time but also not fuck myself.  That was maybe a month ago.  I've now made $4300 in covered calls in the last month (on $134,000 of underlying stocks - and $83,000 of that is TSLA that I really don't want to sell so I only play way OTM there) and I'm only getting better.  


Don't be too greedy, don't sell a call when you're not willing to sell the underlying stock at that price, cash out if it hits 90% profits and then roll that bad boy a week forward. Rinse and repeat.... profit."
2021-06-01 20:42:01,wallstreetbets,"I never told you not to try, some people are successful with options and do well after years of research and experience. We are all just trying to give you a proper warning that it isn't easy money like people make it out to be. For every 1 person that hits it big from options, 100 people lose it all. That's just how the game goes. I've been investing for almost 8 years and have seen so many people on Reddit lose a ton of money. We're not trying to be assholes, just wanting to make sure you understand the odds are stacked against you. But either way, godspeed and good luck."

2021-06-01 20:13:20,wallstreetbets,"One good use of margin is in buying so you don't have to park a lot of cash in an account. 30 years ago with longer settlements I could have my broker buy something, receive the bill in the mail, mail in payment, and have the check cover the purchase.  OK so I lived a few miles from the brokers' offices. That meant no margin loans.

Last year my new broker was having the back office work only two days a week and I was making huge purchases in March 2020.  It took one mailed check for 20,000 19 days to clear.  Margin loans were up to 35,000 at one point.  Ultimately margin loans cost about 60D due to their delays.  Made me totally rethink where and how I moved money."

All the bullshit you see online nowadays is from the fucking 90's.  That's how old and out of date that shit is."

There are professional gamblers who actually make a lot of money in casinos.  Here's the thing.  Professional gamblers don't know what cards are going to be dealt more than anyone else. They're not making money because they're luckier, or because they are ""right"" more often.  They make money because they are really good at risk management.  The know how to bet to maximize gains and minimize losses.  Same here.  People making a living in the markets aren't better at reading prices than other people.  It's not about super secret TA that predicts the future because that doesn't exist.  It's about capital management.  It's about risk management.   Staying emotionally disconnected.  Those are the real secrets."

CMA FISH KT have no place in these labs. Not to mention NIPT will ensure the penetration of the healthcare market. There will be saphyrs in every hospital. HUGE market, CEO has already said TAM is much higher.

Nanonozzle will make PACB lose all their customers

2021-06-02 10:26:35,wallstreetbets,"Do you work in this space? I don't think you understand how this works. Nanonozzle is far from deployment as a sequencing technology, and anyway there is little benefit from ""ultralong"" reads because DNA is usually too fragile to be able to get such long molecules anyway and the problem of detection is readily solved with any reads that are >50kb in all but the most repetitive regions of the genome like the centromere. If you're doing sequencing, unless they can beat pacbio on cost per Gbp of sequence, they're going to come up short. And PacBio has been doing this for a while now and their tech has gotten progressively better. Oxford nanopore is already in widespread usage. Your speculation that BNGO and Illumina are the only major players is absurd. I work in this space and I literally can't tell you anyone that has used BNGO for anything. Pacbio, I can point to literally 20+ colleagues that continue to use it. Same for Oxford nanopore. Maybe they get this nanonozzle going eventually, but this is not going to happen fast, and they're way behind Oxford + Pacbio."

TAM is according to CEO HIGHER 'substantially' than 3B which is current estimates

2021-06-02 00:36:06,wallstreetbets,Any day is t+21 if you get to choose every day as t
2021-06-02 00:58:19,wallstreetbets,Does a short squeeze still count if a subreddit didn’t figure out exactly why it happened before it happened?
2021-06-02 00:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately you don't, been working with them for years hoping they would find a way."
2021-06-02 08:10:23,wallstreetbets,"I'd love to have a window to look into your mind because it must be filled with some crazy fucking monkeys swinging around flinging shit and eating fleas off of each other's backs to come up with a comment like this. Company stock **IS** the company - a share of ownership of it's assets and earnings. Blatant pointless semantic arguing to confirm your views.

No one cares if you own one, your wife's boyfriend works there, you think it's an innovative company. There's no other way to spin it, it's a bet against Tesla."
2021-06-02 02:35:16,wallstreetbets,"No thank you to Ford. 
Driven them, never liked them.  I only buy German cars."
2021-06-02 08:38:18,wallstreetbets,"Company stock IS NOT the company. It's much more than that. And you're absolutely fucking kidding yourself if you think the share price of a company is 100% tied to the success of that company. Companies that are in absolute shit places can go to the moon if the money goes into them. Look at hertz. Close to filing for c9 bankruptcy last year and the stock ran up 10x for no other reason than retail fomo. I know it because I was there and no one I knew started talking about hertz until it had already run from ~70 cents to over $4, despite there being WORSENING fundamentals. 

Or do I have to remind you of SPAC mania that occurred over this last year? Shit ass companies like NKLA that produced NOTHING and will likely never produce anything were trading at $90 a share at the peak. 30 billion $ evaluation for nothing more than power point slides of photoshopped really nice looking trucks (except the trucks didn't exist and likely never will)

Look at AMC, for instance. What news coverage fundamentally changed the position of the company in the last FOUR DAYS to more than double the valuation of the company?

Stocks in the stock market represent a company to some extent but they also represent human psychology, FOMO, and greed. If you're knowledgeable AT ALL about the stock market you'd know that the dot com bubble is representative of ALL OF THIS. 

You're an actual blithering idiot if you think stocks can't become divorce from their actual real value due to human greed and fomo. Look at the volkswagen squeeze. Look at the gamestop squeeze."
2021-06-02 02:43:37,wallstreetbets,so that's Ferrari fucked then
2021-06-02 13:12:26,wallstreetbets,"It's super simple - why would anyone enter this position if they didn't believe the share price was going to go down? Hence, ""It's very clearly a bet against Tesla"". Take a look at his Twitter, he clearly thinks they're massively overvalued.

No one said Tesla is a shit company. 

No one said the share price of a company is 100% tied to the success of a company.

No one said prices aren't influenced by human psychology.

Sorry your feelings got hurt because people are short Tesla."
2021-06-01 20:41:20,wallstreetbets,"This is one of Jim Cramer's favorite stock and of course he's bullish. He even came up with an acronym for his favorite stocks ""FAANG"" Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. And yep, he's still bullish even though they got hammered over the previous months. I been watching the show, he just doesn't give up on these stocks. So if you are like most WSBers, do the opposite of Jim Cramer XD"
2021-06-02 05:11:01,wallstreetbets,It's doing great here in the bay area

2021-06-02 10:39:04,wallstreetbets,"I can absolutely see the market for it. My best friend’s wife has Alpha-gal from a tick bite, so all mammal meat is off the table. She does a lot of soy and emu or tuna steaks. She was very excited when this became available, but can’t stand the texture.

There’s certainly a small market for it, but not enough for me to have faith in their long term success."

2021-06-02 04:42:58,wallstreetbets,Where'd you get those short interest numbers? The stuff I'm seeing show around 10% short interest.
2021-06-02 08:19:57,wallstreetbets,"another possible catalyst?

2021-06-02 14:42:43,wallstreetbets,After a few posts about Wish I did some DD and moved 20% of my Roth into wish and did 100 contracts through June. I might sell already 20% returned. Thanks.

2021-06-02 19:06:47,wallstreetbets,As a new trader. You hit some very key points. A co worker of mine told me about $WISH. And said everything you said. But everything is so cheap! So I actually believe in the concept.
2021-06-02 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,"27, 21, 15 and a lot at 7.50"
2021-06-02 19:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Cheap doesn’t always mean undervalued IMO, sometimes they belong there. A higher history doesn’t dictate a good future, sometimes it dictates it was overvalued prior and corrected appropriately. Also, hedge funds short people sometimes because they deserve it, unlike AMC/GME, etc...I may speak from bias, though, as I mentioned, I find it hard to buy a stock from someone whose kool-aid I refuse to drink. 🤣 I just personally feel like wish should die and go away, unless they begin to enforce customer protection policies that ensure the good ordered is the good delivered. Imagine if Amazon decided to send you fake goods half the time and barely assisted, they’d plummet. Lol."

2021-06-01 23:34:11,wallstreetbets,"If we are talking long term I would say certainly not. Its a company that competes on price and its assets become less and less valuable over time. As a short term trade or maybe a year one/two trade, the logic makes sense if you believe that the chip shortage will persist for another year or a lot longer. Though I haven't actually looked into whether the numbers make any sense."
2021-06-02 00:01:25,wallstreetbets,"I don't really try to predict things. I'm really a long term investor type of guy, so I own TSMC because I don't see Samsung catching up [based on projected density](https://semiwiki.com/events/294639-iss-2021-scotten-w-jones-logic-leadership-in-the-ppac-era/). I think there is a large possibility that even Intel will eventually be forced to go to almost entirely to TSMC but that would be at least a decade away. 

As far as UMC goes it is a much better way to play the shortage than TSMC and I think all the things you wrote up are real tailwind. Intel CEO says they expect shortages for like another year and a half. TSMC said they are only expecting to meet minimum allocation for their auto maker partners by June, so it sounds like the chip shortage would last a lot longer than that. I don't try to predict market sentiment. That's too hard for me"

The situation could change but might take some time. In the short run, you could expect a sympathy run along with AMC & GME but don’t expect it to moon anytime soon.

Hoping one of these days to get lucky and actually be able to earn a life changing amount.  Don't get me wrong, 400 is a lot of money to me, but it isn't going to pay off my debt or pay for my kid's college, so this is my best bet. Any idea as far as anticipated return on NIO?"

It would be few years but NIO's market cap is 50B now, down from it's high of around 95B. So, I see it's a 3x opportunity at least in few years. Short term, I am not to sure what the market would do."
2021-06-02 19:34:13,wallstreetbets,"NIO is a chinese premium EV giant. It's still growing company. The CEO Bin Li is visionary and the company has some unique approach to selling their cars, very customer friendly company. It will be a beast in 5 years."

2021-06-02 19:39:05,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Buy price is $41.24 on Etoro app. Worth buying ? Jesus I'm nervous to invest $1000 😅
2021-06-02 08:39:30,wallstreetbets,But yet I didn't even need to read the article and I know what happened
2021-06-02 11:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Haha. true. Unless you have like 10k, it's hard to make money."
2021-06-02 19:36:29,wallstreetbets,"I am not a XPEV fan. I feel the company is short sighted and trying to compete with Tesla directly, whereas NIO has more unique approach to their business which Tesla lacks and that's why I feel it will succeed more in China."
2021-06-01 22:00:39,wallstreetbets,You were saying...
2021-06-02 11:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Zoom makes use of servers located in China, and the option to select the region to which your data is sent is only available for paid users. Ergo, the app is absolutely insecure. Mutahar made a video on the matter not long ago."
2021-06-02 11:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Jeeze, 10k is more than I make in a year.  This all stared with me saving up $50 so that I could get a start in earning something because I got tired of the negligable interest on savings accounts (another way to make money if you already have a bunch).  It's worked so far, up to $400, and hopefully the NIO stock is the way to go.  I don't need to be a millionaire, I am not that greedy, but man it'd be nice to be debt free."
2021-06-02 19:42:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks.  XPEV is a Tesla practically.  I don’t think competing with Tesla is a bad thing since we are talking China.  They will beat up on Tesla most likely.  Didn’t know NIO had an approach which was all that different.
2021-06-01 22:13:24,wallstreetbets,Nothing about today is anything like GME. This buying isn’t a squeeze. It’s someone trying to make one happen.
2021-06-02 12:35:32,wallstreetbets,Also people like my entire company only use zoom when GCs ask us to and own a free account to do so.
2021-06-02 10:44:08,wallstreetbets,"well, i sold a few at $30, same way i sold a few when it hit $20 which was my original goal/hope for the stock.

now that’s it’s $40, i sold a few more again. in your opinion, what are the odds we see AMC hit $50+?

also, thanks for such a well written and valuable response yesterday :)"
2021-06-02 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,The volatility is really high so it’s certainly possible it could keep going up. It could also crash. You can’t know where the top is until you’re sure you’ve missed it. So take profit when you’re happy.
2021-06-02 11:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Ah, fair enough. In your personal opinion, where do you put the chances that AMC hits $50+ ? 

I was thinking about holding and seeing, if it drops to like $35, then sell."
2021-06-02 11:08:59,wallstreetbets,"I didn't think it would hit $40 so why do you care what I think? :P Other people's opinions are useless. it can go up and it can go down. It sounds like you have a strategy. if you're happy with that strategy, stick with it. you can always adjust more later."
2021-06-02 11:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Cause you’re one of the only ones who isn’t just chanting the usual WSB slogans lol. Appreciate it though, best of luck to you as well :)"
2021-06-02 11:14:41,wallstreetbets,oh sorry. this is the way. apes together strong. stonks only go up. rocket ship emojis.
2021-06-02 11:30:18,wallstreetbets,"I sold 6 more at $40, 2 mins later it hit $43 :P

2021-06-02 12:55:21,wallstreetbets,"LMFAO. I wanted to sell a couple at $61, but literally couldn’t cause my broker WealthSimple is 15 minutes behind and they halted the stock.

2021-06-02 12:10:10,wallstreetbets,"I’m feeling really relaxed right now at $49. I actually thought you were talking sense when I first saw your comment but in the end, nobody knows what they‘re spouting."
2021-06-02 12:12:56,wallstreetbets,"And what did you buy in at? This is simply another round of January meme stock surge, no one knows when it will end or how hard it will crash back down. I have 7 stocks with over 10+% gains today and the past two days lol, so approximately 30-50% gains IN THREE DAYS. 

Is it retail driving this alone, hedge funds joining, shorts actually getting punished? Who knows for sure. 

I've been very successful taking 200% profits on these type of surges and I haven't been caught holding the bag once. 

No one knows exactly what will happen of course but if you care anything about actual financials then there is at least a base level of understanding a smart investor would have. 

Now if you're just gambling then call it what it is lol."

2021-06-02 07:54:58,wallstreetbets,This post has aged well though. It should cool off back to mid 20’s and then resume the uptrend since it may retest the 200 EMA and bounce off. You will make mucho dinero
