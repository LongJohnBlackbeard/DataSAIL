2021-05-07 19:39:44,stocks,"Absurdly overvalued to start with, maybe the market is returning to some level of rationality."
2021-05-07 19:39:46,stocks,"I am heavily invested in ABNB at low 160s as I believe in the brand and business model. I think it’s an opportunity to buy but each of his own decision to make. 

I didn’t see any specific news but it has been bundled with other gig economy companies like Uber,  DDASH etc. but I believe ABNB is better than those."
2021-05-07 19:59:05,stocks,"There’s news everywhere, recent legislation against them throughout Canada. Additional by laws preventing their use. Multiple lawsuits and pending lawsuits…"
2021-05-07 19:40:46,stocks,"Could be due to the upcoming earnings on May 13th. The stock is fairly new so there really is no way to tell what the average range is. However, it is considered overvalued right now."
2021-05-07 19:41:36,stocks,"It’s a tech stock. Essentially they make money on collecting data. Very similar to Facebook, tik tok, Uber, Lyft etc. Their worth is based upon users not anything physical. If you’re skeptical you should be those companies can implode on a dime."
2021-05-07 19:49:45,stocks,"You must have bought the same tech dip I did on Tuesday morning? Kicked myself for not selling Wed morning but at least Mr. Market gave me another opportunity this morning to turn a little profit before bleeding the rest of the day.

Here's hoping for a real run up on Monday..."
2021-05-07 19:32:27,stocks,">I don't know what to do anymore. Totally clueless.

you don't need to figure it all out today. just take a break. go read a novel or walk the dog. leave the portfolio alone for a few weeks. clear your head.

IMO investors should have a core position of something low-feethat covers the entire market or a cross section of the market. there's nothing wrong with augmenting that with some speciality/sector funds or active management or other strategies. there are many roads to heaven, to paraphrase Warren Buffett. there's research showing the most important thing is just saving money into whatever options are a available. 

In a taxable account, ETFs can have an edge over index funds/mutual funds. ETFs are usually structured to minimize capital gains. 

as a general rule, investing is for money you can leave alone for several years. 5 years is the usual guideline, because ~90% of any 5 year periods have a gain. if you'll need this money in as little as 3 years I would not invest all of it. part of it? sure. but the rest is fine in a CD, savings account. don't obsess over every last dollar needing to aggressively earn more money for you. nothing wrong with a big fat savings account. most people have $1000 or less in the bank. 

might want to look at a low-volatility ETF for the taxable account. they will have a ""beta"" lower than 1. VTI has a beta of about 1, meaning it moves exactly with the market because it IS the market. ARK funds will have beta of about 1.5 to 1.7, or 50-70% more volatile than the market. In contrast, a low-volatility ETF will have a beta of maybe .6 ... so it's LESS volatile than the market, the ups and downs will probably be less intense.  low volatility will be less prone to sharp drops in a crisis. here's one, for example, look under ""portfolio characteristics"".

2021-05-07 19:39:14,stocks,Do you still have your big tobacco positions?
2021-05-07 19:37:38,stocks,"Appreciate your tips!  The thing is I don't really know how much money I will need going forward... that is the question.  And right now holding cash in savings accounts or even CDs is just awful.  I see an opportunity to make my life just a little easier down the line while still shielding myself from total market risk.  But yeah, I do have a significant portion of it out of the market as you said.

I should also say I'm having fun with all of this, and I've learned a lot.  Sometimes it just gets to be too much.  I like your advice... step away for a bit.

That ETF is quite interesting.  I'll be taking a closer look.  Thanks!"
2021-05-07 19:40:25,stocks,"Yes, I still hold PM, BTI, and IMMBY.  I dumped the rest."
2021-05-07 18:47:36,stocks,"A 10% gain is a 10% gain whether it’s on half a share of Amazon (~ $1600) or 100 shares of a $16 stock. In both cases your gain is roughly 10%.

I think the thought for most people is it’s “easier” for a $16 stock to double to $32 than it is for a $3,200 stock to double to $6,400. But ultimately for a stock to double its market cap is hard regardless of the initial stock price."
2021-05-07 18:32:52,stocks,You could always just find a fund thats heavy in both Amazon And Google...So you can get both as well as invest in a bunch of other companies as well.
2021-05-07 18:05:24,stocks,If you use fidelity you can do fractional to get exposure and still diversify
2021-05-07 19:19:32,stocks,"If you want to ""set it and forget it"" I'd recommend something like VTI.  Almost nobody beats the market picking stocks, so you'll outperform most people and save yourself lots of time. Just add more into VTI every month. Check the balance in 10 years and you'll be very happy."

2021-05-07 18:50:36,stocks,SPY will be better in the long run for consistent gains.  AMZN likes to oscillate.
2021-05-07 18:08:04,stocks,"As in, smarter/efficient/worthwhile in a return aspect. I want to buy one AMZN and some smaller stocks, but i was hoping for advice either for or against the juggernaut approach.

Sorry I’m still new and I’m probably not explaining myself as clearly as I’d like."
2021-05-07 18:10:08,stocks,"well it comes down to your reason as to why choose those specific stocks in the first place. as for pure diversification, yes it's better to have more eggs in your basket. if you don't know much about the stock market just put it in a VOO or similar ETF and be done with it."
2021-05-07 17:03:21,stocks,Yes.  I don’t know what that other mutton head is talking about.
2021-05-07 17:04:10,stocks,"yes

selling call: you receive 200 

exercised call: you receive 3200

you paid 3000 for 100 shares

total profit is 400"
2021-05-07 17:38:57,stocks,"Yes. you sell at the strike price. If that strike price is above your purchase price, you also gain that profit. 

That is what selling a covered call is: you are offering to be the seller of shares at a agreed upon price. in exchange for this, you collect premiums, but you must sell if called. It cannot be higher or lower than the strike price, it will be exactly the strike price."
2021-05-07 17:27:57,stocks,"I have a question too...

Say you're in the money. You can just sell the contract and make a profit, but if you exercise it, do you have to right then and there pay for 100 shares of that stock at your strike price and then can instantly sell it for a major profit OR do you get paid what 100 shares of that strike would be worth without having to sell the stocks?

Sorry that question is all over the place- I'm new to options trading and I wanna get things right before I start gambling money."
2021-05-07 17:01:35,stocks,You get paid the premium minus commissions when you sell the contract.  If it is exercised you get paid the strike price for your shares.  The spread you do not get or who would buy?
2021-05-07 17:12:32,stocks,"Uh oh getting mixed answers here, you’re speaking from experience?"
2021-05-07 17:13:15,stocks,Thanks 🙏 good answer
2021-05-07 17:34:55,stocks,"just sell it for a profit

there is no option that exists where exercising early makes more than selling the contract itself"
2021-05-07 18:49:54,stocks,"Only situation you might really think about exercising are LEAPs near expiry, where ideally you’re so deep in the money that there’s no extrinsic value left and no one to buy it from you"
2021-05-07 17:06:55,stocks,"Yes, you profit 200 from buying at 30 and selling at 32, plus the $200 from selling the call."
2021-05-07 17:16:28,stocks,"Yes, i do wheels all the time. I don’t understand angry cupboard. There is no spread, this is just selling a covered call. It’s pretty simple.  The profit in your scenario is $400"
2021-05-07 18:10:51,stocks,"Okay, thank you. Robinhood's explanation made it sound like I needed to consider both options for optimal profit. I appreciate your reply, thanks!!!"
2021-05-07 17:19:21,stocks,"Niiice, okay that’s what’s I thought just wanted to confirm, good tip on the option wheel that’s what I’m going to do then, keep selling cc until I break even and/or get exercised and then sell puts and round and round we go"
2021-05-07 17:10:40,stocks,I can't believe the amount of stocks that opened up strong (+5-6%) that bleed all day until closing even. What exactly was the point in that.

If nothing else you can marvel at his wardrobe."
2021-05-07 19:14:35,stocks,"the best youtube content is from professional investors. either old interviews with Buffett/Munger, Howard Marks, Peter Lynch, etc, or newer original content from guys like Patrick Boyle. 

Andrei Jikh is a cut above, he was talking about PEG ratio in one vid (explaing why Tesla was overvalued?). Typical 20-something stock channel barely seems to know about P/E ratios, let alone PEG. 

Ben Felix is good but he's a Dimensional Funds Advisor. And Dimensional Funds is good, but their fanboys can be a little cultish and elitist. He just stands there and spouts tons of academic research, but (a) some of the research has been rebutted or questioned and he either ignores or is unaware of the criticism (such as his ""irrelevance of dividends"" video, there's tons of research showing dividend stocks tend to perform better than non-dividend stocks); and (b) his own portfolio contradicts his videos. He says ""buy a total market index"" but his portfolio has up to 14 funds. Felix says ""Fees matter"" but his portfolio has a .41 fee which is much higher than anything from Fidelity or Vanguard in Canada. 

Graham Stephan, yuk. no thanks. index funds are a good strategy for a core position, but he's otherwise just full of crap IMO. 

and of course read books by professionals. Peter Lynch's books, the ""Little Book of XXX"" series published by Wiley. The Little Book that Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt, the Little Book of Value Investing by Christopher Browne. Ken Fisher's Little Book of Market Myths is free on his website. https://www.kenfisher.com/books/little-book-market-myths"

2021-05-07 18:46:17,stocks,"Jeremy from financial education was good for my first three months of investing but afterwards I realized he really doesn’t provide much information. 

Graham Stephen is great for a general and basic knowledge across a wide spectrum of financial topics.

Andrei jeikh is for crypto, not my cup of tea personally. 

Meet Kevin is by far the most information financial YouTuber I’ve seen and his hustle is nothing but godlike. Extremely transparent person as well. Has a solid knowledge across everything finance related. 

Dave lee investing is great for Tesla and a few other high growth stocks and does a lot of podcasts with ceos and friends from the Tesla community. Extremely knowledgeable and quite reasonable with his analysis, is fairly conservative with some of his high growth predictions which is a breath of fresh air (while still being bullish). 

Solving the money problem is great for mega Tesla bull content. 95% of what he says is solid analysis, but the 5% makes him fairly controversial even in the Tesla bull community. If you’re interested in Tesla though he’s a good source for bullish content. 

Learn to invest is good for a more value based investment advice."

2021-05-07 18:47:23,stocks,I’ll definitely need to give him a look.
2021-05-07 19:36:24,stocks,"Meet kevin feels more like a salesman than an investor the way he talks. He's transparent about his money sometimes, but I don't think you should follow his bets given that he's made most from Tesla luck than skill and he's already making 6 million a year from YouTube and rental properties so even if he loses 3 million in bets he's still set for life. Making YOLO risky bets is only worth when you're having extremely good cash flows like him.

Also, if any YouTuber is a great god level investing pro why do they need to non-stop post on YouTube their strategies or sell you courses, why not use them and open your own hedge fund and make 10x more. Banks and hedge fund investors would kill to get you handle their money and make them millions. You can say strategies don't work at large level. True, but does that mean getting millions of retail folks to invest in risky plays is better ?


Solving the money problem guy is basically an a$$hole. Even if he's right his content is basically insulting others especially bears and makes him unbearable to watch now. Uber bull, cannot stand to hear anything negative about Tesla. I feel he may make decent points but way he says is just too childish. He got lucky on Tesla but he's only invested in Tesla so extremely risky bet despite the tailwinds"

2021-05-07 17:00:53,stocks,"Amazon is one of my largest positions, and I'm glad it doesn't split. I want the price to go up based on fundamentals -- not because of a lot of retail interest. If they split the stock and that gathers more interest, that just means it's trading at a higher valuation -- which in turn could result in higher volatility and could cause some institutional investors to take profits. I'd much rather have the institutions holding the shares than retail investors, if I'm being honest."
2021-05-07 16:43:37,stocks,Equity compensation is a big portion of a lot of Amazon employees pay package is my understanding. I assume it’s because they don’t want to introduce more volatility to their shares than necessary

2021-05-07 19:32:50,stocks,Bozos said in 2007 to a private group of ball streeters and edge funds  that he didn't want poor  people getting rich off his company as he wanted wealth inequality to get to insane levels and the only way he could do this was by not ever splitting AMZN shares.
2021-05-07 17:00:17,stocks,It’s somewhat this... High share price means more serious long term investors (which companies want).  Lower share prices invite more speculation on the stock which invites more volatility.

2021-05-07 18:56:55,stocks,"I think it’s the opposite. AMZN split three times between the IPO and the dot com peak, when it was worth $107 a share. From there it fell all the way to $6 in 2001. If the stock hadn’t split, that early high would have been $1284 and the low would have been $72. But because they did split, they came pretty close to penny stock status for awhile. Bezos likely saw the splits as a mistake. Splitting the stock is the big ego move, from that perspective, because you’re assuming your company is too good to ever lose that much value."

Amazon doesnt really get any benefit from people buying their shares on a day to day basis."
2021-05-07 18:02:59,stocks,That's actually the reason they don't want to split it. Bezos wants to keep away the retail investors who'll buy 100 shares and just write covered calls
2021-05-07 16:44:32,stocks,keeps the poors out of options for sure

How can it be 200+ million if it was 4 million like you claim until March 18th?"
2021-05-07 16:41:54,stocks,"Are you sure you didn't switch between a 10-minute chart and the daily chart, or something?

And you don't ""trade"" an index. The volume of the index is the sum of the volumes of the components of the index.  To ""trade"" the DJIA, you can buy equal shares of each of the 30 companies in the DJIA, or buy shares of an ETF (like DIA) that does it for you, minus expenses."

When you sell a put, you agree to buy 100 shares of the stock at an agreed-upon price *if* the stock drops to or below that price before the options contract expires. In the meantime, the person on the other end of the contract pays you money (called a ""premium"") to have the right to sell 100 shares to you at the agreed price.

Then you can buy the stock at the price you want, and get paid to wait. If it never drops to your target price, you simply pocket the premium, and you can even sell more puts with a later expiry.

I decided to buy when it ran up to $350.00 because I believe in the company long term. Now its trading at $390.00 so if you feel like its undervalued and you plan on holding long term than I wouldnt second guess it.
2021-05-07 14:52:54,stocks,"That is the risk you take when you try to time the market. Sometimes you miss the train. It happened to me with LUV(Sw airlines) which is a company I have only great personal experiences with and really wanted to buy into as a reopening play. I was targeting $50 as an entry point a few months ago and the lowest it got was $52. I didn’t pull the trigger and now it’s in the 60s. I’m still too stubborn to buy at an ATH. But there are other companies that I believe overall will be good long term I will buy no matter the timing. 

Time in the market is better than timing the market as they say. Now I’m more into just striking when something dips or is considered undervalued. Never wait for a better price or for earnings to hit. 

Instead just buy and then if it dips on no “fundamentally changing news” buy more to lower your average."

- I am bullish as fuck on Corsair but let's leave aside the financials and their recent earnings report, even though it was impressive on itself. As an avid gamer myself i can say that All pc gaming related subs are worshipping them. PCMR, one of the biggest subs in general, is filled with Corsair products. The edgy 15 year olds that frequent these subs and can't build PCs on their own or have very restrictive budget, will build computers and buy peripherals in a few years. They will also recommend parts and peripherals to less tech savvy friends and relatives. Corsair is set to thrive, they have built a cult following with the upcoming generation of gamers, something that no financial analysis can say to you unless you spend yourself many hours in gaming subs.

Also, they have shown over the years the will to expand. Remember that they started as just a memory company and they now put their name on many products. They will probably not stop here"

Not sure about Logitech margins within their gaming division - but given that gaming is 25% of their revenues and as mentioned Logitech has almost double margins as CRSR, stands to reason that they also have much better margins within the gaming segment.

It’s also a bit ironic to be claiming a positive Covid effect for Logitech when Corsair clearly benefitted from the same."
2021-05-07 16:15:47,stocks,"Isn't the 117% revenue increase for Logitech overall? This is what i thought, feel free to correct me though

> It’s also a bit ironic to be claiming a positive Covid effect for Logitech when Corsair clearly benefitted from the same.

Yes but not exactly an apples to apples comparison. In Logitech's case the pandemic caused a necessity from every office worker to have decent peripherals in their home. It created an option for people that stayed at home to spend money into the gaming industry but it was a choice not a necessity. Not everyone did it though, many other industries made huge money from this like home workout equipment.

And to add, i am a gamer myself and i know a lot of gamers. I don't think many people picked up gaming because of the pandemic, or at least got into gaming that much to the point of buying fancy keyboards and power supplies. most people that spent their time and money into gaming while at home were already gamers and had already equipment"
2021-05-07 16:32:17,stocks,"117% is both for Logitech as a whole, and for their gaming segment. [LOGI qtr slide deck](https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Logitech-F4Q21-Presentation.pdf)

COVID was a big boost to many industries and gaming was definitely one of them. 

CRSR is a prime example of this. Revenues grew 55% in 2020 following years of much lower growth. Based on guidance, this year they expect revenue growth between 12-24%. The logical conclusion is that they expect growth to revert a bit following reopenings"
2021-05-07 16:47:19,stocks,"117% for gaming yeah you are right. That webcam and tablet growth though!

 But on the top of my head, i can't think of many products that logi and Corsair have that compete against each other so their comparison may be not worth that much in the first place.

If it moved down, the option contract will become less valuable.

Similar story with BP. Very well run companies with a very high dividend yield (the skepticism being warranted in BP's case given they slashed it previously) for companies of their size.

I’m thinking in terms for tax purposes, where my understanding is if you have a stock for over a year the tax implications are different.

I like averaging down, it's a great trading strategy it also will make you not second guess yourself as much. Another way to help is write down all the reasons you are bullish. If you do this then anytime the stock dips just look at it and remember why you love this play! Hope this helps and best of luck to you in the future!"
2021-05-07 13:40:40,stocks,"Spend days researching before you make an investment, and make sure you're investing for the long term, 5, 10 or 20+ years and don't worry about it.

After the insane bull market last year everyone is expecting 50%+ gains in a year when that's simply not realistic. The average is 7-11% over the long term (10+ years), so stop expecting immediate gains."
2021-05-07 14:11:13,stocks,If you know it is good value at the price you bought then all you have to realize is that you're almost never going to time the bottom perfectly.

Every analyst has upgraded its price target, called it undervalued by 20%, it beat its earnings and I just don’t understand why it’s still trading sideways. 

Is this just a slow recovery that’s taking more and more months?"

Trading platform is Robinhood.  I am looking at a particular ETF. There is an in the money strike with a break even at less than the current trading price.  Am I wrong in understanding that by buying this and immediately exercising, I would be making money?  I can't see how that would be possible but I'm new to options. Thank you in advance."
2021-05-07 11:40:57,stocks,You pay premium for option. And option decay/lose premium value over time. You can easily loose money with options. I lost 20k past 2 months playing with them. The decay is killer if you don't exercise right away.
2021-05-07 14:49:15,stocks,Probably a wide ask/bid spread.
2021-05-07 11:33:03,stocks,"Sometimes it really be that way... Particularly on a quickly growing stock on option closing day (fridays). option price can sometimes be a little slow to catch up. options are reactionary to price, volume and time so they will always lag stock price by just a little"
2021-05-07 11:48:02,stocks,"Interesting!! If you found in the money options where the strike minus the option price is negative - well.. you have free optionality! 

I'm trying to think of how that might occur - maybe the volatility was super low? Share what you are looking at!"
2021-05-07 11:46:37,stocks,"Right. I have a few but just hadn't seen where you could buy profit right off the bat.  My misunderstanding was that the option was exercisable immediately, but that is not the case, someone selling the call just agree to the bid to actually have an exercisable option.  Nobody who knows what they are doing would sell a call that is already at a loss as soon as it is exercisable, at least I wouldn't think so.  Thank you for your input, learned a couple new things with this post"
2021-05-07 11:42:26,stocks,"I understand a little better now that I placed my order - someone else has to pick up that bid that I made for the order to actually be exercisable.  So nobody in their right mind would agree to the bid I placed because they will be at a loss from the moment they take my bid.  Still used to stocks where when you place the order, it is executed. In this scenario it must be accepted by someone selling a call for that amount.  Thanks for the info, I am getting a better grasp now."
2021-05-07 11:55:42,stocks,"Was looking at SCHK.  My other comments say this too but since I'm new to options, I didn't think about someone having to sell you a call at your bid price.  I am used to buying shares where it is just immediately executed at that price. To do so would be stupid as you would have an immediate loss.  Current price as I write is 41.88 with a 6.55 Premium for a 35 strike, breakeven is 41.55.  on the surface looks like immediate profit but you have to get someone to literally sell to you at a loss out of the gate.  I think I understand better now.

Edit: it's not just the 35 strike that has negative breakeven in this case, that was just the one I was looking at. Other strike prices at negative breakeven too.

u/thelastsubject123 this is the example I was seeing today, and why iam asking how it is possible.  As you can see ithink I understand now but if you can expand I'd be grateful."
2021-05-07 12:12:14,stocks,"give an example and do the math. there is no option that exists that ""gives you a profit"" by buying and exercising immediately. if you can't figure it out, i'd be more than happy to explain it."
2021-05-07 12:02:09,stocks,Options might not be at lost. The stock at $25 price. They can sell ITM $24 and still profit because you pay premium. Lots of hedge fund do this. They don't just hold the stock. Hedge fund A can also lend the share to Hedge fund B to sell as contracts. Hedge fund A charge interest to B and B sells contract with premium to profit off decay.
2021-05-07 13:13:45,stocks,There's no open interest for any of those options - if you try to buy them I suspect the price will go up

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Beyond Meat (BYND) a buy after the recent dip? **Company Description:**

Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in the United States and offers consumers a range of various plant-based meats. This company’s mission is to build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products. Beyond Meat’s products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat, although the nutritional aspects of plant-based meats have been questioned. While plant-based meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat, by shifting to plant-based meats people can positively affect growing global issues. The issues which this company is trying to address include human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare. Their products consist of the Beyond Burger, meatballs, sausage, beef, and more. Besides certain Beyond Crumbles, all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal. As of December 2021, you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122,000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries. In addition, Beyond Meat has an e-commerce site which offers consumers bulk packs, mixed product bundles, and trial packs. This company is constantly innovating and their R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies (Nestle, Kroger, etc.) at 7.8%. Their state-of-the-art innovation center is a 30,000 sq. foot building located in El Segundo California. This company’s mission is simple to understand, through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planet.

**Total Addressable Market** (TAM)

In 2020 the plant-based meat market was estimated to be valued at $4.3 billion and is projected to reach $8.3 billion by 2025. All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan, vegetarian, and health conscious trends people are adopting. Also, many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products. All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy, but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems. While the plant-based market may not be the largest, Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry. The global meat industry is valued at $1.2 trillion and had a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2019. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price. Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage sells for $10.30 a pound, that is about 70% more than regular pork sausage. One pound of factory-farmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around $3/pound, while one pound of Beyond Meat’s Beef Burger will run you around $6.25/pound. While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot, that doesn’t mean that people don’t buy Beyond Meat products. Going forward we’ll have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat market.

**Recent Developments/Acquisitions**

**The new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide (April 27, 2021) –** Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35% less fat and saturated fat, and fewer calories than 80/20 beef. This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd. It will be available in a 2-pack, the brand’s first ever value 4-pack, and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack. Dariush Ajami, the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat, said ” We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plant-based beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience. The new Beyond Burger’s rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef, and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring on-par with 80/20 ground beef burgers.” According to the University of Michigan’s 2018 Life Cycle Assessment, when compared to traditional 80/20 beef burgers, the Beyond Burger has 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, requires 46% less energy, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Beyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe (April 12, 2021) –** Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations. The plant-based foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49% over the last two years. In the U.K, Sainsbury’s said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide. Also, Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage. The retailers together increased Beyond Meat’s presence in 445 stores. In Germany, Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1,000 German retail stores through Kaufland, Tegut, Famila, and Real. In Austria, the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1,500 retail stores. Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores. Nearly 1,000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince. Chuck Muth, the Chief Growth Officer at the company, said “These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europe’s appetite for plant-based meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise.” Moreso, in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first co-manufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen World’s Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude Netherland.

**Beyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation (April 7, 2021) –** Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai. Ethan Brown, CEO, said “The opening of our dedicated plant-based meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meat’s ability to effectively compete in one of the world’s largest meat markets. We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth, and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.” Just a little over a year ago, Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks. In addition to Starbucks, Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Jindingxuan, GangLi Beijing, Slow Boat Brewery, Hema, METRO China and more. Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that they’ve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market, Beyond Pork.

**What could go wrong**

**Foodservice doesn’t pick up –** Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries. In the past we’ve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically, only to fall back to where it was before a few days after. Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, KFC, and a number of other restaurants. Looking at the foodservice side of their business, they’ve seen tremendous YoY growth. While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales, many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back. While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward, I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out. Impossible foods is their main competitor and they’ve partnered with the likes of Burger King, White Castle, Red Robin, and others. These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue. The questions that remain to be asked are, in the long-run, how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat? Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plant-based protein products and how many others will follow? Furthermore, Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales. There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then? Nonetheless, I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years."
2021-05-07 11:55:21,stocks,Still further down to go. I’m not in a hurry to make an entry yet.
2021-05-07 13:53:43,stocks,"Would be interested in your thoughts about valuation. Right now, BYND is trading at a significant multiple of revenue - about 17-18x annual sales if I'm doing my math right - which is unheard of for a food company. And while it is growing, that growth is likely to be into lower profit channels like fast food/quick serve restaurants. Are we sure BYND's stock price isn't more of a mood afflilation thing? Full disclosure I love their products, have not invested."
2021-05-07 17:43:16,stocks,"I found the impossible burger tasted better, with that and the many vegetarian options out there along with the plant based meat hype slowing, imo I see further lows with this stock."
2021-05-07 11:18:06,stocks,I really loved your research and breakdown this is so great! I've been keeping my eye on Beyond Meat for awhile and I can't really see the last point happening. Alternative meats are the future and Beyond Meat is making sound business decisions so I see it as a good long-term investment! The dip right now could be good buy in point let's wait and see haha!
2021-05-07 15:56:26,stocks,"I’ve been buying and selling BYND for about a year now. Haven’t made huge gains, but I’ve come away with around $200 so far. Each time with 5 share buy in’s. 

$110 per share right now, I’d totally jump in if I didn’t need the cash for home buying."
2021-05-07 19:39:16,stocks,"I don't think fast food companies will be in a hurry to make their own recipe when they find out how hard it is to create something that works for them. 

If beyond or impossible already have a product out that works well with their menu, I see them just making a deal. No need to spend years and a crapton of money to develop something just as good as something that already exists.

The only time I would see it as viable is if the current, or future products dont meet their standards or fit their requirements. - I.E. taco bell, tofu for chipotle, etc..

Its not easy to come up with a winning formula, as evidenced by all the iterations and money thrown at new versions every year.

-Unless beyond and impossible are charging a lot in order for these restaurants to use their meat?

 In that case, I can see fast food giving up the ""lets make our own version"" as soon as one of them lower the fees to sell in the restaurants. - which would make a great loss leader for Beyond/Imp for a few years,  while they lock down all the licenses for the big FF brands and pull ahead in market share.

Even McD had to work with Beyond in order to create something, and considering how fast they drop things from the menu, it sounds like it would have been better to just sell Beyond instead of make their own. I wonder if this is some way to screw franchise operators so they have to buy the proprietary version instead?"
2021-05-07 12:47:23,stocks,"I got into BYND at ~$140 and was also considering buying this dip. For what it's worth, the catering at my workplace had beyond burgers for lunch and they were gone faster than the regular burgers. The caterer told me that many meat-eaters and vegetarians/vegans alike have been asking for the beyond burgers more and more. I think their products have a good amount of demand and popularity, so I feel comfortable in taking this opportunity to invest more in this company."
2021-05-07 12:37:36,stocks,"Beyond Meat is disgusting. I bought some to try cooking about a year ago, and lost all interest in investing in the company after that. There are much better vegetarian options.

This is just my opinion, not a financial advisor, etc. The company may be a good investment, but I don't like the product, so I'm out."
2021-05-07 14:32:21,stocks,Tastes like chit
2021-05-07 11:25:02,stocks,"Ive always been sceptical about Beyond Meat.   The problem is that you can only make things that you would make out of ground meat.   So sausaces, hotdogs, burgers, chicken nuggets/fingers.   

And tho supplying the fast food industry is a huge market, you still can't make a chicken breast or a pork chop or a t-bone with beyond meat type of products. 

It is probably a good investment in the short term but long term i'm not confident."
2021-05-07 14:45:45,stocks,"Yes. Chuck (sales) doesn’t play around. Sales are artificially low. When these dumb gov cunts say everything can open then we’re back strong.  I believe in the team. This is the tesla of fake meat. The others are trash. Competition can cut price to boost sales very temp and as people try it and realize it’s trash they come back again and again to BYND.

Ethan and Seth and Chuck are going to succeed and are great leaders. There’s a lot of people who simply do not know this bizness or what the fuck they are talking about."
2021-05-07 18:30:38,stocks,I revise my comments. Let’s keep everything closed bc we’re all gonna die for a few more years. It’ll be great for every stock and every kid and family and bizness. I’m so excited for a second Great Depression!
2021-05-07 19:11:10,stocks,"Saw somebody say this exact thing when it dipped to $120 in January. And they were right, it did have further down to go. But it went to $190 in between."
2021-05-07 17:54:11,stocks,Yea good point a normal food service company like USFD has a 8-10 bill market cap.  I wonder if the thesis is that bynd meat is supposed to have better profit margin.
2021-05-07 19:19:14,stocks,I agree impossible does taste better. The drawback to impossible tho is that it is soy based. It is also found to have some chemical in it that can also be found in round up which I personally am not a chemophobe but you can bet your ass most vegans probably care about it.
2021-05-07 11:40:56,stocks,"I appreciate your kind words. I've certainly been skeptical about how well the foodservice channel is doing and I wish they posted something along the lines of comparable product sales for the restaurants that hold their products (if that makes sense). Although, to track the individual products at the restaurants that do offer Beyond Meat products would entail analyzing a ton of data."

Compare it to a juicy 95-99% mest burger and you'll cry at the difference in flavour, texture. I eat vegan at times by choice but it's impossible to misstake if for the real deal, it's like saying you'll not feel the difference between jeans and yoga pants."

The big chains are testing beyond meat and once they see there is enough demand they will cut out companies like Beyond to make better profits.   I think.

Does mcdonalds or burger king buy pre-made french fries? no , they get potatoes and make the fries and send it to locations.    Quality control and margin control.

I already have a couple of individual automaker stocks that I like in this sector. But I want to look into ETFs that focus on EV in general. Someone suggested DRIV. Is that the main one? Are there others I should look into? Thanks!
2021-05-07 10:58:21,stocks,"Just invest in an automotive ETF in general.

The major auto companies will have their own EV offerings that are just as good.

CARZ (general auto index) actually has more exposure to TSLA than EKAR and KARS (EV tech-focused), which is a little funny.

The EV-centric ETFs are more focused on the ancillary tech--software and semiconductors--than the vehicles themselves."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"$PTON - Peloton over reaction Just wanted to get some thoughts on the recent sell off that PTON went through. To give some context, they had to do a product recall on their treadmills due to some injuries. Their treadmills represent about 2-3% of their total sales and the stock dipped about 15%. Quite honestly this seems like a massive overreaction. Don’t see a massive risk here as their bikes are the major driver of their business. Even pricing in a few lawsuits and costs related to the recall, I don’t think a 15% dip was justified. 

Basic math/logic above coupled with the fact that everyone I know who has a peloton bike is absolutely obsessed with it lead me to scoop up some shares around $83 this week. 

It’s not often you can pick up a hyper growth stock at a discount in this environment so I jumped at the opportunity.

Thoughts?"
2021-05-07 10:40:17,stocks,"That 2-3% number has been thrown around a lot. But I’ve also heard that it’s actually about 12%. I’ve been trying to find a real number but haven’t been able to. Still, it’s not a sizable part of their business.

Seeing their incredibly low churn rate on subscriptions and high engagement in their content  (26 workouts / month?!) is encouraging. Yeah, the fitness market is tough, but their secret sauce is and will be content, talent and ecosystem. The subscription model is cheap compared to a gum membership for their target market and they have plans for more hardware to attract more customers.

Biggest threat is probably Apple - they launched their own fitness content and already have strong shares in hardware and adoption. But that’s not going to take off for the next few years, likely, so I’m bullish on PTON for now. I bought at $83 and feel like a rise back to $120 is likely in the next 6 months."
2021-05-07 10:29:22,stocks,Didnt someone die though ?
2021-05-07 10:21:06,stocks,Peloton is bullshit imho
2021-05-07 12:20:00,stocks,"It's a complete overreaction and a great buying opportunity.  And PTON bears just don't get this company.  Here are my two cents:

1. The financial impact of the treadmill recall is almost nil.  They hardly had to adjust their revenue projections at all to account for the impact.
2. The earnings they just released showed that growth and retention are still incredibly strong and weren't just a COVID phenomenon.
3. The company isn't just equipment with a tablet attached.  The expensive bikes and treadmills are just the first step in the process of getting customers into the ecosystem, much the same way that Apple uses its hardware.  In Q3 paid digital subscriptions grew 404%.
4. People keep saying that gym reopenings will kill PTON's growth but that simply isn't true.  PTON appeals to people who want the social aspect of workout classes from the convenience of their own home.  Plus, part of their strategy is to partner with hotels and gyms so people can go to a gym, connect to their PTON account on the gym equipment, and still do their favorite class.  Besides, this company was growing very strongly before COVID.  Q1 2020 saw 116% growth in digital subs and 103% revenue growth.
5. Any company can create a connected bike or treadmill but what other companies can't duplicate is the brand value and community aspect that PTON dominates.  Think of Lululemon as an analogy.  There's nothing special about yoga pants and many other companies tried and failed to duplicate their success.  They failed because people want Lululemon yoga pants.  Apple is another good analogy.  They dominated the smart phone market for years because there was a cool factor associated with being an iPhone owner.  PTON has that cool factor; other companies don't."
2021-05-07 13:45:09,stocks,"Peloton is the iPhone or Tesla of the fitness industry. It has the name factor and everyone wants to own a peloton. People love it. I don’t see that changing.

I’m not worried about the treadmill issue, bad press for now that drove down the stock price to a better price.  

I could see peloton growing their brand to be much more than what they are today. I could also see them getting bought out by a larger company or merging with a company like lulu.  There’s so many different ways this company can go because of the name brand that they’ve built and will be a player going forward."
2021-05-07 10:35:00,stocks,"What is the long term potential for Peloton?

From where I sit, what I see is a fad that if it catches on in a real way to justify their valuation, they will get stiff competition from Apple and Google. Two companies that don’t NEED to charge their customers an arm and a leg for machines or content, especially if they want to just capture market share.

This is what happens to most companies that try to play in these spaces.

I just don’t see how they become more than a niche company for the rich and people that like to pretend they are rich."
2021-05-07 16:49:54,stocks,"I go to my wife for advice on this. Peloton is an envied piece of equipment. It’s like all the home gym crap people buy but rarely use, except peloton people seem to be using these quite a bit. The reputation is actually really good despite tread-gate and the subscriptions are overpriced, which means margins are usually pretty good. Don’t have the exact numbers though.

I think the high volume selling is an over reaction. Whether it’s a value added product is a totally different discussion from whether or not it will make money. The target audience doesn’t know they can get a nice road bike (because they never ride outside) and put it on a stand. 

So....oversold. I’d buy. (Not a financial advisor, just a dude who bought a few shares after the fall)."

I have 3 friends with the thread+ and neither of them want to return in because they love the product and don’t want to wait a few months to get a new one. One of them thinks they can actually sell theirs for over msrp because there have been people waiting months for their orders lol
2021-05-07 13:22:47,stocks,"Lol at everyone bashing Peloton. Will surely be a play in 3 years that these fools wish they jumped on while they had the opportunity. No doubt its currently over-valued by a wide margin, but they are so far ahead of the pack in at home fitness experiences that its truly a no-brainer. Buy the industry leaders folks."
2021-05-07 14:58:47,stocks,"For some reason people on r/stocks (and reddit in general) hate the peloton product but everyone I know who has one loves the product (both bike and treadmill) and community (subscription service). I've used it myself (my cousin bought a treadmill) and it's a fantastic product. 

Is the price high to buy one? yes

Is it worth it? It's like any fitness product - if you use it regularly of course it is. If it ends up int he closet it is not

The sell off made sense as the cost of the recall would have been quite high but the Foley confirmed the details hence the buying again."
2021-05-07 11:03:21,stocks,"PTON needs a long term strategy to remain viable.  Hype and emotionalism are not business strategy.  Their commercials are so cringe and fake.  Plus, people have been locked up for a year. How many people are going to be indoors riding a stationary bike this summer with some dipshit instructor feeding them faux emotionalism.  Also, human nature with exercise equipment: it is purchased emotionally and then goes unused.  It is a highly cyclical, highly seasonal, high risk business.  The stock was overvalued because people were in lockdown, it is gonna crash back to earth.  I have been in the fitness industry for 10 years, human psychology never changes. Great business around New Years and winter, mass drop off after.  Rinse repeat, and there are always new exercise fads.  Finally, they are in a saturated industry and have massive competition not only from Mirror and other equipment + streaming companies but also from thousands of fitness apps, outdoor sports, and the thousands of channels of fitness content on roku, Vimeo, utube etc for in home exercise."
2021-05-07 13:16:44,stocks,"PTON is a fad and will die out in a year old less. I think you’ll be hearing nightmare stories of trying to cancel subscriptions with them very soon as they try to hold on to their subscribers. I also think there are going to be tons of bricked peletons in everyone’s home as people start going outside more and realize they don’t want to be a subscription fee for a product they no longer use. 

Also, there are going to many other competitors in the market, some of which have already come out. This industry has no economic moat. 

All in all, it obviously enjoyed huge positive sentiment from the pandemic and lockdowns. That won’t be the case going forward.

I got in during the dip yesterday, got out at a gain today but I think the stock will go a bit lower so I'll wait till then before I buy back. 

Alot of people saying PTON is in trouble as gyms are reopening - but tbh actually I would be worried if I was a gym owner as COVID definitely accelerated disruption in the fitness space - everyone I know that has a peloton won't go back to the gym because of how great the product is. 

Also, once the PR blows over with their treadmill - that's a huge catalyst for growth. 

Is it expensive? certainly but I really like the lululemon analogy you've used. Also being first in the space should also serve them. I dont see apple google or anyone else getting into the treadmill or bike space...even from a fitness perspective apple google and whomever else leave a lot to be desired. 

I think it's a buy but I dont think the company has bottomed out yet. I have no idea what that number will be but I think we'll have a better idea next week."
2021-05-07 13:56:00,stocks,"100% this. 

All the other brands operate in a fragmented space. Peloton by far has the most mindshare in the health equipment space. While this means jack to most people here, the implication is that the moment PTON releases a new product or service, everyone will know about in less than a week. 

You can't say the same about:

* Precor
* Nautilus
* Woodway
* Technogym
* Stryker
* Life Fitness

&#x200B;

For anyone thinking that Google or Apple will get into this market, apple will tread lightly. Google will buyout someone and the shut it down and release a far worse product. The biggest competition is apathy. If PTON only sticks to workout equipment, then yeah - it'll be a problem."
2021-05-07 11:11:07,stocks,"They have significant opportunity for geographic expansion: Australia is an new market they’re entering soon, and they’re only right now in UK, DE, CA and US. Their acquisition of Precor solves one of their biggest issues: manufacturing and logistics. 

They also have a huge opportunity to continue to increase market share from the fitness studio and gym market - Barry’s, OrangeTheory and SoulCycle - at a much lower price point. It’s a 40B industry that’s been totally disrupted by COVID - there are so many people who don’t need / want to return to a physical gym ever again.

Lots of people keep saying this is a fad - I don’t really get it. Fitness is not a fad. Home fitness is not a fad. It’s a booming industry, and has been absolute ripe for innovation and they’ve been killing it."

Even if you don’t have the space a foldable treadmill and some weights is a lot more viable than a 3k dollar bike. If you are really wanting that internet connection thing, buy a tablet and put it infront of a bike, or just keep a cheaper stationary bike in your living room and use the TV. There are a lot of solutions already existing to the problem peloton is trying to solve and they will do it cheaper."
2021-05-07 11:46:37,stocks,"I can’t think of a fitness exclusive product from a company that hasn’t been a fad. The one that had the best chance, Fitbit, got destroyed by Apple and then bought up by Google for a third of what they IPO’d at.

Maybe Peloton is different, but I highly doubt it."

2021-05-07 14:25:51,stocks,"But cheaper isn’t nearly engaging. Again, it’s a content platform that *seamlessly* integrates hardware into the experience. Sure, you can definitely put together your own setup, but that’s not plug and play. There’s more hardware to come, too, and once you have the hardware the recurring subscription revenue is automatic.

I admit, I love Peloton, and I was a person who didn’t like cycling before I got it and hated the vibe around it. Everyone who I know who has gotten a Peloton loves it, and the data shows that’s the case at scale. Not to mention, they have a lot more than just cycling - yoga, strength, HIIT, Pilates, etc. You need to belong to three different gyms to get all that. 

That said they’re going to get competition. But Mirror, SoulCycle and other alternatives are not it right now. Apple has the best shot - such a huge number of users in that price point already in an ecosystem that they use allllll the time."

You develop relationships with them like you do twitch streamers, you tubers or radio talk show hosts. 

PLUS you get access to yoga, meditation, leg, core, arms, total body workouts, etc classes. Anywhere from 5-60 min long. It’s so damn customizable. The company has potential for massive growth in markets all around the world IMO. Also their apparel is always sold out on their site. It’s crazy."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Tesla Saw New Registrations Drop 25% In Germany In April, While Volkswagen Saw 108% Rise This popped up on my TD Ameritrade app this morning:

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”  

I am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months. 

And no, this isn’t intended to be a detailed DD, so don’t come at me for that. :). Just sharing what I read this morning.

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.

2019: 75k

Edit:. regarding VW's 230k sales in 2020. That is quite funny because it includes PHEV and Hybrids. When it comes to BEV, VW's top seller is the ID3 at less than 60k so their whole BEV sales is probably less than 100k. So no, VW is not catching up any time soon.

This is deep historic fact. When the cars get there they’re sold. They come in giant ships. It’s obviously not granular to the monthly level."

Tesla for example tends to ship a lot more vehicles to countries where incentives to buy an EV are expiring soon, which hurts the sales in other EU countries where Tesla would otherwise have shipped some vehicles.

Also keep in mind, ALL of the cars Tesla sells in European countries have to be shipped from the US or China. And because of different regulations in those countries Tesla can't just build the exact same car in the US/China and ship it to Europe unchanged. Tesla also can't have their US or China factory make cars just for Europe full time, otherwise they wouldn't be making anything for the US or China markets.

2021-05-07 11:59:44,stocks,"Doesn’t seem to me that waiting lists for Tesla cars in Europe are beyond those of other premium brands.

A new Model 3 gives me a couple months estimated time for delivery. A 3 series BMW a few years ago was also two or three months. From what I see, those are standard waiting times for a new 50k+ car from many brands. Might be wrong.

Regardless, Tesla will lose market share, if nothing else because its cars aren’t better than the competition anymore, they only sell one model in two variants (3 and Y are basically the same car, like Taycan sedan and Cross Turismo) which isn’t enough to satisfy the varied needs and tastes of the market, and they seem slow at increasing their offerings."

The last 3 cars I've bought have been the result of a car accident where I needed another car sooner than later.  After my last one, I wanted a Tesla and the wait time for an order was 3 months.  Luckily they offered to discount a nearby test drive model and I had it within a few days - but I feel like that is not sustainable for the general public and it eliminates them from a BIG demographic - people needing cars as a result of an accident."

And that’s up from only 73k or so in 2019. So the tripled their EV sales in the pandemic. Plus obviously their other non-EV cars, of course. Porsche is their most profitable car now. And their market cap is tiny compared to Tesla. 

I am not saying that Tesla isn’t a great company. I am saying that as other companies get into EV, their insane stock valuation wouldn’t make much sense. At least to me."

That’s my point. If Tesla wasn’t where it is now price wise - sure. The company can be great. The stock isn’t so much. Just my opinion though.

Similar to why people would buy a ford instead of a bmw/audi non EV - not everyone can afford a premium car.

Among the incumbents I think Hyundai is most likely to succeed followed by Ford and VW. Unfortunately HYMTF is too lightly traded, F has too many unknowns right now, and VWAGY is exposed to political risks I don't understand well."

But now that other car manufacturers pretty much have the same tech in their cars as a tesla, except the fart pillows, the only thing that separates them is how sturdy and well made they are. And it's common knowledge that tesla uses pretty cheap plastic and their interior is pretty low standard compared to brands they try to compete with (mercedes, audi, bmw). 

My point is that they don't really have a competitive advantage anymore and it will probably be less and less competitive as more manufacturers catches up to it's ev range, tech and price."

Let’s say for example Stock X is $10. It has a good run up to  $70 over a course of 2 months and because of its high run up and RSI, you know that there will be a pull back. Let’s say now you invested 100k. This 100k has essentially 7x to 700k, but since you did not sell it at $70, it then pulled all the way back to $30 so you now have 300k. You've essentially lost out of 400k profit before tax is considered.

Why do people say it’s stupid to sell it just to rebuy it back? If you knew there would be a pull back due to the RSI, sell at $70, then rebuy the dip when it’s back at $30? Sure you pay short term capital gains but you’ve now doubled your position at the same price, assuming you reinstate all that money back into that stock. You can now increase your position, but just pay a higher average cost of $30 rather than at $10. What am I not understanding for those that hold when you know the RSI will indicate a strong dip?

An example of this would be Fubo TV, DDD, or STEM."

2021-05-07 10:01:10,stocks,"It's very smart if you can do it. The challenge is picking the highs and lows. If the stock runs and it dips, so you sell... you may miss a rebound that takes it higher. If you sold AAPL, TSLA or AMZN in the early days when it was on a downtrend, you'd miss a great ride and a lot of profit later.

One technical indicator I learned about too late is moving averages crossing. If the 5 day moving average crosses the 30 day moving average going up, it's a buy signal. If the 5 day crosses the 30 day going down, it's a sell signal. It gives you false buy and sell signals periodically, and you'll never catch the high or low, but it does catch the main trend.

I'm an old investor... and I learned about this signal after I lost 2 years pay in the 1987 stock market crash. If I had known it and followed it, I would have avoided losing a lot of money along the way.

Full disclosure: The Nasdaq just gave a false sell signal a couple days ago, when the experts said the jobs number would kill tech stocks, so you would have been on the wrong side of the trade."

There is a huge difference between something being oversold just for the sake of it or an announcement/event of the company or ANYTHING else that remotely has to do with the sector or financial instruments. A panic sell off most certainly will recover soon after if it was actually a panic sell off.

See the amounts of ""if"" here? Yea, that's the problem. Abandoning a clearly sinking ship because it's a meme or had a bad outcome is a good strategy.

my personal perspective: 

whenever my returns  exceed about 50% (if ever), I sell. I might not sell all, but I will sell enough to have covered my initial investment thus, the rest is risk free and makes no difference. no risk, just possible upside. 

I usually reinvest returns into something else, usually a long term investment , like an etf. less risk, less return. but thats the name of the game.

Is it seriously that ppl don't want to work and are taking advantage of the system? Or is it that wages aren't replicating the work force shortage?

Also, ET has been a very, very controversial stock. Not so much on reddit but check out how many negative articles have been written about ET on Seeking Alpha.  And ET's price has been very depressed due to a combination of poor strategy (Kelcy Warren is incapable of not buying companies), over leverage, Covid, DAPL pipeline woes,, fossil fuels being in disfavor, etc.  Now all of these factors are starting to move back in ET's favor.  The ENBL acquisition was great!  ENBL had a hell of a quarter (2× estimates).  Market conditions are improving.  DAPL is priced in.  And most importantly, management has finally figured out that the single most important metric right now is reducing leverage.  They have gone from ignoring their over leverage to bragging about reducing their leverage.  They will soon go from credit watch negative to stable..  As these positive factors get priced in you could see a big move up in ET.  Look at MPLX as a guide for what ET will do when the leverage is reduced and they  can repurchase units. I personally think we will see high teens in the next 2 years."

Are gains taxes only due when the OVERALL sale of a stock passes the initial investment value? I know that is the case in general, just looking for specifics. For example, if I own 10 shares of ABC for $10/share ($100 total investment), will I only owe taxes once my sell value as a whole increases past $100? If I sell 5 shares at $15/share, I won't owe taxes on that since my realized gains aren't over $100 right? Even tho the stock price itself is higher than what I bought in at? 

Thanks in advance 👍"

2021-05-07 09:24:10,stocks,"All gains and losses are per share. If you bought 10 shares at $10, and then sold 5 shares at $15, you owe 5*(15-10) or $25 in gain.

if you only sell a few shares you only pay on the gains for those few shares.

Now he wants a work schedule he has full control over so he is no longer in retail. Retail i see being hit hardest, retail is some very degrading work for it's pay. Expectations very in many places from having management skills to sales to convincing people to give their personal info to you for a rewards account with quotas all for $11 an hour in many places. No one liked that before the pandemic, seeing that nothing changed during the pandemic probably pushed many to the brink. I see a shortage in retail and manufacturing growing exponentially before my eyes, I'm not sure what this means down the line but it's actually quite bad. At least in New Jersey which is a very densely populated state.

Just wanted to add that my girlfriend was working 3 jobs while in nursing school and the pandemic hit and now she's working 2 and about to quit both because of unreasonable expectations of time dedication because of lack of employees.

I believe many people started their own businesses and gig employment and realize they dont want to work for other people and maybe have learned their own skills. These people are now receiving benefits. People dont want to work for little pay if they can learn to sustain themselves with their own work. Some people have also used this money for school, to be able to not have to take those low paying jobs.

Now, many people are also using this money for the stock market, which I think is both good and bad. It is good, and also likely to continue for people who took the time to learn about investing and understand that the majority of the gains made were unprecedented, and due to covid, and arent likely to continue.

What's not mentioned at all is how many applicants there are on average for these job openings. My girlfriend's boss has been looking to hire more people, has literally gotten 100+ applicants, but he's super choosey and only interviewed about 3 people who were in the immediate area, all of whom he didn't feel were qualified, and complains that nobody wants to work. Keep in mind this is for a retail job. It's easy to say nobody wants to work when you're literally ignoring most of your applicants. And if you're not getting enough applicants, maybe do something to incentivize more people to apply. If businesses slashing prices to get more customers in makes sense, then that same logic should apply for businesses increasing wages to get more workers in. There was a recent story about a Pittsburgh ice cream shop struggling to find workers, so they doubled their starting wage from $7.50/hour to $15/hour. Guess what? After they announced that they started getting more applicants than they knew what to do with. Funny how that works."

Absolutely this. It's the reason I haven't worked in over a fucking year. When all this free money was on the table, I was someone saying ""no way, it's going to incentivize people to not work"" and that was met with the usual ""but think of the children!"" arguments from the left, who thinks money is just free paper printed by daddy govt. and we just print more of it, and that we magically just say ""no more evictions"" and that also won't have a negative impact on the economy.  


They won, and it's free money for everyone, so I took their queue, and i'm riding this shit all the way to fucking sept.. I work in live entertainment, so you best believe I can ride it all the way through. I've been getting full benefits all the way since they started in early March 2020.  
I am not the only one. There is an incentive to not work. it's the same with food stamps and SSI, when you make it an easy peasy hand out with no work behind it, you best believe people will be lining up with their hands out. You make it a bit of work to get it, and suddenly just literally doing a regular job makes more sense.

I was starting to puzzle this out last week when earnings were amazing, but the market had a tepid reaction. If earnings were amazing, why weren't the big kids buying? Their big concern was rate hikes. If rates go up, stocks go down. We will only see rate hikes when we get some traction on the employment numbers.   


Big question: When will we get traction on job numbers? One of the big problems is that the generous unemployment benefits and stimulus checks are enticing people to stay out of the market trading stonks. A lot of the stimulus starts to wind down over the Summer and through September. It's possible that the unemployment benefits will artificially peg down the job market through the Summer, and inflation will rise because employers will have to pay above unemployment compensation to entice workers to get off the couch and go to work."

2021-05-07 10:43:44,stocks,"I don't think unemployment benefits and stimulus checks are as big of a problem as people make them out to be. Not everyone is qualified for unemployment benefits, only those who explicitly lost their job directly due to covid, employer's have to confirm that that is the reason why they had to let you go, and you worked for a certain amount of time within a certain time period. Not anyone who was fired for any reason, or someone who never had a job to begin with can get unemployment benefits. Plus there were only three stimulus checks ever issued over the course of a year, totally only $3200, and not everyone was eligible/have yet to actually get their checks. And while yes wages are slowly increasing (not rocketing) your actual purchasing power with said wage isn't actually any better because the cost of living has actually been rocketing."

Don’t get me wrong I’m all for the min wage to be increased by supply and demand. Which I think were already seeing, with massive retailers like Amazon offering $15/hour and full benefits.

No offense, but for the most part the people who are working these “cog and spring” jobs have already shown they clearly don’t WANT to work, or they would be moving to, at a minimum, skilled labor. Plain and simple some people just don’t want to work. It’s like if you told a kid, hey you can have $10 for lunch or you can help me for 2 hours and I’ll give you $20, some kids will just take the $10 and play for 2 hours.

2021-05-07 13:47:39,stocks,"In my state working in a restaurant full time, my paychecks were typically between $0-$60 biweekly. The wage was somewhere around $4/hour + tips, as you've discussed the bulk of these tips came as credit card tips that are automatically claimed. Further, the managers are incented to keep expenses low and watch payroll costs carefully, and have a good handle on how much money servers are making daily - if someone tried to underclaim, most managers are quick to confront the employee as they handle paying out the employees at the end of each shift.

Hope this helps slightly illuminate the current state of tipped labor."

Your supply of jobs is LESS  than the total availability of workers.

Let’s say you and unemployment and all benefits you’re still going to have some of the highest unemployment numbers on record because there are less jobs available than there are people that could feel those jobs on unemployment. 

Now you look at the workers minimum quality of jobs that they can accept. 

Now the new reflect back to the available jobs that businesses are offering.

There’s a huge discrepancy there.

You have about 7 million jobs available right now. 

Let’s not even talk about the discrepancies right just let’s do basic math.

And then you have almost 10.2 million people unemployed

That’s a 3 million person gap 

Now let’s talk about discrepancies between what people were paid before the pandemic and what’s available now that 3 million person gap jumps to 5-6 million people. 

You can’t expect someone that was making $20 an hour to take a job that pays them only 10 or 13 or 12 which is the large majority of jobs that are available.

In addition to this, the United States small business administration is absolutely slaughtering our small business owners to the point where even if these lockdowns were nonexistent at this point we mostly won’t have enough capital to hire on people out a quality wage to re-open the business or reestablish it.

The SBA has only approved a small percentage of grants that were supposed to be available for majority of business owners which is hurting small business recovery.

The SBA is also denying people who have already received an economic injury disaster loan their loan modification increase to re-open their business if the IRS hasn’t produced their tax transcript yet which as we are all aware that IRS is significantly behind on peoples taxes. 

So if your business that went into lockdown which majority did you lost a lot of money and then you’re expected to rehire people with the limited cash that you have after receiving a loan last year that was supposed to last you six months which has already been exhausted six months ago and then you’re denied 24 months of additional working capital to help open your business because IRS is behind...

You are so far disconnected from the reality of what’s actually happening it’s not really mind blowing because most people don’t actually own a business nor do they have any clue what’s really going on they are just fed from Fox news and CNN and that’s part of the problem. 

And what my tyrant above did was just only scratched the surface of what’s really happening at the SBA the IRS and job inequality."

Take fast food for instance, one of their busiest times of the day (lunch) is right in the middle of typical class hours.  They are providing a service to people that work in other fields, convenient food during a typical lunch break.  The workers providing that service deserve to make enough money to actually survive.

2021-05-07 14:38:49,stocks,"Perhaps this is a cost of living difference. I worked in the Midwest for a mid-cost restaurant in a great chain of restaurants - no one in any of these chain of restaurants would have made anywhere near $100k, not the servers bartenders nor lower- and mid-level management. Everyone in the industry talks to everyone so pay rate and average tips were an open secret.

For easy reference, a server working 5 days a week could reasonably expect an average of around $100 a shift in tips - AM shifts would typically net around $40-80, PM shifts between $80-160 depending on the night. Night shifts are a commodity and servers fight for the best nights, so you will be expected to work a mix of AM and PM shifts. You could work a double shift aka 8am - 11pm averaging $200 total.

So quickly if you worked a double shift every day, 5 days a week x 52 weeks the best-case would be around $52,000 salary pre-tax. Most servers wouldn't / couldn't work the 14+ hour double shift every day (I was in school full time so only worked around 40 hours a week). Also this doesn't take into account that you are relying completely on tips - when you caught a bad break you could spend a whole week making less than $50 a shift due to bad tips or lack of customers. Typically your paycheck covered the cost of your taxes, and it was standard to get a $0 pay check. 

If your buddy is making nearly $100k that indicates they are bringing in around $400 tips per day (at 5 days a week) - or perhaps their restaurant has a great salary rate. Either way that figure doesn't mesh with the reality here in the Midwest, where average annual salary for full time servers was around $28,000 - at least through 2015."

The lockdown helped prevent the situation in NYC in March 2020 from looking like India right now. The lockdowns lasted weeks in most locations, if that. 

>other countries that used those strict measures had no more success than those that didnt.

There are a million extenuating circumstances in each of these countries that need to be taken into consideration. But those countries with more restrictions almost without exception did better than those without. Countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, etc all have stellar track records with the virus despite very high population density. Why? Because they experienced SARS and managed the restrictions/mask wearing much better than other countries.

One factor is that if you raise the minimum wage, to say $15, the extra cost is passed onto the consumer, however, because wages at the lowest end account for such a small fraction of commerce, that rise in prices is very small and easily swallowed by consumers. The idea that inflation takes off at lower end wage increases is a complete fallacy. Historically, if you look at minimum wage increases, this trend has held up, with prices not rising dramatically, especially for staple goods."

Or I could get a job at one of the local restaurants that are hiring.  They will pay me $8 an hour for 30 hours a week, or $240 before taxes.  (most big hourly places only assign 30 hours per week so they can call someone in for an extra shift and not go into overtime.  Ask any walmart employee).

If someone was making $10 an hour working 40 hour weeks before going on unemployment they would have a state benefit of $192 + $25 per dependent + $300 PUA.  So someone with two kids would get $542, or $13.55 an hour.  Far from the $30 it maxes out at.  Yes, it out pays the $10, but that is more of a negative reflection on the job.  After the $300 goes away, they drop down to $6.05 an hour.

For fairness, I'll run the numbers for your theoretical $20 an hour job.  That comes out to $385 + $25 per dependent and the $300 PUA.  If we again assume two kids, that is a total of $735, or $18.38 an hour, so any jobs that offer a decent wage aren't going to struggle to hire people.

I was curious so I calculated the break even point.  Jobs that pay under $15 an hour are out paid by unemployment while the $300 PUA remains in Massachusetts.  Jobs that pay over $15 are not."

It's been going on for decades, so much so that even bumping minimum wage to $15 an hour doesn't cover it.  The low wages not keeping pace with inflation absolutely kept the consumer price index down so that inflation wouldn't be measured as high.  That is literally the definition of subsidizing.

Companies that pay workers low enough that they qualify for welfare are literally subsidizing their business on our tax dollars.  Why should we have to pay for them to be able to pay so poorly?  I'm all for welfare, people fall on hard times and it is good to provide them a safety net, but people that are reliant on it while working is a shame.  Not on them, but on the businesses.  I would love to see an added tax on companies that have people on their payroll who qualify for welfare.  It is typically companies that pay low wages and under employ people so they don't have to pay benefits.  Then we, the tax payers, get stuck with the bill with increased welfare recipients."

This is literally the job of the government though and has been for well over a century now.

We already saw how that works back in the late 1800s when dangerous working conditions, child labor, 16 hour/6-7 day work weeks, low wages (sometimes in valueless company scrip), etc were the norm.

Why is it the company's responsibility to pay for your priorities? Let the govt set a minimum standard of living, and fulfill that directly.

If your buddy served here in OH he was most definitely pulling in $60 biweekly checks at best, or else he wasn't making any tips, worked overtime (typically not allowed as it incurs additional cost to the company), or he had a very unique role that paid above Ohio's minimum wage for tipped employees ($4.40/hr here in OH, $5.63/hr in FL as of 2021).

Yes it does. The populations of these countries had a run in with a similar but far more deadly pathogen. They got super lucky SARS fizzled out on its own as they were as ill-prepared for it as we were for Covid. Afterwards they develpped plans to better battle anotber similar outbreak. Plus their populations actually followed restrictions more stringently (like not having anti-mask demonstrations for example).

>other places used those same strategies and had no success.

We either need to optimize the production process to make it competitive, or accept the loss.  In this situation we are subsidizing our consumer prices on the backs of the poor people in other countries because we are content to look the other way.  It doesn't make it right either, but we have limited ability to change that.  International trade tariffs targeting countries with poor worker quality of life would be a logical approach though.  What metrics you would use to do that efficiently could be debated.  Not something I've given much thought to though.

One thing worth noting, though, if fewer people are living in poverty, consumer spending increases dramatically.  Consumers would be able to bear higher costs for luxuries if more people made a livable wage.  People on poverty wages just live without the luxuries, but if they can comfortably cover their living expenses they can occasionally partake in luxuries too.  Just because it will cost more, it doesn't mean it will be priced out of the market.

If we reduce the power, that's not necessarily going to make things better for the people who are less able to access the power.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in tech in the current regulatory climate - theory and discussion. Hi all,

First time poster. I have been thinking about the future of tech investments. As some background, I work in the field of competition law & regulation. Currently there are cases against Google and Facebook in the US, the latter may even lead to divestiture or total breaking up of the ecosystem.

Aside from that there is regulation on the way in the EU, the DMA and DSA will have far reaching consequences for the profitability of app stores, causing me concerns about Apple. Aside from that Amazon is under investigation as well. Aside from app stores there are also strict rules surrounding search engines. 

Right now I feel like only Amazon and Microsoft will be able to deal properly with the fallout of the changing regulatory landscape. Amazon as it is so diversified that it's a safe bet somewhat. However, I'm worried that Amazon is already so high (and public opinion of their employment terms are so bad) that there will be some inevitable fallout.

Now I'm left wondering if Microsoft is the right long-term investment. They are not overly data reliant and are building up positions in more and more areas for professional software. The only thing that concerns me is that Microsoft has a bad track record when it comes to being innovative. I fear some of their projects will ultimately fail as they are becoming perhaps the ""dinosaur"" of the tech world. 

I was wondering about your views and opinions. How likely do you think it is that new regulation or antitrust interventions will significantly harm the growth potential of these stocks? Am I missing something in my evaluation?"

Hypothetically, one share of Facebook would give you one share of Instagram, one share of WhatsApp, and one share of Facebook. separately, they might actually be a more attractive investment.

2021-05-07 16:33:51,stocks,"Interesting thread. I am long FB and GOOG so the topic if of obvious interest to me.

I would also echo the comments of others here regarding antitrust breakups, that they are few and far between (AT&T was 40 some years ago and Standard Oil was 100 years ago). I don't know however, if we can necessarily extrapolate from history that a breakup would automatically be a good thing. In the case of something like Google, even though I salivate over the thought of being able to receive and own Youtube shares, it's not entirely clear that there would be no adverse impact on the Youtube business (loss of search synergies, having to host Youtube outside the Google infrastructure, etc.).

I also think about the point you raise about Amazon. When Bezos  came out in favor of Biden's infrastructure plan (and a rise in the corporate tax rate), the commentary revolved around how Amazon would benefit from public infrastructure spending, and how they don't pay the full corporate tax rate anyway. But I think that's missing the point: these corporations are walking on thin ice, with over a decade of spectacular success generating substantial financial wealth to their high level employees, all while a lot of other folks in the country did not do well at all.

For Apple I'm quite worried because things that are on the table in the EU include no exclusive app stores on OS, no mandatory subscription through app stores etc. It may hurt their business quite a lot.

Then there's also the epic/apple case.

I don't think divestiture is on the table for apple in either way. 

--

For Google the DOJ referred to AT&T in their complaint so there is an indication a break up may occur. However more concerning for Google is the DMA in the EU that prohibits combining data from other services with their search service (core platform service) and mandatory fair and non discriminatory access to their ranking, clicks etc.

This may cause Google to lose their competitive edge in search which is ultimately their source of revenue. 

Especially in a situation where Google both has to divest (because US) and give up their data-access and ranking systems (because EU) they may be in deep water.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"CRWD valuation and upcoming earnings on May 31 Crowdstrike is a cyber security company that provides end host security to prevent breaches and data theft. They have earnings on June 3 for Q1FY22. They posted Q4FY21 earnings on March 18, at one of the brutal red days of the Nasdaq+tech fuckfest.

Currently, CRWD is trading at December 17 levels. Lets take a look at its current valuation and try to understand its short term and long term upsides. We can also compare CRWD to NET and see where the valuations sit.

First lets look at Q4 and FY2021.

https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/8906/html

The biggest thing to note here is that CRWD is on a 100% yoy revenue trajectory. This is impressive as they've done this for 4 years straight. In FY2021, they were able to pull in $874M revenue, growth of 81% yoy. Their profit also grew 89% comparatively as they were able to drive down the costs of both their product and services increasing margin for both.

Taking into account FY21 revenue, their current P/S value is 48 (42B mktcap by 874M sales). If CRWD announces first quarter revenue of $380M, which would project it for another 80% YoY growth, then consider the stock price to go back up to $220 as we'll try to project to a P/S of 48. If CRWD earnings drop below that, I could see the stock drop to $150 at growth has slowed and the P/S would no longer justify its valuation.

Looking at their projections from their April investor relations deck:
https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/2852082c-2ce8-4d5d-96ad-0e2cb1bd8edc

CRWD is expecting to hit $3Bn ARR in 2025. As of FY2021, they are are $1Bn ARR. 

Overall, I think CRWD is fairly priced currently at $190 compared to other high performing industryplayers. I think CRWD can easily get to $220 based on speculation or if they have a good revenue Q1. I think $240 is very reasonable by end of year due to secular trends in security concerns. Their investor presentation is compelling, showing large TAM growth and tailwinds in cybersecurity. Additionally, over the next 4 years, CRWD is planning to release new products that break into new markets that increase their TAM by 2x (from 44Bn in 2021 to 106Bn in FY25). Compare this to how the market reacted when NET released their serverless platform and the stock jumped 15%. Tackling a new market creates strong tailwinds in growth.

Betting on CRWD at this current price is betting that cyber security and endpoint protection will be critical for large businesses going forward. Do you believe that corporations will see nation state and corporate sponsored cyber security attacks going forward? If so, Crowdstrike is a place you should be seriously considering putting money.

I got into CRWD at $185, but I unfortunately averaged up to a cost average of $209. Seeing CRWD at $190 feels like a fair price, and anything below $180 feels like a deal. The upside potential with regards to risk/reward feels good below $180. At around $200, it could go either way and you may just break even short term.

Long term, I think CRWD has the legs to grow 20% this year."

Then there’s also the data aggregation piece. Exchanges needs to set a time to stop all activities so it can start doing the consolidation work behind the scene.

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

also,

> In 2017, IBM revealed that they had created 5 nm silicon chips,[13] using silicon nanosheets in a gate-all-around configuration (GAAFET), a break from the usual FinFET design. The GAAFET transistors used had 3 nanosheets stacked on top of each other, covered in their entirety by the same gate, just like FinFETs usually have several physical fins side by side that are electrically a single unit and are covered in their entirety by the same gate. IBM's chip measured 50 mm2 and had 600 million transistors per mm2.[14][15]

But screens are going to have higher nits by 2025 when this possibly starts rolling and the radio (wifi) is hungry too.    
So the power savings for the processor won't really matter when other parts are probably going to get more power hungry.    
    
Really battery technology is the big gain area right now to me.     

Also the manufacturing process will probably be low yield for quite some time, so costs will be significantly higher.      
So while this is great, theres going to come a point where the gains aren't really all that great.    
    
Maybe for servers. And if processing power for the space this takes up is increased it could be useful in certain devices.    
    
I don't know will this rollout for phones or watches for example.    
    
I think for home users we will see a point where our devices no longer go to this smaller tech.

There are I/O implications, memory bandwidth limitations.  You can't compare the 64-core AMD benchmark to the 28-core Intel benchmark and be like ""Look AMD da best man.""  When you compare the 64-core AMD vs a 56-core Intel installation (similar *cost*) the gap is like 15% instead of 50%, and there is a lot more calculated into the platform cost than a single CPU alone."

That's why the big.LITTLE designs and chip-stacking stuff is interesting.  They are pouring money into precisely the kind of research it takes to overcome these problems.

Intel's market cap is over 230 billion dollars. AMD's is like 93 billion.  That's today, right now, with all the problems taken into account.  They have the money to ""fix"" this problem.  It sucks that it takes time but it's not like they can just call up a guy and ask for a better CPU lithographer.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

At the same time, the Dow likely gets flushed to down .3 to .4 percent at open.

I suspect that this day won’t be anything out of the ordinary though. I think you’ll see a bounce after that.

It should be noted that if it’s not seen today, the Dow and apparently maybe the S&P as well now have globex record highs that need to trade at some point this year and likely will, honestly."

NDX is up quite a bit itself but you're really seeing the effects of what this kind of a miss means for tech stocks that don't have the huge profits right now the most (in that since there's less of a threat of a taper, they're still going to perform well for now).

2021-05-07 10:30:02,stocks,"From my trading journal:  (not financial advice)

The NASDAQ has, in recent history, ended dips and corrections after at least kissing the 100-day SMA. The NASDog is finding support on the 50, but this could also be semi-experienced and/or impatient traders ""buying the dip"" after seeing support on the 50-day yesterday. This occurred back on 2/23 with the NASDAQ finding footing on the 50, moving up and trading choppy for a few days before ultimately making final bottom on 3/8. To feel confident in a rally if the NASDAQ does not make lows, I’m looking for price to reclaim the 20-day SMA.

2021-05-07 06:18:46,stocks,What are some conservative index funds good for holding long-term for someone in their 50's?
2021-05-07 08:01:23,stocks,"I invested in December and January when the stocks were in the all time high season. Because of that, I’m down 20% of my 60% portfolio. That’s not the first time I put money when the stocks are high. 
However, I waited for the day the stock dropped. 
As a lesson learned, I should wait much more for a stock dropping, such as two months instead of weeks.

I have a question for you. What industry would you invest $100.000 to get returns by 2023?"
2021-05-07 08:12:43,stocks,"Why do some stocks have weekly options while others have monthly options only? I've noticed stocks below $10 are usually monthly which I understand, but CRSR which is above 30 and still has monthly only?"
2021-05-07 08:26:05,stocks,I check American Outdoor Brands to remind myself what a healthy trend line looks like. It's my only solace right now
2021-05-07 08:32:55,stocks,Awful job numbers. Wow
2021-05-07 08:57:20,stocks,"Is today going to be the day? Probably not, but here is to hoping."
2021-05-07 09:31:37,stocks,"Is the job report actually good news for tech stocks since experts are saying the fed is unlikely to raise rates anytime soon? Man, what an f'd up system...."
2021-05-07 09:53:21,stocks,Cant believe I missed that NET dip. I've got some buys but that price was a good deal imo. I've only got 20 stocks at the moment but even that is still too much to follow the dips.
2021-05-07 09:57:49,stocks,"I wanna buy some shares of Apple, should i wait for the dividend payout or just go for it today?"
2021-05-07 10:11:23,stocks,"Used the green today to do finish what will hopefully be the last of the rebalancing I need to do for a while. (Sold off an ETF that turned out to just be compounding my exposure to a lot of companies I am already well invested into.)  Good chunk of my portfolio is still in large cap growth but at least it's more reasonably so. 

Can't predict where the market is heading but after these past 2 weeks I am now more confident than ever in my portfolio being able to hold strong in the face of on the fly rotations."
2021-05-07 10:17:31,stocks,Quintupling down on Himax yesterday was a good idea!
2021-05-07 10:56:42,stocks,"Great recovery today but still down 1% overall. What I wouldn't give to end the week in the green, that said, it's much more likely to sink back down than go up tbh."
2021-05-07 11:17:10,stocks,"Man, my NET option bought at the bottom yesterday is getting crushed on volume. Should be at least double, but I’m up all of 20%."
2021-05-07 12:39:26,stocks,"Go away VIX, I don't need this today"
2021-05-07 13:24:06,stocks,Some whale bought a huge amount of LOTZ at 10am.
2021-05-07 13:51:14,stocks,"Would you rather put money into a ETF like FTEC? Or own individual companies like AAPL, MSFT, NVDA?"
2021-05-07 14:16:01,stocks,"Well then, FNKO really popped out of nowhere, lols. 

My shares will probably get called at this rate if things down simmer down by may 21. Was a good run though.

FA wise, they were solid, but I guess their recent acquisition really helped prop them up for more revenue streams. Didn't expect it to be THIS good 😅"
2021-05-07 14:22:32,stocks,What is your threshold in determining if a company is overvalued?
2021-05-07 14:52:23,stocks,Can nasdaq finish over 1% today?

2021-05-07 15:02:43,stocks,"Tesla has been holding up pretty steady despite many other aggressive growth stocks dropping , 670 is a very strong support for them."
2021-05-07 12:51:48,stocks,"Yellen just finished speaking. Watching the S$P intra-day and you could sense the market hanging on her every word. She was VERY careful in her wording. 

I need a drink"
2021-05-07 08:59:03,stocks,Cathie wood sells half google stake and half apple. What is she thinking? Seems like a really bad move.
2021-05-07 16:05:01,stocks,"Why so many people use margin? Investing in stocks is already risky enough, margin is pretty much for situations when you have some insider info about a specific company, yet so many people use it mindlessly and get margin called"
2021-05-07 13:23:28,stocks,Market really wants to dump

2021-05-07 12:42:18,stocks,"IDK what to do with BB, do I keep my shares or sell them now (for a slight gain I have) and put that money into my dividend stocks (NRZ, FDUS, ABR)?"

2021-05-07 13:51:57,stocks,Small portfolio... but days like today rip
2021-05-07 16:42:54,stocks,"Is PLTR still overvalued in the $19 range? Kept hearing it was in the 40s, 30s, 20s, now it 19. It a value now?"
2021-05-07 05:55:21,stocks,"Hi, what you guys think about buying Airbus and Boeing stocks and holding for at least year or two? They are nowhere near pre-corona price and one would think in a year or two they will be back at pre-corona value."
2021-05-07 08:10:18,stocks,Appian down hard pre market. Earnings seemed better than expected for the most part... Hard not to jump at this

2021-05-07 08:58:13,stocks,"Anyone been looking at STMP? Down 30%+ after a big drop a couple months ago, near its 6 month low. P/E of ~20 isn't too bad nowadays either. Looking like a decent drop pre-market after a big earnings beat but no guidance."
2021-05-07 09:35:14,stocks,When nobody wants to work higher wages need to be paid to attract workers and that can still lead to higher inflation and the Fed tightening. It could actually be longer lasting inflation.
2021-05-07 09:54:07,stocks,My SOXL calls coming back alive
2021-05-07 10:10:31,stocks,"Wish I put more into XLE after its dip back down. Its back up \~10% recently. That and my chemicals heavy material ETF is up 12%... evil boomer shit has consistently been my stronger performers lately, while all my sexy tech investments have dug me into a hole."

2021-05-07 13:58:57,stocks,Anyone's thoughts on Goldman Sachs stock? I purchased a long call option with a $370 strike price with a May 28th expiry. I'm already very in the green and the stock has been consistently climbing the past two weeks. Fundamentals seem good and the P/E ratio is pretty low. Other than a crypto team announcement made today I can't find other news. Sell and take profits or hold (I'm already up a significant amount but there is a lot more money to be made if its trend continues)?
2021-05-07 14:05:20,stocks,"Very disappointing day so far by growth and innovation, really thought that the pop would hold better but nope.

I probably won't have as good of a day as I had yesterday based off what I saw when I last checked my holdings (yeah, I was here complaining, but I had a really nice day yesterday). Half were green and half looked fairly sizably red."

Thank you, Papa Buffett."
2021-05-07 14:57:46,stocks,The DOW has a 13.7% YTD increase. What a run its had. I never would've thought it'd perform better than SPY for this long. Feels like such a boomer investment
2021-05-07 05:40:03,stocks,"My portfolio only had TSLA, PLTR and FSLY. All are down 30-40% from February. Time to uninstall the app and come back after 10 years?"

I do, however, have stocks in other industries as well, my most significant hold being $ZKIN. ZK International is primarily in the industrial conglomerates' industry but has holdings in the blockchain, NFT, and gambling markets through their subsidiaries. Their listing has skyrocketed over the last few months, and their volume is picking up too. I'm counting on this stock to give me some good returns too."

2021-05-07 13:40:50,stocks,"Question about Sell Stop Limits.

Would it be dangerous to set up a stop limit order with a limit order far below the stop price to make sure it gets filled to exit the trade? For example stop is placed at $100, with limit all the way down to $80.  If the price isn't tanking hard / gaping down, or on a low liquidity stock, it should fill near the stop price at $100, even though the limit is all the way down to $80 right?  Asking because the broker that I am using does not allow regular stop sell orders, they must be stop limit.

Thanks!"
2021-05-07 13:57:44,stocks,What in fuck happened to $VWDRY?
2021-05-07 14:02:17,stocks,Here comes the decline.
2021-05-07 14:51:44,stocks,"Recently got into options. Question about leaps:

If I buy a leap today for next year, say for PLTR. Lets say PLTR is at $20 and I buy a 1/22 $25c. If PLTR hits $25 on 10/21 or 12/21 will I still make profit? Or will my leap have bled out by then? Sorry for the noob question."

2021-05-07 13:56:52,stocks,"Welp I'm now in on Lucid motors 100x shares at $19 average. Feel bad for all the folks that bought the peak. 

I highly doubt this'll be a bad endeavor by the time their SUV is announced, but I know the risk I'm taking. Less than $20/share seems very reasonable given their team, backers, product, and future plans."

2021-05-07 17:04:31,stocks,"Call me crazy... call me a conspiracy theoriest... BUT does anyone else have this sinking gut feeling that with Bezos steeping down and selling off a ton of assets (mind you once a year he does this), Bill and Melinda Gates divorce which allowed the selling and transferring LEGALLY of billions of dollars in assets, the absolute bipolar and clearly manipulated market with oddly low volumes they all know something we dont know? 

Theres no doubt our economy is terrible with unemployment,  inflation and rising costs or living. While a crash someday is inevitable the more i think about it the more im worried we will have either another major correction or worse a crash this year.

Biden needs to get his crap together and open the country up. This isnt sustainable in the long run. 

Anyone else or am i over thinking?

It is possible to have a market selloff of everything, it's happened before, which is a reason why I have found the last couple months to be baffling at times.

Like I said on Wednesday, that Nasdaq day on Tuesday would have broken everything in the fall easily (and probably led to it plunging even deeper than as bad as it was at its lowest).

I could have egg on my face after saying this but despite the rotations that have been going on, color me doubtful that the Dow and S&P's resilience ending would be a good thing at least initially for growth tech. It would likely be better in the long run in that everything finally got corrective, but it'd be painful in the short term."

2021-05-07 16:18:10,stocks,"I remember getting my post about PLTR reaching 15-18 being blasted as heresy.

&#x200B;

here we are a dollar and a half away

Here's another one for you:

If a correction occurs this year, and I'm guessing a correction of 15-20% will occur in the broad markets (since that would put us back to..gasp..where we were in Jan), I would expect to see PLTR to head to around 12 a share or LOWER. Nio down to around 20-22. Tesla down to around 300. Arkk will hit around 50-60. Yes, you heard my correctly, that would be around a 70-80% fall from the February highs, depending on the stock. When investors mentioned ""2021 is the year where a lot of the n ew tech inventors will completely give up and pushed out of the market""  they were NOT talking about the 30-50% drop in March, they were talking about a 70-80% drop. That is peak fear folks - imagine dumping 10k in Feb and being DOWN 80% with 2K left. I sure as hell could not stomach that if it was my first time investing.

Come on, bring down the downvotes, you all laughed when I said pltr would be headed to 18 soon. look where we are at now. The future projection I have is the NOMINAL case if we have a correction, not even the WORST CASE. 

and load up on your cash because its prime buying season when it happens

2. Look at their stock price and history. This alone will give you a lot of insight on where the price is headed and upside potential. 

3. Look up the health of their business. Are they making money? Do they have things in the pipeline that could shake things up? Are they stagnant? A company that has no basis for success is pretty much never a good investment. 

4. Scour their earnings reports. Not just for numbers but also look at the general information. This where companies give you all the big updates. And if that don't cut it, you can search for articiles that pinpoint the exact info for you. 

5. See what others have to say on the stock. Beyond forums see what reputable people on Youtube or analyst sites have to say. They ain't always right but it's probably better to hear encouraging things than awful things. 

When I am actually serious about investing in something I tend to do the above."

Judging on past experience, tech corrections stretch on much longer, especially when re-enforced by market wide corrections.

TL;DR: tech correction will correct further when market wide correction occurs, likely sometime this summer/fall if I had to guess.

I don't expect tech or growth to really recover until later this year at a minimum, and not reach previous feb highs until next summer - based on past behavior. but each one is different."

When I rationalize to myself why a company isn't *something*, whether that *something* is overvalued or a pump-and-dumb, or whatever it might be, typically it's because that company obviously is that *something*.

Any time I take a step back to silence the voice in my head, it's really the voice of reason I'm silencing

It's basically up to you to guess. But you can be pretty damn sure it's not going to be a $300 billion company; at that capitalization, you'd be fairly sure it's overvalued.

2021-05-07 09:26:00,stocks,"While I agree that it's silly to let a current downturn make you completely abandon your conviction picks which for both of us seem to largely be tech, you shouldn't let a comeback day make you overestimate a move you made. 

I recall how by the end of April it seemed like tech's hopping back into the saddle seemed to be on lock after what, a week and half rally? But all it took was a nutty earnings season and a couple days to basically wipe out 50% of that comeback. (NASDAQ went from like 14000+ to 13600 in just a few days). Not saying that constantly buying dips is a dumb gamble or that you should just blindly chase every rotation. Note that the good advice is to diversify your holdings so that you have exposure to different sets of sectors at all times to offset downturns some might go through. Not sell all your holdings and dump them in Marketwatch's latest darling. Specifically chasing the hot item of the week is not sustainable for most folks. The market simply moves too fast and erractically. Just...keep a level head. 

I am hopeful for tech comeback today but if there's anything the past month and a half has taught me, is that you gotta keep a level head and long time horizon and not get too caught up in the minute by minute action. And purchases/sells should be paced accordingly. Eagerly jumping at every opportunity the market seems to present makes you that much more supsceptible to unexpected developments."

If rates are raised, that makes it harder for these companies to borrow and expand. The current price is reflective of expectations of future earnings. If these companies can't borrow as much, future earnings should be lower. 

In reality I'm not sure it's all neat and tidy like that, but that's the general idea. I think it's even a meta of like ""oh, if rates go up Nasdaq sells, so if rates go up or look like they're going up I'll be sure to sell first"".  So a self-fulfilling prophecy, too."

2021-05-07 16:59:38,stocks,"First, I don’t think being right about PLTR gives you the credibility to predict a massive market crash. I do think you’re right about speculative tech getting hammered or underperforming this year, but I disagree to the extent.

It’s also important to distinguish that a lot of things fall under the umbrella of “tech” and many of them are unlikely to be highly volatile."
2021-05-07 17:17:06,stocks,"I could see this happening, but I don’t think the correction overall will be that intense, a lot of the more speculative stocks have already been smashed. I would guess something a bit less extreme then you are suggesting given everybody is walking around with their ass checks clenched in preparation for a big crash and “holding extra cash”. I think that big of a crash has to have a trigger, and just “inflation LOL” is not going to be a big enough trigger to crash it that much at this point, unless something else unforeseen happens."

2021-05-07 10:58:00,stocks,"I am willing to share some blunders:

- Don't buy ahead of earnings. The volatility is too much to be worth the gamble. 

- Consider waiting a day before averaging down a position you just got that's going down. Either it sorts itself out quickly or you get the chance to average down a lower point and avoid getting cut by the falling knife harder.

- Make sure you build hedge picks on pace with your conviction picks. The market can turn wonky when you least expect it so make sure you're satisified with your diversification so that you don't gotta go chasing rotations you don't understand. 

- Just be patient. Seriously. The market is so unpredictable. Never feel pressured to chase a seemingly missed opportunity. I fomo'd into expanding a lot of my tech holds after they've had a solid couple of weeks an because of that I had too much money tied up at this time to justify splurging on this week's dips. Never feel forced to buy. Buy when you think it's sound."

2021-05-07 14:52:56,stocks,I disagree with your last point. Pins' numbers are looking good. They have good margins and growing nicely outside of the US. The pandemic indeed inflated their growth which is why the stock has been free falling lately. But there are no signs it's a bad business or not on the path to profitability this year.  Its last 12 months return is still AMAZING. If you bought recently then you're holding the bag indeed.

They have stood up to HBO and Comcast and won. Now it's Google's turn. Roku spent their money expanding everywhere that matters. Look up the Nielsen deal. From a the nextgeb tv ad company, Roku. How did people ignore this dd? The stock price was high, but the company and leadership is excellent.

Streaming is still expanding rapidly. There is still a ton of room to grow as rural gets broadband this year and next, and then global. Somehow the average person is still underselling cable cuttings growth, but Roku is also already turning profits.

You raise a good point and long-term one has to wonder if this sort of policy is really sustainable.  I'm not talking about an immediate crash - the economy is improving, albeit slowly, and inevitably things are going to recover from Covid sooner or later.

But inequality just keeps growing and growing and this could be a very bad sign for the US economy, yes.  Debt is a problem too, both corporate and federal.  These are things that fiscal policy needs to be addressing starting this decade IMO, and especially coming out of Covid."

2021-05-07 15:44:17,stocks,Not sure why margin % is the metric you're using.  If the company doubles revenue yet doesn't increase margin by keeping expense increase marginally less then the margin % stays the same.  Would a company that now makes 2x as much money (which also shows 100% growth) still be valued the same now as before?
2021-05-07 15:51:41,stocks,"74% is great. As long as they keep growing revenue at the rate we've seen in the last year then it doesn't really matter. As we know, large numbers matter. Overall their margins are solid.

Regarding path to profitability.  Net income last two quarters in millions:

Q4'20: $207     vs Q4'19: ($35)Q1'21: ($21)    vs Q1'20  ($141)\*

\*I think some of it is probably due to SBC related to the IPO

It's worth noting their revenue is seasonal and they tend to make much more revenue in Q4. If they don't end the year with nice profit after the potential they showed in Q4 of last year, then I will be worried."

And the length of the benefits have been extended as well as easing the restrictions around what qualifies as unemployment.

Not saying this is necessarily bad (it could drive up wages to compete with it), but there are definitely people making more on unemployment than they were when working."

2021-05-07 15:55:18,stocks,Exactly. There's a limit of how much companies can improve their margins. But 70% of 10M is not the same as 70% of $1B. Amazon has low margins (at least for retail) but still has billions in profits because of their insane revenue numbers.
2021-05-07 16:00:10,stocks,"> 74% is great.

My point isn't to get into some semantic exercise where we try to decide what superlative sounds good. The point is that the margin is what it was, and what it was is what it is now. Either way, it's not a good metric to explain its current shareprice.

As I said before, ""path to profitability"" still doesn't mean profitable. Companies fall off the path all the time. We're over a decade along this particular path, and Pinterest still isn't making any money. If we want to go play the ""guidance says the sky is the limit"" game, then there's dozens of other growth stocks to choose from.

Regarding your edit,

>It's worth noting their revenue is seasonal

It's still trading at ~x20 projected revenue. 60 is probably the ceiling on its price regardless of the season. Even if it smashes the revenue out of the park, it's what... x16? x15? Even for growth stocks, there's not many where hitting top end revenue estimates like clockwork for the next five years just to hit mid teens.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Is 9 stocks enough? (mid-term dividend portfolio) Hey guys,

I put some money in a target retirement fund in a Roth IRA every year.  Recently however for various reasons (Covid, stimulus, etc.) I'm sitting on a lot of extra cash.  I already put a lot in series I bonds (inflation-protected), but I think I can do better than that and want to invest a good bit in taxable account as well.  For now I don't need the money, and I've got my 1st tier (cash) and 2nd tier (savings bonds) emergency funds set already.  But looking at a 3-5 year time horizon there's a lot of uncertainty for me right now and I may have some big purchases (major home renovations, back to school, new car, etc.)   Again, though, I don't just want to sit on cash or savings bonds and miss out on gains.

Right now my taxable account has 50% index funds (VTI and VXUS).  These are great long-term plays but I'm worried about having total market exposure in the event that I need to pull out equity at some point.  The absolute worst thing that could happen would be for markets to drop 30% right when I need to access that cash.

Thus I'm considering creating a fully defensive portfolio for the meantime, collecting dividends with some hopes for modest capital appreciation.  I have 9 stocks that I already own or that are on my watchlist.  My question is that if this will provide enough diversification for the short-to-mid term.  If you're interested, here they are:

1. MSFT
2. AAPL (these two are not for dividends, I just think they're solid companies worth holding in any portfolio)
3. BTI
4. IMBBY
5. PM
6. MO
7. UVV (3-7 are tobacco companies)
8. KO
9. PAAS (mining stock / inflation hedge)

Everything would be about equally weighted with some minor variations.

Obviously I'm way overweight on tobacco but I've done research into the industry and in the next decade or so these companies aren't going anywhere.  Hell, I'm confident even on a longer time horizon and already hold a couple of these in my portfolio.  I do see long-term risk because it's a declining industry, but again, I anticipate ample time to get out and/or rebalance.

I don't anticipate any of these companies suddenly going bankrupt... they have good balance sheets and strong cash flows.  That said, I am concerned that some unforeseen event could wipe out 10%+ of my portfolio.  I think mid-term this portfolio makes sense, but I'm new to this, so I just want to see what more experienced people think about the soundness of this allocation.

I'll also take any recommendations if you want to help bump me up to 10+. =\]"
2021-05-07 06:28:31,stocks,"I would take down some of the backy companies and do some actual diversification. If you want to hold tech and backy only that is fine. You said you wanted to diversify?

Stick to two tech and two tobacco and add f, xom and pep and you will have a good dividend paying list. The shipping and logistics tobacco company could be an outlier from the other group. You could also consider mmm and vz.

I am smitten with kmi and bkep."
2021-05-07 06:33:24,stocks,"I know you think the tobacco industry isn’t going anywhere but would be a little wary of having that much exposure to a regulatory-dependent industry. There are surprises that could happen that you’re not ready for - though it looks like you’ve considered this and is a risk you’re willing you take. I would suggest you pick the one or two tobacco stocks you are most confident in and load up on just them (my personal vote is BTI). 

Other stocks/industries that held up like soldiers last March are telecom, defense, and big pharma. VZ, LMT, LHX, BMY, MRK, and ABBV are ones off the top of my head. You’d get some industry diversification with those and Buffett owns the listed telco and big pharma stocks.

For what it is worth my portfolio looked similar to this and I eventually moved most of it into big tech. I think Google, Facebook, and Amazon are great investments but probably more variable than what you’re looking for. That said, you may want to juxtapose KO with either Google or Facebook and look at valuation and growth, I personally found the tech stocks much more attractive on nearly every financial metric."

VTI/VXUS is a completely broadly diversified global portfolio.  Unless you are going to own and maintain 60-80 stocks on your own, you can't recreate that.  Better to overweight it with a defensive dividend play, if that's what you think will work in the short term, than to dump it all.  All individual issues require price targets and frequent maintenance of targets regardless of how solid you think they are."
2021-05-07 06:33:51,stocks,"Wonderful recommendations here, thanks!  The only reason I like tobacco is because I used to smoke it, and I already did a ton of research on all the companies and the industry itself.  I feel like I have information advantage there, whereas if I switched to the other companies I'd be generally okay because they're strong names, but also in the dark about how the companies operate, etc.

I'm also in IMBBY, not sure about the long-term future but the value right now is undeniable.  Believe it or not I actually sold out of MO and UVV recently because they were my lower conviction picks... but now that I'm realizing my risk tolerance isn't what I thought it was I'm regretting putting that money into indexes.

I'll have to take a look at some of those picks, I appreciate that.

As for tech, noted as well.  Two issues I have are that, yes, it's more volatile, and secondly, I don't know how much more room we have to go up right now.  The early signs of a taper tantrum are part of what has made me second guess holding index funds for non-retirement purposes.

EDIT: Oh yeah, the tobacco industry. You're right.  We got some bad news a couple weeks back with menthol as well as reduced nicotine.  However, the fact that these stocks not only recovered but some rallied beyond earlier levels was a good sign IMO.

But you're right and that's something I'll need to consider."

2021-05-07 07:32:29,stocks,I don't think anything is wrong with holding tobacco companies but you mentioned diversification.  What happens if WTO or EU or US switches mindset towards banning tobacco products.  Biden could also see another sin tax as a way to bring in more revenue and a tobacco tax could reduce consumptions.   All of the companies will be hit the same.  Perhaps you can hold your percentage of diversification across industries.  so for example you hold $1000 of both AAPL and MSFT and you spread $2000 total across all the different tobacco companies instead of $1000 into each.

The potential benefits of these advanced 2 nm chips could include:

Quadrupling cell phone battery life, only requiring users to charge their devices every four daysii.
Slashing the carbon footprint of data centers, which account for one percent of global energy useiii. Changing all of their servers to 2 nm-based processors could potentially reduce that number significantly.
Drastically speeding up a laptop's functions, ranging from quicker processing in applications, to assisting in language translation more easily, to faster internet access.
Contributing to faster object detection and reaction time in autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars.

2021-05-07 15:17:43,stocks,"> Power usage per system is irrelevant. 

Sorry, I believe you are mistaken. Power usage per system is a critical metric. If you don't know how much power your systems are using you can't calculate a baseline, nor plan for future growth. You **can** ignore that metric, but you're never going to get the most out of your space by ignoring how much power you're using, and where. This is one of the most important parts of datacenter design, especially as they push higher and higher densities in each cab (+32-48kW). 

> The choice isn't between less compute at high power or more compute at low power. It's high compute at high power or high compute at low power.

Well of course, higher compute potential has been the goal since the 8086. But you can't hit that goal if you don't have the power. Which brings us back to the original point - smaller architecture, in this case 2nm, consumes more power and will need more cooling. Both of which are power metrics that you **should** be measuring in a datacenter.

There's a lot of supplemental info in /r/datacenter about these topics. Just search for power, cooling, efficiency - if you're interested."

2021-05-07 15:30:14,stocks,"> Sorry, I believe you are mistaken. Power usage per system is a critical metric.

That's kind of sidestepping my point. What I meant is it's irrelevant to comparing 2nm to > 2nm hardware. If I can have one system that uses X power with an equal amount of compute power to two systems that use the twice the power, the power is still lower. The energy use and BTUs generated by an equal amount of computing power is still lower.

Your argument is essentially that because the energy cost and space concerns are lower, they will just increase the amount of hardware they're using, which will erase those benefits. My point is that their hardware acquisition is driven by the amount of computing they need/can sell. Nobody is going to by extra hardware they won't use just because energy use is lower. Similarly they will buy extra hardware they will use regardless of whether the energy cost is lower or not.

To put a home example to your case. Your argument is essentially that if I buy an energy star rated fridge, I'll just buy two fridges and use the same amount of energy. If I need two fridges, the amount of energy my first fridge uses is not the deciding factor to whether I buy another fridge. How much stuff I need to keep cold is.

> Which brings us back to the original point - smaller architecture, in this case 2nm, consumes more power and will need more cooling.

What? This is literally backwards. Smaller architecture consumes less power. That's one of the largest factors for making chips smaller. It's literally in the first paragraph of their press release:

VT/VTI is a ‘safer’ place to put money (not totally risk free), but it’s generally not a bad place to put money if you want to sleep at night especially as you try to better understand the markets and their risks. If you decide to learn more about other ETFs and are willing to take more risk, it’s a good place to start before doing so."
2021-05-07 10:10:06,stocks,"You're actually in a great place to start investing. Do it at your own pace, where you feel comfortable. If investing $20k will give you sleepless nights and make you worry too much, then don't... start where you're comfortable. Keep in mind, the market is very bipolar right now, with stocks skyrocketing or crashing based on things that seem to make no sense. Buy companies you think will be successful in the long term, and look at the stock charts to find good entry points. Good luck!"

Yes, you should invest it - if you don't need it for 10 years+.

Start by buying some SPY or VOO.  Then when you have another 1k you don't need for 10 years+ buy more.

Just keep using any excess cash (if it exists) to buy more and invest.

By the time you're 50 you'll be thankful.

But, we also could see ratios continue to lever up, who knows... but it seems pretty obvious to me, and the past few months imo show that big banks/firms are ""reevaluating"" their positioning

Think how much it would cost you to learn a useful skill, and compare that to the 1k.

Buy 5 of this one you think might be a winner, and a call or put option on something else. Play small and pay attention. Build a watch list. Figure out the pulse of the market and see if you can grow your 1k.

What do you have to lose? 5% of your savings account? Even if it goes to $300, you'll know if you like it. You'll know if you can learn from it.

People try paper trading but honestly I can't get into it. I tried a few thousand instead to keep it interesting and it's such damn fun. Even though I'm down some, I have identified a few winners and learned from some losers and think I'm getting better at it. Money well spent."

My investments are pretty diversified; Real Estate, Stocks, CDs, Pokemon cards (joking!), etc. I've been reading a lot of positive things about having a portion of your portfolio dedicated to dividends. I'm interested and looking for ideas. I'm sure if we get enough heads
 together we can come up with some ideas to not only help me but other people as well.

Personally, I'm looking for mostly sideways-ish trading stocks, low priced, with a decent dividend payment. Doesn't have to meet those things exactly I guess it mostly just depends on the stock/company.

For example, $ORC (Orchid Island) mostly trades sideways. Has a monthly dividend of .07 and is low priced at currently $5.50 per share. That means with a 150k investment you could buy 27,272 shares and have a monthly dividend payment of $1900 per month (roughly).

Do you have a sexy dividend portfolio or ideas for one? I'd love to pick your brain and I'm sure many other people would as well.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Am I crazy for still liking $Lyft? I first bought into Lyft after listening to an ARK podcast about “micromobility”, which actually went more into the EV space than anything iirc. But it got me thinking. 

Micro-mobility is the shorter distances, I believe under 3 miles, that people take which account for the vast majority of car trips. Urban areas are getting denser and commutes are shrinking, parking and (if you own a car in a city) reparking for those short trips is a hassle. It’s no surprise that cities are seeing booming demand for alternative forms of transport. Scooters, bikes, and yes still “rideshare” as well. Lyft owns Motivate which runs e-bikes. Certainly this is only a small part of their current revenue. But I already see the bikes monopolizing infrastructure(charging stations on street corners) and they’re blowing up in popularity in my city. 

They sold their self driving tech project recently, but they still have a promising partnership with Google’s Waymo. I think they will be in the right position when/if robotaxis are a thing. 

Anyway, I like the company. They are set to be profitable by the end of Q3. They are a reopening play in the short term. They just beat expected earnings despite a driver shortage.

But the stock has taken quite the hit this week, all because the Biden admin is reigniting the gig worker debate. Nothing fundamental has changed. Look, they survived that prop 22 debate in CA because all of the part time drivers prefer the flexibility of gig work. The bureaucratic threats are overblown.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"$ROKU Crushes Earnings, Profit and Revenue Beat Roku reported earnings of 54 cents a share for the first quarter. Analysts had anticipated a net loss of 13 cents a share. Roku’s net revenue of $574.2 million was up 79% year-over-year, beating out consensus estimates at $491.6 million.

ROKU has been caught in a pretty nasty selloff since early Feb. Up 9% after hours making up more than the day's 6.5% loss.

PS you can pry my ROKU shares out of my cold dead fingers."

2021-05-07 00:26:53,stocks,"Their platform revenue grew at over 100% year-over-year, compared to only a 20% growth on the hardware side. I think some analysts still give too much focus to their hardware business which is why estimates have been way off the past few quarters. Their platform revenue in Q1 alone exceeds their total revenue numbers in Q1, Q2, and Q3 of 2020, which is kinda crazy when you think about it.  

Platform profit margin has also risen every quarter. Q1 is 66% compared to their hardware business which is typically 5-10%. 

The only downside to this is that I think Roku just lost their vaunted ""unprofitable tech company"" unicorn status, and that might actually drag the stock price down in the near term (""omg 100 PE = OVERPRICED!!"").

Still long Roku though."

This cannot happen. The brokerage will automatically execute the trade on the client's behalf and pay out the difference and keep the shares if the client doesn't manually exercise.

I mean in theory it could happen.  The client would have to call up their broker, get on the phone with a human being, and tell the human being ""I want to lose money, please do not exercise my contract"""

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"The Market Is Unpredictable And Stocks Going Down Is Normal Since the March lows, it seems a lot of the stocks have gone up +100% in one year which is very abnormal and does not happen in ""regular"" years. We have seen this, especially in the tech sector. We have seen a bit of a pull back in the tech sector with stocks going down 10- 20% or more since February. 

You must remember that if a stock goes up 100% and falls by 20% that is still a great return if you got in early. However, if you FOMO'd in many cases or bought into the hype, you must understand that this can happen. The market is unpredictable right now and it's important to invest in stocks that you believe are good and not look for a quick book if you are worried about losing money.

Stocks don't go up forever and in many cases, they may fall because the stock is going back to its ""fundamentals""."
2021-05-06 21:54:30,stocks,"The biggest lesson I’ve taken from this market is to ignore all the “we’ve seen this before, it happens” sage advice. No. We haven’t seen this before. This market is unique to the time we are in. Speaking of Buffett, he’s made some terrible trades over the past year and a half. While random 20-something Redditors with $500 to their name have seen 10-50x returns. 

Stocks going down is normal, sure.

What isn’t normal is stock going down after crushing analysts estimates. Stocks going down after posting record breaking revenues. That is not new for small growth stocks, but for major corporations, that is new territory. 

ETSY is a good example. It sank 10% because it got downgraded by analysts this week. Then sank another 15% today because it beat analysts forecasts... but not by enough. Two years ago, if they posted the same analyst beat numbers, they pop 10% that day.

Lots of big tech have crushed analysts estimates across the board and have seen basically no movement.

But now we are seeing crazy forward earnings already being priced in.

Then we got the Fed operating like a circus. The government putting the population in a cash fan tube. Unemployment being more profitable than most hourly paid positions in the country. 

So this market isn’t your typical, “go out in the woods and find some fruit; watch out for snakes.” It’s, “go out in the woods and find some fruit. Watch out for snakes and the thousand land mines that have been buried all over.”"

2021-05-06 22:40:38,stocks,">Stocks don't go up forever and in many cases, they may fall because the stock is going back to its ""fundamentals"".

Which lots of the stocks being posted around reddit is very very far up away from. I see lots of people hoping prices would go back up, or hoping to go higher. However when I check to see the stock they're talking about, check the financials, check the max range of the chart, then 5yr, 3yr, 1yr, 6 months, a decent number of them were already on their way down prior to 2020. Or worse, was flat until 2020. Am thinking, go up from where? It's already up there right now, it's trying to come down a bit.

Then suddenly everyone became a trader around dec and jan and propped everything up for no valid reason. I mean, there's even a deli shop somewhere in US with annual sales of $30k, but currently has a valuation of $1M because of people buying shares of the company."

Investors with around 1 year horizon will definitely be selling their growth stocks and rebalance to financials or materials stocks."
2021-05-07 04:05:38,stocks,Exactly. A stock from a solid company like Apple being largely at the same level as 5 months ago is not normal. Especially after crushing earnings expectations multiple times in a row.

The people who got into doge initially did it for a laugh, not really to make money. Musk tweeting about it caused a surge and momentum.  Making money is a bonus for the doge holders.

2021-05-06 23:33:06,stocks,I think the most compelling rationale is Apple was so drastically overvalued trading 35x earnings with an historical earnings growth of 14% annually and a historical PE of around 17x. So beating earnings is not that relevant considering Apple essentially got 5 years of stock gains in a single year. Don't be surprised if Apple trades sideways for 5+ years or drops 50%.
2021-05-07 00:16:21,stocks,"Why? Because such growth was already built into the price and the earnings projections are not aligned with market valuations. Rampant speculation is driving up multiples and even beats don't justify them because the existing valuations would need far better results than the projections, so big players are selling into the retail buying pressure. Why wouldn't they? Tesla is a great example. The current valuation implies 1,000% growth over the next 5-8 years, depending on your valuation method. Will that turn out to be correct? Maybe, but am I willing to buy in at a price that *implies* that growth? Helllll noooooooo"

But still. I guess I come off as angry because I’ve spend the last half hour reading about people accusing a individual of a crime without any evidence.

Social media has a down side. It’s easy to make semi anonymous accusations and folks who ask for evidence are not popular.

These accusation may seem harmless but I think have some unintended consequences. Congress has decided that a bunch of evil people are intentionally misleading people about things like elections, virus and climate change.

Many have said that social media should lose protections but don’t say how. The easiest way would be for Congress to say that the protections only \[corrected the negative\] count if the individual poster’s real identity is publicly available.

Thats why you cannot write a letter to the editor without them publishing your real name. They have your neck to hang.

Widespread semi anonymous baseless accusations of criminality will definitely be used to justify such legislation.

And as a result the price of the ticker is artificially inflated, making it seem like the deli is worth millions of dollars. I could be wrong but this was what I read.

2021-05-07 09:12:49,stocks,"First, I think that a small laundry might work as described but it wouldn’t scale to this level.

Second, It’s unfortunate when People misinterpret  a analytical challenge as anger or other negative emotion. I find that many times it’s the only way to save face as they lose the high ground. I am a serious person that says serious things about serious issues. That might make some people uncomfortable. That is their problem as long as I tell the truth. I don’t need to chill because some folks are uncomfortable about their publicly expressed opinions.

I may own some Ark yet You said you were 90% sure that the Arks were part of a criminal money laundering scheme. My money is at risk and you want me to chill?

It could be argued that Reddit has allowed a meme that the Arks manipulate the market and participate in money laundering. The lawyers can probably have a bunch of charts proving their losses.

The Congress and others are trying to regulate social media to protect society from representing the truth. They will end up hunting people that make libel and slander.

You claim that you don’t say stuff on Reddit that you don’t want connected to you. Great. You slandered Ms. Wood. Maybe you don’t have empathy for another in that position.

How would you feel if your real identity was known and people started to speculate about your love life and your practices on the job. They say it where your significant other and your boss regularly read. Many people are all saying the same thing.

Do you really believe your significant other or you boss would just chill? Would you chill? Maybe I’m smart enough to know that mob justice doesn’t stop until everyone is consumed.

Look if it was just you then I would be unjustified. But you are not the only one making these accusations.This isn’t about talking about a ticker it’s about a indifference to the reputation of a human being by a large group of people speaking in public.

As well as drawing a big bulls eye on Reddit for the regulators to see."

I’ve gone through a gut-wrenching portfolio allocation strategy over the last four months and bounced from low fee ETFs, to “value” stocks, and landed on big tech and feel good about it. I own Amazon, FB, Google, and Microsoft. These are some of the most profitable companies in human history - they also have a growth runway. I came to the conclusion I’d rather be sitting in Google than, say, Verizon, big pharma, Lockheed, or tobacco. 

Except for Amazon I don’t know if these are decade-long holds but they’ll get you through the next few years until anti trust ramps up. Amazon for me is a long term hold.

For me personally I hold them in the order of Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google. I don’t own the big daddy Apple. Microsoft is probably the most overvalued of them that I own on a historical PE basis. Polen Capital has a good framework that I like.

Tesla belongs nowhere in this conversation.

I will add I like the Chinese big tech stocks and they’re dirt cheap right now - own BABA and Prosus. JD is likely a good one but don’t own it."

Yet when it´s red you start to panic and you are curious what´s going on. Well, this is what you get when you buy overpriced, overhyped stocks without thinking about their fair value.

Even Repackaging winners like Tesla or Bitcoin to to prop up ETFs with more risky positions is not manipulation. Manipulation means falsehoods and concealment.

I have found that people who accuse others of crimes without evidence are not to be taken serious and are probably criminals themselves. Hopefully you have not chosen your words carefully. Maybe Ms. Woods lawyers hope the same."

“Market manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market; the most blatant of cases involve creating false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security or commodity.”

The US Securities Exchange Act defines market manipulation as ""transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradable security"".

Pump and dump
“A pump and dump scheme is generally part of a more complex grand plan of market manipulation on the targeted security. The perpetrators (usually stock promoters) convince company affiliates and large position non-affiliates to release shares into a free trading status as ""Payment"" for services for promoting the security. Instead of putting out legitimate information about a company the promoter sends out bogus e-mails (the ""Pump"") to millions of unsophisticated investors (Sometimes called ""Retail Investors"") in an attempt to drive the price of the stock and volume to higher points. After they accomplish both, the promoter sells their shares (the ""Dump"") and the stock price falls, taking all the duped investors' money with it.”

This is what basically ARK is doing. Lures retail investors and when the price is high enough they sell, then it dips they buy back and the cricle is going around and around."

2021-05-06 23:49:31,stocks,"I assume you’re an average investor because you’re posting about ark funds that (im guessing) you bought near the top because you’re now down (if not then my bad). This means you are chasing hype. An above average investor wouldn’t get caught up in these. You can have years of experience and still not outperform.

You don’t try to hedge once you start losing. That’s not what hedging is. If you wanted to hedge, you would open the shorts or options at the same time as the original purchase. Now you are also chasing it down. 

You need to near perfectly time the market in both opening and closing the shorts or you will end up losing money there too. If you actually like the stock and believe in it long term, just leave it alone. If you don’t believe in it anymore, just get rid of it. 

Hedging from the start limits both gains and losses which can also be achieved by just owning less like I said. Institutions hedge because they can’t just own less. There’s no need to try all this advanced stuff unless you enjoy it in which case go ahead. I’m just trying to be realistic."

2021-05-07 08:46:16,stocks,">	People have been calling her trash for years since she is high profile with Bitcoin and Tesla before their massive runs.

That’s exactly the problem. Her performance is largely thanks to anticipating some speculative mania rather than owning productive business.

Bitcoin and Tesla both had an important influence on the world, and for this reason it was important that they had backers, but their current value as assets is arguably very overestimated. Both are likely to end up badly.

Bitcoin has no objective value and is replaceable by any other token that gains mind share, see the Dog craziness now.
It’s only legit usefulness, beside speculation, is to help move money secretly, which can be both a blessing and curse.
Once governments start their own digital currencies they might take a stance against it and cause its value to plummet.

Tesla is in a silly bubble based on fantastical best case scenarios of world domination or something.

Here is the problem for common people:

When people start treating them as the bread and butter of their investments you get these crazy runs and crashes, because they have little fundamental value, they are not reliable producers of wealth and move largely on hopes and moods."

2021-05-07 07:33:58,stocks,"Okay, so  how is Ark a pump and dump? I don’t see how they are “basically” doing that.

Ive not seen anything but very optimistic communications from Ms. Wood or Ark. Do you have evidence of “bogus” emails?

You last sentence is not clear to me.

Lures is a word that implies a deceitful motivation. I don’t think it’s good to change the definition of lures to describe all marketing and sales. But suppose this is a criminal enterprise luring unsuspecting investors into buying the ETF.

So, the dupes buy the ETF  then you say they, presumably the ETF, sells. Sells what? If they sell the ETF itself then what have they gained? I suppose you mean that they sell some of the individual stocks. In other words, they rebalance. All funds sell off some stuff and buys new stuff, they call it rebalance. I hope we won’t call an ETF rebalance as manipulation.

It could be said that the recent sale of Tesla manipulated the price of Tesla. Well sure it can have a effect on price. They own a bunch of Tesla. But the sale was done carefully over time. No broker will allow a super large percentage sale to move the price too quickly. They spread it out and even find some evil hedge funds to keep things stable.

I suppose you mean that after they sell Tesla they buy it back? How do they make money on that? I don’t see how the cycle you describe makes money. Or improves the ETFs price at all.

Finally, if she is manipulating Tesla then it’s a crime. How come we are so smart to notice this before the authorities?"

In my opinion though, if you truly like the stock/etf and believe in it, and you think the downturn will only be a few weeks/months, just leave it alone. Yes you might get lucky and make some extra money but the percentage will be small in the long run if you truly intend to hold long term. It could also turn around tomorrow and then you start losing money on your hedges. Just really not a great idea unless you have expertise running a long/short portfolio like some hedge funds. L/S hedge funds also go neutral with different stocks, not hedging the same stock"
2021-05-06 20:13:47,stocks,"The implicit assumption here is that ARKK somehow has a very high probability of going to zero. Otherwise, why use such an extreme example? So lets assume ARKK can go to 0 in the near future. That would require all their 40+ holdings to simultaneously go to zero. 75% of ARKK holdings are large cap/mega cap tech, so if ARKK goes to zero the US tech sector has effectively ceased to exist and companies like Tesla, Square, Roku and Zoom are no longer in business.

The more likely scenario is that this is short term underperformance due to the market rotation into cyclicals and industrials, and ARKK will likely recover in the long-term. However, you can ""hedge"" short-term underperformance by selling covered calls and using the proceeds to reduce your cost basis."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Should I tax harvest? Last quarter I made roughly 30kish in capital gains through a combination of selling calls/puts and buying them as well; had to pay 10k in taxes. However I had a 40k unrealized loss which is absolutely killing me and has gotten worse. To put it into perspective, I bought 35 different small-mid cap stocks and almost all of them are -80-90% from where I bought them. I'm now at 65k unrealized losses and I'm thinking of selling literally every single stock I own except for a couple winners. Despite my massive losses, I'm still somehow ahead due to some risky bets paying off. For example, I made 30k off buying call options from (INSERT BANNED TICKER). I feel like most of my EV stocks that are massively down are due for a rebound eventually and I don't want to miss out on that. I just feel so conflicted. After calculating everything starting from 2021, I'm like 5k up off of playing with 64k. Actually, I don't even know why I wrote this or what kind of advice I'm looking for.

2021-05-06 22:57:09,stocks,I think you misunderstood how deducting losses work. You can subtract losses from your gains. If that wasnt the case no one would trade. Youre talking about losses past gains. Ive made more money than ive lost which is deducted from my gains
2021-05-06 22:56:19,stocks,I would 100% harvest enough loses to close out all of your margin. Typically tax loss harvesting is done near the end of the year but this should be done now.

2021-05-06 20:23:23,stocks,Uhhh. Well. One more thing to throw in is to avoid options....
2021-05-06 20:18:52,stocks,"Nevermind, it won't work because the securities technically will not be identical even if it's on the exact same stock because it's based on delta which will be way too low. I think it has to be .8 or higher for it to be considered identical in order to trigger a wash on an option. That was certainly a very interesting find though and got my gears turning for ideas so not all is lost."
2021-05-06 20:12:24,stocks,"So I'm still new to how a wash sale works and it's hard to find the exact answers online. So in order for it to attach to the cost basis of those OTM call options, can I just buy one option or do I have to buy enough options until it represents how many shares I sold at a loss? Also, how is this something the IRS isn't aware of, or are they aware about it, but can't do much about it? Do I have to wait until the options expire in order to permanently attach the cost basis? How do I know the cost basis doesn't transition when the option expires/sold to the shares or does the wash sale always represent a 1-1 ratio for establishing a cost basis? If there is any confusion among any of my questions, let me know and I'll try to clarify further. Anyways, thank you for this info."
2021-05-06 20:27:57,stocks,"Options has been what's saving my ass though. It's been bag holding shares that's been killing me. In fact, almost 95% of my gains is through options. So yes, I lose on most stocks I buy lmao. I disagree pretty strongly here, but I appreciate your input."
2021-05-06 20:18:27,stocks,"Yes, the option has to substantially represent the shares.  So if you have 200 shares, you need to buy two options since each call represents ownership of 100 shares.

The IRS is aware of this.  Hasn’t challenged it because it conforms to the wash sale rules.

You can resume trading the next day.  Theoretically you could do it immediately after but I recommend waiting a day so that there’s no confusion as to which asset the basis attaches to."
2021-05-06 21:14:55,stocks,Smh. You have a lot to learn.
2021-05-06 21:20:58,stocks,I'm genuinely confused as to how you are thinking. How can I know what you are thinking if you don't explain? Why do you think options are bad?
2021-05-07 00:36:04,stocks,"Options aren’t bad but shouldn’t be the backbone of your portfolio. You’re supposed to use them to hedge certain situations, adjust your risk, cap losses etc. 
the problem with relying so heavily on options is that picking stocks is hard. When you buy and sell stocks you have to correctly pick the direction of the stock. When you buy and sell options you not only have to get the direction right, but you also have to get the timeframe right. You basically turn your straight bet into a parlay and substantially lower your odds."
2021-05-07 15:34:16,stocks,"I guess I get the premise that you are aiming for. Time in the market beats timing the market. However, I think you've misunderstood the purpose of options. Options are a type of hedge when buying and are technically a much safer method to employ rather than straight up buying shares. The reason why they are safer is because you are putting less money on the line. Now, if you are doing option trading less than 6 months out and OTM, then that might be considered gambling depending on the context. If you're purchasing options based on solid fundamentals more than 6 months out then you are employing the strategy correctly. This is why you buy deep ITM call options a year to two out as the delta makes the underlying option you are purchasing basically the same security as the stock itself (since the break even point is ridiculously close with such a large time frame to accomplish that), just at a discount. Why do people sell these options? The only reasons I can think of is they think the stock is going to go down, but they don't want to cash out yet because of taxes; or maybe because they need a lot of money right now and don't want to cash out on the stock yet. It's a strategy that I've recently employed as has been performing the best consistently so far. The reason why more people don't employ this strategy is because it requires a little bit of knowledge and how much of a negative stigma is associated with options themselves. There is the possibility of losing the money forever as well if things go really wrong as with stocks, there is always a small chance of recovery, but when dealing with statistical odds, they are heavily in your favor when you do the proper research when you purchase options the correct way."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"How to pick a stock to research? 
So I am relatively new in the stock market as I am struggling with finding stocks to research and invest in. So far I have invested in a couple of blue chip stocks and a couple of ETFs. But how do I find up and coming stocks to research and DD to invest in?
Any advice is helpful thanks!"
2021-05-06 20:33:30,stocks,"The best way to do research is to look into the companies sec filings. Which is all free to see on sec.gov. 10k and 8k give the bulk of info.  Look at how their debt is structured, see if it's good debt or bad debt. If it's a company in financial trouble do they have a solid plan?  Theres also tons of content like interviews with CEOs you can try to read between the lines on. It's best to have a combo of financial information and current news. 

The larger the company the more subsidiaries they have and the more work it becomes. So it helps to start off with a smaller company even if you dont plan on investing it. Just helps to learn where the info is in the report that you really need. 

I would also do some research into the different ratios and what they mean, and also how people use them.  PE ratio can be interpreted very differently quarter to quarter or day to day. Beta can be misleading on news cycle days. All these stats have information, some of it's useful but it can also be extremely misleading if interpreted on the wrong day. Learning what they represent helps you to establish which priority order you set to the available information.  So it's not just about doing the research it's also about deciding which information is most important to you. Because there's always conflicting info or misleading stats. It's much easier, and faster, to find what you're looking for if you know what you're looking for."

In its semiannual Financial Stability Report, the central bank said that while the system overall has remained largely stable even through the Covid-19 pandemic, future dangers are rising, in particular should the aggressive run on stocks tail off.

“High asset prices in part reflect the continued low level of Treasury yields. However, valuations for some assets are elevated relative to historical norms even when using measures that account for Treasury yields,” the report states. “In this setting, asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall.”

“Vulnerabilities associated with elevated risk appetite are rising. Valuations across a range of asset classes have continued to rise from levels that were already elevated late last year,”"

2021-05-06 21:59:57,stocks,"The average EPS estimate is 4.98 (so call it 5), if the Forward PE drops to say 25 (currently 31.85) that still puts the stock at a value of ~$125.  Could it fall further, absolutely.  But AAPL is more of a darling stock than ever, especially with their increasing plans/success in foreign markets, stock buy backs, and the expected entry into the auto market.  So a bit of increase on the PE closer to peer FAANG stocks isn't too crazy.  

For sure AAPL (or any stock) shouldn't be treated as a bank account... that's just frigging crazy.  But if you're a long term holder in AAPL the current price isn't that bad IMO."

2021-05-07 08:45:42,stocks,"I wouldn't be so sure about that. Last time the Fed tried to taper rates, it caused a market upset in 2018 and that was \~80% gains ago. The Fed knows if this bubble pops, it might pop for good, because billions and billions of dollars are sitting in underfunded pension and retirement funds that can't afford a market crash and would require trillions of dollars of government intervention in equities markets, which puts us right in line with China-level fiscal policy. It's much, much more likely that the Fed will allow inflation to run very hot (possibly north of 10%) to avoid a situation where they can be blamed for the crash that will dwarf the GFC because of the easy money policy they've provided for the past decade. Japan is a bad example because their entire society is in a deflationary period. 

People say ""well inflation hasn't happened in 40 years.. so it's unlikely to ever happen"".  Apply that logic to the odds of getting into a car crash: As you spend more time spent on the road, it becomes less likely that you get into an accident? I don't think so. Also, ""past results are not indicative of future performance"". If the ""roaring 20s"" thesis plays out this summer, inflation will be rampant. If demand for the dollar falls off because of US instability, inflation could be incomprehensible. That last part is what they are trying to avoid at all costs, because it will bring this MMT experiment to its knees."

Between 2010 and late 2019 they pretty consistently traded on a PE of around 13-18

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

It's only since 2019 after the 2018 dip that they started soaring, up to 20+ and then after COVID 30+ Lets assume they meet earnings expectations which even I, an AAPL bear, think is a safe assumption - that means that if the stock price stays exactly flat for months (is that what AAPL investors want?) they'll reach the forward ratio of 25 - that's still like at least 35-40% above where they’ve normally been when the market is not in a bubble about to pop. 

Even if they smash expectations, grow into these news spaces which they're flirting which allegedly 'justify the higher PE' - today's valuation just doesn't hold up in my opinion. And people say ""well monetary police has expanded the range of acceptable earnings ratios"" but I mean the 10Y has been under 3% for a long time and interest rates were 0% for most of that 2010 - 2019 period were they traded at a PE of 15? What changed to make 30 acceptable, besides of course, a tsunami of retail investors that have piled more money into shares in the last 12 months than the many previous years combined on hype around promises and vision of “tech being the future”? 

And what happens when monetary police reverts ( or will 0% interest rates remain forever?) and interest rates start going up - now there is theoretically a contractionary force acting on the share price where even if earnings go up the share price will go down. If It's a seriously a ""long term holding"" for people buying today's price (and not a speculative gamble made by amateur investors who are buying the biggest company in the world at near its ATH because ""i like apple and their financial reports have numbers which are very big on them"") .. I just can't fathom it. There so many indicators flashing that It's got a good leg down left in it yet, even if the company itself is a ""licence to print cash""."

I've been in IT for a couple decades now, and believe it or not AAPL has been largely absent from most enterprise applications for most of it.  That's changing fast... AAPL products are now ubiquitous in almost every technology decision.  Covid & the work-from-wherever has further amplified that.  

But it's more than fair to consider how those past stock dynamics could be of influence.  I'd go a step further and say it would be negligent not to do that.  

It's simply my opinion that I'll very, very likely be happy that I bought AAPL in 2021 (even if it swings some) when my future self looks back at the investment."
2021-05-06 23:35:18,stocks,"I think you might only have a surface level understanding of how sovereign currencies work.  Don’t think of the deficit as a traditional form of debt.  Think of the federal deficit and the cumulative “national debt” as more of a score board for how much the government has spent into the economy since Alexander Hamilton convinced congress to establish the dollar as the official unit of account of the US government.  

Think of US currency as green dollars.  These green dollars are regular old money that you can exchange for goods and services.  Think of treasury bonds as yellow dollars that gain value so long as you don’t spend them.  Issuing hard currency and issuing bonds are effectively the same thing - money creation.

The only real constraint on money creation is excess inflation - which is inescapably tied to resource and labor availability.  Two things that the United States has in surplus."

2021-05-07 01:07:29,stocks,"The federal reserve does not issue currency, though this is a common misconception.  Rather the Fed issues credit to its member banks.  Only the US Department of the Treasury is empowered to issue currency.  

That treasury department has no need for tax revenues to pay its bills because it can create whatever cash it needs.  

By law, their checks do not bounce.  

Your federal tax dollars are effectively destroyed upon receipt because the treasury department’s balance sheet is literally irrelevant to its ability to spend. 

Federal taxes serve two main purposes.  First, by taking money from certain segments of the economy, congress exerts a certain amount of control on resource allocation and consumer behavior.  Second, higher taxes are deflationary because they take cash out of the money supply thus increasing demand."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Shouldn't 10 Year Bond Rates and Precious Metals Price Move in the similar direction? Price of the precious metals such as gold and silver goes up when we anticipate inflation since the value of the fiat will go down. Possessing real money will preserve our wealth.

For similar reason, when we anticipate inflation, long-year (such as 10 year) bond yield rises since holding bonds with lower rate is bag holding when inflation comes. So people sell bonds to avoid bag holding.

Sure the bond yields has risen for several months prior to recent times (recent times as in recent few weeks). However, it has either stagnated or went down a bit for the recent few weeks while gold and silver price went up for the recent few weeks.

What other factors are in play that makes the bond market to depict as if they are not anticipating inflation while making the precious metals market to depict as if they are anticipating inflation?"
2021-05-06 20:51:35,stocks,"Yes, the inverse relationship is based on time when we were on the gold standard. Rising rates meant people were selling gold. People still think this relationship exists, or at least the banks use it as an excuse to manipulate the price of gold. 

Rising rates means no one is buying bonds means central banks will print more means more inflation means gold goes up."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Wash sale clarification: I sold my whole position on merill edge but it only recorded 75% of the losses. I recently sold a position which I had purchased in multiple installments less than a month prior. I sold it for a loss, but the whole loss is not showing up on merill edge. I have since noticed this with a number of positions I have completely closed. When I called the help line, they just reiterated the wash sale rule, but it didn't resolve my question. I suppose it's possible I just don't understand the wash sale rule, but I don't think so.


Here's an example of what I am talking about: 

Day 1 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 11$

Day 2 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 10$

Day 3 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 9$

Day 4 - sell all 30 shares at 5$

Actual loss:150$

Recorded loss: ~120$ (or at least less than 150$)


Why would this be the case? Shouldn't it register as the full 15$ loss? The guy in the phone said FIFO means that the first shares would be wash saled into the ones I bought later, but then shouldn't selling the later shares net me the same loss for tax purposes? Even with the wash sale rule, selling my cost basis adjusted shares as well would mean that those would record the loss, and I'd end up with the same net loss as the difference between the purchase and sell prices. As it is, my tax losses have essentially been permanently prevented, which doesn't make any sense. Can someone help me understand? Is merill wrong, or is there some nuance I don't know?

Edit: corrected the numbers.

Also, since this seems to be a common misconception, the wash sale rule applies when you sell a stock which you bought identical shares of 30 days before or after."
2021-05-06 20:30:46,stocks,"Is your final net position in XYZ 0 shares?

Otherwise, look at the ledger and try to match up the adjustments to see if it all checks out."

“Company management concluded that the Warrants should have been accounted for as liabilities measured at fair value, with non-cash fair value adjustments recorded in earnings at each reporting period, rather than equity.”

1. Which metrics and the corresponding threshold would you use to value such high growth stock?  I understand PE doesn't make sense since many of these growth companies are not profitable.
2. Which is the most reliable and affordable paid tool for fundamental analysis and valuation? It would be a bonus if it has an analysis of the companies business, moat and stock recommendations etc. But priority would be extensive data on valuation.  I am assuming free tools are not good enough.

It's pretty heavily shorted still so I'd imagine it still has a ways to go down. I had to take out an interest rate just to short it when it hit 100 a week or so ago. It can potentially come a loooong way down. If it makes you feel any better theres a huge amount of retail interest in this, it's a really good idea and I do think their market cap is going to go bananas over the next 5mto 10 years. That being said it's probably got a ways to go still. I dont think I'd touch this personally until it went under 40 or 45 but I've also made peace with the fact that I may be missing the boat by being cheap. 

Tough decision on your part but if you really bought the top than more the half the damage is already done. So two ways to look at it.  If you're under 50 yes old I'd just consider doubling down if it really come down around the issue price.  Always a tough call to sell a position or add more later but it is a really cool idea and I think it's going to work.

When women click an image, they go ""Yay! It's Pinterest!"". Go talk to some women and you will find out why Pinterest is loved.

As for monetizing it, the great thing about Pinterest is that the people searching on Pinterest are generally searching for ideas and inspiration so unlike in other places, the ads on Pinterest are actually welcomed. Advertisers can pay to have their ads be placed as regular Pins in their desired audience's feed and relevant search results. So, for example, if someone is searching on Pinterest for fashion inspiration, when they click on the Pin of some fashion item that they like, they can be taken right to where they can purchase that fashion item from you. They can also share the Pin with other people to drive even more people to your product via a social shopping experience. This is incredibly attractive to advertisers."

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"New Investors: The average return of the stock market is 10% per year over time. 2020 was an unprecedented year. New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

Keep your head high, stay invested, let your investments compound, just don't be saddened when your returns are at or slightly below average moving forward. You're still doing better than those that don't invest at all."

2021-05-07 02:18:36,stocks,"True but don’t miss an important point, 10% is average. 

So it’s not unusual to have 3 years in a row of negative returns then the 4th year up 2% then down 3% then up 22%.

So think about this carefully - are you ok with waiting 4 years and during those 4 years - until 2025 you lose money. Then in 2026 you’re up? 

If not then the stock market is not for you. 

The whole point - think in terms of decades not weeks. But really understand what a decade means."
2021-05-07 02:26:42,stocks,You guys are making money?
2021-05-07 08:21:43,stocks,"Wait, I can’t make 500% a week for the rest of my life?  Damn, no wonder I’m down a bit now"
2021-05-07 08:26:13,stocks,"The truth is in the detail... if you invested $100 in  1998 and cashed out in 2008... 10 years.. your return would have been 7.53% or 0.66% a year.  2004 to 2014 and it would have been 123% or 5.38% a year.
Some of this is luck as much as anything."
2021-05-07 09:02:41,stocks,"Also if the market grows at a rate of 10% a year it doesn't mean if you buy on January 1 and sell on December 31st, you'll make 10% profit. You'll have to sell on highs to keep that profit or keep holding. This wasn't obvious to me when I first started."
2021-05-07 09:03:33,stocks,Whew! Good thing I’m -41%.
2021-05-06 20:19:20,stocks,Thanks for the much needed pep talk for the third time this week chief
2021-05-06 21:18:47,stocks,"I am minus 60%. A valid question though is. What if the paradigm has shifted, millions of new investors may change volume and volatility for the better in regards to gains. Surely no time in history has there been such an ease of entry into the market"
2021-05-06 23:10:18,stocks,"Lol for one, (assuming your talking about us equites) 10% is objectively incorrect. Also, to even have this conversation you need to frame it as nominal vs real. 

Well intended but your low quality post is just muddying the waters."
2021-05-07 02:33:51,stocks,10% is not the average
2021-05-06 21:11:11,stocks,"Average return is such a shit metrics.

Example why: year 1 you return 100%. Year two you lose 50%. 

Average return is 25%%, total gain is $0."
2021-05-06 20:20:56,stocks,Except when you factor in inflation then your cashing in 1-2%
2021-05-06 20:35:11,stocks,"Shit, it's only like 5% over the last 20 years"
2021-05-06 21:51:29,stocks,It's actually 7% historically.
2021-05-06 21:55:25,stocks,I’m above average. I need 18-20% a year.
2021-05-06 22:37:03,stocks,"So if I'm already up 1000%, I'm years ahead of the average return of many many years, do I take profits now and never come back?"
2021-05-06 23:07:02,stocks,"The market is about to go up a hell of a lot more as hyperinflation from reduced economic output plus running the money printer.

Expect over 100% returns for the next couple years...

They won’t adjust the CPI but you can already see the cost of some thinks like meat went up 200% and the price of houses has gone up like 30-50% in a single year...."
2021-05-07 00:24:32,stocks,"As a young investor that is also cautious, I’m inclined to agree my performance over the last 2 years is unlikely to predict that I will continue to beat the market. But it’s important to remember that we’re in a new age of investing where barriers to entry are low, and information (and, to be fair, misinformation) is plentiful.

Even if stockpicking doesn’t continue to be a good strategy, that Swiss finance institute paper that Cramer sometimes talks about seems to indicate that stock pickers on Wall Street bets have been outperforming the market significantly. I don’t think we should marry ourselves to the idea that the market will return to the way it’s operated for most of its existence because plenty of inventions have changed the way the market has operated through its history.

But ultimately, I agree that we shouldn’t marry ourselves to believing the market has changed forever either. 

Total “either it will happen, or it won’t” analysis on my part, but that’s a stock market principle. The only rule that the stock market seems to follow is... there are no rules. The stock market isn’t easy to predict, and I don’t think that future market returns are easy to predict, whether they be the S&P or whether they be stock pickers’ returns, for the future to come"
2021-05-07 01:01:52,stocks,"I think a general rule of thumb here is that if everyone and their dog is talking about it, don’t buy if"

I still made money overall, due to time in the market.  Young investors thought they can make a living off the stock market as their full time job will learn a tough lesson."

2021-05-07 10:10:31,stocks,"There's going to be MASSIVE investor washout in the next few years, but overall I think you're going to see the market itself start to evolve, for better or worse, there are just too many people getting into the game, more hivemind type investments to come, and I think we will see continued volatility as long as it continues to be this accessible.   If the market tanks or corrects hard the fallout will be insane, if wall street can come up with a way to fuck retail they'll do it, if they can't bleed us like a piggy bank, they'll try to devise new ways to fuck us in the ass. 

10% is a GREAT return if you can do it every year for a decade you're on a roll.  

I've beat 10% returns since I started in 2015, but I started really small and just bought shit I liked, and was fortunate that it was during an endlesss pump of wallstreet to the point where I've questioned if we're living in reality anymore.  

""You're still doing better than those that don't invest at all.""  I sort of disagree with this, because a lot of folks aren't investing and spreading it around, they're rolling those 1-armed bandit style - YOLO's and eating shit.  In that case you were much better just putting into savings, index fund or ROTh or something you know - even a fucking .000001% savings account.  - I do want to point out I'm not judging, I've been throwing dice for months \~ :)"

2021-05-06 23:47:44,stocks,"What is this 10% (which seems too high) based on, our biggest unprecedented and likely unsustainable bull run in history? You can also end up investing at the end of a bull run and lose your shirt as it turns into a long stretch of a bear market, you know, the one that we are due any day now. This is why x% return per year is so misleading. No matter what, at the end of the day, investing is always going to carry risk and hence there is always an element of gamble. Stop viewing the stock market as a HISA."
2021-05-06 23:49:38,stocks,"Last year didn't teach me that I could make 350% per year for 20 years. It taught me to be prepared and to take advantage of a good situation.  The reason many people did so well in 2020 was because they had Cash, or assets to invest. And they were smart enough (or bold enough) to invest during peak fear. I dont know why the market will look like in 12 months. But I know we are seeing weakness and fear in the market again. And those with Cash and balls are putting their money to work"
2021-05-06 23:53:38,stocks,minus 3% for inflation
2021-05-06 23:54:28,stocks,Also meaning returns have to revert to the average. There will be many red to low years to make it back there
2021-05-07 00:02:55,stocks,That’s the balance of what the hedge funds don’t steal. They leave you just enough to keep you interested. If the scum bag banks and hedge funds strip all the wealth out of the market the investors would make more money. System needs to be fixed.
2021-05-07 00:04:43,stocks,Well said!! The best thing that can build investment is compound interest and time. The second best thing is great stock picks. Combining those is great! Keep in mind the bet that that Warren Buffet made regarding a Hedge Fund vs index fund over a 10 year period. He bet a million dollars that am index fund would out perform a managed hedge fund and he won. Look it up for more information.

Imo in the coming decades it will potentially be more than 5x the s&p500"
2021-05-07 05:55:50,stocks,subtract inflation from the return . looks like s and p 500 is a good investment.

2021-05-07 08:33:16,stocks,"I agree That beating the market is hard, but it is not anomaly. Anomaly would imply either geniuses or luck at work.

I have not seen any evidence that a buy and hold investor can’t beat the market. There has been some research suggesting short term players like fund managers or hedge funds don’t regularly beat. But no evidence about retail investors.

I would agree that most retail investors as well as short term institutional investors cannot regularly beat the market but I would thing it trivial to put a portfolio together that in hindsight would beat the market.

So what we really say is it’s impossible to pick a basket of stocks that will, in the future beat the market long term even with rebalances and reconsiderations factored in.

Investopedia says that mutual funds didn’t really take off until the 1980s and the 1990s. If I believed that you can’t beat the market then nobody beat the market until then?

In  your example the average return is 0%. Total gain is $0.

For the average to be 50%, year two should have been +12.5%."
2021-05-06 22:19:58,stocks,"No, you compare with respect to the amount you started.

Let's say you start with $100, get to $200 at the end of the first year, end up with $100 at the end of the second year. Your gain is $0, your initial capital is $100, so your average return is still 0%. (Don't average the way did)

Also if the gain is 100% next year and -50% the year after that, your way of calculating averages will give you 25% not 50% as you mentioned (still wrong though)"

As for the hypothetical, there is no definitive answer to your question. Some people dumped their yearly fund into PLTR at $34 per share, made a 10% gain within a day or two, and have now lost -42% of their initial investment. Others invested in say Apple at $110, it shot up to 121 for a +10% gain, but if they held to now it'd be up another +6%.

2021-05-07 05:43:14,stocks,"FYI. There are preferred stock ETFs that are paying 7+%. They pay monthly or 3 months worth  quarterly so reinvesting compound more often. Also, buy on the dips, because preferred stock pays at a fixed rate meaning you can snatch up these ETFs yielding sometimes several percentage above 10%. If you do this consistently, you'll have a net basis and yield, guaranteed, and compounded more frequently than the general market at possibly a higher average return. 

P.S. I've been doing this since before the 2008 great recession successfully, so don't come at me with bullshit reasons why this can't work. It does. Just pick quality preferred ETFs and follow advice. Reinvesting monthly you get more shares paying dividends every month. 

Also, I do this as part of my portfolio, not the entire thing. I also invest a significant portion in vanguard broad index funds like VTI, VO, VOO, and VUG and other more focused ETFs on smaller scale. The remainder is money to use investing in individual stocks that I have researched thoroughly and have a gut feeling about. These individual stocks I do buy and sell on dips and peaks, etc. Very few individual companies will I hold long term.

On the flip side it is not advisable to be content with gains less than inflation because then you're losing money. People have to start somewhere and inflation is a good baseline. I would think most people should prefer beating inflation as they learn instead of dumping 100% into a penny stock because of risk/reward. Again it should be your baseline, not your end goal."

The way you're thinking about average return, more closely linked with dividend reinvested IRR, is closer to 7%. The 11% only pops up with the way you and I both apparently think are crappy ways to compute. 

Since OP is saying let's round to 10, since highest is 11... that's the metrics he is using for average.

2021-05-07 09:50:48,stocks,"Right. That's not the average he is talking about though. 11% as noted in the post, that comes from simple average of year end S&P returns, which as I said and as I standby, sucks as a metric.

I'm getting a lot of people telling me ""nono that's not how you do averages in this setting"". I AGREE, my issue is 11% is not the geometrically average but the simple average and misleading. The 7% is geometric average so OP ""meeting in the middle"" is misleading. 

Running though the formula calculations is great, but the vast amount of people reading even this sub isn't going to understand that. They do, however understand, ""11% average return"" incorrectly due to how its computed."

2021-05-07 13:02:43,stocks,"[Check here](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Fidelity#Tools_for_Boglehead-style_investing). Scroll down to International Stocks, and look at the Total International Stock Market row. For an ETF that you can use through any brokerage (check with the one you use): IXUS. If you're with Fidelity: FZILX (zero fee mutual fund). If you're with Vanguard: VTIAX (mutual fund).

Using a mutual fund from one brokerage through another can have large fees (for example, using a Vanguard mutual fund if you're with Fidelity). Keep your costs low by going with the ETF if you're not with either brokerage. Mutual funds allow automatic investments and only trade after the market closes, so they're good for set-it-and-forget-it investing, almost like a savings account.

Investing internationally can also get you the foreign tax credit on your taxes, but I think it mostly benefits large portfolios. Diversification across the globe will definitely help your portfolio though. Check the rest of the [bogleheads.org](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page) Wiki.

Looks like they do simple average of several year end performance which would be ((end of year $)-(beginning of year $))/(end of year $) if I'm understanding it right. This could match up or be misleading. Is it just to fool retail investors?

2021-05-07 05:52:30,stocks,"In general, if any of you wish to learn more about overcoming this, this issue is associated with a behavioural phenomenon called reference point bias (which you seem to already be aware of). 

Since the purchase/cost basis becomes the key piece of info for many retail investors, (since we all hate losses and love tendies) we typically place too much weight on the stock price returning/converging towards our cost basis, and ignore the opportunities presented elsewhere.

This is just a very small piece of the puzzle and should by no means dictate all of your trades, but it's a key thing for us to be aware of as small fish in a big ass pond."

2021-05-07 05:56:09,stocks,"Sunken Cost Fallacy and Opportunity cost nearly devestated my portfolio at the start of the year when I started. Bought a lot of gassed up picks like I saw on Reddit and online cause the juice was they were gonna blow. The thing is, I didn't really know or understand jack about most of them. And when the speculative bubble finally burst in February, I started seeing losses and had no idea what to make of it. It hurt but I quickly realized I had way too many positions I didn't understand well that were dragging me down and making balancing a nightmare so I begrudgingly started a long process of axing a lot of my whacky/impulse picks off and channeling the leftover money into either market ETFs or stocks I actually was convicted in and understood. And it ultimately payed off in a big way. My daily performance kept up much better with the market and the few small cap picks I kept actually helped me beat the market on a few days as they recovered. And now I have much easier time rebalancing cause it's easier for me to spot current issues with my holdings and deal with them and building my positions up is less of a headache since I have more refined pool of them and got a better idea of how big I want each to be. 

You shouldn't let go of every stock that has a down day cause all of them will. But it's key to understand why you're toughing it out. If you have a truly veritable reason to hold the position and can make a logical basis for it coming back later than definitely hang on. But if the best reason you can think of is that you don't want to take a loss/down too much to bother shuffling than you may need to seriously reassess that holding cause its opportunity cost could be costing you positions that could prove far more prosperous."

If you have two asset classes, one with 16% and another 14% expected returns, regardless of what correlation and volatility they have, can you have more than 16% portfolio return? No, unless you take leverage. If you strongly believe stocks are going to have superior return for a certain period  of time and have the risk tolerance (most people don’t, contrary to what they think), concentration is the way to wealth creation, not diversification."

Half of my gains this year are from shorting EV's and overvalued pandemic plays like Zoom and Snow.  Also, we're in a bull market like 90% of the time, just look at the 100 yr chart.  I started doing this full time in Q1 last year,  but been doing it since 2015 and profitable every year since 2017.

See if you believe they can continue revenue growth at certain levels for your time horizon, and see if you believe they can expand or maintain their profit margin (e.g. think selling software with no additional marginal cost vs producing hardware with fixed additional costs). Then estimate where their profitability will be at the end of your horizon. Do a multiple analysis as to where this would leave them, e.g. P/E vs more established peers. 

&#x200B;

E.g. if a company selling adds is valued at 60bn with only 200mm profits, estimated to get to 3bn profits in 5 years, it is hard to see them outperforming given that even with no share price appreciation their P/E would still be at a relatively high (historically) 20 in 5 years."

Mid cap: 12%
Small cap: 10%
IG bond: 4%
Treasury: 1%
Hedge fund: 10%
Private Equity: 18%
Venture Capital: 25%
Distressed debt: 12%
And so on.

When I say “wealth creation” I didn’t just mean increasing someone’s net worth, I meant, getting ahead of the mass. In the example above, concentrating in VC is THE way to wealth creation whether 70% or 100%, but of course there are immense risks involved. Having a diversified portfolio of some or all of the above will get you meaningful downside protection, but in reality most institutions have a hard time even getting 12% from all these. For the most part, diversification is to manage risk and improve relative returns (Sharpe ratio), not improve absolute returns."

However, the company's profit and operating profit margin deteriorated over the last 4 quarters? Quarterly revenues haven't grown since Q2'2020. Perhaps your growth and profitability estimates were too optimistic? 

Assuming you bought in at 8bn market cap, then that would be 13 times sales most recent TTM sales. That's higher than FB (P/S at 9) which is growing revenues by 30%, zero debt and expanding profit margins as well as optionality (multiple potential future revenue opportunities through VR, Payments, Shops etc.). To me, that's a very high price for 0% revenue growth and steady negative profitability. 

Could you perhaps share how you came to this being a better opportunity? Has something changed since you bought it? Do you expect revenues to grow in the future?

What I can't get my head around is how you'd make money buying a put (well, a covered put, anyway; I understand how you can make a lot of money shorting, even though it's risky).

Let's use GME as an example. Right now, the stock trading at $163. A $155 GME put has a premium of $0.83, so a single put contract costs $83 total. But in order to cover that put, I need to start with 100 shares of GME, valued at $16,300.

Let's say I buy the contract for $83, and the stock price drops to $150. I have the option of selling my shares at $155, but why would I ever exercise that? I'd lose $8 a share from where I started, to say nothing of the $83 I'm down for the contract itself.

Do I just sell the put contract to someone else to make back the premium? Because even if I did sell the contract and keep my shares, I've now lost $13 a share when the price fell from $163 to $150. Would selling the contract actually break me even, let alone make me money?


Are puts just supposed to be a tool for stopping your losses, instead of making money? Are you even ever supposed to exercise puts?

Any help would be appreciated!"

**Key Numbers**

Price: \~$18.54

Market Cap: $3.73B

**Description**

Genius Sports ($GENI) recently reverse merged with DMYD to become a publicly traded company. GENI provides sports data and solutions in multiple ways. Recently, they centralized all of the NCAA’s sports data and stats. This would be 1,100 universities and colleges among three divisions. As such, they were able to provide sports data for 50,000 events in their first 18 months of going live. NCAA basketball, football, volleyball, ice hockey and soccer leagues all use the Genius Sports LiveStats software. 

Furthermore, Genius provides media solutions for both sports teams and sportsbooks. For example, the Vancouver Canucks hired them to target ads to fans for special offers on tickets. This led to an 875% return on investment for the Canucks, so it’s a service they’re likely to keep using. The media department is just getting started as Genius just [doubled their revenue in that department](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/).

Most importantly and what amounts to 74% of their revenue, Genius Sports provides sports betting data in a variety of ways. First and foremost, they supply 40% of the sportsbooks with their betting lines, and this includes live betting. DraftKings, FanDuel, bet365, and many other Sportsbooks use GENI’s software and data for line setting. What this means is that it doesn’t matter which sportsbook does the best, as GENI supplies data to many of them.

Genius Sports is currently the leader in their field, and they have exclusive rights with multiple leagues. Among those are FIBA (pretty much every basketball league not in the USA), the NCAA, NFL, English Premier League, and many more. GENI actually has employees in attendance at the games to ensure they get the data in real time. Genius currently covers more than 240,000 events each year of which 110,000 are exclusive, and they have more than 650 long-term partnerships with sports leagues and sportsbooks.

Their operations were sourced from the SEC 4K below. Look specifically at pages 154-170 and 205-221 for the business and products.

[https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/)

**Sports Betting Outlook**

Sports betting hasn’t even come close to hitting its peak in the United States. In 2018, *Murphy v. NCAA* ruled that the federal government couldn’t make sports betting illegal; that decision was in violation of the 10th Amendment since those powers are not delegated to the Fed explicitly. Since then, [22 states have launched sports betting, 3 just had bills passed recently, and 22 have introduced bills](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization). That means that ***only 3 states have not attempted to legalize sports betting in some capacity*****.** Everyone has been talking about the impending legalization of marijuana and which companies will skyrocket because of that, but sports betting is already here, and no one is talking about what the plays are outside of DKNG and PENN.

Sports betting is less morally gray than marijuana to politicians, so full US legalization of sports betting is literally a couple years away. Also unlike the marijuana industry, sports data companies have already been established and operating in the legal sector for some time. There’s more to sports data than just sports betting. NFL nerds like myself can browse Football Reference for hours and look at OJ Simpson’s stats from his 2,000 yards season. Pro Football Focus has revolutionized the NFL with analytics. Genius Sports distributes stats for FIBA and has their media department.

Live betting has been seeing an increase in popularity and is actually more popular than pregame betting, especially in Europe. For this reason, it’s crucial that the data is as accurate, fast, and reliable as possible. Most of the states that legalize betting also legalize mobile betting, meaning that people can bet all day every day from their phone. In-game betting is huge and is expected to grow in the US much like it has in Europe. I’m unable to find the source, but I’ve read that roughly 60% of bets placed in Europe are live bets. Genius Sports gets a cut of each wager placed, which means the more live bets taking place means more money for GENI.

**Consistent Customers**

Genius Sports has only lost one customer in their history, and that customer ended up coming back to them. They always seem to be in the headlines for acquiring new deals. Recently they partnered with [Major League Rugby](https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/genius-sports-betting/) to be their data distributor, acquired [FanHub](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genius-sports-acquires-fanhub-leading-110000827.html) for the media solutions, and signed a deal with the NFL.

GENI has a habit of signing contracts with customers for a minimum of 4-5 years, but sometimes longer. Their deal with NCAA is for 10 years and was signed in 2018. In 2019 they signed with FIBA for 15 years. Their contracts have guaranteed minimums with escalators as well.

Most exciting and the cherry on top for Genius Sports is the aforementioned [deal with the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) to be their exclusive data distributor. The NFL dominates ratings, as Monday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, and Thursday Night Football were the [top 3 most popular series](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2019-2020-season-masked-singer-last-dance-1234612885/) according to TV ratings. Oftentimes a random Thursday Night Football game will have higher ratings than games from the NHL Finals, World Series, and NBA Finals. 

The fact of the matter is that the NFL is king when it comes to viewership, and Genius is set to capitalize. Additionally, part of the NFL deal was that the NFL would get an equity stake, so it’s in the league’s best financial interest that Genius Sports also does well financially. Making this an even sweeter deal is that GENI’s main competitor, SportRadar, was the official provider of the NFL prior to this. In other words, Genius Sports was able to steal their biggest competitor’s big fish client right when the league has finally started to fully embrace betting.

**Financials**

Financially this company has room for improvement. They have $391M in assets but $530M in liabilities. However, this is for the 2020 year, and they’ve since gained extra capital from merging with DMYD and now being publicly listed. $350M of their liabilities are preferred securities, meaning that companies with equity stakes (like the NFL) are buying those special shares for a dividend. This isn’t a huge deal because those investors believe in Genius to stay afloat and grow, otherwise they wouldn’t expect a dividend.

According to the investor presentation linked above, they should now have a debt free balance sheet upon completion of their merger with DMYD. GENI’s upcoming earnings report will be big to see if that is actually true. In 2019 they reported an EPS of -0.23. I can’t find EPS for 2020, but their EPS in Q4 2020 was -0.08, so I’d have to imagine that they did slightly worse.

They reported positive EBITDA of 8% this last year, and they’re projecting an EBITDA margin of 18% for 2021 and 29% for the 2022 fiscal years. Additionally, revenue is fast increasing, as their 2020 revenue of $149M was a [30% increase](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/) of $114M the year prior. Considering they were able to increase revenue in a year where sports practically didn’t exist for a quarter of the year, this is wildly impressive. Genius believes that a 30% CAGR is more than doable, and they expect revenue to be $190M in 2021 and $238M in 2022. DKNG won’t be profitable for a few years *at least*, but profitability is right around the corner for GENI.

It must be noted that the numbers in the above paragraph are from their investor presentation which was released ***before their deal with the NFL***. 

**Valuation**

I’m not great at valuation, but if someone else is please feel free to chime in. For what it’s worth, Simply Wall Street says that this company is priced [roughly at fair valuation](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-geni/genius-sports#valuation). Additionally, analysts have set price targets anywhere from [$25-30](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GENI/research-ratings). This is probably flawed logic, but if DraftKings is roughly $55 a share right now with a market cap of $22 billion, I gotta imagine the company that they rely on for their product is worth more than $3.73 billion. In fact, according to Niccolo de Masi, CEO of dMY Technology (the company GENI merged with to go public), DraftKings listed in their prospectus that Genius Sports going out of business is a risk factor.

**Bear Cases**

There are a handful of risk factors, and most importantly is that they have one main competitor in SportRadar. As stated earlier, Genius provides data for 40% of sportsbooks. SportRadar provides another 40% of the books with data, and the remaining 20% is split among a handful of other companies. SportRadar mainly does data for the NHL, NASCAR, and NBA (for which they have exclusive rights). 

SportRadar runs Cleaning the Glass, Sports Reference, and Stat Head, websites where you can look at stats dating back to the inception of each league (really cool stuff if you’re into that). With that being said, I believe there’s room for two companies even though they’re competitors, which is a thought that de Masi also backs. SportRadar is rumored to merge with HZON, and full disclosure I do own only a small position as it’s not actually official yet.

As with anything, the Fed could decide they don’t like it and make it illegal. I believe that to be unlikely, as sports betting provides a great amount of revenue for the State, and the government more than likely will take any extra avenue of money considering all the cash recently printed.

Financially they’re not exactly the most sound at the moment, so that risk is obviously there. A downside to their deal with the NFL is that it’s pretty damn expensive: $120M a year. Half of that will be paid through equity, so Genius is really paying $60M a year. A value investor (which I mainly try to be) would look at GENI’s balance sheet and free cash flow and say “no thanks”. 

I believe the opportunity for huge growth is so great that I can’t resist. Profitability looks like it’s around the corner. Plus, if I”m gonna sports gamble I may as well invest in what I’m losing my money in.

If you have anything to add, any questions or critique about my DD (this is my first one), I’d love to hear it. If I’m flat out wrong about something, please correct me, especially when it comes to explaining the financial stuff.

**tldr;** Sportsbooks such as DraftKings, Bet365, FanDuel and more outsource all of the sportsbooks lines.

Stock price doesn’t matter, what matters is a company roadmap and how they are executing it, and yes, they are executing it perfectly. You are looking at the company that is innovating faster than amazon, all the while gunning for AWS.
They are a whole package:  
Security with Zero Trust Suite  
Core cloud CDN and Edge compute  
SaaS network  

Fasly, their so called competitor, is nowhere near them  both in term of product portfolio and the innovation capabilities, and won’t catch-up for few years. Their main competitor are well established cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc., and  those are companies NET is going after, NET being an edge network has the advantage that these cloud providers don’t have.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,"VIAC is very undervalued in an overvalued market and just had an amazing earnings report VIAC is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping."
2021-05-06 21:41:15,stocks,"I agree that is undervalued

However, it seems the market won't value this company more than it is.

Look at their [2018-Q4 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/d50946cf-2bb8-441f-a8ad-a8e118ff44cf): Revenues: 7B, EPS: 1.43. Share price back then: $43.72

Look at their [2021-Q1 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/78a9d2e0-5f09-4f6f-b890-45b139769eff): Revenues: 7.4B, EPS: 1.42. Share price now: $38.15

So they had the same results in 2018 than on 2021 and the share price is just $5 dollars of difference.

The market is showing the same love for this company now than in 2018.

Why is this company more worth now than in 2018? The competition from Netflix and other online platforms can't be ignored.

EDIT: look at the PEG ratio fo this company.. is negative. This means the earnings of this company are not growing but shrinking (EPS growth is negative) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC/key-statistics?p=VIAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC/key-statistics?p=VIAC)"

In a sense sure, Netflix became a competitor to cable tv networks and market leader in its own segment. But I wouldn't say it was a fair competition if it was at all. It's comparing apples to oranges. Now that there are more and more streaming services it's kinda the other way around.

In the short term, sure. In the long term, we believe value determines price. The reason this happens is because deeply undervalued stocks attract money. This is exactly what is happening here, and we anticipate it will continue happening until VIAC is at a fair value.

2021-05-07 00:00:00,stocks,What's your analysis of the ark funds? I'm still inexperienced so I would appreciate any insight you all can give.  I put a third if my portfolio into the ark funds a few months ago and have taken a beating since.  Did I buy at a peak or is ark degrading? TIA
2021-05-06 22:23:32,stocks,"I'm not going to tell you to not buy ARK ETFs or stocks similar to their holdings, but they aren't just normal growth stocks. They are high-risk/high-growth.

They are stocks of companies that haven't 'made it' it at all yet, but they might be on the cusp of becoming huge. They might be turning a profit (very small) for the first time or about to. They could be huge in 10 years, but some of them will flame out.

As an investor it is important to take risks, but it is critically important to manage risks. I wouldn't ever put more than 5-10% of everything in my portfolio together into assets that risky (beyond what my S&P 500 index fund already holds in it in moderately small amounts).

Look at P/E ratios and understand them. Look at the Revenue and **Net** income/profit of the companies it holds over the the last several years.

If something has a P/E ratio of $500 or $1000+, this should signal to you that the stock price had nothing to do with how much the company made in profit this year, it has to do with how much profit investors believe the company will make in 5-6 years. This is investors getting in early, before it makes enough money to be worth the price. 

 If they continue to do well and the macro-economy stays great, it could very well make alot of money. However, on any small bump in the road with the company, their customers, or the macro-economy investors will get scared the company can't achieve enough profits in 5 years.

It is high-risk/high-reward, even if they have momentum.

If a company is profitable over long periods of time, stable, and has a P/E between $10-$35, it is a signal the investment is more stable. They are making money back for stockholders quicker. If the P/E is $15 this means for each $1 net profit they have, the stock costs $15. 

If the P/E is $500 that means for each $1 net profit they have, the stock costs $500. Not such a bargain, unless I believe they will grow so big so fast and that comes with more risk. In short their stock price isn't worth what the company is generating in revenue at this very moment. Investors are paying for future profits that haven't happened yet.

Too many new investors have been watching this long bull market for awhile, and they are only looking at past stock price gains alone. You have to realize the gain and the risk of the investment. Nothing wrong trying to get bigger gains, but balance/manage the risks."

Yes all ETFs have similar issues but it’s more pronounced here from my research.

Not against ETFs in general but with more people than ever using them I think we are probably getting incorrect valuations on several large companies but I am only convinced arkk specifically is a bubble.

2021-05-07 11:25:22,stocks,"People and culture IS data.

So not sure what you’re trying to say here. Whether the people and or culture is good or bad that will show/reflect IN the data.

Which means if she is focussing on the data, she is focusing on the people and culture.

What I can say is this I don’t always agree with everything she has to say, her prediction. But she does make some interesting arguments. Do not forget that we are entering a new era, something that will make EVERYTHING change so fast.

We went from horses and wagons, to fuel engines (airplaines, helicopters etc), to electric motors and hyper-trains. From exchanging sheep’s with tabaco to food for silver/gold, to materials for paper money and now to buy everything with digital currencies.

My take is that the industries that we so much have been used to and believe in many will vanish and new industries (innovations) will take their place. And or that these companies will rebrand themselves to fit in, which means the culture they used to have will no longer be valid/change.

So companies (some) that are in innovations are definitely going to good in the future, that is without a doubt. Look at netflix, etsy, square, tesla etc.
Which definitely makes etf’s in innovation a very attractive buy.

Ofcourse no one can predict the future, which is why we “predict” the stock market. Lol
But one thing is certain “the norm” of yesterday is not the norm of tomorrow, and Ark tends to focus on that instead of what what we are used to, which makes them very interesting etf to look at.

Are they the best etf out there? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Thats for each to make that call.

EDIT: Leadership and team can be swapped but not what the company provides. It definitely can improve things for the company, but in the end its consumers who says what that company is worth. Which will say if that company is going to succeed or not. And again all of that you can see and get in the data. Because of all of that IS data."

**Big dividend payouts show the value in unloved miners**
	
*Neil Hume MAY 5 2021*

For evidence of just how wary investors are of the world’s biggest miners, take a look at how markets are valuing the prodigious dividends from the sector.

Commodity markets might be gripped with supercycle optimism but the sector remains relatively unloved in valuation terms.

Aided by soaring raw material prices, Anglo American, BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are set to record results this year that should comfortably surpass the profits made during the last commodity bull market a decade ago. They will also spew out cash, having slashed spending on new mines and projects since the peak of the previous cycle in 2011 by as much as 50 per cent.

As such, JPMorgan reckons Rio and BHP are likely to pay the largest dividends in corporate Europe this year at almost $20bn and $18.2bn respectively. Looked at another way, JPMorgan estimates the total capital return from the Anglo Australian duo is equivalent to a dividend yield per share of about 13.5 per cent and 11.1 per cent for 2021 respectively. 

While share prices have risen sharply since the pandemic lows in March, so have commodity prices, meaning there has been no re-rating for the sector even though it will have a crucial part to play in the shift to clean energy and the post-Covid economic recovery.

At current prices the value of BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, including net debt is just 3.5 times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year, according to estimates from UBS. Likewise, Rio trades on a multiple of about 3 times, Anglo 3.6 and Glencore under 3.0. That is sharply lower than the multiple of just under 10 times for the MSCI Europe companies.

These lowly sector ratings are an increasing source of frustration for industry executives who see themselves as the major providers of the commodities — such as copper, nickel and steel — that will enable the energy transition.

Some caution on the part of investors is understandable. Mining comes with unique environmental, social and governance risks and some investors, scarred by a turn in the commodity cycle in the past, might question the sustainability of current prices.

Copper, used in everything from electric vehicles to washing machines, recently broke through $10,000 a tonne for the first time in a decade and steelmaking ingredient iron ore hit a record high above $193 a tonne.

The last time commodity prices traded at these levels was 10 years ago when super cycle exuberance was reaching fever pitch and Glencore was preparing for its blockbuster $60bn flotation on the London Stock Exchange. Then, as now, commodity markets were tight and the world was recovering from the financial crisis.

However, that period marked the top of the cycle. The LME metals index, a gauge of major metals trading in London, subsequently fell 50 per cent over the next five years and the market capitalisation of London’s five largest listed miners plunged 75 per cent.

“Looking at history does not necessarily help to predict the future, but it is a reminder that commodities/miners are cyclical and at some point the cycle will turn,” said UBS analyst Daniel Major.

However, there are reasons for thinking things are different this time. When commodity markets tanked post 2011, the cycle was already mature, with China’s rapid industrialisation already well established. This cycle is still in its infancy. The global recovery programmes that governments are putting in place today are more commodity intensive than was the case after the financial crisis.

That makes commodity markets less dependent on China. Even as Beijing reins in credit — a key fear of investors — other parts of the world should be able to take up some of the slack.

Miners are also more disciplined and focused on shareholder returns than they were 10 years ago. After a near-death experience in 2014, when the sector was left struggling to service debts piled up in the boom years, balance sheets are in much better shape.

The big miners are also more reluctant to invest in fossil fuels and other commodities in structural decline. In 2012, BHP’s capital expenditure budget was more than $20bn. In 2022 it is forecast to be $8.5bn. At the same time, they are finding it increasingly difficult to discover new projects in mining-friendly jurisdictions that they do want to develop. All of which should help keep a lid on supply and prevent the sector from shooting itself in the foot and repeating the worst mistakes of the past."

2021-05-06 21:26:02,stocks,This is much more of a response than I expected. Unfortunately my comment is not highly upvoted and many people will not ready this far down. I recommend you copypasta your response as an edit of the original post. It is worthy.

2021-05-07 08:48:46,stocks,Mmm. Because I want to pay gobs of time value.

2021-05-07 08:52:09,stocks,The metal or the drug?
2021-05-07 01:31:03,stocks,"You are right, ""rallying"" was the wrong word. Of course the stocks rose significantly since their lows in 2021. MT set a new 52week high yesterday.

What I meant to point out is: Both companies stocks are still severely undervalued as per their expected profits for the next few quarters. As the biggest vertically integrated steel makers in USA (CLF) and outside of China (MT) both will very likely benefit the most from the steel boom.

STLD and NUE will also benefit, but not to the extend of CLF and MT. In my opinion you can't go wrong with any of them."

wtf was going on there"
2021-05-07 01:40:28,stocks,"Fair. I agree they will all gain more and their size and vertical integration are competitive advantages, but those two specifically i think are very overbought right now and their fundamentals are not ideal (debt ratio and immediate growth constraints compared to sector for example). But on a 5-yr timescale you’re good on both definitely. 

TX, PKX, and to a leaser extent Vale are my non-ETF preferences right now (just bc they have more immediate runway and aren’t as runup right now, arguably).  MT of they get their house in order financially and pull back quite a bit."

2021-05-06 22:08:30,stocks,"RKT did not make any net income in 2018 and 2019. It only made a small net profit in 2020 with $197.95m out of $15.98B revenue.

This means their margins are a bit on the tight side. Mortgage companies are getting into some intense price competition right now and they just announced last quarter they had a drop in large originations. With a slim profit margin, this signals risk of them not being profitable in coming quarters.

The stock is now riskier, so the price drops. If they recover next quarter and mortgage originations pick up or their net margins improve with the fewer mortgage originations they got, their stock will go up. If it doesn't it could go down further."

He literally wrote complete bullshit misinformation twice and you indulged in it. RKT doesn't specialize in sub-prime loans, they didn't even dabble in them back in 2008. Also ""empty offices, business shutting down and only kept afloat by government spending""? They have 2.8B cash on hand and had one of their highest volume quarters just now... In their ER Call they mentioned lower margins helped to increase volume by 10%. They're in a growth phase and gaining market share."

Its ok to feel like you got fucked, you did if you bought into the market this year for tech and growth. But now is a great time to load up on it and average down on your initial buys otherwise you will be red for awhile. Think of this as black friday deals

Some toddler being eaten by a peloton was not a valid reason for PTON to sell off like it did yesterday. Its a good company that had great earnings so that was a golden opportunity you needed to pounce on.

ETSY is being hammered despite good earnings, buy it. ARKK has been down 30% for 3 months straight, maybe buy it idk"

Chose to pull out a lot of my money last March thinking everything would tank (also had some personal issues that made me want to really protect my money).  Several people told me to hold tight and I didn't listen.  I look at some stocks that I had today and want to vomit at what I lost.  They were companies I bought low and believed in.  Ride it out if you really see a future for the investment.

2021-05-07 03:26:59,stocks,"Whoa whoa whoa, which tech stocks are down 50%?"
2021-05-07 14:58:07,stocks,"Have a plan BEFORE investment and stick to it. That gets rid of the emotional portion.

My own strategy is to buy stocks that have good longer term trend lines (months to year) and stick with them until they break their those support lines. This does mean one has to pay attention on a daily basis to what's going on. (Not that one is trading daily - just make sure one is watching.) And that there needs a stable of other possible candidate stocks that are being watching closely. I.e. getting better returns requires doing more work. Duh.

I know some prefer the buy-and-hold-no-matter-what. But I see no reason to follow a stock down when there are other stocks that are doing well. Of course you always have the risk of buying at the top. But holding stocks has the risk of holding underperforming stocks that may take years to come back. Not good for the portfolio performance."
2021-05-06 20:00:02,stocks,which stocks are down?  i want to buy in.
2021-05-06 20:03:50,stocks,At first I felt like betting on shorting funds was like betting on craps and no one wants to be that guy. Now I’m like why am I only watching LABD I should own this shit.

When I first started invested in 2014 I remember the sinking feeling of “Dammit, everything is down, my portfolio is worth 20% less than when I started.”

I learned to put my phone down, stop looking every day at certain assets and just continued to buy on low days. By the end of 2016, my portfolio was up 30% from the beginning."
2021-05-06 21:15:32,stocks,"Well, now you know why there's advice to invest somewhat gradually, such as 20% of your funds at a time, to limit the risk that you're investing at exactly the wrong time. Of course, it also ensures that you not investing at exactly the right time either.

If you're investing in individual stocks, you don't really know whether you've made a good or bad choice until a year goes by. I put some money together into large wind turbine and solar component vendors, and they did a nice pop immediately on investing, but the performance has degraded as other investors worry about the effects of increased cost of capital. I'll still give it year for the assumptions to grind out into reality."

Take a look at information about stock “candle patterns” to try to understand if you should get out of (sell at a loss) potentially bad stocks. This is essentially taking a “stop loss” position. 4. Do NOT risk more than you can afford. Look carefully at your financial position and act accordingly. This includes taking out money and walking away BUT please seek professional advice before you do 5. Learn what due diligence means, how it is accomplished, and do it for ANY stock you have or are thinking of getting. 6. Don’t YOLO on one stock but spread your investments across both industry types (called verticals) and companies to reduce any single stock burning you. 7. Avoid “bag carrying” the wrong stock. So, if you think, based on due diligence, a stock will recover that might make you lean towards keeping it. You might sell at a loss to put the remaining funds into a stock that will grow and eventually cover that loss. 8. Think macro - years, not micro - days/weeks/months, if you do not have the skill to day trade (which is extremely risky for new investors) 9. Get advice on how & when losses could count as capital losses that balance against capital gains to benefit from net losses at some point 10. You work hard for your money, respect that by taking your time and learning about investing before you buy anything else 
Good luck, wish you all the best!"
2021-05-06 22:43:28,stocks,"I also got into investing for the first time in February. All of my current stocks are down but I’ve made money on crypto and am going big on crypto.

At first my biggest problem was only thinking about money. I didn’t care what the company was, only if it would go up. That was a huge mistake. Now I look for the next tesla or Amazon, what has the potential to go up 20x in the future? Where I can get in over time and do well. 

My second mistake was exactly as you described: I bought some things at the worst possible price. I am lucky that I started small and didn’t lose bad. Now I’m losing some but plan to hold.

I did make gains and sold some at a profit but it didn’t cover my red sales yet. Crypto has covered my red sales and brought me to a profit overall. 

I bet big on ARKX for my first long term etf hold. Hoping to triple my investment at minimum in 3-5 years. I’m also starting a position on ARKF. Some say CW got lucky but I disagree. 

Best lesson is this: this investing is for your future. Once it pays off you’re basically set for life unless you need to be rich. If you’re comfortable living cheap it can really work out for you in the long run. You can also get rich too, but people had to wait 10 years for Amazon and tesla to make them rich. You have to have that mindset of waiting for 6 months - 10 years on any stock you buy unless it gets lucky early and you’re happy to sell."
2021-05-06 22:45:25,stocks,Listen to what you said. You bought when everything was up 50%. Youre not supposed to buy at the top. You buy at the bottom. You should have bought after your friends all lost money. Not after they made money. Take this loss as a lesson to never follow the trends.

2021-05-06 23:26:29,stocks,"Not sure what kind of Capital you’re working with here but if you go back and still believe in your thesis for the companies you invested in then you could try to look at resistance levels and set small buy limit orders around them to bring your cost basis down enough to where you can collect premium on covered calls with a strike price above your cost basis. 

I’ve done that for all of my tech stocks that are down big (CRSR, AMD, PLTR) and was able to cut 30-35% losses into 10-15% which I was able to recover through premium. 

I also did this for BlackBerry as a way to get out of bag holding. Luckily I’d sold a decent number of contracts already before the big IV crush so my cost basis was already pretty low and I was able to get out without a loss recently. I wouldn’t recommend this approach tbh and I’m sure people will call me stupid for doing this but it did work for me.

If you don't have alot of money to invest, find some small cap stocks to invest in (from 1-10 dollars) you can make more with less money - profit $1 per share works out the same way if a stock share costs $1.00 or $80.00, and you can make much more if you can buy more.

2021-05-06 20:15:32,stocks,"Just ride it out. After 15 years of learning loosing and winning some, the best lessons I've learned are about being patient and riding out the dips. They happen every year. Sometimes more frequently and sometime the dips are deeper than others. Here's two of the most important things things I've learned :

1) Don't invest all the cash you have in your brokerage account. Save some for the yearly dips. I actually learned this from watching what Warren Buffett DOES and not listening to what he says (he tells people to keep buying at any price because the it all averages out in the end). But, Buffett actually has reserves to buy big when the market is low. And he spends big in the dips. 

2) Don't buy fads and meme stocks. Now, I know a few people made some serious money but a lot who jumped on wagon late got/are getting stuck holding massively overpriced stocks.

Buy what you know and buy companies you like and use. That's really how a lot of the GME profits were realized (by people who loved the store and wanted to buy a piece of it just for fun). 

Pick some of those stocks and do your research to find out which ones are the best. Why? Because you rarely get rich in a week or a month of investing. It often takes years for a stock to pay off.

One example: I bought PLUG at $2.50 in 2019 or so (maybe even before that?). I held it and added some here and there because I believed in the company and the product. I sold it at $60 a few months ago. Years of hope and patience paid off. But I had to hold on and ride out some big market dips in order to get to the payoff."

I see people mention some ETFs as stocks, and that is a dangerous misnomer.  Some ETFs are structured in a way that can have you lose money quickly, like UVXY.  These are meant as hedge plays and short term.  If you don’t understand the instrument, then don’t buy it. Good luck!"
2021-05-06 22:02:52,stocks,">to lower my cost

You didn't lower your cost, you raised it.  You bought, say, 6 for $600 and then another 12 for $500.  Your cost went from $600 to $1100. Nobody's giving you a refund on your initial $600.  There is no cost reduction. It was and always will be $600.  When you go to sell 6, the IRS is going to make you specify which 6 those are, the $600 lot or the $500 lot.

There is NO such thing as lowering your cost or your cost basis."

It can't be understated how key it is buy things you like/understand. Even when picking out hedges.

I had the exact opposite advice ""don't be afraid of investing in a company you hate because you probably hate them for business practices that make them wealthy"". I think the deeper truth is that customer service is a factor in long term viability, especially for younger companies (e.g. young Amazon had the best customer service ever). As they grow they get away with worse customer service because people have formed habits around buying from them, and their lack of customer service either makes them wealthy or gives them a competitive advantage by allowing them to price cheaper. This is also why I think it's very risky for Tesla to already have such poor customer service, they definitely think that price is the end-all factor to whether they succeed or not, but a car is not something you want to bring into the shop 2 weeks after you buy it, or every few months for the same problem."

This. With all the cheap paper on the street, market will stay inflated for quite some time. Still, lots of fear out there, so trading sideways in this volatile market means some  channels are going to be 10-20% wide, quarter to quarter. But,  I can't imagine we'll see anything resembling a drastic and protracted downtrend on a longer timeline. Barring some other once in a lifetime event, March 2020 isn't happening again, anytime soon. Until rates go up significantly, we'll keep on seeing new highs, with lots of scary dips along the way.

If you call a rep to discuss repairs, their go-to policy is to convince you to just buy a new item. 

That isn't an argument against the quality of Apple products though. In general, they have pretty good build quality (although 2018 MacBooks with their butterfly keyboards would beg to differ, and unfortunately I have one of these).

Furthermore, their shitty policies encourage other companies to do the same. It seems that Apple sets the bar for what is acceptable (removing headphone jack, not shipping chargers, etc), and since consumers are enamoured with their products, they accept this change. This in turn emboldens everyone else to do the same, which normally would have gotten them burnt, but since Apple normalized it they remain unscathed.

Also, your Dell/MSI laptops were probably significantly cheaper. You're paying a premium to have higher quality products, which is a fair trade. Paying a premium to own less of the physical thing you just bought (software blocks), and then defending the company that does that is just shooting yourself in the foot.

Sensibly designed ETF’s are safer than individual picks due to diversification. However, an ETF entirely composed of speculative growth plays that necessitate best-case-scenario outcomes to justify their price is just as bad. 

I also don’t like their recent trading behavior of buying new IPO’s like coinbase and roblox. It feels like they have absolutely no sense of risk management. 

Even I was a bit mystified by their run up until they released their recent forecast of Tesla. Their bear/bull scenarios are insanely optimistic and I have a suspicion not even Elon Musk himself is as bullish as ARK is over Tesla."

“Buy ARK ETFs, they’re super reliable. Way better than any index fund. Cathie is a genius. Literally can’t go tits up.”

So I bought some ARKK at what turned out to be the peak. Then the correction hit. It didn’t take long before I realized the fund was run by a WSB-esque maniac with no concept of risk management. It was too much for me so I got out with only a few hundred dollars in losses. Many were not as lucky.

When growth comes back into favor again Cathie is going to blow everyone’s socks off. But who knows when that will be."

If you're looking for a stock that went through a scandal of some kind to maybe study, I actually think Chipotle, might be the perfect example. I don't know how long you've followed stocks lol, but in the mid 2010s, Chipotle had a massive E-Coli situation that think took the stock from around $750 to around $300, however I think Peloton can fix the safety of its bikes faster than Chipotle can fix a food-bourn plague.

Do you have any arguments to go with that seemingly arbitrary cutoff point for government interference?

>If someone has to work more than 40 hours per week to survive they should work more than 40 hours per week. 

Why exactly? The point of life is not to make money  or to barely survive while working 24/7. Its to have a nice life. And the point of society is to bond together so we can all be better off together. Having to work 80 hour weeks just to barely survive is a dystopia not a society.

>It's not my job to subsidize other people's lack of skills with my taxes. 

Increasing minimum wage does not take your tax money so you are not subsidizing anything. In fact the opposite is true, people that are making minimum wage, need tax paid medicaid and food stamps to stay alive.

Meanwhile, large corporations are laughing all the way to the bank.

> Nobody is starving to death in the US so clearly people are getting by 

Not starving is the bare minimum of survival. Not what I mean with getting by.

> I look at other countries and I see poorer countries that don't innovate at all 

Hate to break it to you, but the USA is not the most innovative country in the world. Its just really big, so it just looks like a lot of stuff is coming from there. Its not in the top 10 countries of [Nobel prize winners per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Nobel_laureates_per_capita) and not at the top of the [innovation index either.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/world-most-innovative-economies/)

>and couldn't defend themselves if Russia or China decided to invade. I see countries that are subsidized by the US military and US innovation. 

No single country can defend against Russia no, again because they are small. But the whole of Europe or the EU can easily. 

> We can't eliminate poverty. It's not possible 

Maybe not, but we can decrease it substantially with some relatively easy measures.

> Many people who make good money are stressed about work or their kids. 

The work life balance is quite bad in the USA compared to other western countries. It can be better, but you just dont want to for some reason.

> If someone produces $10 of value an hour, and they must be paid $15 an hour nobody will hire them 

Yes exactly. Thats the point. Let those jobs die the death they deserve so they can be replaced by jobs that are actually worth the effort. If we replace 70 hours/week pissing in a bottle warehouse worker jobs, with 40 hours/week assembly of warehouse sorting robotics job. Everybody involved is better off. 

We easily produce the surplus to have the whole country only work 10 hours a week and still manage to have house and feed everybody.  So 40 should be easily doable. We just have to want it.

>  Giving people welfare does not help them. 

I agree, so give them a salary high enough so they dont need welfare or give them the means to get qualified for said job.

> There are need based scholarships and grants for poor people 

Thats great. Why not expand that to everyone.

> People should pay for their own insurance. Society shouldn't be paying for it. 

Why not? Health is a basic human right just like security is. Why pay for the one and not the other.

> Only the rich pay taxes. The top 20% pays 87% of the income taxes 

The poor still pay payroll tax and sales tax.

> People's rights aren't up for a vote 

I agree, and healthcare and shelter are human rights.

Being rich isnt.

> Socialized healthcare is crap. It stops innovation and creates long wait times.  

The UK's socialized healthcare is slow-ish true. But the locals actually do love it. The majority of western countries have socialized healthcare which work way better and have no delays. Better than the USA and certainly better than the UK. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_quality\_of\_healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare)

And this is with it being cheaper, 100% available and without perverse incentives to over medicate or over treat.

> Other countries have poverty too. Ending poverty is not a problem for the government to solve 

Its up to a society to decide about themselves if they want to solve poverty amongst themselves. Government is just a tool. At least that is what it is in actual full democracies.

Maybe thats where our disagreement lies, because you are right, I would trust the US government with anything either. But that has more to do with the broken 2 party system, heavy bi-partizanship, and corruption than capita-socialist ideas being bad."
