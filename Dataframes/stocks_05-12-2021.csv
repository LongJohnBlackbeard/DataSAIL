2021-05-12 19:47:04,stocks,"Honestly Tesla needs to get its stuff together. I agree that the resources required for crypto mining is a consideration. I agree that it is a major issue. However, they should have thought of that initially. It‚Äôs not like the process of mining crypto has become more of an issue since they decided to accept crypto. Making decisions like this appear knee jerk and does not instill a ton of confidence in their business practices."
2021-05-12 19:58:25,stocks,">We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use [less than 1pc] of Bitcoin‚Äôs energy [per] transaction.‚Äù

This is the real uppercut to BTC.  As TSLA was a pioneer/market-maker for the legitimization of BTC, to come out and basically blacklist for environmental reasons is huge.  

At a minimum it will slow down adoption by industry leaders, but could also cause a snowball-effect abandonment of BTC.  

The spotlight on BTC as hackers #1 payment choice in the pipeline shutdown can't be helping either.  

I could see a lot of money exiting BTC in favor of those more 'energy efficient' cryptos."
2021-05-12 19:27:55,stocks,doubt fossil fuels is the reason why. maybe PR stunt. i have nothing useful to contribute

Perhaps wasting energy is the only way enforce double spend protection.

There's nothing stopping him from putting c ryp to mining assets in orbit where energy is ""free"".  He owns the rockets and the solar panel making company.  Hell, he could even use those mining assets to shade the earth to mitigate global climate change (use bitcon to save the planet, news at 11).

How much orbital lift and solar cell efficiency would he need to achieve 51%?"
2021-05-12 19:50:06,stocks,"100% agree.

Elon is erratic and if his public perception turns sour, it will not be a net neutral for TSLA."
2021-05-12 19:30:47,stocks,"I don't think so.

He's been at wits end with his board and the SEC. He's been sued before and they have some oversight into his tweets.

In addition, the CFO said they mostly bought coin because it was the best option for their excess cash - despite the fact they could have done a stock buyback."
2021-05-12 19:43:17,stocks,"Probably not worth it.

TSLA was considered huge catalyst back when it was in the 30ks. 

Everything is still tied to that coin, and it's already probably in a bubble. This could cause a downtrend for that market. 

Last time it was hacks and regulation talk. His drastically change in stance makes you wonder, why."

2021-05-12 19:53:08,stocks,"Highly cynical reasons institutional interest is there should worry anyone holding it.

On the light end of the cynicism:  the stock market is over valued and holding it as 1% of a portfolio will level things out when the big crash happens.

On the heavy end of the cynicism:  the US dollar will collapse and holding it as 1% of the portfolio will provide a life raft. 

In the immortal falsetto words of John J. Travolta:  Ah ah ah ah stayin alive stayin alive."
2021-05-12 19:35:20,stocks,"I mean, prior to this year he sort of neutral on it.

Tesla/Elon has a lot of hype coming from his followers. If he ends up being the cause for loss, people might think twice before spending money with his company."
2021-05-12 19:56:04,stocks,"Institutions didn't stop the dot com bubble, nor did it stop any stock from falling. Institutional support is not a reason for something not to crash.

Furthermore, institutions moved into that space not because of need but because of bonds. Even 1t is relatively small to firms, banks, etc. It was their hedge against inflation."

2021-05-12 19:21:16,stocks,"It happened, now I know. The issue is can they take me to the court after collection and defend for margin abuse or due to covid and lockdown not giving me a chance to pay back same day before transfer to CAD"
2021-05-12 18:55:41,stocks,"Have you seen how much they want to dilute the float in the upcoming shareholder meeting? Seems wild given that they VERY recently received that $125m cash/say they have enough cash for the next 4 years of operation. Couldn't really find a logical argument for needing to dilute so badly. 

Otherwise think the company is promising, have 200 shares and a few $4 C's for later this year."
2021-05-12 19:07:01,stocks,it's just an option they have on the table. whether they execute it or not is anyone's guess. i speculate it was just insurance in the event the eli lilly deal fell through. raul even said in a prior meeting that they are well capitalized after the deal and before that dean didn't seem to think they had any need for further dilution. he even talked about scaling back if it came to that.
2021-05-12 19:13:28,stocks,"I hear this argument but I am yet to have a company I own NOT go ahead with it, even after saying it was 'an option for the future.'

If it isn't necessary now, and won't be for years, why don't we talk about the issue closer to when it actually becomes relevant...?

Either way I hope you're right but again, I was pretty disappointed reading through the material they sent me about the meeting."

2021-05-12 18:46:53,stocks,"Ideally with a margin account, at least 30-40% of buying power should not be touched and when it gets to that level, stop opening new positions that could cause it to go lower.

2021-05-12 18:37:08,stocks,"Of course traders and hedge funds know this. With these huge positions, you are getting margin called like crazy. You just have to hold a couple days and not get greedy. Have your risk and reward set out."
2021-05-12 18:39:30,stocks,"This is why I stopped working with margin, temporarily."
2021-05-12 18:53:55,stocks,let's say you have 200k equity and using 100k margin; 300k total equity. Is your margin percentage 50% or 33%?  What is the general rule to keep it under 30? Even a big crash you would still be good right?
2021-05-12 19:22:57,stocks,"If T margin, 300k is fully invested with 50%. So leaving 30% buying power would be about 210K invested. That gives some room for adjustment/ closing out losing trades etc assuming some options trades are included. 

For a portfolio margin, it gets more complicated as the margin requirement gets significantly larger as the stock price drops. So keeping more buying power untouched would be ideal. 

I personally trade primarily opinions so it could be little different for people who only trade stocks."
2021-05-12 18:09:06,stocks,"We were on a solid bull run for just over 4 years, I know very few people who lost money in the past 4 years. We also have this fuel hack that happened. Market corrections are healthy, I would be worried if it didnt drop."

Many genuienly big cap, good companies (strong guidance, free cashflow, profitability, debt ratio, etc) are already down 20-25% from ATH ($TSM, $PYPL, etc)

Other growths like $TDOC and $BYND are down 50%+.

I don't understand how much more punishment these need to receive for a reversal to start taking place.

And what shall we do, buy bonds from a historially indebted US Treasury?

I feel like these inflation news are priced in now, and actually promising that the US economy is not totally fucked. Imagine if we got disinflation. That would be a huge issue.

If we drop another 10% I am buying all the way down, in my humble opinion, I feel like companies like Apple will keep killing it."

2021-05-12 18:38:02,stocks,Rising interest has much further reaching impacts than the stock market. The OP knows this too but I want to add to the economic impacts of why the economy could slow and growth would go out of style and value (think dividends) will be in vogue. Go grab a mortgage calculator and finance a house at 10% interest.  Or a car...  or anything really.  Think of all the stuff that today gets bought on credit.   In the case of the mortgage the market could freeze up.  In the case of the car people get crowded out of buying and can‚Äôt afford the payment so they dont trade.  Or car companies raise the price to subsidize a higher buy rate to get to zero percent interest.  But people can‚Äôt trade every year because they are up side down forever. Lots of businesses could come to a screeching halt.  When that happens I‚Äôll bet you both growth and value get revalued.  Growth takes the brunt of it.  But value comes down too. Just not as far since it wasn‚Äôt as out of line. At 25x earnings on the markets I don‚Äôt see how we can avoid a major correction to get back to a historical PE ratio.  The forecast calls for PAIN!

2021-05-12 19:25:44,stocks,">Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%.

I understand that interest rates set by the fed determine the cost of lending between banks. I guess because there's some rule that requires banks to obey that minimum rate. But why does this affect ""my deposit"" too? The bank could pay me the rate as well, as I am a lender lending my deposit, but wouldnt that be just out of courtesy? What keeps a bank from just not paying me those 5%?"

2021-05-12 19:53:17,stocks,"Haha exactly.  I‚Äôm not sure if their comment was serious or not.  It‚Äôs the exact same fear.

Inflation means that the Fed doesn‚Äôt get to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù when they raise rates.  They‚Äôd have to play defence eventually or risk inflationary pressures running away a bit.  Thus they will be raising rates sooner, and perhaps more rapidly.

Again, this could be a much more supply constraint driven inflation, but it‚Äôs still a risk."

Their true goal is to keep interest rates low.

The main way that the¬†Fed¬†influences interest rates is by¬†buying¬†and selling government¬†bonds. ... When¬†Fed¬†policymakers decide they want to lower interest rates, the¬†Fed buys¬†government¬†bonds. This¬†purchase¬†increases the price of¬†bonds¬†and lowers the interest rate on these¬†bonds.

2021-05-12 16:33:27,stocks,I had the same issue with TD.  One guy in a group said his deposit was ready to use next day and my cash account took a week for the payment to clear.  Guessing it‚Äôs a difference in account types - cash versus margin.

Trades take 2-3 days to settle. If you hold a position for longer than a business day, upon selling, the proceeds plus any gains or minus any losses will be made available for you to move into another stock. 

Hold it less than a business day, and the cash will have to settle."
2021-05-12 16:39:38,stocks,"I think there's multiple factors. The bank you use (I've been told Credit Unions are sometimes quicker with processing), and possibly the amount of withdraws and deposits TD or your Bank has going on at the moment. 

I've no experience with Margin trading but my Cash account deposits are always all over the place: between a few hours or 3 days max before the amount is actually ""cleared "". I also use a popular bank so I think my times are around the average for most Cash accounts."
2021-05-12 17:19:04,stocks,"
TLDR: SEC rules dictate percentage of funds that platforms must maintain to cover trades, platforms do not process the trades themselves, and it‚Äôs up to whatever clearing house the platform uses, type of trade, time of trade and other aspects like volume to determine when funds are available...normally two full business days.

It has to do with the clearing house rules, regulations, volume of trades, etc.  Platforms like Robinhood, Webull, and others don‚Äôt process the funds themselves, everything goes through a clearing house.  That process normally takes two business days to complete but can be faster depending on when you compete the action.  The type of action also may have different rules as to when the funds are available ie selling an option vs selling a stock, depending on the trading platform you use.  Each platform has their rules clearly listed somewhere in app.  

Other things that could mess with time funds are available is volume.  Part of the clearing house rules dictated by the SEC state that the trading platform has to maintain a certain percentage of funds per trade.  As an example, Robinhood and other apps had to shut down trading on GME and other highly volatile stocks when the volume exceeded the amount of funds they actually had to cover the trades. Those trades were happening so quickly, that the clearing house did not have time to process them fast enough to maintain whatever balance needed to complete the actions.  Of course, there is also the thing that Robinhoods clearing house also held a large short position in GME so the whole thing looks fishy as hell, but technically, that is why they had to shut down."

Seriously though, probably my biggest mistake in my investing career has not been holding onto stocks long enough. People like to dream and fantasize, look back, and dream like oh, if I held through here I'd have ""x"" amount of dollars. Don't be that person.

Markets always correct, and this year was atypical. I would say prior to this year, I have never seen so much optimism across all markets. People just have the idea that this is how the rich got rich. The truth is you should focus on making money outside of the market to add to your investments. A 10k loss is huge if you make 20k a year, but for someone who makes 100k a year, it's relatively not as much.

Social media, reddit, etc. are just passing the idea that this is how you get rich from 0 to 1m. The truth is a lot of these people are selling classes, making ad rev, or pumping some random BS shit. I have said this in many posts, people take their investments too hard. I've heard people say AAPL is gonna go down, but I have never taken it offensively. I swear if you say certain assets will go down, you are gonna get a death threat."

2021-05-12 17:04:05,stocks,"This might not be popular here, but start watching sectors. One sector might get totally destroyed while the overall market is crushing it. Get into those sectors. 

For instance, I bought a bunch of oil stocks back in October because I felt the broader market was way too frothy and I saw traffic coming back in a major way and thought oil was way oversold. My portfolio was up most of today and closed just barely down. I currently have a big position in XOM and VLO and each has over an 8% dividend yield from where I bought them. Even if they don't move up another nickel for 5 years, I'm content with where I got in. 

There are sector SPYDERS that you can use for this strategy. XLE for oil, XLF for financials, XLU for utilities and several others. You have to watch the news. Wait for people to hate, I mean absolutely HATE, a sector. Then you buy it. These sector SPYDERS cover a whole bunch of economically foundational industries that aren't going away in the blink of an eye and there is almost always some sector that is majorly out of favor. 

You'll go red sometimes. For perspective, the NASDAQ kissed 5,000 in spring of 2000. It had doubled in a year. It was up from 1500 to 5000 in something like 18 months and then quickly drilled to sub 2000 and even sub 1500 by 2002. In 2009 it was back down to like 1200 or 1300 and since then it has been on a 10x run. It took 15 years to peak at 5k and get to 5k again. 

The absolute key is to dollar cost average in and stick with it for years and years. $100 a week or whatever. You might have bought a top and it might drill and not recover for 10 years. But if you keep throwing money in regularly, you'll be buying when it isn't the top."

At this point I can just hold on and ride the roller coaster. If I lose it, were full time rv‚Äôrs, everything but the camper is paid for, and I make enough money from work to pay the bills, and if the economy tanks I can always go back to trucking.

Yeah. The market goes up and down. Since the 70s there have probably been at least 5 major crashes I've lived through. There was a crash in the mid 1980s, I think 1987, and that was when I learned that crashes are temporary and if you have the funds to buy into them. It was a valuable lesson. 

One stock I got in on at $1.99 PLUG dropped to $0.92. I doubled down on that stock. Now look where it was earlier this year. I'm not a seller and do not time the market so I held in there. I think it will still do well. But it is a good example of how the market works.   There can be some life changing gains over time. Maybe even early retirement."

Eventually you'll be worth $100k, and market fluctuations aren't going to mean nearly as much.

If it still bothers you, you can stick with dividend aristocrats, so you'll at least have the comfort of getting paid regardless of market direction. I'd also encourage you to look into low beta strategies. Studies back them out performing over long time frames, and they won't dip nearly as hard.

Here's advice. Buy only at the bottom and don't keep adding more while it has gone up already by a lot. If you want to add more while the stock has already made a big run, then sell those stocks you bought high for profit when it goes up more.

2021-05-12 15:27:39,stocks,"generally, as oil prices go up, oil companies will profit more. uso is comprised of oil futures so as oil futures go up, so will uso. the current oil boom is due to increased demand for summer/reopening and decreased supply due to covid. 

ironically, the biden administration will be good for oil stocks. they are against increasing the supply of oil which will in turn increase the price of oil."
2021-05-12 18:56:56,stocks,"The whole story probably won't fit into a comment, but here you go:

There are upstream, midstream and downstream plays.

Upstream are the companies who extract the unrefined oil and own the reserves (shell, BP, Chevron, Exxon, etc.).  Midstream are the pipeline guys.  Most midstream companies (Kinder Morgan, etc.) are undervalued at the moment, but they are also mostly structured as Master Limited Partnerships.  Great long term dividends but unless you are investing enough to use an accountant, you might want to stay away from the additional tax paperwork or put it in a Roth IRA where the taxes don't matter.  Downstream is the refiners (Valero) and the end product (gasoline) sales (Exxon, Chevron again).  

'Super majors' in this category are companies with all their fingers in all the pies.  While you may think these are profitable investments no matter the price, they actually suffer quite a bit if the oil per barrel price gets too low (even though they can technically sell a bit more gasoline); they have to shut down fields and it's really expensive and can't be restarted at a whim.  They've poured billions into finding and extracting, refining crude oil but certain oil fields were acquired several years ago with the anticipation of higher prices (back when oil was +$100 per barrel) so there are massive legacy costs involved - essentially, they overpaid for the reserves given what the cost per barrel is today.  Not all crude can be extracted or refined the same way - crude from Saudi is a light, sweet product that is easy to extract and refine, crude from Alberta, Canada is much heavier, harvested from tar sands and much more expensive to refine.  You can't send one kind of crude to another plant without a heavy, multi-billion dollar plant revamp, they have different processes, so you're locked into which plants and and pipelines you can use (also, there are contracts, etc.)

There is a whole ecosystem of companies who also serve the industry.  Like Fluor, which engineers the large plants.  Ship tanker and trucking companies that move the final product.  Steel companies that benefit from the construction of plants.  Heavy haul companies like Mammoet.   

Then there are the chemical and gasoline plays.  If the cost per barrel goes up, jet fuel costs more and airline stocks take a dive.  If the cost per barrel goes down, chemical and plastics manufacturers (Dow/Dupont, BASF) will do better because their raw material costs go down.  

All of this isn't even touching LNG (liquified natural gas)."
2021-05-12 16:17:50,stocks,"Supermajors and pipeline/service companies (FTI, SLB, ET, ETRN) look undervalued. If you are concerned about the climate attitudes of these companies, european oil majors like BP and Shell are making concerted efforts to decarbonize their businesses."
2021-05-12 16:00:09,stocks," None of my Oil Holdings bloomed from the recent Biden‚Äôs political disaster that lead to this catastrophe for the American People on the East Coast.  That said it‚Äôs early in the game.  I think $BP could be a nice long term play once gas prices get to $5 a gallon over the next $4 years.

The problem w Green Energy is that it currently ONLY works w huge subsidies.  Take California Wind Farms.  90% of them built only a few years ago are running but obsolete.  Older ones are being torn down.  On their own, without Government giving the developer either Hard Cash to build them or HUGE tax credits, they don‚Äôt stand on their own.  Ecologically? Yes of course green energy is better than coal.  But it‚Äôs not perfect either.  Wind Farms kill birds.  Solar is super inefficient and super expensive and makes the land it‚Äôs placed in utterly unusable for any other feature.  Wave energy and Nat Gas has issues as well.  The key thing for humans to realize is that we need a diverse array of energy solutions, but #1 greenest thing we can do to save the planet is use less energy and make less people.  Till then?"

2021-05-12 15:46:33,stocks,One thing that you also need to consider when you value an oil company is the oil reserves. That is how much oil do they hold in their oil fields. That is an important number..as you can imagine when you buy a company you buy inventories of goods. Oil reserves are the inventory of oil companies and their value fluctuats with the price of oil..

&#x200B;

>ironically, the biden administration will be good for oil stocks. they are against increasing the supply of oil which will in turn increase the price of oil.

I see, so this is just basic supply and demand. If a toy company sells a popular toy for $30, and the supply begins to dwindle, the toy company increases the price of the toy to $60, and people still buy the toy because it's so popular - therefore, the toy company still profits.

Believe me, the Company Man will stop at nothing to get the tool out for results, this was just unfortunate timing. I pulled all my money out for something else. I will be going back in late summer before drilling season starts. Also the silly masses were looking for unreasonable gains.

2021-05-12 16:46:56,stocks,"The problem is that semis are integral to almost everything at this point. Here's a little anecdote:

Late November 2020, I bought a graphics card for $600 and people said it was overpriced as it was $100 over MSRP. The batch produced after that went for $800, and it was the last batch you could buy. Nothing since. A couple of months later and you can sell it used for $1500.

My buddy got the same spiel with the CPU he wanted to buy in early 2021, except he didn't buy it. Now he can't get one. The result is: He's not building a new PC even if he could reuse his old graphics card. He's also not buying new peripherals, waiting on that lighting upgrade and new chair. The semis not being able to keep up is starting to hurt everything, meanwhile prices of products that rely directly or indirectly on semis are surging.

Cars are just the next stop, but we should treat this semi shortage as a wave going up and coming down, hitting different sectors.

But there are those who will profit off of this. Can't get a new car? You know who just got resurrected? Hertz. Yes, the company that went bankrupt last year surged +55% today. There will be others. Think long and hard. Or just cost average down, keep what you have and realize that there are two outcomes:

1. It will blow over, semis will be back soon because the global economy relies heavily on them. Inflation and crap policy will end and be brought under control.
2. We are all fucked and this won't end quickly and spiral out of control. If this happens, we stand to lose no matter what.

Chances are we are ill-equipped to deal with outcome 2."

The value of an asset is determined by its market clearing price (where demand equals supply, or alternatively, the volume people want to sell and the volume people want to buy are equivalent), which creates and destroys wealth as it changes.

Imagine a stock is worth $100. Earnings come and out and are better than expected - as a result, shareholders reassess their valuation models, and as a result, absolutely no one will sell it for less than $110: below $110, everyone would prefer to buy it. So the price immediately jumps up to at least $110 - even though money hasn't flowed in from anywhere, the value has increased by 10%.

If earnings had been worse than expected, and the stock had crashed 10%, the opposite would have happened.

In other words - value is an accounting fiction, and wealth is based on expectation and assumption, not any objective measure. When stocks, bonds, and commodities all take a bath, it only means people are willing to pay less for them today than they were yesterday - for whatever reason."

2021-05-12 16:51:16,stocks,Hedge funds have sold off a bunch of positions in preparation for the liquidity test this week. They don't want to be margin called so they've got cash in hand.
2021-05-12 14:50:07,stocks,"The amount sold and bought are the same.  If I sell a million dollars worth of stock and convert it to cash, it means the people I sold it to converted a million of cash into stock."
2021-05-12 15:33:28,stocks,Short positions or the vix
2021-05-12 16:29:45,stocks,They are being rebalance because earning seasons is over. This happens everytime an earning seasons finishes. You can expect green on Friday and next week. Plus Yellin didn't help with her talk of raising interest rates. Big investors are too expose to inflationary events. They need to cover their exposure with assets which are protected against inflation.
2021-05-12 18:21:35,stocks,It flows back into cash
2021-05-12 14:39:07,stocks,Presumably then there is a strong incentive for the money to be put to use quickly given low interest rates on cash and inflation pressure deflating cash holdings. So people are just waiting to decide if they should put it back into the market or in something else? It seems like this would create a strong pressure for the money to flow SOMEWHERE (other than cash) within a couple days.
2021-05-12 16:20:45,stocks,As are a bunch of the related stocks and structured products.
2021-05-12 16:27:34,stocks,I thought the definition of the price was whatever the price of the last trade was. So the price literally can't change unless a trade takes place right?
2021-05-12 16:39:14,stocks,">So the price immediately jumps up to at least $110 - even though money hasn't flowed in from anywhere

Doesn't a trade need to take place for the price to change?"
2021-05-12 17:15:47,stocks,What is this liquidity test you mention?
2021-05-12 16:19:49,stocks,Negative interest and inflation are better than crashing prices for traders.
2021-05-12 16:39:03,stocks,"I think the price is usually defined as the mid between the bid and ask prices, which can change even if no trade takes place. Half way between the best buy and sell prices in the market."
2021-05-12 16:35:32,stocks,Right. And volumes tell the rest of that story. Bid and ask don‚Äôt change price without trade.
2021-05-12 16:44:53,stocks,"Yes, but every trade has a buyer and a seller, so the total amount of cash hasn't changed. The terminology I used was confusing, but I'm not sure how else to emphasize that when asset prices change, the money isn't really ""coming from"" or ""going"" anywhere."

2021-05-12 14:31:11,stocks,"I mean if you‚Äôve done the DD and everything looks good, you should have faith in your investment. Stocks go up if people want to buy them. And vice versa. That‚Äôs it. It really is that simple. If it‚Äôs a good strong company, people will eventually want to buy. I think what is more important than anything is making sure you find the best possible entry point."
2021-05-12 15:54:38,stocks,I have faith in spy and top tech stocks. Change my mind
2021-05-12 15:13:30,stocks,How about don‚Äôt buy investments you don‚Äôt believe in?
2021-05-12 16:04:22,stocks,"This is exactly right. If you buy broad index funds, then just ride the wave. If you chose to buy stocks, you better be keeping up with the companies you've invested in."
2021-05-12 14:04:29,stocks,"By saying that I think people mean to have faith in your research and analysis. Also depending on how stable the company is.

Like I have a lot of faith in AAPL than I do with DKNG for example."
2021-05-12 15:01:59,stocks,"I think the only issue, is most people don‚Äôt actually study a company..therefore they have nothing to believe in to begin with..
If you look at the annual reports or 10k...do all the ratios your self..examine growth/market...look at management and any relevant news/history of the company..You should have a strong conviction...however if you are just looking at stock screeners and opinions, your more exposed to losing."
2021-05-12 17:01:37,stocks,stop investing in garbage
2021-05-12 14:05:32,stocks,"Honestly, confirmation bias is rampant in our world today. Maybe getting completely burned by the market will teach people to look past the tip of their noses and actually try to better understand the world around them."
2021-05-12 14:20:26,stocks,"I believe my investment is taking a fucking brutal beating literally days before it hits long term gains. 

How‚Äôs that?"
2021-05-12 14:56:00,stocks,"It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

If you are a \*TRADER\*, cut your losses.

If you are an \*INVESTOR\* what happens today doesn't matter if it does not materially impact the overall core operations of the business.

For example, AMD moved lower.  I closed out my calls because it was a trade.  I added to UWMC this morning at $6.82 (cost basis of $7.48) because I think it's a great company selling at a discount."
2021-05-12 17:47:34,stocks,Faith is not an investment thesis.

2021-05-12 16:01:05,stocks,"If you made a decision to buy something, step back and look at why you made that decision and if it still holds stay in it.

Most people made the decision to buy something because they saw the price going up and back-justified some fundamental reason for this and oh no now it's going down! bad!"
2021-05-12 16:12:39,stocks,"Maybe constructively reconfirm your positions?

* Did you actually do the DD or just read a reddit post that typically has little to no fundamental analysis?
* Has your investment timeframe or risk tolerance changed?
* Is there significant new information that impacts your valuation?
* Is it still worth the opportunity cost of your capital (ex. will it outperform VTI)?"
2021-05-12 16:17:43,stocks,"I mean, in a way deciding to keep a stock every day is very similar to the decision to buy it at that price on that day.  


So I think to myself, would I buy it at this price today? Then I keep it. It's not exactly that, of course, because there is a cost to closing a position (commission, taxes, etc) as well as the mental work of doing this."
2021-05-12 16:19:38,stocks,"well, if you dont believe in yourself, who else would you believe in?

only you have your best interest at heart. everyone else is out for themselves"

2021-05-12 14:48:33,stocks,"No. Things change a lot. If you buy individual stocks you have to be willing to ALWAYS question the company, the industry, etc"
2021-05-12 19:44:50,stocks,"That assumes all stocks are created equal, with equal potential. They're essentially putting a stock like AMD at the same level as PLTR."

2021-05-12 15:13:39,stocks,For example I‚Äôm 100% AMC because I did enough DD to know I‚Äôm going to at least double my money when it squeezes. BUT i have faith that it goes to 100k per share so I can retire at 25
2021-05-12 15:27:24,stocks,100k bruh what
2021-05-12 15:29:08,stocks,Yes my faith is 100k lol I already know a safe exit is at 1k. And that milly will look real pretty from a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stock
2021-05-12 14:01:39,stocks,"Inflation increases the cost for borrowing. Meaning people have less money for spending.

Inflation also makes old debt cheaper to resolve. So rational people will pay off old debt and have less to spend.

Inflation will also create future uncertainty. If prices are raising, people will need to save more than previously thought for retirement. So they may up savings and retirement contributions leading to less spending. 

As for square, my barber just stopped taking credit card payments as the cost became too much. For small businesses, as prices increase, so do their fee totals. Thus, they have more incentive to seek (and reward) alternative forms of payment. Lots of small businesses with large purchase prices offer discounts for paying cash/check. I‚Äôd suspect that to be more common place. And in a world of inflation, ‚Äúdeals‚Äù are hard to come by, so this would feel like a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù.

Of course, this all implies the average consumer acts rationally."
2021-05-12 13:51:28,stocks,"Assuming everything else is equal, the increase in transaction revenue will be exactly offset by loss of purchasing power of the revenue, so there won't be a net gain in value."
2021-05-12 14:57:50,stocks,"Rising of inflation due to high demand (which is in case now) will benefitical or at least protection for $V and $MA.

People tend to more spend in high inflation eras because most of us don‚Äôt know what to do with their cash. 

People tend to be more conservative in case of low supply inflation era. This is not the case now."
2021-05-12 15:02:05,stocks,"Inflation doesn‚Äôt increase the cost of borrowing. Real yields does.

Why would I pay off my old debt while its getting cheaper everyday ? Would you ? 

People afraid of losing value of his/her cash in high inflation eras and tend to spend more."
2021-05-12 14:47:07,stocks,"Let me offer a counter thesis here.

Rising inflation decrease the cost of taking and holding debt as your debt load will decrease over time compared with your spending power. 

If governments continue to keep interest rates low, the spread between inflation and the interest rates at which consumers can borrow will remain low, so the real cost of borrowing will remain stable.

If inflation is high people are disincentivized to save as their savings will decrease over time, increasing the velocity of money, which means more money to spend.

Higher inflation mean lower prices on bonds and stocks, which means higher yields, which decreases the amount people need to save for retirement to fund their lifestyle. Which means more money to spend."
2021-05-12 15:23:09,stocks,Agreed
2021-05-12 15:21:10,stocks,So far your comment is 1 of 2 that assumes rates won‚Äôt rise. I‚Äôm betting rates rise.
2021-05-12 15:33:52,stocks,"Even it‚Äôs rising, why wouldn‚Äôt I borrow the money while real yields below inflation ?

I mean there‚Äôs no difference in borrowing with %5 while expected CPI is %6 than borrowing with %3 in case CPI is %4."
2021-05-12 16:02:44,stocks,"Real interest rate is typically negative in times of rapid inflation. As it was in 2008, which is coincidentally the trend we are hitting today."
2021-05-12 13:56:17,stocks,"Complacency, it‚Äôs definitely complacency.

I‚Äôm in the thrill phase if you are wondering.

Okay it‚Äôs really about market sentiment and not about the sentiment of individual investors, but this was still fun.

If I had to place the market somewhere I would say it‚Äôs in the belief phase. Everyone says to be fully invested, but we ain‚Äôt seeing too much leverage yet, and prices are still at least somewhat based in reality."

2021-05-12 14:13:29,stocks,Different sectors seem to be at different points along the chart.  Tech obviously is down but resources and industrials seem to be moving up.  Problems is that you can never be sure until looking back after significant changes.
2021-05-12 14:26:38,stocks,"I tend to agree. I definitely think that there are some localized bubbles, but overall things seem fairly priced all things considered. Some of the bubbles has come down a bit and ai don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over yet. People are still holding, but we are seeing more and more people every day, who are about to capitulate, but I could be wrong. I‚Äôm not about to gamble yet.

I don‚Äôt think there are any truly suppressed sectors these days, but there is some decent value, and a few good deal, especially in emerging markets."

I stopped going with trends & started going with what felt comfortable to ride out the long term."
2021-05-12 15:23:39,stocks,"It really depends - are you investing or are you trading?  If you‚Äôre trading, then you‚Äôre probably fucked, like some have said already.  But if you are investing, then those are two good companies with long term value."
2021-05-12 16:55:55,stocks,"For what it's worth, I think Amazon is the tech stock with the most to gain from inflation. They have made heavy capital investments into infrastructure, both for their logistics network and for AWS. If inflation kicks in, they will see much greater returns on these investments over the long run.

Apple might be a bit more vulnerable to inflation if it affects their bottom line, but I wouldn't bet against them. If Apple and Amazon are your two primary tech holdings, holding long term is a great strategy and I don't think that there is any reason to sell right now."

2021-05-12 17:57:32,stocks,"I'd like to add that portfolio size is relative. Most people aren't investing with life changing money, and I would argue most shouldn't. To a millionaire, 25k probably feels like 1k. 

Also, I know people who invest tens of thousands of dollars without owning a house, which I wouldn't advise ever. It could have potentially been their down payment. 

Rest of the advice is solid. Buy what you know and use. Half of the commentary online is bullshit anyways. I've gotten in to debates with people over products they do not even use, like EVs and it's obvious they have 0 clue what they are talking about."

Was about to panic sell this time too but I thought about it and reconsidered. Seems like the winning strategy is to only invest what you can afford to not touch for as long as you need to, so you free yourself from the need to try to time the market, and to do so on a regular schedule regardless of whatever the market is doing. If it's going up, buy and enjoy the green. If it's going down, buy and average your cost down for the next bull run. As long as you don't overexert yourself and only invest to what you can afford to not touch for a long time, you are free from timing the market."
2021-05-12 16:44:41,stocks,Lmao so true. Stock sub can be so hindsight minded sometimes. Then when things go up you will see people come out of woodwork saying they bought the dip. Glad they did it.

2021-05-12 17:04:57,stocks,"When I got started years ago we didn't have partial shares, (which if you could is what you should start with) so the best thing was to setup recurring deposits. Then periodically you should assign those deposits into stocks at different price amounts. Perhaps once a month, depending on how much you're putting in each time.

I would then have companies at different price targets. 90-120, 40-60, 10-20, 5.  Buy what you can of the 100, put the remainder into the 50, the remainder of that into the 10 and the rest into a penny stock.

Surprisingly this turned into a balanced strategy where the 100 stock was safer, known and probably had dividends. The 50 range was established and growing, 10-20 is speculative and the penny stock is a gamble.

 I bought what I could and worked my way down until I used up my deposit. Then did it again. Invest in companies future, invest in what you know, and invest in what you believe in. For me, I knew technology, believed in VR/Solar/EV would be established. (Happy accidents do occur)

For example in 2015 I started with TSLA(230) MSFT (50), SCTY(33) , NVDA (26) and AMD (2). Needless to say that worked out, but it still took **years** to happen. I had to weather ups and downs and not sell anything, even for a profit until I absolutely had to. My only regrets are selling entirely out of my positions. I now sell what I put in, then move the investment to the next target and let the rest ride.

Find those companies today. They are out there."

I thought we‚Äôd see a really strong post covid summer but supply chain issues are causing both manufacturers and retailers to raise prices.. dollar not looking as strong, etc.. 

I still think there is a strong desire for retail consumers to go out and spend as covid restrictions loosen. Won‚Äôt pretend to know what that will look like in the markets. Despite what the jobs report said, around me (Los Angeles) I see people working again who have money and are looking forward to spending it. That has never been a bad thing for the economy.

Aside from the obvious non-stock ETFs (bond funds are obviously about 10x safer than SPY), there are low-volatility ETFs that are composed of more stable stocks, and they typically see much smaller pullbacks during times like this.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Lesson learned from buying ‚Äúthe dip‚Äù. I began investing it the second half of 2020 and like most people, things were going very well until February hit. 

Everyone started saying ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs on sale!‚Äù when a stock dropped 4-5% and it sounded like a good idea to make back a quick 5% once the stock recovered. However the dips kept coming and every 5-8% drop I kept ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù.

I now realized how 5-8% is barely a dip and I should‚Äôve waited for at least a 10-15% drop in price before buying more. Now I‚Äôve got little capital left to buy at these 30-50% drops from ATH and I just gotta weather the storm until (hopefully) these climb back up. Lesson learned.

Price movement should not influence your decision making if you are long term investing, only the current price at that moment should. I'd rather buy a stock that dips from $150 to $145 that was already a good value than a stock that went from $150 to $100 and is still overvalued. Now if you originally buy a stock at good value and it dips really any amount, of course that should present a good buying opportunity assuming nothing has changed on the future outlook of that company. If you are long on stocks you should not be focused on taking advantage of price movements, you should be focused on generating value.

Now ""good value"" is 100% in the eye of the beholder and based on your own method of due diligence and beliefs."

5% drops or larger can happen 3 times a year on average. These are small fry. Not bad to buy in on those 5 percenters but also not 'whip out the Warren Buffet cash reserves' time to buy.

How do you know it won't ""dip"" 80%?

You ought to figure out/calculate what *you* think the stock is *actually* worth. Then you can decide for your self if its over/under priced. Stocks can go to zero. I've lost 95% on a couple of stocks when I was younger.

Social media a toxic brew of cult-like echo chambers and pump-and-dumps. This is an awful place for financial advice. You have no idea how qualified some one is or what their agenda is.

I'm up 10ish% since February. I haven't bought a SINGLE thing I've seen on reddit. Never once.

My point being; you did the right thing buying the 5% dip. You perhaps should've invested lower amounts at a time, but you never know beforehand. If it had started going up again after you bought you would've done the ideal thing. There's no ""perfect"" way of approaching this."

2021-05-12 17:29:29,stocks,A dip isn‚Äôt a dip until the indicators line up for a second buy. With value stocks you should only have to average down once or twice but high growth is volatile and you should have a minimum of 3 support levels to buy at. You can double your buys on the way down too but that makes your first buy small.

Also, the dip works at any time you're buying under your average price. Sure, you can't buy forever, but it's also well-known, or at least should be by now, that nobody can time the market.

2021-05-12 15:19:45,stocks,"It looks like I've written an essay here. Things got a little out of hand. WTF am I doing.

First off, If you prefer, ETFs are much, much easier to invest with. In addition to be easier, there is a lot of data that indicates ETFs are better because many people/funds don't beat ETFs over the long term.

I do the following stuff because I like/enjoy investing (I don't know why). Its become a hobby for me that I am becoming more and more serious about as time goes on.

There are different ways to price a stock. First, You find the information you need in the financial statements. Sadly, you'll be learning a bit of accounting at this point.

I also want to add that learning to read financial statements is really important. To start learning about the statements, I suggest you find an income statement. The top line is revenue. Look at this number and then move down and look at the gross profit/loss. A good company will have a gross profit here. Then move down further and find the Net income. This is the final profit. Hopefully they have profit. If they don't, find out why.

The ""simplest"" valuation metric is share price divided by earnings. Earnings is profit/net income (P/E). It is easy and readily available to calculate/find. The historic average is around 15ish. the S&P average right now is around 22 I believe. This is almost historically high. ie: stocks are ""expensive"". At P/E of 15, it takes 15 years to pay off your initial investment. If you find a growing company, this payoff can be much sooner. This is why you want companies that are growing. The big thing with growth, is that you don't want to pay ""too much""(what ever that means, its subjective). For example, Tesla is about P/E of 500. This ""high"". In the long term, the P/E will eventually revert to the mean. Profit and share price are what affect the P/E so, for it to revert to the mean, they can make more money, or the share price can drop, or a combination of the two. That's why growth is sort of a gamble. For tesla, you are paying a big premium in the hopes that they are going to be massively profitable. If they miss on their profits a little bit, the share price will probably start coming down.

When a company has no profit, you can't calculate a P/E.

In that case, you can look at cash flow. Companies historically trade at 15 times their cash flow. Super easy way to calculate is to find operating cash flow, add back capital expenditures and divide by the market cap. If its higher than 15, its ""expensive"". However if the company is growing, it can be worth it to ""overpay"". Your willingness to overpay should depend on your belief/understanding of the businesses ability to ""grow into its share price.""

You can look at share price to revenue/sales. If its software, you might compare your company you like to something like Microsoft or oracle. If your company trades much higher than the industry, it is ""expensive"" and you are paying a premium. If you pay a premium, You hope that your company grows into the price your paying. Something like Palantir is at 30 times revenue while oracle is 5 and Microsoft is around 10 or so I think. With Palantir, they would have to double their cash flow to get this ratio down to 15, which is still higher than other software companies. Once again, if you pay more, this means you think that Palantir will ""grow into its current share price"".

If you want to get more complicated, you can go full-business-school and build complicated models in excel called ""discounted cash flow analysis"" or DCF. These are time consuming and have a lot of inputs. I find them troublesome because you are basically are making educated guesses about any number of the inputs. Bad judgements or errors can really affect the outcome of a DCF model. This is the sort of thing the investment banks are doing(among many other strategies). There are simpler models you can build too.

If someone is talking to you about ""fundamentals"" but they are NOT discussing something similar to what I've written, stay the fuck away from them. Its not fundamentals.

If someone says I expect the share price of tesla to be 1500 dollars in three years, your next question should be ""what P/E"". Someone told me that they thought tesla would be 1500 with a P/E of 80 2 years from now). I found their current P/E and earnings on yahoo and then, I spent 5 minutes and calculated that they thought earnings/profit would be 20x higher 2 years from now. Maybe, I don't know. Sounds optimistic to me, but I don't know.

Wow I wrote an essay here. Anyways, I hope this sort of steers you in a good direction. I'm no expert, but I hate to see people losing their money because of other peoples bad advice.

I am not affiliated with any of the following and I have no agenda here:

If your interested, there's a CFA on YouTube with a small channel called Cameron steward, CFA. He might be confusing at first, but he wants to teach and analyze companies. His method is one way to do it. Great way to learn the above stuff. If you went through a handful of his videos you'd basically have a handle on the above stuff.

Another channel is called Everything Money. They break stock down a little more simply, but they're good. Their approach is respectable. The downside is that they are shilling their software pretty hard, but I think its actually decent stuff.

Another channel that I respect is Sven Carlin. He's a PhD in risk management.

A good book to read is ""One up on Wall Street"" by peter lynch. He wants to teach this stuff too, but its a book. Its not a hard read though. He wrote it in 1989 which seems old but its funny how much things have stayed the same even though the industries are different. A surprisingly high number of the ""can't miss"" stocks from that era are gone or struggling now. Makes me wonder about all the ""sure things"" I see now.

Investopedia is a good resource to learn about investing concepts. When I come across something I don't understand, I go there.

If your still with me, best of luck.

Not him but there's an easy answer to that: the price. Absolute values make talking of relative percentages much easier to grasp. 

Simple example: consider MSFT.

- went between 230 and 240 a bunch in march

- grew to 262 in anticipation of earnings in april

- 4-5 days before actual earnings it started to dip and kept slightly below 260

- after earnings started to dip gradually to 250

- now went to 238

To go back to the questions asked: there was a lot of ""dipping and growth"" during these two months. Some of it relatively predictable, some less so. Obviously the values didn't go too crazy and there was ""only"" 13% gain if you bought the lowest value and sold the highest, but that's about it. Even if you took your sweet time you had a full month to get in and positive earnings in april for MSFT were a no-brainer for anyone who knew even a bit about the company. Post-earnings decay was also visible from after amazon's statement.

Every time period is different but on a short enough timeframe with well known variables and no surprises ""timing the market"" doesn't amount to much. Of course it also involves putting an amount you're comfortable losing and stop losses in case shit happens but that's that."

I speculate big oil companies see green energy in a 10 year horizon and are already making moves to use their infrastructure  and capital to be part of the transition to capitalizes on it. In the mid term they will also benefit greatly by the big prices on oil and gas. If I was a CEO of an oil company that would be my play, make a bunch of money on oil as prices increase, and already have a plan for the transition to also capitalize on that. Also any conflicts in the Middle East will increase oil cost. Also the new administration has set restrictions on new oil exploration which will only decrease new supply.

I bought a number of stocks and ETFs that I regretted a few days later and sold to eventually move into broad market indexes.  After a few days, I even sold most of my shares in the broad index to just wait and see what happens with inflation.

I'm concerned that most of my sales has a small percentage that is a 'Wash Sale'.  I understand what a Wash Sale is, but I don't see how that applies to all of these stocks that I bought and then resold a few days later.  I know it occurs when you sell a holding for a loss and then buy a similar one within 30 days, but I don't think I did any of that.  I never rebought any of these stocks.

Would I get a Wash Sale because I sold a stock for a loss then purchased a broad market index?

Also - I sold most of my shares in ITOT today for a loss because, and I have a few hundred that is listed as a Wash Sale (positive).  Is this because I had purchased the initial stock within 30 days prior?  If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days?  I'm a new investor and confused."

The wash sale loss exclusion does apply to stock losses that you still hold stock in that you purchased within 30 days prior and 30 days after the sale considered an wash sale excluded loss.

In other words, you'll have to entirely get out of the stock and remain out for over 30 days to have a loss that can be deducted."

The idea that the Fed has largely been a tailwind for the last 10 years should not be lost on market participants. We are at close to zero interest rates already and inflation is a limiting factor for additional monetary/fiscal support.

2021-05-12 12:09:14,stocks,"I think we have to refrain from creating narratives that don't really have much basis in facts and more akin to speculation.

The data that we have available should always inform future decision-making.

Inflation is much much higher than we expected. What does that mean in terms of macro?

Think about how much the Fed has been supporting markets. Does this remove potential for support of growth assets. I'd say yes for sure because it's less likely they can move further lower or even stay at current rates.

This break in narrative is enough to generate fear in the market and spark a bear market. Yes long term it may just be a blip in a 30 year time horizon. But big investors don't want to be caught in a bear market it would be a career-ender. Taking chips off the table is completely reasonable if there's ample data that shows the Fed could be discounting inflation risks.

The Fed is taking a stance against what they've done previously because they know it doesn't work to create actual growth and 2% inflation. They are almost experimenting at this point because ""running hot"" on inflation could mean that they end up overheating. Interest rate effect changes could take 6mos - 12mos until it actually takes effect so it's possible they're already behind the curve and they might require even harsher tightening.

It's not necessarily the same thing but you have to look back at the 70's stagflationary conditions to understand what the risks are of sudden tightening due to heady inflation measures. Sometimes the markets are the sacrificial lamb to stabilized inflation."
2021-05-12 12:48:16,stocks,"Inflation causes bond yields to rise, whether through bond sell offs or interest rate hikes (which also trigger bond sell offs).

TINA (there is no alternative) doesn't apply once yields are good enough. This is why we had a mini bear market on the S&P 500 back in December 2018, when yields at times were over 3% on the 10 year treasury."
2021-05-12 18:06:56,stocks,"I think the major reason why inflation tends to crush tech stocks is that the ten tear treasury yield has to rise to stay in line with inflation.  Hence it's better to get risk free yield than take risk in the market.  Also, and we haven't reached that point with the ten year yet, if the company pays a dividend this gets less attractive as the ten year yield moves higher.  If the 10 ye yield gets higher than most dividends there is almost no reason to own the stock."
2021-05-12 11:54:04,stocks,"In my opinion, it's not just the fact that we have inflation. It's the fact that we blew out expectations and have fairly high inflation that limits the maneuverability of the Fed on interest rates. I would also say that there could also be political headwinds against even further stimulus because of the number of job openings vs. employment data.

It also signals where we could be in this next cycle of tightening and what that means for equities. 

It's all about relative weakness. If cash supply depreciates by 3-4% inflation that's actually not bad if we expect a 20% bear market for a few years.

Consider the fact that a huge chunk of the bond market investors are purposely shoveling cash into negative yielding bonds.

With real yields money is still being lost but flight to safety still makes cash an attractive option in fat tail scenarios.

These days with massive Fed intervention and market distortions you can't explain a lot of current reflexivity in the market with simplistic lines of thinking. 

It's a very complex system and if the last 12 years have taught us anything it's that the market can seemingly act irrationally in a specific moment but after the fact we then realize it's a paradigm shift in the current monetary/QE regime.

i.e. Taper tantrum, Mario Draghi ""anything it takes""

A lot of people trading have no clue what an actual bear market does to your sentiment. I bought Goldman for like 47 bucks in 2008 and sold it in the low 50s and was ecstatic because I had lost so much on other stupid financials trades. I bought Apple for 70 and sold it for 72.

2021-05-12 13:38:58,stocks,"Yep, I agree that trying looking at this thing 1 year out is speculation nonetheless.

However, my comment was more to bring more reasoning of year-to-date market action based on historical measures and forward looking data - rather than blaming a the dark shadowy characters like big hedge funds and purposeful big player market coordination. That's a unknown unknown that can happen at any time during any downturn. Does that mean we would jump to this conclusion at any time the markets go down? We have to look a bit deeper in all cases.

And I'm sure this manipulation does happen but the point is to bring reasoning as to why there is even fear/risk building in the first place. I believe that is the best line of reasoning is the best starting point vs. hand waving real data that we have and ignoring current market risks.

The fact that we're reaching far out for an explanation residing in dark shadowy corners is probably a sign that we've run further than what is rationally expected. 

Markets correct all the time. What the fed has done continuously creating the expectation that markets shouldn't go down. (even in a global pandemic) This is a travesty in capital markets because you can only suppress risk for so long until it appears swiftly and suddenly.

I'm not saying there aren't reasons to be bullish in certain cases. However, I have a feeling that a lot of people in the market now are stuck on the meme that money printer go brrr and we have no reason to guard against risks. Long stocks cause businesses should always expect inflation.

Unfortunately it's not that simple. The FED does not actually understand the consequences of their actions because we're in uncharted territory. The market knows that we are in uncharted territory and has to guard against risk that the FED is not positioned in accordance with reality. The idea that this is transitory is still speculation even though history tells us that some prices can be ""sticky"".

Time will tell, but what I'm saying is that historical events have proven time and time again that the FED will say things on one breath but behind the scenes have other thoughts and considerations and can turn on a time due to policy mistakes. This is what the market is pricing in at this point.

High inflation is a real thing and can't be hand waved away because it affects a broad section of the population. It has huge macro implications and what we're seeing right now is concerns for what those implications mean."

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre mid level firm ($700 Mil-$3 Billion). You‚Äôre guaranteed to make $7-15 Mil this year based around slightly beating the market (whether that‚Äôs a loss or gain). You have an opportunity to take a trade that‚Äôs going to make a 2% difference in your overall gains. That 2% will put you in the upper or lower echelon.

If anyone is invested in energy could you give me some recommendations or which one is the best long term. I plan on holding 5-15 years roughly.

They generate a decent amount of electricity from renewables as well, which I believe is a good thing. So im willing to invest in a company that shares my values.

March 25th-April 26th ain't the first time the big boy Nasdaq stocks have driven the show (although for a brief period near the end, the smalls and mid caps TRIED to help) and decided what happened here, in fact, although there's probably plenty of fond memories over 2017's market, this was actually your story for most of 2017 based off what I've seen.

https://www.slickcharts.com/nasdaq100"
2021-05-12 09:38:56,stocks,"I don't know much about DT in particular but it was trading at an all time high and it's still 50% higher than it's 52 week low. Knowing little else about the company, I'd say yes, this stock was among the high flyers last year that was due for a drop."
2021-05-12 11:41:03,stocks,"By high flyer, I assumed you meant growth stocks that weren't making any money.   DT is raking in the cash.  I still dont put it in the same category as $FSLY for example.   There's overhyped meme stocks and then there are solid stocks like $DT.   

I just saw your earlier comment which goes right to my point:

""If so, then yes, the Nasdaq is made up of mostly blue chip stocks and it's weighted. The Nasdaq isn't at it's ATH either, it's about 800+ points off of it.""

If the NASDAQ is made up of mostly blue chips, and blue chips are down (maybe not as heavy as growth stocks), then how can the NASDAQ be up so high (being down 800+ doesn't seem like much considering how high it is relatively speaking).   If the NASDAQ crashes as being predicted, will it affect FANG more than growth stocks?

And why are biotech and growth stocks being so significantly affected when NASDAQ falls?"
2021-05-12 12:41:57,stocks,"By high flyer, I meant any of these stocks that made significant and unsustainable returns over the past year. Again, I don't know much about DT but it's trading 50% higher than it's 52 week low so it seems to be performing pretty well to me. Looking at what it's done in the last two weeks isn't always relevant to the companies actual performance.

800+ (now over 1000) points is quite a bit. It's about 8%. The blue chips also flew pretty damn high over the last year leading Nasdaq to hit that ATH and then those same stocks pulling back led to what is now a 10% drop."
2021-05-12 14:09:57,stocks,I keep seeing predictions of a NASDAQ crash.   What do you think about that?
2021-05-12 15:08:42,stocks,"That depends on what a crash means in relation to the overall market. There's no actual definition for a crash. When the pandemic hit, that was a legit crash because everything went down really really fast. Meanwhile some people will say today is a crash. It seems to be used more as a buzzword than anything meaningful. 

There are corrections (down 10%-20%) and bear markets (down 20%+). We're already heading down and I think a tried and true correction is on the horizon. Nasdaq is pretty much right there already. There was a lot of money pumped into the market and a pullback with some concerning economic indicators (namely inflation) being a catalyst makes sense.

I don't think we'll head to bear market territory though. Housing market is still strong. The demand for labor is outweighing supply. The economy is reopening and people will be spending money this summer like crazy. Despite the markets not reacting favorably, companies are reporting generally good earnings and keeping guidance in line. 

So, IMO, I don't see anything serious on the horizon for the overall market but at the same time, people got heavily invested in these tech stocks that went up like 200%+ over the last year that are now looking at 50% drops. They may be good buys now but I think it'll be a long road for them to get back to the valuations they had a few months ago."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results. **Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain. ¬†While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy‚Äôs what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.¬†

a.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One Month

b.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One Quarter

c.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k ‚Äì $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can‚Äôt be proven from the data and is left to the reader‚Äôs judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

Good shout. Whether it was due to insider knowledge in different sectors, or due to greater personal interest in particular industries or personal relationships shifting their stock picks that way, or whatever else, it would be a different analysis than your story/question focused on. Interesting, but different."

2021-05-12 13:02:19,stocks,"It probably wouldn't even deter trading any, but couldn't they literally divest it from the job? Something like ""Whilst in a term in office, a congress member shall not engage in stock trades of any kind. Members can continue trading once they are no longer an elected official."" They can go back to trading after their tenure when they become a lobbyist.

I'm sure they'd just have their brother/friend/whatever handle the trades during their tenure but it would be a start. Adding a middle man makes it slightly easier to catch inside trading. I mean if there's a record of a phone call from a congressman/woman to the person doing their trading for them on tape saying something like ""sell now. Don't ask questions. Sell now!...No there's no time!"" And that call happens 5 minutes after a meeting about an oil pipeline or something it makes it much easier to convict because now there's a ""paper trail"" so to speak.

What they neglected to point out was he made 13 million dollars on book deals and speaking engagement which he had invested which he paid no taxes on. I guess to be fair I put money in my 401K for 35 years and did not pay taxes on it till I get it out. My point is rich people and politicians can hide their money in investments or overseas and not pay taxes so I do not believe the rich people tax is going to bring in any new money.

2021-05-12 10:48:32,stocks,"Because the people benefiting are the same people that would make it illegal. The only way I can see is to end it is to call attention it. But seeing the actions of the intelligence committee last year, both parties do it. 

Another problem is how popular people‚Äôs reps and senators are in their own state or district.  I live in a very Republican part of NYS.  I can set my clocks to my gerrymandered district sending a Republican while Democrats go to statewide office and take more seats from the delegation. And all of said, reps remain popular in their district (my rep is 65% or so), yet when taken as a whole Congress usually has single digit approval rating. Same thing happens in Republican states. Even if this issue came to the fore the lift would be voting the incumbents out (or embarrassing them enough to do something)   AND doing that when the system is pretty rigged to just send the same to congress every year with a few toss ups. 

It sucks, I wish it was better, other than encouraging you to get active locally, I have no answer that doesn‚Äôt involve changing constitutions (proportional representation for example). If the state and local reps are better they will replace the Congressional reps at some point (primaries or retirement). Honestly I joined a party just so I could vote in primaries because that‚Äôs the only way I can see any change.

Breaking it down by party might have added quite a bit of political argument in this sub about insider trading and fat cats and lobbying.

 It would be interesting to see it broken down by party, but looking at those results properly would also require quite a lot of additional analysis (e.g. do some members of congress buy the same company or sector at about the same time more than the market would suggest, is that consistent, and is it broken down by party or comittees they are in or regions they represent), as well as having hidden factors (e.g. like those mentioned in my comment) that we can't easily account for.

2021-05-12 15:23:29,stocks,"Sure. On average, they have outperformed the S&P in the past. That doesn‚Äôt say anything about what to expect in the future from a data analysis standpoint. 

Maybe I am missing part of what they worked on, but I‚Äôm thinking this needs a regression analysis. To the point made above, we definitely need something like a p-value if we want to make any sort of real conclusion. 

For all we know, it‚Äôs absolutely possible that they all lucky and that you can‚Äôt expect them to necessarily outperform some random person you pull from the street. 

It could be that most randomly selected people outperform the market but a few really poor investors (outliers) bring the average down.  Given that there is a limited number of congressmen, they may have less outliers just by chance.

2021-05-12 16:35:24,stocks,"imo part of the 'inflation' we're seeing is the effect all the shortages we have on prices.

Take housing for example, a perfect storm of conditions is creating an artificially low supply which is driving up prices so much. Mainly:

* Many people don't want to sell their home right now and have potential buyers possibly getting them sick with COVID as they tour their house.

* The government basically put a freeze on all foreclosures for a while, which means less foreclosed houses on the market.

* Low interest rates mean buyers can afford to buy more house by locking in a historically low interest rate today.

While we can debate if the third will stick around or not, the first two items are definitely going away once COVID is eradicated. More supply will cause housing prices to correct downward.

A lot of other markets are like this today, a limited supply due to COVID (among other things) drove prices up, which makes it look like inflation when it's really just a lack of supply.

That said, yes there is still definitely some inflation going on, but imo it's not as bad as many are making it out to be, many of the data points most often being cited ignore how artificial COVID created shortages are driving up the price."

While they were necessary during the pandemic‚Äôs darkest days, as were stimulus checks, those ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù need to end now. Like ASAP. They are fueling the inflation issues.

2021-05-12 13:16:53,stocks,My biggest fear is money printing compounding the inflation from supply chain issues and economy re-opening.

2021-05-12 11:15:50,stocks,"I'm assuming you have statistics to back up the May trends, and you're not simply running off anecdotal evidence, but a bubble in car prices thanks to the semiconductor shortage is not an implication of inflation. The rise in prices are attributed to the fact that plants were shut down in the wake of covid. If prices had risen across the board, then ya, the arguement is there for inflation higher than normal, but they're not."

2021-05-12 15:59:13,stocks,Supply shocks in general are partly causing inflation. People staying at home with extra unemployment money also add to inflation. The bubble in car prices is due to money printing.

2021-05-12 13:19:55,stocks,"Problem is a lot of the supply chain issues could take over a year to fix. For example steel futures are very high into q1 2022, chip shortage could also continue into 2022."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Amazon Wins Fight to Throw Out $303 Million EU Tax Bill https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/amazon-inflicts-another-tax-defeat-on-eu-s-vestager

Now Apple beat a much bigger tax bill recently where it was $13 B it turned out was not owed to Ireland, and $303 M is a trifle for a company Amazon's size. It's less than 1% of their European gross income. But I think renewing Amazon's court room power means that there will be at least a brief spike for Amazon today as the word gets out. 

Notably it could establish beneficial precedent for Nike and Ikea who are having similar tax bill fights. That's been doing on since 2019, though, so it might not be settled any time soon."
2021-05-12 07:14:58,stocks,I just read an article in lemonde that confirms the opposite. Amazon lost the fight and the 250m eur tax bill is now due.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Softbank Earnings (3.3 P/E) I was taking notes while I was listening but I can't type fast enough to transcribe everything. I'll skim through and post the highligts.

47 billion usd net income, including one-time gain from selling sprint etc.

200 to 236 billion usd increase in NAV (including debts) over 12 months

Breakdown of net asset value: 47% BABA, 25% SVF1+2, 32% other

269 billion usd equity value of holdings, 34 billion usd net debt, 12% loan to value (25% expected in normal times)

12 months ago they announced 2.5 trillion jpy on share repurchases, and 4.5 trillion jpy monetization strategy. Ended up doing 10 trillion jpy in monetizing [includes pending Arm deal], today 2.5 trillion jpy share buyback was completed, and will be retired from treasury.

2.7k jpy EPS in last year [TSE shares, not OTC], NAV is 15k jpy/share, 9.3k jpy/share [actual price]; 3.3 P/E, so it's still undervalued on paper.

1 year ago SVF -1.116 billion jpy quarterly loss, last quarter 3.590 billion jpy quarterly income from svf. Last 12 months 6.358 trillion jpy gain from SVF.

Of the companies that have gone public from the portfolios; SVF1 originally invested 15.7 billion usd, not worth 60.4; SVF2 invested 1.6 billion usd, now worth 6.2 billion.

SVF1: 60% of gain in value went to Softbank Group, because 40% of equity is outside investors with preferred shares and fixed return. SBG had 39% return on net equity annualized (IRR). SVF2: was all SBG capital, 30 billion usd used, 119% IRR. Latam Fund: 2.6 billion usd invested, now 4.0 billion fair value, net equity IRR 62%. 244 total investments across all 3 including deals pending closings.

Companies fluffed: Nvidia, Gopuff, Better, Jellysmack, Trax, Jobandtalent

Important notes from Q&A:

No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps.

My take: fundamentals are good. Investors are not going to like that he no longer plans to commit to share buybacks. I'd expect the share price to fall a fair bit medium term. Masa implied high levels of confidence on BABA and Arm deal to NVDA which are the 2 big question marks right now."

If I think stock is going to go down, I might sell it and then buy it again when it dips. But with taxes it will be based on what I bought the stock at initially. This might fuck me over because the taxes might be more than the dip was. Am I understanding this correctly? So basically I shouldn't do this strategy?"

2021-05-12 11:37:59,stocks,"Can't complain about this correction.

Remember when people complained that valuations didn't make sense? 

SNAP was worth the same as WFC. Sure, SNAP is a growing company, and WFC has a history of controversies.

But WFC makes 20bn in a non-covid year. They made 4.8bn in the recent quarter. SNAP lost 286mil in the recent quarter.

It didn't make sense for both of them to be worth 80-90bn. 

So WFC after having doubled is still trading under 10PE. If interest rates rise, bank interest margins may even improve. 

I think it's well-deserved gains for fundamental investors who bought financial stocks that were trading at 5 forward PE. 

Or what about SNOW, that was worth more than 100bn, total revenue less than 200mil a quarter, with losses greater than their total revenue? 

The fact that it crashed to 55bn and still dropping makes more sense to me than when it gained 50% after IPO to be worth over 100bn.

Companies with revenue under 1bn, worth more than 100bn, with nothing by losses was NOT NORMAL. It's just no one knew whether these stocks would correct or not at the time. (I would be super shocked if a company like SNOW kept increasing in market cap versus if it dropped like now)"

Most studies conclude that expected inflation can either positively or negatively impact stocks..."

What happened today? Why is the stock market down? How does it influence the long term outlook for my investments? If it doesn't change much, don't worry so much. If you have truly lost conviction in your investments then as at a minimum take it as a learning experience. Knowledge and experience can be just as valuable as dollars and cents to new investors.

Same with washed gains. The last couple of months I hear you saying we are in tech bubble and that big pullback is coming. Many companies made +100% ROI in less than a year = it's normal. Same companies drop -15% = mass panic. Huge dips BUY BUY, I zoom out to 1Y and I see that we are still not even in the middle of the after march spike. 

Single day can be green/red, but it doesn't project the whole picture. I'm afraid that we might face market recession for a longer period of time, like months or years. I still buy and avg down, but be mentally prepared for this. You bought ath, so dealt with it."

2021-05-12 15:10:38,stocks,"Last time S&P futures made a new ATH and then it was followed up with a full on market selloff was in early September.

Don't know if we get to the point of what was seen in early September. But it sure feels similar to that in that we're done for a while, what it did in futures will likely need to be tested...but maybe in July?

3 day rule means bounce maybe tomorrow, but I don't think we're going to go fast like what's been seen since late October.

BTW: Futures making a new ATH and what the NYSE Advance/Decline line has done recently does not suggest that ""THE"" top is in. Although what was done on the NYSE on Monday (it apparently had the most 52 week highs ever at the open) suggests that there might have been buying exhaustion."

What will realistically happen: the tech/growth rebound will be hampered by a  second correction in the major indices, which will dump tech and growth to even lower levels, effectively extended the growth and tech correction another 3-4 months. after the dust has settled in Late Sep/Oct, big tech will be down 20-30% from January levels, and growth will be down \~70%. from January Levels.

2021-05-12 15:41:25,stocks,"To everyone who told me my conservative approach was wrong, and that stocks always go up: where are you now? 

Look, the fat lady ain't sang yet, and we could bounce back and have a huge rally. Unlikely.  This is what happens to the market everytime there's even a hint of the need for tapering, so imagine when it actually comes.  But hey.  Nobody really knows.  So yeah, I could be wrong, and don't let me tell you that my way is the right way.  Think for yourself. 

To everyone who said index funds are the best idea, and time in the market beats timing the market: where are you now?  Index funds are great in and of the selves, but they've become so touted that some people 
even recommended lump summing into index funds right now (1-2 months ago) because ""usually"" it provides better returns just go get it all at once. How about all that talk about Bob the world's worst market timer?  Tell me you'd like to be in that position and be able to say it with a straight face.

If you just DCAd into VTI all this time, great!  That's still a wonderful approach.  But the irrational exuberance and lack of investor IQ these last few months was going far beyond that: large allocations to index funds, lump sums, and get in now before it's too late! 

I'm glad I saw it for what it was.  I'm glad I held my ground.  Today was a victory for me.

I'm sorry for everybody who can't say the same thing. And long run you may get rich and I'll still be poor.  Then you can laugh.  That's fine.

I'm new to this, but the fundamental lesson here is to never listen to the crowd.  Never.  Never listen to any single individual either.  Not in finance, and hell, especially not in life.  We can learn, but at the end of the day we've got to find an approach that works for us.  So don't take my word for anything either. 

It's a sad day for our economy.  Hopefully things will even out, but it looks like the Covid recovery is not going to be as simple as we thought.  My best wishes go out to everyone who is still affected by this crisis. 

As for me, I'm content today, and besides being a victory for me, I hope that my words can inspire other people.

Investment for me isn't just about asset growth. It's about personal growth.  Obviously we shouldn't throw away any money on any philosophy or poetic ideals, that would be silly.  But by being smart we can all secure a comfortable and happy future for ourselves. I'm sure of it."

And HXL being as low as it is makes actually zero sense to me. All they do is beat analysts' expectations by using technologies to make the materials of the future. Maybe they should throw the world ""artificial intelligence"" into their prospectus to make themselves more sexy.

2021-05-12 10:54:12,stocks,"There's a lot of reasons inflation is a big concern. 

Speaking personally as an investor who likes bonds, I'll start there. 

For many investors like myself there's a choice to make: bonds or stocks. One very stable bond is, of course, a U.S. Treasury. Treasury yields going up means more return buying them. The more they go up, the less pie there is for stocks. This is especially true of institutional investors that either by law or internal process *must* have a certain amount of liquidity on certain days. If you're a pension fund manager, you can't just tell retirees ""whoops, we are going through a cycle. You'll get your checks next quarter."" 

The U.S. Treasury yield has been rising, and perhaps most disturbingly (for growth stocks) it has been rising with inflationary fears. [Here is a chart.](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) I want to stress that today is a bit like the movie Margin Call at the 10pm boardroom meeting. We're not hear to discuss the specter or possibility of rising inflation rates and yields pushing money out of growth stocks. The reality is it's already happened.

The reason this is especially disturbing is because when inflation goes up, and interest rates haven't yet gone up, the yield should be growing more. *There's a lot of U.S. Treasury Bonds*, especially after all the spending the U.S. government has done. The yield has not gone up as much as it should, though it has gone up plenty, which means the picture is even bleaker for growth stocks. There is a huge movement into U.S. Treasuries that the current inflation discussion is obscuring vis-a-vis higher interest rates. 

There are additional reasons: higher interest rates means it takes more money to burn cash, and most growth stocks burn a lot of cash. A small change in interest rates extrapolated over future guidance is literally taking food out of your mouth and giving it to financials. Higher interest rates also mean inflation, and in a high inflation environment people like to do other things with their money like get goods and services while they can."
2021-05-12 10:53:10,stocks,"General logic is inflation could result in Fed raising interest rate. This causes big investors to shift funds.

Retail investors like us see inflation as blood in the water. We panic sell hoping to be flush with cash and catch the falling knife aka buy the dip."
2021-05-12 10:52:29,stocks,"Since prices go up, it means people are less likely to want to spend money, the costs to run businesses also goes up, sometimes more than the profit, so margins become smaller. Imagine having to pay $8 for a burger, then all of a sudden it jacks up to $12, many now decide to make their own lunch. On the business side, the cost to get goods will also go up, meaning making a smaller margin as well. With interests rates also going up, it'll impact profits, esp growth small tech companies running of loans, even more."
2021-05-12 10:51:45,stocks,"Look at how a DCF is calculated.  The discount rate is a MASSIVE part of the equation, changing your discount rate leads to wildly different valuations.

I always find it funny when people say that.  The entire point of every econ course after Econ 101 is that 99% of what you learn in Econ 101 doesn't actually work that way in the real world.  People saying ""this is Econ 101!"" are almost exclusively people who just barely remember like 3 things from, their econ class and apply them selectively to confirm their priors."

The President's impact on the stock market is historically very low, especially when we're 4 months into an Administration. Biden's goal is saving the economy for now and the future, but the stock market is not the economy. Etc, etc. I guess as usual, the best we can do is give you Trumps own words:

**This was before covid:**

*Just last week, Trump tweeted, ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn‚Äôt lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate.‚Äù*

If that actually happened before Covid, we would be in negative interest rates now, deflation, and good bye US Market for who knows how long."

I decided to start easing my way into various markets at the start of this year after having my advisors start my Roth last year and I don't recall seeing tons of posts warning folks about a speculative bubble that was about to burst. Obviously one guy here and there calls it but if you're new and don't know where all the best juice or insight is, it's very easy to miss this stuff. In hindsight and with more practice it's clear it wasn't a good move but in the moment only fraction of that info was super clear. Especially when there's way more noise from the ongoing bull mania. 

Anyone who took an L shouldn't beat themselves up for some unlucky timing. What matters is what we learn from it and how we respond. Long term, this will be a blip so it's wise to keep a long time horizon and not get too caught up in the moment. Experience, applied well, will overshadow beginner blunders."

2021-05-12 15:52:56,stocks,"I totally get this thinking. 

But here's the rub. When you buy stocks in a company for investment purposes, you should have a thesis behind it. You should feel comfortable that what you pay in the moment is at least fair, but hopefully is a bargain for the risk you assume. Downward movement on your stock does not guarantee that it will keep going down. **Fear** should not be a reason to give up on the thesis. **Momentum** does not constitute a good or bad investment. If you buy a stock only on the assumption that it should move up, because stocks just do that, then that's no real thesis---it's a gamble. And when your thesis is ""Well it will just go up"" and then it goes down instead, you naturally think that maybe you were wrong.

Tomorrow the market might bounce back up for precisely the reasons you mention. The only thing that matters in the longterm is, did you buy the stock at a good price, and is the investment thesis intact. If these are the case, then there's no good reason to sell. Any prediction of what happens tomorrow is a guess."

2021-05-12 10:59:01,stocks,"I feel like this would be more intuitive if people concretely explained what the discount rate is.

A stock price is just the sum of future earnings of the company expressed in today's dollars. If there is no inflation, then $100 ten years from now is $100 in today's dollars. If there is 2% inflation, then that $100 ten years from now is only $82 in today's dollars because of currency devaluation. In other words, if that cash flow 10 years from now is the only earnings the company will ever have, then that company should be worth $82 today with 2% inflation and $100 today with 0% inflation.

Interest rates are used to convert tomorrow's dollars into today's dollars because it's a very liquid market. If a government bond yields 2%, then $82 today is guaranteed to become $100 10 years from now."

Its supposed to be a business with tons of potential and the domain as a whole is full of potential due to legalization. Well now its down about 30% with absolutely no bad news at all.

It's also worth noting DFEN has direct exposure to defense companies like Northrop and Raytheon, but I assume that's implied from DFEN's name

Point being, I think JETS is just about played out. I like them, but it is what it is"

2021-05-12 11:04:47,stocks,"If the discount rate continuously moved according to fundamentals, then inflation would be a wash since any growth in cash flows would be canceled out by a growth in the discount rate.

Unfortunately, discount rates have been artificially suppressed by the Fed for years, causing asset valuations to continuously rise as the DCF numerators increase with every earnings beat while DCF denominators stay the same. If discount rates were to suddenly correct upwards to where they fundamentally should be in a free market, valuations would crash. If inflation becomes sticky, the Fed will need to aggressively raise interest rates to meet their price stability mandate."
2021-05-12 11:05:19,stocks,It depends on the sector. Some sectors (like healthcare) have revenues that are less impacted by inflation since medication for serious conditions is not really a choice. Most impacted are things like consumer discretionary since people cut back on non-essential expenses.

Its share prices √ó outstanding shares. If you just look at shareprice a company can have 500 million shares outstanding and be a multi billion dollar company at 5 bucks per share.

One of my picks that I currently think is undervalued is $SFT shift technologies. They are a second-hand online cardealer that are expanding pretty rapidly. Just released a pretty good earnings report. There's also some good DD out there, specifically the video by Thewalrusstreet on YT."

Another company Y that has 1 billion stocks outstanding with a price of $1 per stock is also valued $ 1 billion by the market.

I'm keeping all my banks and financials too. I think they still have a ways to run. The Fed has handcuffed them during the Covid crisis but they will allow them to resume buybacks and raise dividends in June.  I'm still willing to buy more BK but I'm too heavy in financials as it is so I just bought TM instead.  WFC is another good pick,  the fed will eventually remove the asset cap and it should jump a bit.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Hedging via local markets So since February we had kind of a bear market for tech stocks, a lot of stuff dropped, some things dropped more than 50%. From what I see, people have different ways of hedging in situations like that. The majority decided to rotate growth stocks to commodities, some moved their money into —Årypto, some are sitting in cash.

I wanted to discuss hedging via the local markets.

I live in Poland. Let's take a look at one of the local companies traded on Warsaw's stock exchange: [https://imgur.com/a/74npreU](https://imgur.com/a/74npreU). I find it hilarious that while the stocks of huge sophisticated tech companies are dropping, the stocks of a local producer of smoked sausages (everyone loves them!) has risen +125% since the beginning of the year. It beats S&P500 and all giant companies, it has reasonable P/E, it's well defended against the inevitable inflation - when the food price rises the earnings of this company should also rise. It looks like a great opportunity to hedge against the current market conditions. I'm also pretty sure that every other country has some local equivalent gem. Do I miss anything? I think the only problem might be the liquidity, but other than that everything looks great, right?"

I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips.
 
since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now? (I am also contemplating between buying a few picked diverse stocks, a good ETF and dividend Vs growth).

Here are some stocks I've been looking at if anyone's interested in giving me some advice about my picks:
s&p 500, $BOMN, Realty Income Corp,
Innovative Industrial Properties Inc, hitif, nio, alphabet, Microsoft, apple, marvel, Sony, Nvidia, Samsung, visa, tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Decker's outdoor, Facebook, lupa gold, teva, PayPal."

I'd set up an automatic withdrawal/investment so that I could contribute money on a monthly/weekly basis into a low cost mutual fund.  I had someone set up a mutual fund account for me when I was 18 but they got a commission, I didn't know, and it was a OK fund but had a 2% fee in total. I have fidelity account so I use their funds and there is no minimum balance or a minimum to contribute. Those make up the backbone of my account and then I pick stocks based on my insights/interests. I wouldn't let someone sell me garbage high fee stocks. I also wouldn't mess around with penny stocks. By the time you get out you may have a nice nest egg to start the next step of your life. This strategy won't make you rich but it should preserve and grow some wealth for you in that time horizon. You don't have enough capital to make $$$$ on dividends so you need a balance of growth and stability, and that's what you get with a S&P index fund. Maybe if the market would crater again, then I'd use cash on hand to buy individual stocks, but over time and in your time horizon, dollar cost averaging into a low cost index beats just about every strategy.

Everyone varies, you do you, but I personally would not take out a loan to invest unless it was super low interest or I had really good insight on something or there was a massive market crash...

 >Also am I not better off investing in s&p500 or Berkshire Hathaway which are actively well managed and constantly add successful stocks and remove less successful ones?

Investing in S&P 500 is fine but leaves you ever so slightly more vulnerable due to reduced diversification. It wont really make a difference in your situation though.

Berkshire has actually underperformed VTI (another total market index fund with a longer history) over the last 5 years, and with VTI you don't get the idiosyncratic risk that comes with owning a specific company. Better returns with less risk."

The benefit for you is that the government will match up to 5% of your contributions, so that's free money and you should take it if you can get it.  You'll get to contribute to the TSP as long as you receive a paycheck from the government, whether it be as a federal civilian or reservist (inactive reserve doesn't count).  Regarding rollovers, you can roll over the TSP into an IRA regardless of your future employer.  The 401(k) is the option that's employer-dependent.

Something like 80%+ of traders/investors do not beat the average market returns of the S&P 500.

As others advised, highly recommend learning about the [TSP](https://www.tsp.gov/how-to-invest/).  If you are going active duty I would recommend utilizing this as your primary retirement account before contributing to a taxable brokerage or Roth IRA.  If you are enlisting and will be under E3 your monthly take home pay is quite low but over time advancements will come and pay increases.

Again, the TSP is fantastic and highly recommend spending time to understand how it works and what each fund consists of.  There's plenty of good pages such as /r/ThriftSavingsPlan /r/MilitaryFinance and of course /r/Bogleheads if you want to learn more about passive index investing.

The [L2065](https://www.tsp.gov/funds-lifecycle/l-2065/) already has a 10.05% YTD return which is incredible but surrounded by the rest of the market I can see how it looks off-putting.   

>  but a huge return will be a godsend interms of what I can do with it to get into other investments

This is true but what happens if the market continues to drop as it has and you're down 30-40% as many people on this forum can show for it. I invest outside of the TSP since I'm no longer in the military and my VTWAX is up nearly 10% YTD, slowly chugging along. The individual stocks I decided to gamble with in January are not doing so hot.





 If you plan on using this money in the next 5-10 years then that could change how you manage your portfolio.  But since you're 18 I think you should consider that you have compounding interest on your side and that you have 40+ years ahead of you where this money can grow.

> I have something against bonds so that's also a thing

Many do but the <1% in the L Fund is basically negligible until you get closer to your retirement date. I think the 2050 versions have around 10-20% bonds.  If this is the case you can copy the splits yourself in C/S/I and leave out the 1% of G/F.

I would recommend starting with an L Fund until you are more comfortable with your investment plan and what you want to do with your money in the future. You can always change your allocations on TSP.  It used to be a pain in the ass years ago but now it's as simple as logging in and being done in minutes."

This is what many people do even on /r/Bogleheads although their allocations might be much lower or nonexistent on ""fun gamble"" style investing but I think 90% in long term stable ETF and 10% on speculative/short term is perfectly fine.

Having a strategy and sticking to it is the most important thing imo."

Iran with their funding from US payments will start invading other countries in the Middle East.
The USA which had been oil independent will become dependent again on the Middle East as we find the current government does not like oil pipelines.  Inflation is here and we were going to go back to the type of economy we had during the jimmy carter Administration.

I don't recall any suicides on wall st.  If there were it was a rare thing.  

Wait long enough and there will always be another crash.  It'll also be a great buying opportunity if you've got a stable job.  I always increase my 401k during downturns in the market if I can.

Otherwise yeah, them's the breaks.

Many that lost their jobs had to dip into their funds, 401K, taxable accounts, etc. That meant selling at the bottom for a loss to survive. That also lead to more foreclosures, which were already high due to the oversold market and frivolous loan practices. It snowballed from there. People did lose large sums of money and many lost their nest eggs in 2008.

2021-05-12 01:51:21,stocks,"I‚Äôd argue some diversification within reason is a good strategy regardless of how much money you have. It becomes more important obviously the more you have. At the very least you should diversify within a sector, and then at some point add a second sector as your portfolio grows"
2021-05-12 03:20:07,stocks,"I'm gonna be the boring dude telling you to invest into more secure picks and let it grow. There is a reason why most people lose money, a small group makes less than the market and a very small group beats the market.


But let's view it from another point. And let's ignore investing more over time to make my argument very simple, but I should point out this would be WAY higher if you e.g. added 500 a month.


If you are young and invest for 25 years on constant 10% gains (this is not reality but somewhat close) and then you are young and invest for 30 years for constant 10% gains.


On 25 years that ends in 108k. 

On 30 years that ends in 174k.


See the enormous difference? It's not just a tiny bit thats lost and it's on such a small amount (small compared to what most should be able to with investing more and more).


To show how extreme this gets with investing more I will add 6k for 2 more years (500 a month) and add 10% to the year 1 investment, so that's 6600. The initial 10k is now 10000+10%=11000, 11000+10%=12100. Total of 24700 (6000+6600+12100) after 2 years are over and 2700 of returns.


This time 2 years passed so we use 23 years and 28 years with 10% a year.


On 23 years, it's now 221k vs 108k previously.

On 28 years, it's now 356k vs 174k previously.


And again these numbers are only for investing continuously for 2 years, not the entire time. 


Of course you can gamble and hope to hit a very big one, kick start a huge investment and also not lose it, but I guess you should question if you actually need that."
2021-05-12 02:01:51,stocks,Younger investors should have most of their money in low fee total market ETFs and leave a little to play with so that they eventually decide they are better off having all of it in low fee total market ETFs. This is a good lesson to learn young.

2021-05-12 04:03:31,stocks,"Ive made my own portfolio of like 25-40 stocks. Tried to keep it spread out to almost every sector with 2-3 companies that i think are trading for the best value from each sector. So far I've out paced the market with my individual picks. I'd say if you know what you're doing, building up a diversified portfolio of several stocks you believe are winners is a great way of investing. Putting all your money in one or 2 winners is probably not a good idea though."
2021-05-12 12:41:38,stocks,"Depends on your goals and risk tolerance.  If goals are to save up money for retirement, then indexes are the way to go.  If your goals include having fun picking individual stocks, then gamble a little bit and you might hit a jackpot.  I personally keep 2 brokerage accounts, one serious, one play.  This helps me keep a balance between the two strategies.  My thoughts for young people are just to invest something affordable every paycheck, even if it's just $10-20, just to get into that habit and letting the account grow."
2021-05-12 13:52:23,stocks,"With relatively little money on hand, higher risk/ return would probably be more prudent to actually make anything meaningful. 

However, gains made this way should be reinvested into lower risk assets, such as strong companies, RTFs, REITs, etc. This also provides a solid backstop should you wish to utilize leverage in the future as well. 

Be aggressive, but don‚Äôt overextend."
2021-05-12 18:24:24,stocks,Mark Cuban and Warren buffet HATE diversification.  It‚Äôs for people who don‚Äôt know what their really doing.
2021-05-12 08:25:42,stocks,"I'd argue the opposite. In a Roth especially, any dollar lost is unrecoverable as you can only put a limited amount in, and only earn a limited amount at younger ages. I'd argue any dollar lost is worse at younger ages because you're missing so much opportunity cost. Save the riskier plays for when you have disposable income.

Index funds for first 5-10 years of accumulated wealth so ensure the money grows and stays yours and you don't make stupid plays while you're learning."
2021-05-12 11:37:51,stocks,But if you diversify instead of picking the wrong stocks your vase amount will grow when you are still young which is going to result in a considerably more amount of money later in life.
2021-05-12 14:58:14,stocks,"So I don't disagree. But, when you're younger your effort is probably better spent trying to increase income. When I first started working, I was making 65k and saving roughly 20k a year. That means a 10% raise/promotion equated to a 32% increase to savings rate."
2021-05-12 09:36:37,stocks,"No way, young investors shouldn't have a retired person's portfolio. 

Youth is the only time in your life where you're free to take risks with no long term consequences.  This is the time to take risks and learn.  That doesn't mean go all-in on a meme stock, but you should be focused on individual stocks rather than low beta ETFs."

2021-05-12 15:00:34,stocks,I agree.  Investing in yourself is important and will enable you to be a better investor.  Basically mandatory to do today.  If I didn't cert up and upgrade my career I wouldn't even be viable for investing in the market.
2021-05-12 11:40:04,stocks,The opportunity cost from losing money on stock plays when you are young is HUGE. The fact that something like 90% of people can't beat the markets means you will be much better off growing your money through index funds when you are younger so that money starts to compound over a larger period of time.

2021-05-12 12:05:24,stocks,"Your entire premise is that these young investors can beat the market, when 90% of people cannot. For 90% of new investors, they are going to have considerably more money saved at the end of 30 years of investing by investing in ETFs such as VOO or QQQ. The person saving 10k a year for the first 5 years of their investing life is going to have a lot more money saved at the end of 30 years compared to the guy who took risky plays and wiped put their portfolio for their first 4 years of investing and finally won big and accumulated 50k at the end of their 5th year of investing.

2021-05-12 12:55:22,stocks,"No, I'm not suggesting that young investors can beat the market.  I'm suggesting that this is the best time to learn to give them a better chance of beating the market later.

90% of investors don't beat the market because they make human mistakes.  They panic during selloffs, sell prematurely, don't cut losses, average down on bad investments, and so on.  If I learned these lessons when I was young, I wouldn't have made them in my 30's and I would have a hell of a lot more money than I do now.

Any investors who bought and held stocks like AMZN, AAPL, NVDA, BKNG etc., ten years ago, have beaten the market by a wide margin."
2021-05-12 11:41:49,stocks,And how would you know that if people don't take the opportunity to learn...
2021-05-12 11:47:10,stocks,"I don't get it.  If the stock is good, just hold and average down and you will see massive gains anyways.  It is easier, more profitable, and just as dependable long term as any diverse investing strategy.

If your initial down is 10 grand you can't do this.  If it's 800-1000, you can average down REALLY fast on a big dip.  It's literally not relevant.  Long term investing has higher returns than any other investment.  Furthermore new investors are not good at picking buy prices but are okay at picking good stocks.  This has the least risk in general for new investors with small portfolios, and helps them learn better I think too, by focusing one stock to start.

If you keep rebuilding your portfolio because you can't pick ANY good stock, how can you pick a diverse portfolio?  You'll just be picking more losers.  Being diverse doesn't make you smarter at picking stocks."

2021-05-12 12:03:27,stocks,"I just don't see this as an argument, convincing me that young investors can't pick one stock well, so they should be able to pick 7 well.  They either can or can't pick a stock well enough to see gains, and if they pick 3 bad stocks and 4 good ones vs picking one that's good, but buy all at bad prices, they're gonna be able to manage the downturn in their portfolio a lot easier with only one stock to average down or pivot from.

Something only someone with zero futures trading experience or knowledge would say.
[*or as a joke - as explained*]

Unless you trade with the specific intent of delivering, (by providing notice) your broker will either automatically close or roll your position. 

Most stock traders are completely stunned when they see how fast they can bust a futures account. It's hilarious. 

Caveat Emptor!

Edit to note the comment was originally meant as a joke. üòâ"
2021-05-12 11:56:22,stocks,"Lol, tell that to the investment banks who tried building warehouses to hold commodities back in 07-08 lol. Not all firms/people that buy futures are traders btw and many of those firms actually do buy or sell with the intent of delivery. Anyways, he asked what was the best way to follow the commodity price, and while not practical, buying the physical product/resource would technically be the way(also it was said in jest.)"

But is there actually any real connection between a companies market cap and its financials? Like there is idea that you want to invest in good companies with good ratios and balance sheets but does that stuff actually have any direct impact on what a companies market cap would be? Because I can‚Äôt think of any besides If the balance sheets show it might go bankrupt, or that if you care about dividends and want a positive eps. But it‚Äôs pretty obvious to see if a company might go bankrupt, and even when it does it doesn‚Äôt always mean a low market cap (gme case and point). And most people investing don‚Äôt really care about dividends. Can y‚Äôall educate me on this thank you üòÇ"
2021-05-12 01:15:48,stocks,"Depends on what companies your looking at. 2020 was a unique year. Multiples for mature industries look pretty normal if you use projected performance.

If you're looking at 2020 or LTM 2021, multiples are going to be crazy. 

Dividends tell you a story. But not the story that most of the traders on here understand. High dividends means low growth and potentially unsustainable payouts (look at $T's dividend. The stock price doesn't think it'll last in perpetuity). No yield can tell a story of growth or financial stress. 

Anyways, young an investor should be indifferent between capital gains and dividends. But you should be aware as to what the dividend is telling you. 


Conclusion: yes financials matter and they impact market cap. Thanks for coming to my TED talk"
2021-05-12 02:39:16,stocks,"Well if you discount your projected future cash flows and it matches the market cap, then you would say a company is appropriately valued. It completely depends on your growth assumptions. You could be very optimistic and think everything is undervalued. You could also be very pessimistic and think everything is overvalued. It all depends on your personal opinion."

2021-05-12 00:30:56,stocks,"Oil. We aren't even fully reopened yet and oil prices are past pre-covid. Heres a couple reasons I think it'll go higher (and why 70% of my portfolio is in it!)

1. Oil is still VERY necessary in our economy. Yes renewables are the future, however the timeline is still 5+ years. The world needs oil for the foreseeable future, and ESPECIALLY in order to make this massive transition to renewables.
2. People are dying to travel and go on vacations. This is assuming COVID ends by mid summer for North America, but the amount of travel by the end of this year is going to be insane. 
3. Oil supply. Well, what's left of it. The oil majors have been burned one too many times. Most probably aren't going to push a lot into capital spending to raise production levels because why would they? They know their commodity isn't the future, so why pour more money into it? They can still reap the benefits of higher revenue simply by cutting back supply. 
4. OPEC. This one is speculative, but I think OPEC has finally realized working together to corner the supply into the market is better than fighting for lowest dollar. Saudi caught everybody off guard a couple months back when they cut production by 1M bb/d, which I don't think they've ever done. Moving forward, I do honestly believe they will work together to ensure higher oil price by cornering supply, but once again its speculative. Maybe not Russia, but nobody likes them. 

Everybody loves to hate oil, but its a necessary evil for the mid term future, and unless that is recognized we are going to wind up in a supply crunch pretty soon."

Not saying it's the right way, but I have low cost index funds in my 401k, a broad base of VT and SCHY plus some individual stocks in my IRA, and a few individual stocks in my wife's IRA.

Overall, the majority is in my 401k, VT, and SCHY, and I plan to always have at least 60-70% in these low cost, diversified funds, with the other 30-40% mostly blue chip, dividend type stocks (with a growth stock or two sprinkled in here and there).

So, this shouldn't be taken as financial advice, but my personal suggestion would be to move most, if not all, your stuff to VTI (or VTI/VXUS for the international exposure, or VT if you really want to simplify things to the ultimate extreme), build that up, and then if you want to get back into a bit of stock picking keep it to less than 10% of your total portfolio."

Following the [link](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio):

and finally:

> I completely disagree with that approach, just stating that point of view.

I'm actually a huge boglehead and pretty sure the 3-fund is the most popular recommendation on the sub. If you need more convincing:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/search?q=international&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all

It's almost consensus that international should be added.

Now Jack on the other hand has different opinions. But if you're gonna listen to Jack over the current Boglehead consensus, buy S&P instead of VTI, and don't get international i guess"

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"AVNW ... I don‚Äôt understand I own this stock and I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs tanking? Just a month ago, it was a strong buy, but now it looks like it is a sell. I looked at its financials and if I‚Äôm reading it right it all looks positive. So why would it just start tanking like it is. Am I missing something?"
2021-05-11 21:17:54,stocks,"Firstly, the stock isn't tanking. Tanking is 50%+ losses. Go look at SPCE, ENPH, MAXN, TTD, LMND. That's tanking.

Also, AVNW is only down 25% from its peak in April, while the entire tech industry and growth is down. Also, its basically at its February heights, which means the stock is well positioned.

Okay, lets look at financials. Their margin is 38% with 8% YoY growth. They were priced at $10 in October and are $30 now.

Also their revenue for the year is targeted for $265M for the year and their market cap is $331M. Their P/S is 1.1. Since their revenue growth is only 8% YoY, with 38% margins, I don't see their stock price going far beyond $40 without good PR or projections to expand into  broader markets.

Slide 13 of their investor presentation says there is a growth opportunity in rural broadband. And slide 7 says they have 6% of their TAM of $3B, and that the 5G growth market is 24% CAGR to increase  1.5B by itself.

https://investors.aviatnetworks.com/static-files/35c3c9af-aa0d-42bf-bf3c-d9c04cafcbb6

With all this, AVNW may have a stock that could reach $50 or $60 if they can increase their revenue growth rates. But at 8% growth, they're not going to see super high stock prices without greater growth. But a 1 P/S ratio is really really low. But the industry for microwave transmission (ie. ERIC, CRNT, etc) all have P/S ratios of ~1. Don't expect to rely on a high P/S ratio to drive up this stock price.

$30 seems priced to perfection."
2021-05-11 20:57:40,stocks,"I'll be told I don't know what I'm talking about, but here goes.

It was being shorted from its high of $41 after it split. On May 12th, it bottomed at $28, below the support that was in the mid to low $30s but there were no stop-losses to trigger after the split.  I assume from the lack of volume at that level that a split cancels stop losses.

The short seller was going for a double bottom to pick up some new buyers with stop-losses and they couldn't beat the earnings report. At that point, an increase in price would have hurt the short seller so they shorted way down to discourage buyers who might be encouraged by the report.

If they didn't cover today with the panic selling, they will probably give up. I'd buy in if I hadn't overspent my budget today, averaging down on my favorite companies.

I always look at stock movement as if someone were planning to take my money away from me. It keeps me on my toes and aids in predicting prices. In fact, panic selling looks like a manipulation, except at the very bottom."

2021-05-12 06:37:33,stocks,"My only advice to you as being a newbie. Instead of asking ""why is this stock tanking"", write up your post in this way:

***
I bought XXX at price $Y because I thought it was fair market value (or under value) for these reasons: A, B, C.

Now I see that the price has dropped by $Z, which gives stock XXX a new fundamental profile of P/S, P/E and P/B. I was expecting XXX to go to $W price by date $D based on these catalysts. Am I still accurate in my predictions?

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hype I feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury. But the allure of having a Tesla in my opinion is that they are different and unique, not necessarily that they are electric. They are like the Macbooks of cars.

Now I get creating an affordable electric car, and marketing it as a cost saver in gas and maintenance, but I believe trying to compete with Tesla in their little market of cyberpunk LARPERs is suicide. As an example... Ford just announced an electric f-150. As far as I know, there are two kinds of people who own f-150's: 

1) Blue collar workers who's only consideration in buying a truck is that it does the job for as cheaply as possible, they could care less if it's with a gas or electric truck.

2) People who want to compensate for their fragile masculinity by driving the biggest, most noisy, gas guzzling, obnoxious atmosphere killing vehicle they can get their hands on. In which case, electric might be a negative if anything. 

GM seems to be throwing all of their eggs into the electric vehicle hype. They are planning on transition all their vehicles to electric by 2035.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement. I don't think either care about fuel source."
2021-05-11 20:22:00,stocks,"I would say it's not that black or white.

I forget which US automaker, but I believe it was GM tried to legislate for EV cars as far back as 2015. However, if I recall correctly, they were told it is not the right time.

Renewable energy makes sense, given climate change. But I agree with you, it's obviously not just about preservation or EV.

Given the state of the market, the gamification - not through the app itself, but through the communities, I would say an overwhelming majority do not care about the tech, company, or assets they are investing in. Just get rich, or die trying. But you can only get rich in one day, otherwise you are a boomer and it isn't worth the time."

* The company was quick to embrace technology. 1.5M app users, app users order 4x per month, \~80% of digital orders during Covid (\~50% before).
* Forward thinking management team paranoid of not becoming the next Blockbuster. The team sees Nike and Starbucks as aspirational role models. 
* Obsessed with owning the customer relationship (via app and comms). Sees DoorDash and Uber Eats at existential threads to restaurants. 
* Distribution channel innovation: in-store pickup is a large business, over 700 Outposts (batched delivery pick-up points in density offices and apartments; these can be served from ghost kitchens), and white-labeled delivery (order through SG app, fulfilled by Uber Eats for a low fee). 
* Created back-of-house production kitchens to fulfill digital orders. These can are higher margin than front-of-house lines. Also leaning into ghost kitchens to serve delivery (these save money on real estate). 
* Thinks about restaurants economics at a market level versus a unit level. For example, the company may build a larger, more expensive flagship store and then smaller stores and ghost kitchens in the same metro.

2021-05-12 05:50:35,stocks,how can such a business generate such immense losses!?
2021-05-11 20:26:09,stocks,"With numbers like that, it is no wonder it is down 20% since April 1.

Hedges 4 Fuk"
2021-05-11 20:44:55,stocks,Net loss of $270 million? Sign me up.
2021-05-12 13:23:43,stocks,"If you looked at their earnings, 240M was related to stock awards."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Not a good idea to sell off on a crash day I was in $PLTR.  I almost NEVER sell for a loss.  At least not a big one (relatively speaking).   This morning I did and it has been eating away at me all day.   I know better and I have no problem holding out during crashes.   Maybe it was too early in the morning and my brain wasnt functioning quite yet.  The slow and heavy bleed on tech and small cap has messed me up...haha.   I don't even think I realized it was a hard crash bc of the non stop downward trend.   I have seen multiple ERs go well the last few days and almost no positive movement on the stock.  I didn't see much of a reaction in PLTR at first and thought it was the same story.   I saw that everything was down again this morning and needed to scrounge up some money.   While I have plenty of cash, I don't feel responsible taking any more.   After months of this crap, I just didn't want to take the cash out.   My average was around 20....ughh.    This bear market finally got to me."
2021-05-11 20:17:50,stocks,I sold Nvidia at $40
2021-05-11 20:09:13,stocks,Don‚Äôt look back. Happens to everyone and you will likely do it again. I have done it multiple times. Just learn from it and move on.
2021-05-11 23:04:00,stocks,I didn't mean to sell but placed a limit sell in at 16$ last night instead of placing a stop loss at 16$. You can imagine my disappointment when 9:30 hits and half of my shares of $PLTR sell in the low 17's... fuck my life.
2021-05-11 20:50:40,stocks,"That pre market this morning would scare anyone... My heart sank when i saw Tsla, Amd, aapl and pltr take major dumps, all to somewhat recover after open... I dont see how these MMs perform such fuckery."
2021-05-11 23:51:06,stocks,Just wait for a week and you will buy all your shares back for a lower price.
2021-05-11 20:47:56,stocks,"FWIW, I am underwater on PLTR, and I didn't sell.

I've basically written off my stupid meme stocks.  I recognize I got baggied in the pump&dump.  I'll just hold in case they ever turn around.

i am tying to get smarter and just use worthy Vanguard funds, now."
2021-05-11 21:08:30,stocks,"I'm pissed that I've been stalking PLTR for months, finally saw the selloff I've been hoping for, and failed to get a long position. 

Moron. Nincompoop."
2021-05-12 10:43:41,stocks,"If you‚Äôre going to kick yourself about past mistakes, hate yourself for not putting your life savings into AMZN 10 years ago. Why worry about this one little mistake"
2021-05-11 22:23:53,stocks,"Bro..honestly after the last 3 months I don‚Äôt even give a fuck. I‚Äôll be honest, I woke up at 710am, saw pre market, saw PLTR down like 8%. I went and immediately read their earnings report, literally just turned my phone off after, felt sick for a minute and just decided fuck it I‚Äôm buying more when I get paid on Friday. Went back to sleep, woke up and it was down 6.5%, again told myself fuck it. Finally got up at 945 and looked and the stock was like up 6.5% Checked all my other stocks and they had recovered in green too. Ended the day off + 11.75%. Fuck this market. No point selling. You‚Äôre investing just believe it and let it ride"
2021-05-11 22:55:59,stocks,"When the market is crashing, either buy more shares (of whatever) or turn off your computer.  Those are your only two choices if you want to avoid selling at lows."
2021-05-11 20:13:21,stocks,"Earnings were at 7am? The stock was supposed to go up the earnings was seen in a positive light. That's what happened 99.99% of the time. If someone gives me a recent example or two of a deep red after hours earnings release followed by the opposite during normal market hours?

What happened at 9:30am on the dot, most of the sea of red tech just magically disappeared within 15 minutes. No rhyme or reason.

Don't beat yourself up, it was non-sense."
2021-05-12 06:28:27,stocks,"Write this down. Reflect on it. Revisit your investing notes. Ask yourself why did you sell? Visit any stock graph - especially in growth stocks - notice there are always dramatic drop offs. Imagine you're the person who bought Tesla back in 2018 for $360 and then dropped all the way down to $180 -- that's a 50% cut -- if they just held - they'd have more than 10x'd their investment.   


What I take away from stocks is this. Buy a company you believe will grow and last your lifetime. Is Palantir that type of stock? I'd say absolutely."
2021-05-11 20:32:54,stocks,Tech has been a son of a ##### lately.   We all know Palantir is going to be the Lockheed Martin of big data analytics but it is a long way to make.that profitable.
2021-05-11 21:48:15,stocks,"See if it drops to $18, buy back in... or buy 1/2 @current, if drops to $18... average down w/ other 1/2. PLTR has been riding this up, down $2 wave for awhile now (post insider sell off) ... recently  decreasing, but  fluctuates between numbers( $2 apart ) before any significant price increase or decrease. I‚Äôve noticed this pattern, realized the floor was lowering, sold before red, then bought in lower 2X now. Average around $20 now/  used to be at $26... 

Technically if your avg. was $20 buying back in @$18 (more shares, same $$) and it goes to $25/ $26 (hopefully b/c 46% revenue increase earnings report) would put you in a better position anyway."
2021-05-12 11:00:16,stocks, Lots of folks wish they sold yesterday instead of bottom fishing
2021-05-11 22:10:39,stocks,Bear market?!? It was a 1-2% drop on one day and not even the full day...
2021-05-11 21:02:39,stocks,"I just got done reading the report from 'the market guy' who always seems to have steady advice.

""If the stock market rally rebounds from here, then Tuesday will look like a short-term bottom. But if selling continues, investors will quickly forget a short-lived intraday bounce.""

You can always take partial risk off sell 1/3 or 1/2."
2021-05-12 00:45:45,stocks,Gonna hang onto my VIAC at $38 average for the rest of my life
2021-05-12 05:00:59,stocks,"My husband never learns. He started out maybe 6 months before I did so at first I was always going to him for advice. I can count on more than one hand the number of times he‚Äôs made me sell because my stocks dipped for a day. If I had just held them, I‚Äôd be up more than $10k right now. He does this to himself as well. He gets so easily scared by dips and he never learns from it."
2021-05-11 21:47:57,stocks,"It would help if you stop thinking of days like this as ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù. Look at a chart and zoom out. Stocks go up, stocks go down. If you can‚Äôt handle days like this either dont trade stocks at all or get into etf‚Äôs or something you just put your money in and leave."
2021-05-11 21:58:56,stocks,"I overslept. Badly. 

Thank god. Try that next time. Maybe all the time lol"
2021-05-11 21:30:48,stocks,You'll look back and realize you made the right decision as the PLTR execs continue selling tens of millions of shares a month.
2021-05-11 22:07:22,stocks,"I live in West Coast, it helped me to ignore pre market & early market turbulence and at least have a okay afternoon trying not to worry about stocks. It may sound absurd but you wont know it works until you move there."
2021-05-11 22:12:08,stocks,"Listen dude, I had a chance to buy AMD at 20 bucks but I didn't and think it's overvalued. Shit like this comes and goes so often you just have to catch one."
2021-05-11 23:29:00,stocks,My strong conviction with my long will not scare me.  I‚Äôll continue to buy the DIP.  I knew it‚Äôs just temporary .  I already rotated most of my overvalued stocks anyway .
2021-05-12 08:16:40,stocks,">This bear market finally got to me.

&#x200B;

Bear market? We are just few points off the all time highs. S&P set record on Friday, Dow set record on Monday. Perhaps its time for a sober self assessment?"
2021-05-11 22:15:02,stocks,"Cheer up. I'm bag holding (31) on SPCE because I don't want to lock in my losses just yet. I still believe ... I can recover some.

I don't like selling for losses, hell I don't like selling for profit and missing out. But I'm at the end of my rope too. I'm at the bottom though, why sell now?

Oh. There's a new bottom. Why not, it's not worth it anymore to even sell."
2021-05-11 23:19:33,stocks,A lot of good comments in this thread.   Just needed a sounding board
2021-05-12 02:35:08,stocks,If you feel bad now imagine how bad you‚Äôll feel a year from now when it‚Äôs trading at $150 per share.
2021-05-12 04:43:38,stocks,"your sleep & (mental) health is worth more than this.

everyone's guilty of the above, but what i've learnt is to build conviction in your picks, position size & enter in tranches."
2021-05-12 05:48:48,stocks,"Lol I saw premarket, I turned off everything and looked at stuff today. I was surprised I even made some money :D So best thing is probably not touch anything except there is some really shit news."
2021-05-12 06:35:23,stocks,"If it's any consolation, I think the ARK etfs are still at risk of a 25% drawdown. PLTR would likely follow suit in that scenario."
2021-05-12 08:18:31,stocks,You should wait with selling PLTR until 2030 at earliest
2021-05-12 08:25:25,stocks,"It‚Äôs not easy but I don‚Äôt know it didn‚Äôt really get to me that much, it‚Äôs annoying I was invested in 08 and knew a lot of people who pulled out into cash after the crash I just said I already lost and if I pull out I‚Äôll miss the ride up so I just kept DCA like nothing had happened"
2021-05-12 10:06:42,stocks,"What bear market? I see bearish developments, but nothing like 20%+ drop over multiple consecutive quarters...... at least in my portfolio."
2021-05-12 10:06:48,stocks,That's what a bear market does. It wants you to sell. It wants to put so much strain on you that you give up.
2021-05-12 10:44:57,stocks,"I think the difficulty is gauging what is and isn‚Äôt a good stock. If you know for a certainty this will go up, I think more will hold it. 

But Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, etc. are not the norm but the exceptions. 

I believe the overall market will always trend up (and when it doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôre in some serious üí©), but I can‚Äôt say the same for individual stocks."
2021-05-12 13:29:01,stocks,"Let it go and dont beat yourself up. I have sold and reentered multiple times. The constant red days beat you down. Every since it corrected months ago and dropped from $40 its sucked... I‚Äôm holding after reentry and averaging down at around $19. I think this is good and will stay here no matter what for the next few years. Not going to touch it. Anyway, dont be too hard on yourself"
2021-05-12 16:10:19,stocks,"Step away and focus on something else for a while. This takes the fear of missing out away, so you wont need to feel like you need to move money around (i.e. selling off to fund another investment). This has worked for me over the past 2 days."
2021-05-12 17:42:21,stocks,"I, too, have fucked myself in the past. 10/10 - Would bang again."
2021-05-12 19:56:12,stocks,"So, what about AMC at this point?   Saw it has limited growth cuz of so much $ in the hole.  I guess I feel personal about it since I believe in seeing movies at the THEATER!!   They are filmed to be seen BIG.       Will it go up more for next quarter  ( big movie release summer) & then flatten out?    How about Cinemark?"
2021-05-11 23:33:35,stocks,I fell the same. I sold on Friday. Bought in at 10.88 sold at 18.50üò° that was going to be a long term hold for me.
2021-05-11 21:01:43,stocks,I did at $23 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-05-12 03:41:42,stocks,I sold Tesla at $90
2021-05-12 13:47:32,stocks,"Sold Shop at 100

Sold AMD at 15 

Sold Nvidia back in 2015 to lose 98% of my money in Pennystocks.

Your first years will cost you a lot if you're greedy."
2021-05-11 23:17:31,stocks,Sorry to hear.
2021-05-12 19:20:51,stocks,"I‚Äôm totally a newb so correct me, but wouldn‚Äôt a stop loss have the same outcome?"
2021-05-11 21:10:34,stocks,"My stomach sank to my ass hole doing the math with premarket prices this morning. I calculated roughly $25-30g down, then at market open I was only down about $15g, and end of day I was only down about $2g. 

I swear it felt like I won the lottery by end of day."
2021-05-11 22:24:46,stocks,So that explains why yahoo finance sent me an update that sounded like the world ended and then my account looked fine at 2 pm. Thankfully I wasn‚Äôt able to pay any attention in the morning
2021-05-11 22:37:59,stocks,Just saw it as a chance to buy
2021-05-12 06:38:15,stocks,"It wasn't necessarily a P&D. I think we were actually in a widespread tech bubble, PLTR included in that. The bubble started popping a few months ago, and many many stocks are down 30-60% from their highs."
2021-05-11 21:25:32,stocks,"Big risks equal big rewards my friend. PLTR is my high conviction spec stock, I was especially encouraged by their commercial sector growth. Hopefully we see a slow rise from here for the next few years."
2021-05-12 00:22:40,stocks,VTSAX is your friend
2021-05-12 11:52:18,stocks,Do you even know what PLTR does and the meaning of pump and dump?
2021-05-11 23:46:17,stocks,"I ALWAYS buy the dips, but this one caught me off guard. When I saw the premarket prices, I reset some limit orders to lower. Ended up buying nothing, which is a bummer. This was a weird day."
2021-05-12 19:47:55,stocks,"Lol.  Thanks. Never knew how to spell nincompoop, not sure I‚Äôve ever seen it written.  My new word to describe my forgetfulness!"
2021-05-12 11:44:15,stocks,That is definitely a good perspective....haha
2021-05-11 21:34:19,stocks,For every Ronald Wayne a millions investors got out of shitty startups before they went bankrupts.
2021-05-11 21:08:44,stocks,Rub some dirt on it and walk it off
2021-05-11 22:35:04,stocks,10% now would be North of 200B. Man would be the richest man on the planet
2021-05-12 05:25:17,stocks,The question now is what PLTR will be worth in 45 years!
2021-05-12 00:07:12,stocks,I cannot understand why the chip stocks and equip mfgs keep selling off--they should all be printing money at this point with shortages on nearly every electronic device made along with new lines and complete mfg plants being added
2021-05-11 23:14:16,stocks,Makes sense
2021-05-12 08:23:08,stocks,"It‚Äôs so hard to buy when the market is getting smashed on but I think the people who gutted it out and buy this crash, it‚Äôs not even a dip it‚Äôs a full on crash will be the ones laughing to the bank in the end.  The bears can have the 15 minutes I‚Äôm playing the long game."
2021-05-12 01:13:42,stocks,I turned off my brain. Didn‚Äôt have to work till 4pm...woke up at 8am saw market in shambles...went back to bed till 3pm.
2021-05-11 23:17:08,stocks,Great advice!
2021-05-12 07:30:37,stocks,"The whole premarket debacle was the nonsense part of the day. All the tech took an unwarranted hit for no good reason. When market opened, people evidently seen that it was an irrational drop, hence the quick recovery. Premarket is low-volume. Easy to move if there's enough people selling/buying, but it's rarely representative of the market."
2021-05-11 23:16:19,stocks,Thanks!
2021-05-11 22:36:31,stocks,Thank you for making sense!!!!
2021-05-12 11:43:49,stocks,I just got in that too!!   Really feel good about that one and happy to see others echo it
2021-05-12 11:43:18,stocks,"unless you are a day trader, that will never work.   And most day traders arent successful anyway from what I have heard"
2021-05-11 22:12:03,stocks,I wish I could sleep In this late.
2021-05-11 22:55:31,stocks,Think it's overvalued now or was then?
2021-05-12 08:41:31,stocks,"I meant with respect to tech.   The tech and biotech selloff has been real.  $DT, $NET, $BIGC, $AI, $FSLY....well you know what I mean."
2021-05-12 11:42:03,stocks,Not yet at least    haha
2021-05-12 08:36:20,stocks,Oh no you only made like 70% on that investment. You gonna be ok?
2021-05-11 23:46:44,stocks,I shorted AMZN @ $110 but thankfully(only a couple hundred sh) covered @ about $135
2021-05-11 21:59:27,stocks,I was at a conference showcasing NVDA GPUs and the insane things they were doing in 2008.
2021-05-11 22:25:46,stocks,I sold SHOP.TO for like $150 lmao. Had at least 100 shares @ 80
2021-05-12 13:58:59,stocks,Same. Did it at 25
2021-05-12 00:21:45,stocks,"LoL I looked at my portfolio to end the day and thought to myself ""nice! I'm only down $3.5k."" 

Please May, go the fuck away."
2021-05-11 21:23:57,stocks,"Same here, I was down $30k when I woke up premarket.  Was thinking PLTR earnings must have been shit.. saw that the earnings were pretty good, added more shares and ended the day $17k up overall. Still not feeling we are completely out of the tech rotation yet. Seen this story happen several times the last few weeks."
2021-05-11 21:11:32,stocks,You and me both brother
2021-05-12 08:15:12,stocks,It‚Äôs really just a good chance to average down or start new positions but people will miss out because they think they are scared now.
2021-05-11 23:26:55,stocks,"big risks are dumb.  stop trying to beat the game of life.  get more money, invest more money in smart assets, and retire."
2021-05-12 07:40:06,stocks,Seriously. Put some more money into it.
2021-05-12 13:19:31,stocks,I do.
2021-05-12 08:56:39,stocks,"I always buy the dips too.  Except this downtrend lasted longer than my ability to do that.  I have learned that my dip purchases tend to be too much as well.  I think I‚Äôm always convinced if it‚Äôs way down today it must go way up tomorrow.

Lesson learned.  When buying dips buy a little, not a lot.   Of course then when it does skyrocket you look at your very last dip purchase and think why the hell didn‚Äôt I buy more right there.  This is an interesting psychological game because most of the results tend to leave us disappointed in some way."
2021-05-12 06:10:41,stocks,"That‚Äôs greed. In the same way when we set profit goals too high, the want to buy too low is the same thing. Both ways we miss out on taking profits bc both not buying and not selling is fear and emotion taking over and driving something we know to be a good decision."
2021-05-12 08:50:10,stocks,"I set a buy limit for PLTR under the pre-market expecting a dip at open, except it went the other direction. Currently averaged at $25.26"
2021-05-12 00:25:57,stocks,"Exactly, especially during the dot com era. So many companies were trading at insanely high multiples."
2021-05-11 22:10:10,stocks,Where the COIN and NKLA bros at when you need 'em the most?
2021-05-12 05:27:39,stocks,Yeah but if I got the possibility to make a fortune and the downside is 800$ then I'll take that risk tbh especially if I didn't put the 800$ in in the first place to acquire my stake.
2021-05-12 08:37:43,stocks,That's assuming he's also a robot and didn't sell any as the value rose. In all likelihood he would have sold most on the way up to cash in on it. The best investors out there are in fact the dead.
2021-05-12 02:38:29,stocks,How can they sell what they can‚Äôt make???
2021-05-12 09:28:42,stocks,"I think it‚Äôs easier to buy when you know you‚Äôre going to be buying again next week and the week after and the month after. Literally bought @ 15, 18, 22, 25, 30, 35, back down @ 30, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21 lol. The market going down does suck but it also gives a chance to load up at near November levels."
2021-05-12 08:21:08,stocks,"Lmao taking it right to the extreme, I like this guy!"
2021-05-12 09:33:47,stocks,"Most of the people trading are addicts/gamblers.....they can't sleep or ""turn off their brains"" for as long as you claim you did."
2021-05-11 23:36:44,stocks,Also....**Never place GTC stop limit orders**. The shorts see this on the books and MMs manipulate the stock price downward to force your sale. And the stock reverses course shortly thereafter leaving you with a realized loss.
2021-05-12 12:07:12,stocks,He‚Äôs not a day trader. He just gets scared like a lot of ppl when his stocks dip
2021-05-12 09:09:16,stocks,How long have you head your brokerage account?
2021-05-11 22:08:20,stocks,I sent a bunch more money from savings to my investment account. Hoping for blood in the streets. I need to establish more positions.
2021-05-11 21:27:42,stocks,"$47g swing, not bad."
2021-05-12 10:36:50,stocks,"Yeah, I want to pile more  into my VGT as it drops (as I did with PLTR, AMC & GME).

My advisor said that the prognosis for tech is weaker in coming years and advised a move out of VGT."
2021-05-12 00:06:44,stocks,"I disagree, I mean you shouldn't yolo your entire worth into it but you should definitely allocate some of your portfolio into riskier growth stocks that you took the time to research and educate yourself on. Especially if you are younger and can hold for a long time. I think AI data analytics will play a huge role in competition between China and the US and I am glad Palantir has taken a big role in these government contracts.  I was pleasantly surprised at the commercial growth which will lead to the biggest growth."
2021-05-12 00:33:25,stocks,So buy more pltr
2021-05-12 06:05:29,stocks,Within a well managed portfolio it‚Äôs not bad to take some well calculated risks
2021-05-11 23:49:52,stocks,somebody upgraded COIN today to around $435
2021-05-12 08:18:23,stocks,"I don't believe COIN and NKLA really belong in the same sentence, do you?

COIN is the company selling shovels during a gold rush, it's a cashflow machine. Can't comment on the price though, I haven't looked too much into that, but it's a legit business."
2021-05-12 08:16:59,stocks,You can‚Äôt compare Coin and Nikola. Lmfao
2021-05-12 09:47:43,stocks,"Well its alway depend on your level of risk. If you had 800$ in Exxon instead it would be sitting on more than 100k right now which really isn't that much if you compare to apple. But no one knew back in the day what would happen to this small company, meanwhile Exxon had been around forever and was a massive company. If this your style of investing you should just drop 800$ in every low cap startups and hope one of them is worth trillions in 40 years. You might get insanely lucky and turn 800$ in hundred of millions, but if not you would be better buying index funds or solid companies."
2021-05-12 05:43:00,stocks,"It's a shortage, not a complete halt. They're making the chips, just fail to keep up with demand. The demand was inflated by fear which was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

On a red week the forum is full of top posts that say ""duh this was overdue to happen"" followed by a green week where all the top posts say ""duh this is the greatest bull run in history.""

I'm just pointing out that most of what this sub has is confirmation bias which does have it's place and helps with the emotional circus of the stock market. Just remember it's not any better then ""the goons at CNBC."" I can give you just as many reasons for the S&P to be up 3% tomorrow as I can for it to be down 3% tomorrow. 

NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS! Now more than ever.

That being said, I get a bit annoyed with the ""I told you so and everyone should have known"" responses. It's easy to boast when you are right and in reality you could have just as easily been wrong.

It doesn't seem like a big deal until someone who lost a lot of money feels singled out like they are the only one who didn't see it coming. No this isn't about me but more what I witnessed in 2009. 

If a year from now the S&P is down 20% from where we are today we can justify it. If it is up 20% we can justify it. Doesn't mean we know anything today. 

That being said, I'm betting green tomorrow but hoping for red! Need to spend some cash! 

Good luck out there!"

2021-05-11 21:35:29,stocks,"It isn't necessarily always confirmation bias. This sub isn't a singular voice and there are often conflicting voices on the same day and in the comments of the same posts.

 CNBC is a singular voice with hosts that are each individually responsible for their own opinions and the content they air.

This sub is literally over 2 million people.... many with different various opinions and many that argue with each other.

The ""no one ever knows"" narrative is a mix of truth and BS.  If I could predict exactly the dates and times the market would behave one way, I'd be far richer than I am... yes. However, there are an array of variables that do give indicators to be concerned with and react to. We can't pretend like we don't have the ability to research the world and note trends just because we can't predict the exact day, week, month, or even year the party ends.

The problem is we all have opinions to voice that and aren't so white and black, but are we suppose to never voice those opinions?  

For example, one layer of information is the average P/E ratio of the market has been escalating very rapidly this year and it was easy to see parts of the market that investors were placing much money into. No, I can't magically know precisely what happens when, but yes I can reliably say... yes I knew that was too high for the market to stay at for a long time and what parts of the market are causing it? .... I'm still concerned about that metric actually.

On the flipside those of us that told people that parts of the market were riskier than people were making them out to be in advanced, ignored some of us when we mentioned. Yet, if I say the same thing after there is a little bit of red it is characterized as boastful and annoying. The opinion never really changed. 

It wasn't long ago many people were arguing with me to double down on TSLA at $850, that wasn't confirmation bias. It was many people with different opinions often debating each other in the comments of a few dozen similar threads.

Just because the world isn't so literal white and black and we can't predict exact numbers, exact dates, etc... doesn't mean we don't have an ability to observe the world at all. It also doesn't mean we are always right either, but just because someone or something isn't always right it doesn't mean there aren't real observations with predictive value across many instances.

The problem is you're confusing the ability to research the world with some amount of predictive value with being a white and black soothsayer that knows specifics prices and dates. The world is more grey, you can have observations of predictive value over time and will be ahead on average and not nessecarily know what the market closes at tomorrow..

&#x200B;

As for me I like reading other people's thoughts on stocks. I like varied opinions and a bit of conflict. If I buy something, I want to put it through wringer first. I want to know all the bad stuff and dirty laundry on that company and their current strategy and market position. 

Let people issues opinions constantly, I'm just going observe and pick off the better thoughts I read and might not have noticed myself."

I spend hours of boring tedious work finding stock picks with methods I have refined for years. Every transaction is a chance to learn about what happened, what could have been, and what to look for in the future. 

The most important thing is being level-headed and set realistic expectations. If you want to grow your wealth to set yourself up for a better life in the future then a realistic view is knowing the S&P has an annualized return of only 10.9% over the last 50 years. Now you know a minimum target for your portfolio and can plan accordingly.

I have personally sold early many times because I'm more conservative and don't have the stomach for high flyers (I'm the most boring person you've ever seen in a casino). 

Long story short, you can't predict human behavior even close to 100% of the time. This means the market will always have unforseen variability. If you do your diligence and believe you are holding onto the right companies you can use that variance to your advantage."

Personally, I like to pick stocks that are trading in nice swings on almost a three month basis. You‚Äôve got a nice time frame to base your entry/exit point, and just need a little faith for nice, short term gains. 

To be specific, I‚Äôve been watching CENX and GE for nice, regular swing trades. You can make some decent money off of both of these *if* they continue to preform the way they have in recent months. 

Wish you the best of luck."

It was puzzling that there were so many posts about this with about a 2-3% dip in the market at large. In the gme world,.that doesn't even register. I think having lurked in a lot of these subreddits, there are certainly a lot of really solid posts, but there are far more posts pretending to know for the sake of karma. 

Should I buy the dip? 2%? That's not a dip. Just normal ass market movement. I think you're seeing a lot of posts from new investors with 2 brains wrinkles thinking they're experts. Most don't know shit. Same reason I don't post. If I don't know that much shit, I should STFU."

Inflation is transitory.  This is a supply shock cause by reopening while having had production down for a year.

Printing money doesn't cause inflation.

The increased savings from the fiscal support from the treasury and fed are bullish.  If the infrastructure bill passes, the China level growth we saw last quarter will continue into the future.  

As long as fiscal support holds, the earnings reports will continue to beat.

As earnings beat, valuations will seem more attractive.

The stock market is a forward looking metric, that said you have to ignore the daily chatter especially the CNBC crowd, remember they are there for ratings, don‚Äôt ever forget that.
Should of been named The talking heads show  but name was taken by the band.
As far as strategies go, everyone must have their own, it takes a lifetime to learn to invest and understanding the markets, but as we know only a few months for some if your in a bull market. 
Once not to long ago it used to cost money to buy shares of a company, you actually used a phone and a broker( who made you broke by bad investment advise and commissions) so you placed your bets carefully and held for a few years not a few hours or days. 
No one rings a bell for you when it‚Äôs time to sell or buy, make your own choices, dig deep to understand.
Understand what you own, because when the markets tank that‚Äôs when emotions kick in and every cell in your body tells you to sell now and get out, but understanding what your company does where it be chips of corn or chips of silicon
as long as you capisce you can navigate he storms better.

2021-05-11 22:55:02,stocks,"Personally I don't think opportunity cost should really be a factor unless you're a professional trader working with a lot of capital, to the point where even a few digit swings are highly profitable. Generally speaking, pulling from a loss to move on to a ""better"" investment will often just result in a net loss over time, unless your original investment was fundamentally awful or you win the lottery with your next pick.

If you're in a position where your only choices are to hold or sell at a loss to fund your next pick, you're just gambling and no amount of diligence is going to change that. It's much easier for wealthy people to chase opportunity cost because they can dump hundreds of thousands on a falling stock and let it sit while moving onto something else and even single digit returns will be more than enough to justify it."
2021-05-11 22:08:45,stocks,"That's pretty easy to say when you don't actually have to move funds into new assets.

Traders though, may care more about the line on the screen and may bail to find other short term opportunities. 

Reddits biggest downfall is that we cannot see the age, time horizon, experience, goal or risk appetite of the person making a comment. Without that context, we cannot interpret whether someone is ""right"" or ""wrong"". Truthfully, both statements are correct, for a different set of people.

People are looking to satisfy their confirmation biases by grasping for reasons why a stock price goes up or down, in order not to have a cognitive dissonance.

It is the irrational buying and the perceived value, around the framework of supply and demand, that causes prices to go up and down. In the market, that is mostly caused by the whales. PLTR is a decent company with decent fundamentals, but when you have [Blackrock exiting 71% of their position](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n7z2b6/blackrock_reports_71_decrease_in_ownership_of_pltr/), and the CEO is in on this by [selling $350M](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html) of his shares (a massive third), of course it‚Äôs going to go down."
2021-05-11 22:07:03,stocks,"I agree it's irrational because a lot of valuations are dependent on inputs that are based on ""human feelings."" That's part of the reason why people say valuations are more of an art than a science.

Or do you forget things like the toilet paper insanity? People are fucking stupid and act against their own self interests.

It only takes a few big players taking their money out at the same time to cause a panic and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Ever heard of the prisoner's dilemma? People screwing themselves over so they don't get screwed by the other guy. That's exactly what I and many others were counting on.

Make no mistake, a lot of companies were seriously negatively impacted by covid and the lockdowns. Even without the panicking a lot of companies would have lost a ton of money and brought the general markets down. Even a day of lost revenue costs companies millions. This was inevitable either way. The only surprising thing was just how quickly it happened. I expected a month or so of very heavy bleeding across the market while the government scrambled to make a plan and instead it was a full on crash over basically a week.

I bought the bottom(I knew it was the bottom because SPY was already down about 30% at the time and recovery stocks about 80%, which is a rough historical range for crashes and also just a damn good deal in general) expecting to wait a year or two of slow recovery mind you, but when the fed started printing I knew for sure we'd be in for a V shaped recovery.

I will say I don't know what the future holds now. I made life changing money knowing I could be aggressive over the last year. We're not in easy mode anymore that's for sure."

So the talking heads are selling us their own self-fulfilling prophesies (self-fulfilled by mass irrationality.)

When I see that futures are down, I might set a stop sell on something I want to realize profits from and that it might go down because the talking heads are reporting ""omg futures are crashing.""   


At the same time, I might get ready to buy  those things that are predicted to fall.

This. Heck, most people still don't get it that the effects of the pandemic will still go on into  2022.

They look at what's happening in, say, India right now and think whatever strains develop over there will not be able to cross the oceans, one bad enough to drive a nasty 4th wave.

Your right air travel is here to stay. But I think airlines have 3 big issues:

1) We are 2-3 years away from completely unrestricted international travel.

2) Some buiness trips will now be Zoom calls. If that's only 5% its a big hit.

Maybe if they can't solve autonomy, otherwise they very well could still 10x this decade.

Not to discredit the people you work with, but people in the respective industries said the same of renewable rockets and electric semi-trucks, yet SpaceX and Tesla managed to solve that too.

If you haven't read Elon Musk's biography I can very much recommend it. People tend to think the stuff his companies are trying to achieve is impossible, because they aren't working the way the people at these companies are working. At SpaceX and Tesla, people are impossibly dedicated. Working literally day, night and weekend to get stuff done.

What Elon does with his timelines is essentially taking something that people say can't be done in less than 20 years, demand his team does it in 5 and then deliver it in 10. In the meanwhile outsiders are complaining that his timelines suck, but everyone forgets that by the time it's done, they did it in half the time others could've done it.

> I would be too, but not at economically feasible costs. It's already verifiably safer within certain conditions. It's the corner cases that are difficult.

Fair enough. It's difficult to say when something will be economically feasible. There are so many things that can go wrong, especially when governments and regulations are involved. The only hope I have is that once the first country has it working alright, other governments will be scrambling to be the next for the economic benefits as well as the prestige."
2021-05-12 14:41:44,stocks,"I'll check out his bio. What's kind of interesting is that if there was a standard for self-driving cars to work together cooperatively, some of the challenging problems would become easier. 

However, no company wants to do that when they think they can beat their competitors. Also, security then becomes a huge concern. For example, what happens when one car sends out erroneous information to other cars, either due to actual errors or malicious intent?

I suspect that cooperation is something we'll see in like 20 years. It would also help to have road infrastructure that assists cars, but that just introduces even more safety concerns because the cars have to be designed for the worst-case situation of that infrastructure providing incorrect data.

In any case, it's going to be an interesting decade for technology."
2021-05-12 14:53:12,stocks,"Yeah, there's a lot of potential for cooperation, for example removing the need for traffic lights because cars could just drive ""through"" each other like in sci-fi movies.

It's definitely a lot further away though and I think it's a separate question entirely. Solving globally scalable selfdriving requires companies to allow a car to make decisions based on a true vision system, so that it can drive autonomously no matter where it is. The same system should be able to drive on the moon as on a highway on Earth. That's why LIDAR based systems like Waymo's are interesting for certain applications, but ultimately not a true form of selfdriving.

I could see Tesla license their software to other automakers though. If they are right with their vision-based system, others are going to require at least a decade to catch up to them as nobody is currently working on something like that. It would be much easier for them to just license it from Tesla and Tesla has already said they are open to it.

But yes, it's definitely going to be an interesting decade for technology. With the recent developments in genomics I could even see it become as big a transformative decade as back when electricity started becoming mainstream."

2021-05-11 22:25:25,stocks,"SE due to its higher growth and much smaller market cap. Apple is a 2 billion dollar market cap company and when you get that big it is much harder to double in value. For SE, it has several potential doubles in it."

2021-05-12 08:59:34,stocks,I'd say SE but there is way more to it than looking at a chart. Both companies have good and bad sides from an investor perspective and its more about what you value than looking at a chart.

Just look at airpods, they make more revenue selling those little fuckers than many companies make in total. 

Last point, big fish tend to get bigger over time and this is especially true for a great company like apple. Their revenue beat last quarter was larger than trailing 12 month revenue for 333 s&p companies and thats total revenue. 

Sure SE might get better % returns but how much money would anyone be willing to lay down? A 10% gain on 100k is 10k, while a 30% gain on 20k is under 7k. What im saying is risk and reward are real and apple is going to be a safer bet with great upside as well so im personally on their side."

That's why I am not overweight  Apple and am overweight smaller cap companies such as the ""baby FAANGs of Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit, and especially, out of FAANG, Facebook (which is not even at a trillion market cap). The Apple trees don't grow to the sky and stock physics apply. And great companies don't always get bigger - just look at the dead money that Microsoft was for a decade.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed‚Äôs argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, ‚ÄúAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.‚Äù Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve. 

**Highlights**

* [Prices for single-family homes in the U.S. surged by the most on record](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-home-prices-surge-most-141744748.html) in the first three months of the year, with tight inventory levels and a jump in demand generating a rise in prices. Prices rose 16.2% year-over-year to reach a record high of $319,200, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.
* L Brands (LB) said it is spinning off Victoria's Secret. The move will result in the lingerie chain operating as its own publicly traded company
* Lara Mendona, who led the design of Bumble‚Äôs dating app (BMBL) is set to join Twitter (TWTR) as a senior manager of product design.
* Tesla Inc has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub due to uncertainty created by tensions between the US and China, people familiar to the matter told Reuters.
* Boeing (BA) reported 737 MAX jet deliveries fell to just four airplanes in April from 19 the previous month, as the best-selling aircraft struggles with an electrical problem that has re-grounded part of the fleet. The planemaker started delivering the 737 MAX to airlines in December nearly two years after the jet returned to service following a lengthy safety ban, following two high profile accidents.
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials regarding the semiconductor shortage that has resulted in production cuts, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target raises again due to technical issues on our end, will be resolved soon.

I was able to link my Schwab accounts to Yahoo Finance and chart their performance but I can't group all of my accounts together into a single chart (Brokerage, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, Traditional IRA). Does anyone know if this can be done in Yahoo Finance?

Do you know of ANY other website that can chart my portfolio's performance like this? Personal Capitol charts it but ONLY shows my performance against S&P, US Stocks, and Foreign stocks which doesn't help me because I'm mainly interested in my performance against something like ARK ETFs.

The company recently announced there is a issue with its carrier plane called the Whiteknight2.  So now they cannot fly to space as originally planned.  

The maintenance issue was detected moments before they were planning to have a test flight this month.   We don‚Äôt yet know the issue but could add months to the delay.   

What are your thoughts on VirginGalactic and the most recent delay?"

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Nautilus Inc: Exposure to Connected Fitness at 7x earnings Nautilus is a leading global producer of home fitness equipment known for its Bowflex and Schwinn brands of connected fitness bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and strength training equipment. The company is the 3rd largest player (by a large margin) in the fragmented connected fitness industry. The business, led by a new CEO,¬†has executed on a transformational turnaround in its business model. It has shifted away from being a cyclical fitness equipment maker and towards becoming a high margin, subscription-oriented connected fitness company. The redesigned products have been selling extremely well, and the connected fitness subscription numbers are growing at triple digits (albeit from a small base). 

The company is valued at less than 1x sales, 7x earnings, and has 20% of its market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. The stock trades at over a 75% discount compared to public and private peers including Peloton, NordicTrack, Tonal, Tempo, and more.

Q1 numbers reported yesterday afternoon.

Excellent numbers and forward guidance confirms my viewpoint that¬†the company has transformed its business, and at-home fitness is not going anywhere.  


I am also hopeful that they can capitalize on the fact that their¬†treadmills aren't killing children and injuring adults (referencing the mess Peloton has found itself in).

  
**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights:**  


* $206.1 million revenue (+121% YoY)¬†
   * \+143.3% YoY excluding divested Octane Fitness commercial business (sold last October)
   * Blew past Q1 guidance of $145 million to $165 million (+55% to 75% YoY)
   * highest quarterly sales in 35-year company history
* $30.4 million net income (vs. $2.2 million Q1 2020)  

* $0.93 earnings per share (vs. $0.07 EPS Q1 2020). beat estimates by over 100%
* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million¬†market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to¬†+50% YoY sales growth (+51% to¬†+62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription¬†service¬†

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to¬†gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which¬†means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings.¬†

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

  
I have been frustrated that the market was not giving this company much credit over the last 9 months. But as they keep executing quarters like this, there's no way the stock can stay down here in a single digit P/E."

I defined pullback as any drop that did not sustain a recovery for at least a week within a three month time frame. (Note the NASDAQ reached new highs in March 2018 and April 2021 but immediately fell again after 1‚Äì3 days.)

How is that not timing the market?  I know I'll still have at least this much roku in 5 years. 

As far as I'm concerned, it did exactly what I expected last earnings and it's one of the best values in stocks after dropping from 49 to 31.

I know you're talking about Ark, but my point is not all of ark is remotely equal, and it should not all go through another correction or whatever OP was saying. Major difference between Roku and Square and PayPal to PLTR and BFLY."

What about the negative divergence on the CCI that appeared on April 13th or the Sell signal on April 14th ? What about the Stochastics crossing for a Sell signal confirmation on April 28th the day before the Hanging Man ? What about the gaps that needed to be filled at $320.74 ?

2021-05-11 23:36:07,stocks,"Investing based on valuations isn‚Äôt really timing the market. The market can be priced cheap or expensive but even in an expensive market you can hopefully buy a stock that is relatively cheap based on your assessment. 

I‚Äôm not an expert in roku but if your PE ratio is more than 100 than you have priced in a lot of earnings growth. So I don‚Äôt agree you will for sure have at least this much in 5 years or even  10-20 years. There is a significant difference in risk reward investing in roku or any stock depending on the valuation. The higher the price vs your valuation, the lower the reward and the greater the risk. 

All I‚Äôm saying is that no matter how great a company is, there should be a limit to what you would pay for it in order to get a good deal.

2021-05-12 08:48:40,stocks,"Extra risk association with ETFs is a result of the inability to control fund inflow/outflow due to the nature of being an ETF.

ARK funds can't be closed/restricted, so they are subject to inflow/outflow as a result of market performance which is GENERALLY going to form a negative feedback loop (fund drops, outflows start, forcing fund to sell, which considering the fund size and holding size, can reinforce the fund dropping, forcing more outflows, etc.)  You see the opposite effect with inflows when the fund performs well, as they continue to grow positions in potentially unfavorable ways because they don't hold any cash."

I'm not going to wait for you to time proper value on this company, I felt 100x better adding Roku at 280 last week and 300 today than I did adding DIA or JCI or sbux or steel in the last week."
2021-05-11 22:34:15,stocks,"That would be my plan, yes. That‚Äôs one of the advantages of ITM LEAPS, is that you can make similar gains to owning close to 100 shares of the underlying for a much cheaper price.

2021-05-11 21:38:34,stocks,Should have sold at the top if you knew so much.
2021-05-11 23:04:25,stocks,"Yeah I like to go out as far as possible to avoid that time decay. I think it‚Äôs pretty realistic that I‚Äôll end up making money with these. I mean apple only needs to be above 134 in 2 years for me to make money on this last one I just bought, assuming I held till expiration. It was literally just there a couple weeks ago lol. 

I was thinking if Apple were to take a serious dip I might try doing an OTM LEAPS. I have a theory that it would be so cheap at that point it would be well worth the risk. For instance if AAPLE dropped to 100 (unlikely but possible) I might consider doing a 125 strike price which should be pretty cheap at that point. So if I really had conviction in the stock to recover, that seems like a pretty good bet."

I couldn't not understand why people would buy 2023 LEAPS back then, now I totally do. LOL. I like your moderate approach might wait for an opportunity to test it out. I think last time AAPL dipped to $119 some people bought options in anticipation of pop before earnings, it worked out very well. I got in when it was around $128 and got out quick with a small profit. I'm sure your LEAPs will print way before expiry, with the ITM LEAPS, what's your exit strategy?"

2021-05-11 21:58:07,stocks,And your argument is manipulation found would make the price go up?
2021-05-11 22:01:47,stocks,"No, manipulation is what is causing the price to artificially go down. But once their is a share recall there is no way to suppress the price anymore and will lead to all the shares that the HF‚Äôs have shorted to be covered or bought back and when they have to buy back those shares a lot of buying pressure will be created with no selling pressure leading the stock to rise a tremendous amount"

2021-05-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Today's interesting Pre-market. Today's premarket was definitely... interesting to say the least. I opened up my Yahoo finance app and saw literally all of the holdings in my speculative portfolio down anywhere from 4-12 percent. Specifically both $OPEN and $PLTR were down more than 10 percent (PLTR down that much initially after the earnings report). 

Lo and behold, the market opens and everything immediately is up way higher than in pre-market. Now obviously futures are only indicative to some extent and don't actually reflect at which price-point stocks will open but it still leaves you wondering how PLTR can drop more than 10 percent in pre-market off the earningsreport and currently later in the day is trading up more than 8 percent. 

I don't buy all of the tin-foil hat theories that people have come up with since the whole GME saga but damn this is still kinda sus. I mean someone with premarket access could've scooped up some palantir shares this morning in pre-market and be up more than 20 percent within a matter of hours.

I'll give some credit to r/superstonk on one thing here, there's too much leverage being used. That is not wrong. But then I find it interesting that on a day that was essentially a market selloff day (even if no index closed on the lows) that GME basically behaved like a normal stock at the same time.

You'd think it'd do more if there are funds that are getting terminated.

But it is just one day and just something to observe for now. As I have said elsewhere, the thing that will be interesting if you want to stretch it is what does it do if you get a correction that triggers margin calls (which we might very well have already though). If it doesn't do anything then um...the ""MOASS stuff"" is dead, even though you'll still have talk about it months from then."
2021-05-11 21:31:16,stocks,"I'm not expecting a big sell-off, but just to answer your question, I believe that is one of the misconceptions people have. A stock's price does not mean there is that much money is actually tied to that stock at all times. I could easily type in the number $150 into Fidelity to sell a stock that is currently valued at $200. If I made that mistake and sold the stock I would only have $150. That ""extra"" $50 potentially didn't go back into the system anywhere. It just means that someone was able to buy a stock at $150 instead of $200. One could argue that now the other person saved $50 and can put that cash into something else. But what if I told you there wasn't a buyer that was willing to pay $200 and there was someone who only had $150 and bought my stock. Now there is no ""extra"" $50 sitting around or put into any other system. During panic sells, that's essentially what's happening. People are willing to sell their stock at a lower price than they normally would have. As the number keeps going down and down and down, the seller is realizing lower gains or taking on bigger losses. However, the buyer is not necessarily putting extra money into the system anywhere, and might not be saving any extra money because maybe that's all the money they have or the money they were willing to spend to begin with. Therefore, the value of a stock we see on an app ticker does not necessarily mean that's the true value of the stock or the company. When people say Apple had $100 billion dollars wiped out from its market cap in a day that just means people thought Apple was worth that much less. It does not mean that $100 billion dollars went into the system somewhere else. It's only what you could get at that exact moment if someone else is willing to pay that exact price at that time. Unfortunately for us, too often during a sell-off it's hedge funds and others with deep pockets buying the discounted shares because they can afford too (or take out massive loans/margin calls that us regular Joe's can't during those crisis times). However, even in that scenario, no money is ""saved"" and put into the system somewhere else."

I think GME has a great plan to avoid being delisted as they very nearly were a year ago.  I think that plan could also make them a valuable company in the future at around their current market cap or slightly more.

But it‚Äôs hardly more than a plan right now, they have so much work to do and none of it will come easy.  The issue is that the current market cap is pricing in that growth as a certainty when it is far from that.  I don‚Äôt expect another squeeze but I don‚Äôt expect it to dive either.  That‚Äôs my opinion and how I‚Äôve made my plan.

To answer your question‚Äîyes, everyone is in it for themselves. Trading is not a team sport.  Last week a bunch of GME apes ruined discussion at r/daytrading and literally asked users to not daytrade GME as it could hurt the chance of a squeeze.  In a fucking daytrading sub!  How perfectly ridiculous.

Regularly, on all the investing subs I frequent‚Äîdiscussions are drowned out by apes smugly stating that the entire world is in conspiracy against them or copy pasting memish content like ‚Äúthis is the way,‚Äù or ‚Äúi like the stock.‚Äù It‚Äôs beyond absurd and frankly, embarrassing.  There is simply no acceptance amongst apes of a rational discussion on GME, so many like myself have started to call a cult a cult and hope it goes away so everything can go back to the before times when investing rookies weren‚Äôt loudly declaring their hopium to be accepted fact.  

It‚Äôs a bit like watching a cult form from inside a church community that splinters off‚Äîat first you just ignore it, but as it grows and takes over the institution you enjoy you begin to hate it so deeply that you end up dunking on apes on Reddit far more often than you‚Äôd care to.  The simple fact is that the entire market and government, media, etc are not colluding against GME stockholders.  Brokers shutting down buys back in January was in many ways dishonest and shady, but that‚Äôs the game.  It happens, you move on to the next play.  You ask if you should keep your mouth shut and I think as far as the GME conspiracy it‚Äôs not a bad idea.  ‚ÄúBetter to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt,‚Äù is the relevant Lincoln quote, I think.

Generally, P/E Ratios are a bad metric for REITs because they claim a lot of depreciation in their business model. So most analysts suggest using FFO(Funds from operations).

The problem I'm running into is I can't find any data regarding Price/FFO rations for the REIT  market as a whole, on a historical basis. I can do so on an individual company basis, but it would take way too long to compile the data for every REIT in existence.

Those closest thing I've been able to find is the dividend yield for VNQ on a historical basis. I know this can be a decent proxy for performance, because REITs are required to pay out 90% of earnings as dividends to maintain their tax structure. The problem is the data for VNQ only goes back 15 years.

Anyone have any suggestions?"

 **Global Beverage Cans Market (2021 to 2026) - Portable Nature of Cans Makes Them More User-friendly Presenting Opportunities - ResearchAndMarkets.com12:03 PM ET 5/11/21 | BusinessWire**DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 2021--   
The ""Global Beverage Cans Market by Material Type (Aluminium, Steel, and PET), Beverage Type (Alcoholic Beverages, Non-Alcoholic Beverages, and Water), Structure (2-Piece and 3-Piece), & Region (NA, APAC, EUR, SA, and RoW) - Forecast to 2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.  


The beverage cans market is estimated at USD 23.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6%, to reach USD 31.2 billion by 2026.  


Globalization and the free movement of products are increasing. Therefore, packaged material requires longer shelf life, along with monitoring food safety and quality based upon international standards.  


The recycling properties of raw materials such as aluminium and steel also help in providing sustainable packaging. These factors have helped in the growth of the beverage cans market.  


Aluminium is estimated to account for the largest share in 2021 for beverage cans based on the material type segment  


Aluminium is 100% recyclable and contains 35% of recycled content. The rise in demand for sustainability and awareness regarding the environment have been propelling the demand for aluminium cans as packaging options for beverages. Further, the aluminium body offers different graphic designs to grab greater customer attention. It can be moulded in an infinite number of shapes. It can tolerate temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Celsius to 350 degrees Celsius. Aluminium cans have a better carbon footprint than other packaging materials used in the food & beverage industry. These factors have significantly contributed to the growing use of aluminium cans in the beverage cans market.  


The non-alcoholic beverage category of the beverage type will hold the largest share in the beverage cans market along with growing at one of the fastest rate  


Carbonated soft drinks contain carbonated water, vapour, colour, sweeteners, and preservatives. The rise in the production of carbonated soft drinks has resulted in the dominance of the non-alcoholic beverage segment. Moreover, sports and energy drinks play an important role in an athlete's life. These drinks contain carbohydrates in the form of sugar, electrolytes, proteins, vitamins, and caffeine. Thus, increase in consumption of these drinks have help the non-alcoholic beverage segment to drive the beverage cans market.  


Europe is expected to hold a significant share in the beverage cans market globally  


Europe is one of the leading regions, notable for the consumption of different types of beverages. The market for cans for beverages is projected to witness robust growth in the European region during the forecast period. Countries such as Spain, France, the UK, and Italy are among the leading producers of beverages. The European beverage cans market is driven by the high consumption of alcoholic beverages such as beer. According to the European Commission, the beverage industry is the largest revenue-generating industry in the region. France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Spain are the largest beverage producers in terms of turnover. Convenient packaging for beverages is important to attain the consumers' interest. These factors are fueling the growth of beverage cans market in Europe.

2021-05-12 12:28:06,stocks,You‚Äôre talking long term but won‚Äôt consider the impacts of climate change? What?
2021-05-12 13:14:47,stocks,"Climate change is not the number 1 problem, and CO2 is not the number 1 driver of climate change.  They will/have spend trillions on it, trillions of money taken through taxes at that, grifters will(have) get rich off it(like Gore), they have fundamentally flawed incorrect models(first global freezing, then global cooking, now a blanket climate change so they can say they must be right either way), and meanwhile the environment is really, truly being destroyed.  I will probably have passed on by the time it gets truly apocalyptic, but with rivers full of plastic waste in asia and huge increases in water borne pollutants even affecting oceans(mercury, ect) who knows.  The amount of chemicals and plastics dumped in the ocean will eventually cause some species to die off, and if that is a major food chain component like plankton we're all screwed.  It's classic bait and switch political BS, we won't address China and India flooding the skies with pollutants ALOT worse than CO2, we won't address the plastics issue(even Dow chemicals investors voted at +80% for more info on that), won't push for more biodegradable or actually recyclable containers (the recycling you put in that blue bin may be going in the trash depending on your area, the industry is a mess and they don't talk about it).  Politicians push what is easy to scare people with to get control of more money(take from people) and more power(which nets them more money from lobbyists), then they get the public to believe it like gospel while real immediate actionable issues get ignored.  You see what they do with the markets(like up to 2008, ""It's all ok, markets are healthy, no need to worry"" while they personally sell off their own stocks or buy shorts and puts against the market).  There's a lot of people who want to help the world's environment, that's very good. The fact that they are being focused on something the politicians use for their political and personal gain while things that would hurt politicians(plastic and chemical companies have deep pockets and lobby heavily) is bad, that people act like they are in a cult about it is scary.

That being said, steel is still undervalued. arcelor mittal (MT) just had their Q2 earnings come out and they were well above expected EPS. But i imagine there are a good amount of people here who have already heard it.

Arc Light Clean Transition (ACTC) still seems very undervalued, but it continues to drop, so who knows what its floor is before it starts to become a great play"
2021-05-12 07:58:10,stocks,ggii
2021-05-12 02:09:05,stocks,Sell that tesla and buy the disney back.
2021-05-11 20:54:07,stocks,"No. The tech sector is not falling from the sky. No one can time the bottom, and even if there is a massive correction, things tend to bounce back. The sector will recover. When? IDK, but hedge funds find tech ‚Äúfrothy‚Äù 

Now, lets be real here. What stocks are you investing in? At the end of the day, pick stocks that you are comfortable holding, and feel will exist in 10 years. Understand that tech has become a rat race and many larger companies are either buying out or outpacing competition. To avoid disappointment invest in QQQJ/M to assume profits of the entire sector. It‚Äôs always easier that way."
2021-05-11 21:06:18,stocks,"A vast majority of the market is still overvalued. Sure, a lot dipped today and their prices may be lower than they have been in many months, but their prices are still pretty high if you're looking for a \~10% annualized return over the next 5-10+ years"
2021-05-11 21:22:37,stocks,"If you are a long term investor, keep dollar cost averaging in good companies."
2021-05-12 02:20:23,stocks,Is time to average down
2021-05-11 20:21:09,stocks,"Some people don't want to hear this but this is the top for tech. Negative real rates coming in hot, interest rate hikes looking earlier than expected, and inflation-hedged value stocks are absolutely *printing* money right now, not 5 years from now maybe.

Buy as many dips as you want, smart money has rotated into better plays already."
2021-05-11 20:00:27,stocks,"QCOM, BABA, AMD, NVDA, AAPL is on sale."
2021-05-11 20:38:46,stocks,"I would hesitate to say tech in general is ""on sale"", at least any company that has proven its mettle and actually earns money and isn't just straight-up speculation. The only company I've seen that fits the bill is INTC, but its valuations are pitifully low for a large tech company because its market share is under fire. In a market mania where growth projections are everything, the only things ""on sale"" are things nobody thinks is going to grow. Which is sort of to be expected."
2021-05-11 20:41:48,stocks,"I honestly don‚Äôt see anything on sale, any decent plays that aren‚Äôt up double digits for the year? That being said if it‚Äôs long term +10 years maybe"
2021-05-12 02:23:23,stocks,"Long term I think you should buy now. Rotations come and go but tech in my opinion will win out in the end. I bought more of my high conviction names such as Coinbase, Net, and Draftkings. It might not be pretty but in a year I'll be happy with my choice."
2021-05-11 21:04:37,stocks,"I put my money where my mouth is and bought some of the dip today. I‚ÄôM DOING MY PART, SIR"
2021-05-11 23:56:42,stocks,"Not me, ive been buying at every dip. I know retail is getting hammered with media and ‚Äúexperts‚Äù telling them what to buy. Simple logic says people who actually know whats going on isnt going to offer retail free advice and certainly arent looking out for our best interest."
2021-05-12 01:53:53,stocks,How can the correct answer ever be technical chart analysis?
2021-05-12 00:41:11,stocks,"This is good advice, thanks!"
2021-05-11 22:24:45,stocks,Is there a website where I can see the p/e and p/s historical ratios?
2021-05-11 21:12:51,stocks,"When I was starting out I was intimidated with the high prices of individual stocks so I stuck with ETFs. Have 100 shares a piece in QQQ, TQQQ, SPYG, XLK, SOXL."
2021-05-11 21:55:23,stocks,"I'm on the QQQJ/M train right now. I'm surprised Square and Alibaba are missing from those ETFs, especially since Paypal and JD are present."
2021-05-11 21:02:14,stocks,This is what I was thinking about - if it‚Äôs too late to capitalize on the sector rotation I might as well keep putting my efforts into tech in preparation for another rotation.
2021-05-11 21:04:56,stocks,"I guess it‚Äôs subjective, all of the stocks I‚Äôm invested in seem to be on sale considering the huge negative returns I‚Äôm seeing. My QQQ LEAPS option I bought weeks ago started the day with a -$1800 total return"

2021-05-11 23:55:05,stocks,"He owns like 1% and has no material interactions within the company anymore. If something as frivolous as a bill gates scandal triggers a sell off, you bet your ass im buying more."
2021-05-11 20:39:24,stocks,Like a divorce?
2021-05-11 23:58:19,stocks,Hell yeah!! Stocks are on sale
2021-05-12 00:13:44,stocks,"Exactly, everyone has their own agenda especially media. They tend to end up causing a panic over literally anything they can grasp onto convincing retail to buy high and sell low. Probably real good for clicks, not good for making rational investors out of the public"
2021-05-11 21:25:40,stocks,"Apple is pretty much a savings account replacement


This is dangerous to keep repeating"
2021-05-12 10:07:56,stocks,Charts tell you when to buy a stock and when to sell it because they don‚Äôt take into consideration what a stock is worth just where it is going. How many times have you seen a stock that‚Äôs undervalued go down and one that is overvalued go up ? Now I do think Fundamental analysis is important and you should do both but knowing where you are in the cycle is important. ‚Äú Don‚Äôt catch a falling knife ‚Äú etc.
2021-05-11 23:38:00,stocks,"Koyfin is decent for there, this is a valuation template that shows historical PE."
2021-05-12 10:03:48,stocks,I personally will do the math myself. It‚Äôs not hard just EPS for each year divided by the stock price at the end of the year. You can also do it by the end of each quarter and see if seasonality plays a part in how the share price fluctuates to get the best entry. For price to sales just figure out the revenue per share but keep in mind if they don‚Äôt make money you are speculating and know it‚Äôs a riskier part of your portfolio
2021-05-11 21:21:04,stocks,"Just my own personal opinion here but I think there is still a lot of room to run on value. Considering tech had a solid 10 year bull run commodities has atleast 2-3 years to go imo so it's not too late at all, in fact just beginning really."
2021-05-11 20:48:56,stocks,How‚Äôs he trash?
2021-05-12 07:00:50,stocks,"Can think of many. .. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, AMD, Alibaba, JD, Salesforce, Pelaton, Sea ltd, atlassian, Pinterest, Etsy, Crowdstrike, Fiverr, Teladoc, Square,  Unity, Tradedesk etc etc
Good companies, many are cheaper than before"
2021-05-11 22:26:38,stocks,I think he/she is talking about the Epstein connection.
2021-05-12 10:18:39,stocks,like more epstein connection stuff
2021-05-11 23:41:16,stocks,"Stock market is forward thinking, things get priced in far in advance and then the news gets sold. See here renewables, semis recently, ecommerce over the last year (big moves by AMZN, BABA, etc followed by stagnation/selling).

Be careful chasing the value/dow rotation for the same reason, that shit has been going up far too quickly since november and will suffer the same fate as rotation out of expensive ""value"" stocks back into now much cheaper tech.

Easiest way to avoid this nonsense is to buy something like equal-weight SP500 fund which will be insulated from rotations in and out of big tech until all of this economic boom cycle is over."
2021-05-11 23:19:07,stocks,You live life on the edge my friend
2021-05-11 23:30:19,stocks,"What about the PE of a lot of the value stocks - KO, etc. I don't doubt they have momentum now and near future, but how long will that continue when they are so high of value as well?"
2021-05-11 22:50:28,stocks,I kind of think the same.. Which commodities are you looking at right now?
2021-05-12 07:14:43,stocks,Thanks will check
2021-05-12 00:14:51,stocks,Citadel
2021-05-11 22:32:49,stocks,"I just did this as a 16th birthday present for my niece back in December.  I had her mother (my sister) set up a custodial account in both of their names.  Her mom then purchased five shares of AT&T in the account, and I wired her the money to pay for them.  (I'm not saying $T is the single best investment on the planet, but it was a good choice for this action.)

It was a very simple process, actually."
2021-05-12 14:47:43,stocks,EV stocks never should have gone as high as they did in the first place. Never.
2021-05-11 21:16:29,stocks,Best post gets 4 down votes...this site.

2021-05-11 20:01:12,stocks,That‚Äôs normal. Stock is a long game. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable having more losses than gains most of the time this is not your game.
2021-05-11 20:06:15,stocks,"Dont have a reddit portfolio is my advice. Just buy VOO or learn finance and do your own analysis. All the pumped stuff on reddit is usually garbage tech stocks or garbage growth. Pltr, nio, arkk, etc arent a good portfolio."
2021-05-11 20:54:34,stocks,Buy when it feels bad
2021-05-11 21:05:26,stocks,Start shorting stocks

2021-05-11 21:28:19,stocks,"I am starting/learning too. I'm letting the pros do my analysis... I pick my stocks from SP500 or NASDAQ100.  If they are red, don't sell, do hold.

Except $ETSY. Not an advisor, $ETSY is making me grumpy."
2021-05-11 22:43:10,stocks,lolz you shouldn't be investing...complaining about being down 300 dollars..go read some books to see how things work..I come to reddit for reassurance and for the laughs...red days are the best if you want to laugh
2021-05-11 23:50:16,stocks,"Vitards. It is a sub.

Steel, copper, coal, corn, basic materials, and stay far away from anything that is built with a chip for a few months."
2021-05-12 01:30:10,stocks,It's not about being exclusively up. It's about beating the market over time. Even if your stocks are down they might now be as down as the market is on a bad day - which is still a win even though it feels bad.
2021-05-12 02:34:46,stocks,This is a bad place to get investing advice
2021-05-12 03:06:47,stocks,"What is your goal in terms of gains and how fast do you expect these gains? I have about 10 different stocks. Some are short term play (selling within a year) so I worry a bit if it goes down 30%. Others are mid or long term plays. I have a stock from a company that is really hurting me on paper but this is a long hold for me (5y+) So I really don‚Äôt care as I‚Äôm confident it will be a totally different story in a few years, or at least I hope so. So try to be realistic about how much gains you expect and within which timeframe."
2021-05-12 03:25:25,stocks,"Reverse your actions, Short the stocks that you like"
2021-05-12 04:05:39,stocks,"Buy like 50 stocks, all with the stipulation that they have higher earnings/sales year over year. They can't all go down..."

2021-05-12 06:30:18,stocks,GE? They‚Äôre a terrible company. What are the things you‚Äôre looking at that made you buy that company?
2021-05-12 10:57:15,stocks,"First advice, dont take advice from the internet too seriously, its a confirmation bias hell. Second advice, have patience. Third, etf‚Äôs is a very good place to start."
2021-05-12 13:38:24,stocks,Just buy the SP500 and forget about it
2021-05-11 20:17:07,stocks,"Honestly that seems the way with everyone. Even financial advisors and people who make a living off of picking stocks aren't always right. But I agree with you, reddit is even harder to tell"
2021-05-12 05:09:21,stocks,Started investing in February. Your words are my words brother.
2021-05-12 08:18:13,stocks,"One thing I'll have to be grateful for from start investing in February and not last year is immediately entering the market with a far more rational and cynical outlook and not expecting more out of it than I should. My brother thought he was an investing hotshot last year but honestly anyone would look like a stock guru investing in that market. 

It's in times like these where good fundamentals really show."
2021-05-11 23:31:04,stocks,March and April didn‚Äôt get the memo because they sure as shit didn‚Äôt have a massive sudden leap upward.
2021-05-11 21:15:53,stocks,Good choices. have vtsax and schd in my roth ira.
2021-05-12 00:42:18,stocks,"Definitely no shame in index funds. I have all of my retirement in index funds which have been doing VERY WELL. My individual stock poorfolio on the other hand is bleeding me dry each day. 

Glad I diversified right now. It's been keeping me sane throughout this madness."
2021-05-11 23:33:33,stocks,"Why try? Why is market performance a bad thing to you?  You're not losing by matching market performance, you're fucking winning beautifully. Just look at the OP.  The sad sack keeps losing trying so damn hard to beat the market, when you could have peace of mind and get the market's beautiful gains."
2021-05-12 02:02:54,stocks,LOL..!! True.
2021-05-12 07:50:37,stocks,You are not alone!  Same boat here.
2021-05-12 02:55:21,stocks,"No offense, but technical analysis is a tool, how it‚Äôs used depends on you. You can give me a gun, but with my level of expertise I‚Äôm more inclined to shoot myself in the foot than hit my target.

When did you do the analysis? What were your conclusions on the company? Have you gone back to check if any of the technicals have changed? Just like any analysis, things change. Technical analysis needs to be revisited from time to time to see if it still leads to the same conclusions.


It comes down to if you‚Äôve done the work and did you learn enough to be confident in your decisions. Just because the price is going up today doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt drop like a brick tomorrow."
2021-05-11 23:36:08,stocks,"I've been doing things like, getting ahead of stocks before they go up, then taking gains (usually short term, sadly) when they fall. I was in chip stocks and micro caps as they were going up, then exited as they broke down. That part seems okay, actually, though it only works in trending markets. Again, I have core positions and hold those. I am mainly trying to enjoy the game, and teach myself about risk management as a trend follower. I'm literally okay either way as I won't starve."
2021-05-11 21:12:10,stocks,More like the past 5+ years.
2021-05-12 06:10:41,stocks,"I think they made a lot of money on selling a some ownership in their real estate business which skewed their numbers a lil bit the one quarter and subsequently the year. So they may not be expecting the same numbers. But the numbers don‚Äôt seem right especially with the expected numbers jd has on their upcoming quarter and the expected growth of China. JD can lose to Alibaba and lose market share to Alibaba and they will still grow their numbers rapidly. That‚Äôs if you believe in the growth of China. 

Do your own DD."

2021-05-12 01:20:03,stocks,"to add: I think CNI will not be approved since they already have a major N-S line, and CP+KSU would still be the smallest of the class 1 railways in NA. The railway board of elders seems to have approved CP placing KSU in a trust in recent days, so that's more momentum.

And, I think I read that each KSU share will be credited with 0.49 shares of CP + 90$? I'm not positive on that, or how that related to CP's recent decision to split 5:1."
2021-05-12 09:57:59,stocks,Of course I does. I am only saying what I think the Fed will do. Interest rates have been low for a record period of time and I do not think they should be artificially kept low. But I think they will stay pretty low because the American consumer economy is largely debt driven now.
2021-05-12 00:04:57,stocks,Everyone knows inflation is real but the fed thinks it‚Äôs temporary and I personally believe this to be true since supply chains and bottlenecks will be resolved once everyone goes back to work.
2021-05-12 08:40:46,stocks,Corporate tax hikes won't affect companies that don't pay any in the first place!
2021-05-11 20:40:11,stocks,It sure affects the growth and bottom line of any company no matter how large or small
2021-05-12 08:49:21,stocks,"Dear god, you would think that people on a financial themed forum about would be more educated. When the corporate tax was dropped to 21% it was small businesses that benefited most. They were able to reinvest into their business, pay their employees more, upgrade equipment, and grow their business in general. I know what you mean by predatory capitalists exploiting the system, but small businesses are the ones that concern me the most in reference to the tax hike. Looking at massive corporations is definitely something that needs to be addressed, but to think that it doesn't affect half of all employers in the United States is just ignorant."

But I‚Äôve noticed since this post that unfortunately a lot of the tickers I have on my list don‚Äôt have P/Es available."
2021-05-12 16:16:55,stocks,That probably means that the stocks you own don‚Äôt make a profit. That‚Äôs not necessarily horrible but it is definitely risky

2021-05-11 23:04:02,stocks,"Just like in '99 and 2000, there is some game changing tech out there. 

This one might ring some bells, but I think Netflix is on the path to being the next AOL. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but I wouldn't touch the stock. There are deep content pools that legacy studios are putting together that will really eat into Netflix, including, ironically enough, the assets of TimeWarner formerly owned by AOL which are now the bundle that is HBOMax. 

Any company that isn't an existing conglomerate (like Amazon) that has the word ""cloud"" in its short description worries me. Don't get me wrong, the so-called ""cloud"" is really cool, but I suspect it will be like the old telcos that spent tens of billions burying fiber. Of course, in the long haul that fiber was needed and it was critical for rolling out the data hungry streaming model, but a huge percentage of it got placed and then sat dormant. It absolutely buried companies that were high fliers (you have to understand it wasn't just a dot com bubble, there was an entire telecom bubble as well). A lot of stuff with ""cloud"" in it will probably find a similar fate. There will be winners just like Amazon eventually gained the title of internet commerce king, but the carcasses of the dead will lay across Wall Street only to be forgotten in a few years. 

One that I remember thinking was a turd was PLUG. Look at the max chart on that thing. I still wouldn't buy that. Maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe not. I think TSLA is also overvalued. I'm not saying it's a bad company or anything, but its valuation metrics are way out of whack. 

You have to understand in that era guys would go on CNBC and talk about some new internet IPO was worth x billion because it had y million ""eyeballs."" I'm not exaggerating. They would multiply page views by 2 and use it as a metric for valuation. That whole thing to me felt like the bigger idiot theory taken to the extreme, but even that feels more reputable than the people who push crypto on CNBC. 

I have cash. I want to deploy it because of inflation risks, but there's virtually nothing I want to touch right now so I've just been nibbling on Boomer stocks and swing trading SPY options. 

Oh, and one other thing. Funds. Back then Janus Twenty was all the rage. They had closed it to new investors. People would brag that they were in it. It had all the high flyers. AOL, Cisco, JDSUniphase, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle. That reminds me of that ARK fund or whatever it is called. Again, not everything in the J20 was a terrible company, but valuations got so out of whack that things like INTC have never returned to their highs and MSFT and ORCL, while good companies, were dead money for over a decade. I think a company like TSLA has the chance to find itself in that sort of company where the stock takes a decade plus to touch its ATH again."

2021-05-12 00:35:42,stocks,"I've been holding UPWK for awhile too. I'm a longterm invester type and honestly, UPWK is overvalued. But I'm not selling because my original bull thesis is still right, it just needs 5-10 more years

To me, UPWK will be the dominant business model beating Fiver over time. Everything in the US is acting as huge tailwind's for UPWK services. Increasing minimum wage, normalization of work from home (which will lead to outsourcing), increase in 1099 regulations, normalization of higher unemployment benefits, and stimulus payment."

FAANG companies, even during their growth years, never surpassed 20x revenue. Palantirs a cool company, but in the short to mid term its stock price is very disconnected from its earnings."

2021-05-12 10:36:47,stocks,"Do people here not know how to analyze stock pricing? Even after this quarterly beat and huge price fall PLTR is still priced at over 25x 2021 sales. Even for a tech unicorn that's never made money for nearly a decade, that's still a rich multiple.

Owners initially wanted PLTR to stay private because they valued their autonomy very highly, but once they saw that the market was willing to value them at twice what they thought they were worth they suddenly changed their mind. Then started massive insider selling their shares as soon as it was allowed. So much for ""autonomy"". That's just shady as fuck. 

The narrative around PLTR on this forum is toxic to new traders and no doubt has caused newbies to lose a significant amount of their initial investments."

2021-05-12 00:42:56,stocks,"Ah the stock, not the company, is outperforming its fundamentals. Misread that. Makes sense. 

Thanks for the DV. Probably."
2021-05-11 21:24:50,stocks,"(no, but don't tell anyone here I said that)"
2021-05-11 21:47:28,stocks,"No, I mean they are nowhere near that. I‚Äôve been watching people complaining about how PLTR goes down on good news, and I see the quarterly and the stock is overvalued. In fact based on current numbers, I wouldn‚Äôt consider it until it came down to $4 a share. There is speculation, and then there is 5X overvalued. Either revenue needs to increase 5 fold or the stock price needs to come down. If you believe that can happen, great. Hold. Just expect it to go down a lot before it comes back up. 

You do realize that the whole point of investing is that in theory you put money behind a company with the idea that the company is going make you money, right? 1 billion in revenue is not 1 billion in profit for the investors. And at the current price, it would take 35 years for the investment to pay off. 

Once again, if you got in real early, congratulations, you‚Äôve got one hell of an investment. However, buying at it‚Äôs current price feels like a suckers play. The revenue either need to increase by 500%, or the stock will correct itself over time to match what they are actually worth."
2021-05-12 10:58:26,stocks,I thought if you sold at a loss you couldn't buy back in for 30 days or something. Isn't there a rule about that?
2021-05-12 09:36:59,stocks,"YA RIGHT. Anything can and probably will happen in a 5 year time span, why stress over it. If you're investing I'm sure it is to become wealthier and improve your quality of life. If it's making you stress and lower your quality of life it is going against your original purpose behind investing in the first place.

If anything, a stock you plan on long term holding goes down, as long as the fundamentals are still in place it should be seen as an opportunity to lower your DCA and buy in more to have a larger pot after that 3-5 years.  I'm sure everyone would like to have more of a stock they have, and no one wants to buy that stock at a high price, right?"
2021-05-12 04:12:10,stocks,So basically you're saying 50bn market cap for an eternally loss making firm and 1bn of revenues was perfectly reasonable? You're dillusional then
2021-05-11 20:11:15,stocks,"You are completely wrong. 

The right comparison for PLTR is Oracle.  Expensive enterprise software that big companies must have until 25yrs later its commodity.

Oracle was a service heavy business with consultants charging $300/hr in 2000 to help setup, monitor,  and troubleshoot.  

Oracle frequently charged $100k licensing fees for even tiny deployments.

Companies paid because Oracle kept their data safe and useful,  always available,  easily generating needed reports.

PLTR is just the next generation of Oracle, what Oracle could have been if it invested in AI, data analysis, IOT, visualization, and the needs of big govt contracts.

So, yeah...if you want fair price for PLTR, go back and check Oracles PE history.

I'm not convinced that PLTR is pricing the same though which might be leaving money on the table, and Oracles greed is so legendary today that even now most techies cringe thinking about it..."
2021-05-12 12:57:42,stocks,Lol maybe it‚Äôs the way if you don‚Äôt to be rich until you‚Äôre 50

2021-05-12 12:19:59,stocks,"Not American, but you‚Äôre probably referring to wash sales. Nobody prevents you from selling and buying the same security over and over again, but if you do within a 30 day window, you can‚Äôt harvest the tax loss (iirc)."
2021-05-12 17:18:12,stocks,i am lowering average and buying the dip because I do believe in the companies i bought into however it definitely makes you question your own decision making seeing them plummet lol
2021-05-12 04:59:59,stocks,"That looks good to me for a healthy growing company, especially one that doesn't need to build up factories and heavy equipment. If they keep up their estimates of 30% growth/yr I'm a happy investor, I don't really care if they're profitable they should put that money into expanding the business, if revenue does stay flat for a year I expect them to cut losses and become profitable at which point I expect a PE ratio comparable to any other tech company. In the meantime I'll build conviction from their product quality and how they're received by their customers."
2021-05-12 03:15:47,stocks,I dont like to get into the conspiracy side of thing but I can‚Äôt see it happening without a sell off of other stocks by the hedgies
2021-05-12 12:30:00,stocks,Ah! Thank you.
2021-05-12 06:03:34,stocks,"How can the PE ratio be comparable if they don't make a profit?

Price to sales, more useful, was comparable to Shopify, despite Shopify growing 2x as fast and is able to scale way better than Palantir. 

Palantir has a growing marginal cost curve. Each new client requires in house engineers to go to the client for a long period of time. Shopify can sign up companies at near zero cost. 

So you're happy but didn't do your research?"
2021-05-12 08:28:52,stocks,"I see you have some sort of reading impairment since you somehow managed to miss where I wrote ""at which point"".

Thanks for the price to sales analysis, I didn't know that, sounds bullish.

It seems to me Shopify should scale better then Palantir if Eu lockdowns continue, but I doubt the rate will continue past the next year. And I see your point about scaling new customers, that's why I'm not expecting 100% growth/yr, but I am expecting higher and steadier incomes it just takes more vision and patience to see those PE ratios.

It's a different type of company then Shopify, not all growth stocks are the same."

2021-05-11 22:11:27,stocks,"This was mentioned before but I'll explain my understanding as well. Growth stocks like low interest rates because it allows them to take on mountains of debt to reinvest into themselves and jump start their earnings. Typically, they don't make money and actually lose money by doing this in the hopes that they can crest some bar to start making money - so a lot of them are just in debt. 

When inflation becomes a cause for concern because too much money is out there, the FED will raise interest rates which essentially makes it harder to borrow (and can lead to more money for lenders who now can charge higher interest rates). This doesn't affect value companies as much since either they don't have as much debt or they are at least well established enough to be able to survive higher interest rates. But if your a tiny startup company that just took out fat loans and haven't really started making much money, then the increased interest rates are going to eat up whatever money you do end up making in the mean time. This clearly lowers the possible returns in investing in such a company. 

Most of the market is just grossly overvalued compared to historical averages, however, due to this low interest rate environment and investors dumping tons into stocks. So even healthy companies will likely see a pullback. Not much we can really do about it except continue to dollar cost average our investments in the event of a dip and hope that dividend reinvestment can ease the fall. After all, if the company has good earnings, then the dividend reinvestment will be able to buy more of the company if the stock falls - another benefit of having good earnings for value companies"

Inflation is a state in which aggregate demand within the economy overheats and spending is too high. To cool it down, the most common instrument is amendment to monetary policy, or an increase in central interest rates.

Under increased interest rates, there's higher incentive to put money away and to work than to spend it. With higher interest rates comes higher repayment rates on debt too.

2021-05-12 09:29:51,stocks,"Your grasp on the monetary policy here isn't good.  Also, my comment has nothing to do with the monetary policy the government will likely take in a high inflation environment.  It's about what institutions will do.  What institutions (and individuals) do is pretty well documented.

Raising interest rates in this situation will be reactionary and not a silver bullet that fixes the problem.  Even if rates are raised it will take time to corral inflation.  Also, the Fed can also raise reserve requirements.  Because of how many rule shifts they used over the last year, there's actually quite a few tools handy to restrict reserves in banks.  Also, the cessation of QE is a new tool.

All of that before raising rates; which are a long term ""solution"" to inflation.

>Under increased interest rates, there's higher incentive to put money away and to work than to spend it

Maybe once rates have controlled inflation.  But if you look at when the US had high rates, like lets say the 1970s, we also had very high inflation.  These two things eat into each other.  As a result, usually higher risk equities ultimately remain the best option.  They key is to be in the right equities; growth stocks that are very reliant on debt are not the right answer, that's why you're currently seeing a sell off in growth stocks.

>With higher interest rates comes higher repayment rates on debt too.

On new debt, yes, but not existing debt.  Existing debt takes a big loss if you're a lender under higher inflation."

2021-05-11 20:12:50,stocks,"1: it really bothered me when Elon said he sold coin to test liquidity. The liquidity was there because you bought it. To be honest, it seemed like more of a pump to the TSLA's bottom line for the quarter. The truth is shareholders should be really upset there wasn't a buyback.

2: people like Elon have become celebs. Obviously. I don't think Elon intended to get this much clout, but all celebrities, even small time influencers on YouTube or Twitch, gain a group of loyal followers. From that point on, no matter what they say or do, they are defended to the death.

3: people are mistaking adoption for cheap marketing. If I was a company, and wanted to do a marketing event, that could double as a tax write off, I'd probably do what many of those companies are doing. I would say very few companies believe in the tech, or that space, but are just doing it to pump their numbers.

4: Burry had to delete his tweets after a visit from the SEC. Elon and Cuban shamelessly pumped that coin, knowing people would buy it based off their influence. I think that's irresponsible, it's not like they are buying all the sell orders. I know people who always FOMO and end up losing money. Elon for some reason, has become untouchable by the SEC. Despite some other comments in this thread, it obviously matters on the share price. I mean, shareholders did try to sue him and also have some oversight in his tweets.

5: I think Thiel specifically backtracked. His comments about that space and China were sort of taken negatively by the masses. This reminded me of how Cramer told everyone to sell GME, they basically called him a shill and turned on him, and then he retraced his statements.

6: many people haven't been around for crashes. The previous coin bubble was popped due to hacks and speculation of regulation. That space I read has had a lot of attacks on phising attempts, close to 20b. However, since it's not a direct hack on the tech, it's just attributed to user error. Being a user myself, I've always been worried about sending it to the wrong address. Once it's sent, it's just gone. Regulation is necessary, but it will hurt that space. In this past year I believe there is a lot of well founded mistrust into banks, markets, and hedge funds. However, if there was better regulation leading up to the crash in 2008, the housing market crash probably wouldn't have happened. I thought housing was gonna bomb due to covid, but it did not. It's due to the regulations that came out from 2008. People treat inflation, debt, and regulation like the boogey man now. 

7: also regarding the current state, I think it's more due to disparity and the way the internet has evolved. Meet Kevin is a great example, he had guests on his show where they basically talked about how poorer poeple don't understand how cap gains work and that rich people pay more than their fair share in taxes. In this day and age, we accept people can make money for being a content creator but also fail to realize that people who can make money off of something should be probably examined under a lens or have their info taken with a grain of salt.

People needed the money and are using it for things like rent, food, etc. Despite what you read online, there are still a lot of people struggling and not everyone is dumping their stimmy into stocks and coins. Retail numbers reflect this. It's sort of like taking debt, it makes sense that companies would take on debt while interest rates are low for R&D. 

I read before banks had invested 100t into the bond market, excuse me if this is wrong, I did not fact check this. They took out 1t and dropped it into coin market due to inflationary concerns. 1t seems like a lot to us, but honestly, it isn't in comparison for banks and funds. Once bonds become more attractive, prob around July, they will rotate out of that market and back into bonds. This is due to the fed stating they would pull back quantitative easing when we hit around 75% vaccination rates. You can Google this, as Bullard said it.

So what that means? Banks most likely will rotate back into bonds. This is when I expect the market to actually correct.

As far as what I did, I basically pulled out of speculative positions and held onto things I don't mind holding forever. DIS and FAAMG.

DIS is great because of its holdings, plus cruises and parks, and also great IP in media."
2021-05-11 20:44:55,stocks,"Ok. That all makes sense and an interesting perspective.

I hadn't head the bank rotating back into bonds as a catalyst before. That's definitely something to keep a eye on. I imagine that rates would rise to closer to 2% on the 10 year before you see the banks rotate?

I would love to short COIN, but I don't like the gamble."

I can't find quotes on the exact numbers, but you can see what happens when bond yields increase.

Edit: Burry said the same thing. Crypto is definitely in a bubble, but he wouldn't short it due to the votality. The market always corrects.

Missed your other question, I don't think the target % matters. Any talk of it will spook the market. The issue with that market is its at an ATH, meaning people are more spooked to a sharp drop due to the cyclical history of that market. If you go back and look at most posts after the last crash, most people had stated the next bull run will be in Dec 2020 due to halving. It's sort of like if that sector gets regulated. Either way, I think the catalyst is the Fed's monetary policy. People are mistaking a hedge against inflation as a long term investment."

2021-05-11 20:56:29,stocks,"Yup, their P/S is 13 and they have good growth projections of 60% revenue growth YoY. The big thing they said on the call was that the SpotX acquisition sets them up to really accelerate their revenue in the future.  They may still get punished by being a high growth tech stock, but honesty i think $30 is a good price point for them. That gives them a current P/S of 15 and a future P/S of 10.

Under current market trends with TTD forecast weighing heavy on the advertising industry, its hard to see MGNI pushing a P/S of 20 or higher."

The entire market is punishing any company even being valued by a p/s metric, it‚Äôs gotten out of control. Seeing some of the best value in over a year though, just tough holding through these troughs. 

I‚Äôm still holding MGNI heavy, been in since it was rubicon. Also holding TTD although I trimmed a little on the way up, I‚Äôll probably add those shares back before the split.  KBNT is my newest spec position in the space, slowly accumulating."

By ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.

As for the part that they exclude iGaming etc. In their revenue numbers from the past, those revenues are INCLUDED. But even then, when those markets were growing, they didn't have that much growth.

Yesterday they reported their Q1 numbers: revenue only increased by 5% YoY. Their 2020 revenue only saw growth of 0.59% thanks to covid, so that is pretty bad, since it means they increased their Q1 revenue by only 5% in 2 years time. EBITDA barely improved.

I think that this is the main reason why you saw the share price drop.  BLFS had about 33 million outstanding shares as of 12/31/20.  By  issuing the new shares for  this purchase, they increased the number of shares by 18%, reducing the ownership of the company represented by each share.  This is why share dilution  needs to be watched in companies that are not profitable but trying to grow.  If they purchase a good company that fits their strategy and grows overtime, great.  If not, everyone's holdings lose value very quickly.   I personally used this dip as a buying opportunity as I think the acquisition is a good investment for the company and is a big part of their overall long-term strategy."
