2021-05-20 19:57:12,wallstreetbets,This is the wallstreetbets i miss
2021-05-20 19:58:30,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-20 19:52:35,wallstreetbets,"That's cool looking when it's green, how'd you do that?"
2021-05-20 19:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol! I don't know what that's called but I see u have a spread and shares so hopefully it stays green. The thing about crackheads, they want more crack!"
2021-05-20 19:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Just wait, I‚Äôll post the loss porn soon. VIAC is about as reliable as a crack addict saying they‚Äôll pay you back..."
2021-05-20 19:49:27,wallstreetbets,Get Audi Q7 I was in the same position and swapped out in a matter of a few hours. Wifey got her 100k German sled and is happier then a clam
2021-05-20 19:52:33,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you on this. I closed my call earlier today and opened a short position after this last push. Also, for what it‚Äôs worth consumer reports said Tesla‚Äôs full self driving is ‚Äúinconsistent, unpredictable and potentially very dangerous‚Äù. All this negative press and Tesla bouncing around this $600 support area makes me think it may drop"
2021-05-20 19:51:17,wallstreetbets,reading too much harvey organ...
2021-05-20 19:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Great article, Thank you"
2021-05-20 19:44:40,wallstreetbets,Twitter link is showing suspended?
2021-05-20 19:53:33,wallstreetbets,"If you think silver is going to triple digits, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you."
2021-05-20 19:41:51,wallstreetbets,You are welcome üôè

2021-05-20 19:08:52,wallstreetbets,Good luck. Added 40 shares today to average down to $42 fuuuuuck

2021-05-20 19:56:40,wallstreetbets,Looool well I'm at 150 shares but bought in around $50 initially
2021-05-20 19:13:40,wallstreetbets,"I have RKT already, will get some UWMC shares also so I can have matching loss porn."
2021-05-20 19:48:55,wallstreetbets,"3k shares bought today at market close

We ride."
2021-05-20 19:58:23,wallstreetbets,I sold some 20p just before the big drop like a troglodyte so I sure hope so
2021-05-20 19:26:22,wallstreetbets,"I like RKT, BUT all eyes should be on UWMC for the next month or so ... the CEO announces a massive buyback, enough to buy 44% of the entire float, the stock starts rilling up and what do shorts do ? They SHORT MORE, only now borrow fees are 25X higher and the float is shrinking every day. It‚Äôs a recipe for rocket launch."
2021-05-20 19:25:46,wallstreetbets,"I mean that's just not true, RKT is way more heavily reliant on refinance business, which is drying up. They even went so far as to say they aren't comparing future quarters to 2020 anymore, they will compare to 2019. 

UWMC is actually guiding *up* for next quarter."
2021-05-20 18:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Red rocket, red rocket"
2021-05-20 19:42:58,wallstreetbets,At least you didn‚Äôt start this garbage post with ‚Äúhear me out‚Äù.
2021-05-20 19:22:17,wallstreetbets,It rekt my portfolio already
2021-05-20 19:34:18,wallstreetbets,People have been shitting on rocket for a year now. Because it deserves to be shit on. It‚Äôs gone down not up for a year.
2021-05-20 19:41:06,wallstreetbets,Rkt is a much better company than UWMC. Any comparison is silly!
2021-05-20 19:27:24,wallstreetbets,I am more worried about uwmc and there aggressive  guidance I think they may miss in the second quarter
2021-05-20 19:54:32,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a trap.
2021-05-20 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,i got both... didnt know witch one of my wifes  B.F.s  were right
2021-05-20 19:45:59,wallstreetbets,üòä - I have both as well but RKT is the much better company
2021-05-20 19:22:38,wallstreetbets,Post positions as pic
2021-05-20 18:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately I think with the variants the cruise line/mgm/party boy play is still a bit riskier than you think.
If a successful variant vacc emerges ill immediately play this line but right now too risky for me"
2021-05-20 18:48:38,wallstreetbets,Great points. What‚Äôre your strike prices?
2021-05-20 19:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought 20x 7/16 35c after I read this ""bad"" news today:

https://bernews.com/2021/05/royal-caribbean-cancels-sailings-from-bermuda/

Smart money says they're doing this because the deal with the CDC is imminent and Florida sailings will resume in July. Alaska sailing is a go, just announced aftermarket today."
2021-05-20 19:05:38,wallstreetbets,"I got tired of holding and sold almost everything, only 100 shares left for my Onboard credit.  Almost 1.5 years of no cruising, so the next 2 years will be filled with rebooks that have already been paid for.  I made about 10k selling around 1500 shares. Can't understand how the price is still over $27 without any revenue coming in."
2021-05-20 18:51:58,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been in on this since 22...been a rollercoaster. I hope you‚Äôre right...I‚Äôm not going anywhere. It should 2x at least over the next few months. *Fingers crossed
2021-05-20 19:22:30,wallstreetbets,"I was in CCL & NCLH but took my gains from the last little mini run it went on. I like them as recovery plays, but amongst the many people I‚Äôve spoke to, cruises are the last thing on folks minds simply because of the fear of another outbreak happening, & possibly being stranded on a ship. I say give it another year at best before anything significant happens on cruise stocks"
2021-05-20 19:31:44,wallstreetbets,"The big headwind is going to be that they are usually leaving from south Florida and future President DeSantis has [fully banned vaccine passports](https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/Florida-gov-won-t-make-a-vaccine-passport-exception-for-cruises), meaning they have to figure out new ports of origin....I'm assuming they have to shift to Louisiana. 

This is will potentially hurt profits in the short run and require the companies to relocate in the long run. Also all Anti-vaxers simply will stop cruising, shrinking the potential market."
2021-05-20 19:23:28,wallstreetbets,I hope you‚Äôre right - I bought 10x 10/15 30c back in April.
2021-05-20 19:00:59,wallstreetbets,Yolo call times for tomorrow?
2021-05-20 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,$27.5 calls and $35 calls with July expiry
2021-05-20 19:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Just to give an opposing viewpoint. The majority of people I‚Äôve talked to say that as soon as cruise lines open, they are booking for this summer/fall. I personally  think that you‚Äôll see sold out cruises this year.  Just an opinion based on personal observations."
2021-05-20 19:38:02,wallstreetbets,You think that will actually happen? Think of the tax revenue florida will lose out on.
2021-05-20 18:50:29,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the insight!
2021-05-20 19:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Jesus. I hope you‚Äôre right! $35 seems intense, but I‚Äôm bullish af. Let‚Äôs gooooo.

I did sell 200 shares to dabble in some air bus to pair with Boeing."
2021-05-20 19:46:29,wallstreetbets,"DeSantis is an idiot.  Vaccine passports, they‚Äôre coming but with regard to the Caribbean it may be a moot point as that‚Äôs more of a thing in developed countries with economies that don‚Äôt rely primarily on tourism."
2021-05-20 18:42:29,wallstreetbets,"gonna need a ""tesla too low imo"" tweet tonight"
2021-05-20 18:57:49,wallstreetbets,Insert more coins. You might win this time.

2021-05-20 18:26:19,wallstreetbets,The day before exp is always the toughest
2021-05-20 18:46:46,wallstreetbets,"You need TSLA $744.15 to breakeven. Even if tesla go up tomorrow,  you won't make much back. Maybe $100?"
2021-05-20 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,Supposedly TSLA is the most shorted stock RN.  So there's always a reason to hope.
2021-05-20 19:36:39,wallstreetbets,Eeeesh

2021-05-20 19:35:08,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs awesome. How far out (calendar) did you buy for an option that cheap?
2021-05-20 19:55:53,wallstreetbets,"Nice gains, but what am I looking at what options were these? Strike price ticker symbol?"

2021-05-20 18:31:19,wallstreetbets,"Which is funny because it's not news, they were doing this last month, too...

Doesn't really matter if Tesla uses lidar anyway since they don't drive much sales volume. What matters are the bigger manufacturers who are ramping up EV efforts and more interested in lidar.

This is just for testing anyway, it's unlikely Tesla will actually use much lidar, if any, in production cars.

What really, truly bothers me is that most meme stocks, even *squeeze meme* stocks, have a bullish case to be made. Not all are likely, but many are feasible.

They have either eliminated debt, or are in line for a huge contract, or have a recovery plan to help them shed COVID inertia.

But AMC doesn't. It's propped up by a bunch of Occupy Wall Street wannabes who want to eat the rich.

AFTER their board sold even more shares to give themselves over $8 million in bonuses for ""extraordinary efforts"" during the pandemic... this company still trades higher than almost ever, with more shares than ever, and their CEO will make another offering as soon as he thinks the company's image can take it.


This shit was $6 and AMC was on the verge of bankruptcy before the virus.

I think I'm actually mentally broken. Like forever. 

While the whole world was burning in 2020 I had multiple golden tickets come my way that I basically threw away.

Got assigned SOXL at (post-split) $4...sold for $6...could have sold for $45 a year later. ZERO reason not to hold, but I sold.

Had BB $15Cs I bought way OTM before it went to $25. 2000% gain...just looked at it, then the next day it tanked. NO reason.

Made OK $ on GME and then managed to snag 7 $100C's for ~$10...sold 3 of them for ~$50 for no reason. Was *just* about to hit sell at $245 on 3/10 when the big red dildo fucked me. Literally a matter of seconds...my finger was pressing the button. That's after getting screwed during the first rug pull.

I've thrown away $200k+ in gains like this. I somehow still more than doubled my account, but the amount left on the table with retarded moves like these has **really** broken me.

I might be able to get over it if it wasn't for the ""once in a lifetime"" aspect. 

There won't be another COVID. Ever. There won't be another GME. Ever. I doubt I'll ever be so lucky to be in the right place at the right time again...even /r/wsb is now very different than how it was when I was fortunate enough to stumble on it at that unique moment in history.

I could have come out the other side of Armageddon a decade closer to retirement with an amazing story to tell, instead I'm just a mediocre coulda-been with crushing regrets I'll carry with me the *rest of my life*.

The problem is now I can't focus on anything. What's the point? I have 0 motivation for work or even finding a different job. Watching that much profit evaporate makes everything else seem fake and distant. If I fucked up such easy layups so cluelessly, what else am I fucking up in life? Do I even deserve to ""win""? I don't feel like I'm even entitled to any more luck again ever. I bitched and moaned my whole life, and when the universe relented and rained down tendies, I threw them away.

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

Keep your losses a secret from family and friends, that way when you get a big win you can surprise them!  Money isn't real, so borrow as much as you need to break even.  Studies show that gambling is a great way to deal with loneliness and stress, stave away sadness, and even blow off steam. Drink alcohol. Get high."

2021-05-20 15:13:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a lot of capital tied up for a long time to make $400.   If you want to sell covered calls then maybe look at 45-90 dte and roll them out if it hits sooner.   There‚Äôs nothing wrong with your strategy per se, but it‚Äôs not going to be very efficient in terms of capital usage.   It‚Äôs a safe play though and you‚Äôre locking in 10% returns at minimum.

I‚Äôve been selling a block of puts on BNGO every time it dips under $5 and it‚Äôs done well so far, buying them back when it gets into higher $5‚Äôs - the lower support seems to be mid $4‚Äôs and $~5.15 with resistance in the high $5‚Äôs lately. it could go lower for sure, I‚Äôm fine with holding BNGO long term and see the hard floor around mid $3 right now."
2021-05-20 15:38:57,wallstreetbets,"yeah, don't do this.  

Selling covered calls is a foundation of theta strategy, selling covered leaps is just dumb.

Bngo was really just an opportunity since I had already been holding since January of this year. Also the January 2023 expiration was really just because it gave me a big enough premium for me to play with the put option without having to she'll out more than the $104 potential loss I'd have to use if it expired ITM. Thanks for your input, very appreciated."

2021-05-20 17:44:45,wallstreetbets,You say that now but that‚Äôs a really long time. Like mentioned above 45 days is the sweet spot for theta decay.
2021-05-20 15:25:24,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I honestly got very confused when trying to understand how options work but I finally understood covered calls and cash secured puts and those I think I'm most comfortable with playing around.

2021-05-20 15:30:34,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs very confusing.  I had to get a lot of ‚Äúpractice‚Äù and still barely get it!  I like the idea of someone in your position doing small covered calls because you guarantee yourself profit up front, instead of potentially losing it all, like I have so many times with OTM calls.  Small risk / small reward, but small rewards add up over time, then you can turn them into a big one!  Good luck!!"
2021-05-20 16:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Im actually only diving into options this last month and also starting low risk plays to learn from, very smart move on your part good work!"
2021-05-20 15:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Like I mentioned I also bought 1 put expiring in about 1 month so even if I lose on that side, I'm only going to lose $104 but I still get 100 shares of a company I believe in and I can always hold for a bit and sell that for a small profit or sell another Jan 2023 covered call for that as well. With only $4,500 portfolio I think this is a smart play for me. Thanks for your input üòÉ"

2021-05-20 15:15:59,wallstreetbets,"I've been in and out on this a few times this years (currently IN) as a swing play based on the short interest and resulting price-action we've seen this year.  You make an interesting case for a longer-term hold though, especially in the CTV space.

My biggest concern deals with the privacy issues surrounding ad-tech, in particular these sorts of programmatic advertising companies.  As we begin to see players like Apple shift towards privacy-protective models, and as more stringent privacy regulations emerge, ad-tech will need to adapt and I believe many will fail (not necessarily PUBM though).  Would love to hear your thoughts on the privacy matters."

2021-05-20 17:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Pubmatic doesn't pay a dividend as far as the internet tells me.  So as a major investor, why would you recommend this stock?  Are you hopeful that their reinvestment of profits will lead to a higher dividend yield in the future, or is there some other reason?"
2021-05-20 15:00:23,wallstreetbets,"Didn‚Äôt read any of this, but I assume it‚Äôs something about high highly shorted their float is. Main thing is they don‚Äôt have an options chain so any type of squeeze is not gonna happen by much at all."
2021-05-20 15:24:05,wallstreetbets,"I hear you. I considered that too. Apple is rolling out their privacy changes on iOS as we speak. Much more strict privacy measures are being put in place. Nevertheless, PUBM raised their guidance considerably during their Q1 report. They have mentioned over and over again that they are anticipating the changes in the digital ad markets investing accordingly. I can't speak to the technical details, as I am unqualified, but I can say that a 12% return on tangible book value shows that their investments have been paying off and that they are able to effectively stay ahead of the changes."
2021-05-20 15:36:38,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure what that is.
2021-05-20 17:19:02,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm reading it as Pubematic
2021-05-20 16:56:02,wallstreetbets,I am not sure.

2021-05-20 15:27:22,wallstreetbets,I'm not familiar with current PUBM AI capabilities or their future AI projects.
2021-05-20 17:58:31,wallstreetbets,"Great question. Pubmatic does reinvest their income. This is called retained earnings and it gives the company the ability to compound their profits into more profits. An example: PUBM rolled out their CTV solution rapidly because they have the engineering resources to do it. They invest let's say 5 million of their previous profits into a CTV product (I have no idea how much that project cost). Once they cross sell the product to their customer base, they generate more revenue and therefore more profits. This compounding effect will eventually grow the value of the company as the money compounds. Earnings and revenue will go up. Dividends are more common among mature companies that can't find ways to compound the money, so they simply give it back to their investors. PUBM has growth opportunities ahead of it."
2021-05-20 15:03:25,wallstreetbets,It's more about the company and not really much about the short interest actually.
2021-05-20 15:49:03,wallstreetbets,"So, there's a lot of new tech out there that can tailor ads based on facial expressions, keystrokes, etc. It's intrusive and ethically wrong but it works, which means that it won't be regulated heavily. $$$
This stock is in a 3 month decline because of reopening, the overall choppiness of the market and something you mentioned that tells me their tech is behind the power curve. You mentioned the inability to filter ad presentation. The fact that they can't do something as simple as not putting a Disney ad on pornhub is really telling. 
I think this one is going to continue to decline unless they are able to pick up a smaller company as a tuck in and take that company's more advanced software for themselves. 
I don't think I would get into this one."
2021-05-20 18:01:20,wallstreetbets,So basically you're saying that they should eventually pay a dividend and getting in early on the stock makes for a much higher yield compared to your cost basis as opposed to the stock price when they do start profit sharing?  Or is it something else?
2021-05-20 15:05:29,wallstreetbets,Lol well I guess I should read it then
2021-05-20 15:04:05,wallstreetbets,The kind of dd I like
2021-05-20 16:33:28,wallstreetbets,"My apologies, the filtering of the ad on the porn site was just an example to show advertisers require transparency. PUBM has the necessary tech to do that. If they were that sloppy, they wouldn't have such a high net dollar retention rate. You mentioned an interesting point. PUBM has been growing its cash pile considerably. My guess is that if they can't engineer the new features, they could look into strategic M&A. Also - they are currently have a ton of open positions in data analytics and software engineers. [https://pubmatic.com/careers/](https://pubmatic.com/careers/). the evidence shows that they'll be able to meet the shifts in the market"
2021-05-20 18:08:12,wallstreetbets,"I can't speculate on what management decides to do with their extra cash. At this point, they are in a state of compounding it. That has already increased their value dramatically and will continue to do so if management can continue to compound at such a high rate of return."

At least 14 successful vertical take off and landings with New Sheppard is NOTHING to scoff at.

To add that that tech is scaleable to other space operations, safe and redundant, it blows SPCE out of the water.

SPCE only has a following because they are publically traded. In the space community, most people look at then with wary eyes. I wonder how many people they kill before they get shut down.

Yes, in theory ticket prices will eventually come down, but they are currently $250,000/ticket. Drop that to $200k, $100k, $50k, etc. and while your target audience will grow it will still be monumentally small in the grand scheme of things, so then it becomes a balancing act of pricing the tickets at a point where you can still become profitable with the number of people willing to pay it.

>Let‚Äôs also not forget the real money maker, hypersonic flights.

Is it? I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I understand the science and practicality behind hypersonic flight, because I don‚Äôt, but I do know that airlines as is are pretty terrible businesses in terms of profit margins"
2021-05-20 18:20:39,wallstreetbets,"$50 million is the price of a Dragon ride today. In 4 years Starship will make these suborbitals look like toys.

Musk estimates Starship launches to orbit will eventually be single digit millions, but let‚Äôs say it starts at $25M for v1.

Starship has similar volume to an Airbus A380 which seats 500+, so fitting 100 people for a joyride with room to move around in zero g is no problem.

$25M / 100 = $250k ballpark for an orbital cruise with extremely conservative numbers."

Having said that, this company recently filed an S-3 Shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to sell $350M of stock at the market price, whenever they choose.  So your position is about to, if not already, get seriously diluted.  When they filed, it was trading at $9.  Now it's $5.xx.  So assuming an average of $7, that's 50 million new shares being issued.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1_424b5.htm)

This is in addition to the 29M shares they issued in January. 

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4_424b5.htm)

So this company has shown a proclivity to issue new shares as they need to refill their coffers at the expense of the shareholders.  I'm not sure I would like being constantly diluted every time they need money.

Right now they have a market cap of $1.5B on $10M of TTM revenue, -$40M of TTM net income, and -$153M of accumulated deficit.

So, that's a hard pass from me."

2021-05-20 15:36:37,wallstreetbets,"You are not accounting for the fact that this currency will enter pools within the next few weeks and the ROI is dropping as fast as storage space gets added to it. It's essentially already late to get into it by individuals.

Within a month or two, buying hard disks will be pointless as the only way to keep a ROI on it will be SSDs (already is), and these in turn will also quickly become obsolete in terms of ROI due to the insane amount of storage added to it, making returns plateauing.

That's when you will get a tsunami wave of individuals dumping their hard drive farms in the second hand market, relieving retail demand for storage space and killing prices.

In other words, the new currency has a spike in storage demand now, but given its trajectory vs. the ROI that is achieved it's very likely to lead to quick dumps of the bought storage space to the second hand market as it's already considered 'late' to enter by individuals. Once people realize that for every day that passes they need additional terabytes of space just to stay in the same ROI, they will get off it quickly.

Perhaps an interesting comparison would be to see how did other currencies affect the prices of AMD and NVIDIA, then take a massive chunk out of that and you'll get the WDC potential upside, since it's nowhere near as attractive as those who use gpus."

I read through the analysis on seeking alpha and I saw some people calling last earnings beat ""the top."" WDC did suspend the dividend and made it clear that their priority is paying down debt, not necessarily returns to shareholders. If I was a new currency bear, with little undertanding of new currency, I would have probably exited too. After all, it did have a nice run from the 30s to 70s after the covid crash, so I understand those who bet on WDC for covid recovery would now be exiting."

Without pooling this is completely impractical but when pooling gets here this will be true. Atharium (you know the one) will ROI in around 120 days, possibly a LOT longer starting in July due to fees burning in EIP 1559. For this currency to ROI in 120 days, the network needs to 6-8x in size. That's assuming price of the currency doesn't change. If the network continues growing at the rate that it is, we may see all of this complete before this quarter is over. 

In summary, this is the most profitable currency until the network hits 50 exabytes, in which case it becomes the second most profitable UNLESS EIP 1559 hurts mining in which case it can remain the most profitable for much longer.

There are also cases to be made for the price to increase over time as well, but I'm assuming you know as much about it as I do and I can't really talk about it here without triggering automod."

2021-05-20 15:37:28,wallstreetbets,Seagate is also a great play but more overvalued than WDC and less diversified. I would have done 50/50 in each but I cant buy STX through my broker so I didnt do any DD on seagate specifically.
2021-05-20 14:10:14,wallstreetbets,"Because I was interested in the new currency, and when I learned about it and went to buy some hardware for it, I found it was all sold out or extremely overpriced. I thought jeez these companies must be making a killing, so I looked into buying stock in those companies. 

I checked out Seagate first since they were strictly HDD but my broker isnt able to clear Seagate shares (Canadian stuff) but I could buy WDC. I went through their history, financials, leadership and learned about their company, and it's pretty stellar. I waited through the earnings call and was surprised that it wasn't mentioned even once, and based on the sideways trading over the past 3 months, there hasn't been a significant reaction from the market yet. Sooner or later, people will learn just how much WDC is making and when that happens they will see the stock is undervalued and they will buy in. If you want to buy in before that happens, now is a good time."
2021-05-20 17:55:35,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-05-20 14:58:55,wallstreetbets,"WDC already up huge from October current sitting at highs, so no."
2021-05-20 18:02:20,wallstreetbets,"You should factor in a higher price per tb, 12tb disks are already priced much higher than $240.

Also,you need additional hardware as to make this a decent revenue scheme you need several computers and quite a lot of hard disks. It's not only storage space that's a cost, unless you are talking about making a couple hundred bucks a month.

Given the attention this is getting I suspect it will become unprofitable to all but those with deep pockets soon, just like proof of work has become. It's a natural consequence. Unless you pick a currency at its infancy, trying to jump inboard once it gets hyped is a waste of money. Better trade it than try to earn it. Just my view. Who knows."
2021-05-20 13:18:19,wallstreetbets,We love our mods
2021-05-20 15:35:59,wallstreetbets,"October lows have nothing to do with this play, yes the stock has recovered since october but nobody buying this stock in october could have anticipated a new currency that hoards storage. This is a new development and it's not priced in."
2021-05-20 19:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Proof of work is still profitable, otherwise GPUs would be in stock. If proof of work hasnt become unprofitable I dont see why anything else can't also remain profitable. Secondly, it doesnt necessarily matter for whom is it most profitable. An at-home farmer that needs to set up a 2k rig and only buys 1k in hard drives might not make back their investment very quick, but if whales that are already established buy the new hard drives then it doesn't matter. A sale is a sale. Lastly, I know 20/TB seems insane right now but thats literally what it was before around april 20th ish. That just speaks to the insane demand of this whole thing. If supply is meeting demand, expect around $20/TB"

They're simultaneously retard protection while allowing you more leverage on a dollar per Delta level. 

In smooth brain, you can then buy close to in the money calls and still make big returns.

On top of that take a look at standard deviation and find a good calculator that will show you percent profit chance. Use that to plan your trades and you might make some money."

2021-05-20 19:20:20,wallstreetbets,This explains everything and here I thought PLTR only wants to screw me over.
2021-05-20 19:51:34,wallstreetbets,"Let's hope it closes over 20.83! (I wrote 20.5 puts, so I'm also hoping for an over-20.5 close!)"
2021-05-20 19:53:27,wallstreetbets,good luck my dude. This is quite the FD. I salute you. I have 1k shares so am rooting for you!
2021-05-20 14:52:31,wallstreetbets,Pltr is 20.58.  His call was 20.5.  He is in money right now.
2021-05-20 14:14:57,wallstreetbets,ITM/ATM PLTR calls cling to that ~$.20-.25 premium until about noon on Fridays.
2021-05-20 16:38:22,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs literally bleeding right now. It will bleed while he sleeps and when he wakes up he‚Äôs either covered in blood or hope.
2021-05-20 13:03:03,wallstreetbets,When binary is purely 0
2021-05-20 19:02:56,wallstreetbets,Sadly ‚Ä¶ that will burn to zero by tomorrow

2021-05-20 13:19:56,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not that hard to comprehend what they do.
2021-05-20 13:21:50,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve reported a .19 earning per share this last quarter.  However it was the first they were profitable.
2021-05-20 18:47:07,wallstreetbets,They already printed though ü§î
2021-05-20 16:07:11,wallstreetbets,You forgot the premium
2021-05-20 14:17:24,wallstreetbets,So -40% loss until tomorrow at noon then -99% lol
2021-05-20 14:42:30,wallstreetbets,That doesn't really explain anything. How does one get burned by theta?
2021-05-20 14:44:36,wallstreetbets,I googled it. Makes sense now.
2021-05-20 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,What do they do?  Do you agree with their mission?  Is this one of those companies that have unethical missions?  Does this company work with border control or the prison industrial complex?
2021-05-20 16:11:46,wallstreetbets,"Be real, we all hope it is going to expire worthless end of day tomorrow."
2021-05-20 14:22:53,wallstreetbets,Closer to 20-30% since his basis is .33 but my point is the intrinsic value (or lack thereof) is going to be the main driver of movement.
2021-05-20 15:10:12,wallstreetbets,"seriously recommend you to make a few sell-side plays, 30DTE at least. spend $50 tuition to get hands on experience bullying buyers"
2021-05-20 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,"> What do they do?

Make data actionable

>Do you agree with their mission?

Yes

>Is this one of those companies that have unethical missions?

Whose ethics? But also, I don't care.

>Does this company work with border control or the prison industrial complex?

God, I hope so!"
2021-05-20 14:07:24,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt even know what the fuck you are saying or trying to get at.  They look for patterns in specific data sets they collect.
2021-05-20 16:23:13,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-20 14:25:35,wallstreetbets,"Look I love PLTR, If it were up today I‚Äôd be all over ATM 0dtes, but since it‚Äôs down on a day like this I‚Äôm not interested in a bet much less $50k"
2021-05-20 15:12:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm new to this stuff, but not an actual kid. Thanks for the advice."
2021-05-20 14:09:07,wallstreetbets,And who are they targeting?  Would you support a company that helps deport people?
2021-05-20 15:42:47,wallstreetbets,I like how not knowing stuff gets you downvoted here. Cool.
2021-05-20 18:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Options are affected by 3 things: price of the stock + Implied volatility of the stock + time remaining until expiration.

His current call price is about 0.275 with strike price of 20.5. Current stock price is 20.61, which is 0.11 above the strike.

If we literally remove volatility and price factors, and stock price doesn't do jack shit tomorrow and also closes at 20.61. This dude will lose an additional (0.275-0.11)/0.275 = 60% loss.

Time to expiration is literally only 1 day and the theta is high af. For every hour that this stock doesn't do jack shit tomorrow, relative to today his position is going to collapse in value converging towards that 60% loss."
2021-05-20 14:11:55,wallstreetbets,Terrorists and pedophiles.
2021-05-20 18:53:12,wallstreetbets,That helps. So buying options that expire the next day is a pretty bad idea in general I imagine? Unless there's a rediculous price move that would offset?  I'm still learning protons stuff and there's so much to know. Appreciate the helpful response!
2021-05-20 14:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Define ""terrorist"".  Is it according to the handler?  What if Trump wanted them to monitor BLM activists?  Would you be ok with that?  I wouldn't. 
Would it be ok if police or border patrol wanted them to monitor undocumented immigrants?  Not ok with me either.  Or what about using them to monitor Palestinians and then use that info that leads to missile strikes and deaths of children?  You support this?  I don't."
2021-05-20 19:54:38,wallstreetbets,"Options are pretty much gambling, so it's all as good or bad as one would want. I've definitely bought and sold options one day before expiration. As long as you're on top of it, you can get out fine. But you only get one day, so the swings are wilder- if anything extraordinary happens (Elon tweet), you could make a ton or lose it all."
2021-05-20 14:24:35,wallstreetbets,Jesus dude. Relax.
2021-05-20 14:31:04,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm laughing at your seriousness derived from you thinking they are a CIA hit squad.
2021-05-20 15:30:44,wallstreetbets,A) Why mention Trump? He's been out for almost 5 mos. B) You have a right to your opinion BUT this is a stock thread. I like to keep politics out..
2021-05-20 14:29:56,wallstreetbets,If Blackwater (I think they changed name after their contractors killed a bunch of civilians in Iraq) the company could 5x would you invest?  Or do morals play any part in your investing?
2021-05-20 14:39:24,wallstreetbets,"If Trump or arizona used them to find and deport undocumented families living peacefully in the USA, would you be ok with this?"
2021-05-20 14:33:16,wallstreetbets,They gather the intel and get paid for it.  You are creating a straw man argument.  I never said they were a cia hit squad.  Do you even know who they work with and for what purposes?
2021-05-20 15:47:44,wallstreetbets,PLTR will work with clients that pay.  They had contracts last year with government(s).
2021-05-20 14:38:30,wallstreetbets,You and I are free to look at all their government contracts and what they are worth and how long they run for.  I‚Äôm not the one equating those to tracking BLM protest or bombing Palestine and using them as a shadow tracker hit squad of some sort.  You are and if that‚Äôs what you think they do then go for it.
2021-05-20 14:44:32,wallstreetbets,The point is you don't know if they are used for unethical things like monitoring undocumented immigrants or people or other groups.  The company won't tell you the investor things.  They gather data and identify things and hand it off.  If they want to monitor reddit for SEC and catch people pumping stocks I guess I can support that.

Branson owns like 25% of the company. He sold the rest at double the price and is running the company for free. He wouldnt even connect his new virgin orbit to it because he doesnt want to share his satellite launch profits with you apes. Chamath and wood sold all their shares, the CEO quit.

I would like to know that too but from previous RKT experience, I sold almost everything and kept 50 shares when I could because I don't trust it now. Supre high volume. Censored on WSB. People shorting it like crazy just for the fun of it. If I learned anything in past couple of months I shouldn't bet ""against peoples sentiment"" because the number of retards is always be higher.With that said it will not matter on monday. The ship either flyes or not. But I might make the bet at a better price."
2021-05-20 15:18:03,wallstreetbets,"That's a fair criticism of the post for sure, but the stock doesn't need to hit $60 to be a massively profitable play.

The OTM calls for 5/28 are cheap.  If a successful test pushes the stock to $30 you could have 10-15x gains in a weekend.

Their track record suggests a delay or failure is more likely, but the upside is there."

When comparing companies you look at market cap and derive share price, not the other way around. You are right that based solely on revenue BB is worth 10-12x for it's space, but the share price of one vs another means nothing when looking for growth prospects.

QNX software is a dying ICE nonsense. Toyota ditched it, and others don't even think it's worthwhile to develop their own means it's a minor thing?

Now Partnership With Amazon is positive but nothing is likely to come out from this... It's like  Samsung and LG try to corner the TV with their own OS... nothing after so many years. In this case, its even tougher cos neither BB nor Amazon has any car, and I don't think the big players wanna be part of their ecosystem... unless forced to (like Apple).

2021-05-20 13:04:43,wallstreetbets,"I think a big problem with this is that you assume variance is bad and people are risk adverse.

This is WSB. We love risk

Poor people buy lotto tickets. It's not because they are stupid. It's because a $1MM payoff to someone who has lived in poverty their entire life is world changing. A $1MM payoff to someone upper middle class is nice, but often not life changing. 

Furthermore a lot of users on WSB don't build stock portfolios but rather invest in long options. This means they have positive Vega (volatility) exposure. Higher risk increases the value of long option portfolios. People on WSB aren't stupid either, just retarded

2021-05-20 12:53:57,wallstreetbets,"I actually took a complex class about portfolio analysis long ago, the math and concepts kind of make sense for achieving diversification but the issue I have with all these type of approaches is that there is more to the market than this. 

Individual stocks can perform erratically and more recently, investors can dump all their money on companies that shouldn't exist or that are valued more than all of their competitors combined. Because of diversification, you won't be destroyed when a single stock underperforms, but your returns are not going to to be stellar. If this model proves to be better than the S&P, then it's worth a try, otherwise you are better off putting your money on an index fund and skip the math."

Over a 10 year period its probably going to be positive, even if you picked a 10 year period with the most bear markets in them. Also the example I ran uses 10Y for aapl, amzn, fb, goog, msft. Those stocks had positive returns over 10y. I guess if you put stocks in that had negative returns over some timeline then they would return. Also the model isn't to look at companies individually its more about the user already having the stocks beforehand. So if the user picks bad stocks its not really the model who determined that.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Argument for MNMD Mind Medicine is currently undervalued as a biotech company...

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

&#x200B;

Please take this a Macro, long-term prediction given trends in biotech and mental illness research."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$EEM TA - Once In A Decade Setup In Emerging Markets - Could Double From Here So - this is another setup I've been watching closely for quite a long time. I've got two different charts I want to talk about today. For those who don't know, $EEM - or the iShares Emerging Markets ETF - is comprised of stocks from developing nations, with a **ton** of room to grow. These countries **will** all catch up soon, it's only a matter of time. This is one of the many reasons I find this setup especially interesting.

Here are the top holdings:

[$EEM Holdings \(By Country\)](https://preview.redd.it/zh7nwb2hfa071.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cb2749a2c7d6c7f548ad89a3f9a746b56d2273)

Next, let's dig into the charts -

Chart 1: **Max Monthly (\~16 Years)**

[$EEM Max Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/ylknrqzhea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ee9718b89c47744e6f68224a133c48c7bcfc6f)

Here you can see we have a **symmetrical triangle** pattern that dates back to late 2007. In technical analysis, the longer the pattern has been building, the more significant the breakout will be. Subsequently - you can imagine the magnitude a pattern like this has.

When making new all time highs I like to look for psychological resistances. As a result - logical targets for this pattern are **75.00, 100.00.** Sounds simple, but it works in practice. Keep in mind - something like this will take **3 - 5 years** to play out. This is a position trade.

In order for this breakout to stay valid - we need to continue getting monthly closes above **50.85.** You can see we've pretty much gone perfectly sideways since breaking out for **4 months** now.

This is **bullish -** moving sideways in a higher range is always biased to the upside (except in special situations with certain reversal patterns). Not only that, but we've been forming an interesting setup on the next chart I will show you all -

Chart 2: **1 Year 1 Day**

[$EEM 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/7hy7wbqeea071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8102c5b1f0e92c02260cfccc6b8d77eafea8035d)

On this chart - you can make much more sense of those 4 months of sideways. We are actually working on a large **falling wedge** \- which is a bullish continuation pattern. The breakout point for this is sitting around **54.37** as I am writing this (5/20/2021).

Upon breaking this (ignoring the previous chart) - we would target **54.94, 56.49, 57.32, 60.00, 65.00.** That would be if there was no setup on the monthly chart. Each of these are resistances we could stop and consolidate at. I like to scale in after breaking each resistance. Scale into winners and cut losers fast. A break from a pattern like this would probably take **3 - 6 months** to play out.

I also want to note that **MASSIVE** increase in volume on 3/26. Generally - an uptick on volume when price is doing what you want it to is always a plus. But one like that is very intriguing - on a huge green candle too. My guess would be someone loaded their bags there (or a group of players).

And... **that's it.** Keep it simple. Those are often the best setups.

***TL;DR -***

$EEM has a big pattern - broke out 4 months ago just chopping sideways waiting for the move to happen.

Price targets **75.00, 100.00**

Stop out below **50.87** monthly close

Timeframe **3-5 years**

It also has a smaller pattern above that one - which breaks out above **54.37** and has a shorter time horizon.

Price targets **60.00, 65.00**

Stop out if we close back inside

Timeframe **3-6 months**

***Positions -***

10% of my long term portfolio is in emerging markets ETFs and,

August **55c @ 0.91** \- Will always roll these back before they get below 60 DTE - Will scale in heavily after the smaller pattern breaks out

We had Congress investigating whether DFV had done anything wrong.  That's really all you need to know about where their head is at.   Naked Shorting scam has been glossed over with the ridiculous REG SHO that has no teeth in as far as penalties.  Brokerage firms that are in violation pay the equivalent of good lunch for two people at Del Frisco's Double Eagle.

2021-05-20 14:33:58,wallstreetbets,"People are counting on theaters bouncing back in a huge way as the reopening continues throughout the US. Releases have been delayed for some big movies which *may* bridge the gap as production catches up. 

AMC is the largest theater chain and is currently undervalued compared to its competitors (Regal and Cinemark). I think a squeeze is unlikely but it will climb. How long that climb is sustainable is yet to be seen. I don't have faith in AMC leadership (like you said, not a great stock from the start) and the pandemic has really expedited alternative distribution methods that I don't see going away. If AMC positions itself to be more than just a theater but a large-screen venue they could see a boost.

Things are open and there has been a very meager bump but theaters largely rely on the exclusive distribution of movies to get people in to buy their stuff. The model isn't great long-term and while a lot of people are eager to get back into theaters, there will be a trickle of movies and I believe streaming will really eat into their share. Theaters aren't dead but they aren't a spry young thing either. If there was a big backlog of blockbusters queued up I'd think differently."

Welcome. Anybody who buys AMC and holds is able to jump on when we fly to the moon. Those dumb hedge funds are still shorting AMC. Last week on Friday, they attacked AMC trying to bring it down to $12 to win on their shorts. They failed and have to buy back those AMC shares on top of the ones they shorted in the past. They have not bought back any AMC shares and will continue to pay the interest on their shorts until they buy back all the AMC shares they shorted. The interest is slowly increasing and will eventually have to buy back the shares or pay the interest at a loss. Nobody can live off paying interest forever. Still holding onto my AMC shares.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SPCE is setting themselves up to fail this weekend. This all hinges on on a hunch that SPCE is announcing the test flight in an attempt to cancel it in order to buy more time. Their previous test flight crashed so they should be extra careful during the next one, however SPCE picked the most dangerous day in terms of weather for their flight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Look at the weather for spaceport America. The only day with clouds and precipitation is Saturday. The day they chose. They just announced the test flight today so they must have known about the weather ahead of time.

Saturday has the most wind of any day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why would they choose this saturday, the only day in the past 2 weeks that is cloudy with a chance of rain. Look at the weather history for that area:

Saturday will have the worst weather in the past 2 months and they decided to pick that day of all days. Every other day is sunshine and calm winds except the day they chose.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC DD - sizzle and steak $UWMC Due Diligence - Don't knock it til you read it, or don't I'm a reddit post not a cop.

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

2021-05-20 13:46:58,wallstreetbets,"u/The-Protomolecule

I'm tagging you to add some bear points, and then counter those points with the bull thesis:

Bears say:

1) GOS is suffering huge compression due to companies trying to net volume and the RKT-UWMC price war. UWMC is guiding for Gain on Sale of between .75%-1.15% which is a very significant decrease from Q4 2020 or even Q1 2021.

2) Refinance is slowing down due to higher interest rates.

Bulls Counter:

1) GOS nosediving after booming is natural as it's cyclical. People want to retain as much volume as possible. However, it then goes back to its historical medium of between 1.15%-1.85%.

2) Even at 75BPS, the company is profitable.

3) MSR's value should rise as interest rates rise, and can go high enough to cover expenses for the company as well as the dividend. 

4) They are lowering margin to acquire market share instead of doing acquisitions because it's cheaper for them and more efficient. Other companies don't have the systems they do, and UWMC's systems are the best in class.

5) Interest Rates are still the lowest they've ever been and below 2019. It's only ever been lower last year. 

6) They are purchase oriented, and have been except for 2020. 2018 and 2019 were more purchase heavy than refinance heavy. They also do better in a higher interest rate environment, because they can offer mortgage rates at roughly 15 BPS lower, and as they margin expand through technology it will increase. Home purchases are also complicated while refinance isn't, so time to close is heavily important. They are more than 2.3x faster than anyone else."

I was happyly holding it seeing it going towards 9 on friday, then the entire market did a guh! again, and it lost momentum. I paperhanded for now (at 8.34 which was low, since it jumped back a couple of times before going lower, I suck at timing).

2021-05-20 11:24:27,wallstreetbets,"UwMC has a 13.2B market cap but only 7.4M free float market cap.  This means less less than 6% of shares are out on the open market.  With a low turnover a day, this means a very small amount of shares compared to total market cap shares are traded.  Less than 6%...  what happens of the 94% shares become available to sell and trade?

So people are complaining on short interest or moves based on less than 6% of shares on open market?"

Evan was very reassuring that shareholders of $UWMC would receive the correct rate, but data in app still doesn't match. Considering your size in the brokerage game, I hope that you realize how important it is that your data is accurate.

Google shows dividend yield 4.78%. Other brokerage showing the same amount within .03%. RH shows as less than 2% and has for some time. Been bugging me since about Q1. I've owned this company on another platform since SPAC merger.

2021-05-20 14:03:35,wallstreetbets,"For what it is worth, I think the jumbo mortgage growth is only going to be a temporary boost and is not sustainable; once the housing market cools off a bit, the market for jumbos will decrease rapidly. We're really only seeing the current ""jumbo boom"" because appraised values aren't keeping up with sale prices and buyers need to either come up with the cash to get it to conform with a traditional mortgage or go the jumbo route. Eventually, things will cool off and allow appraised values to catch up, at which point refinancing into a traditional mortgage for a better rate will be very attractive to the folks getting jumbos right now."
2021-05-20 17:20:30,wallstreetbets,Is this some trick to make us all buy to our disadvantage...

(They can't buy 40% of the float at current price) With ex-divy coming up,  a perfect buying opportunity presents itself to possibly get more shares at a cheaper price.

I'm personally selling premium at the strike I want to sell them, and buying more shares after ex-divy. I'm holding the shares and playing the premium, so they can't cheat the shares and make FTD's and extra shares to short as easy.  Make shares make shares.

2021-05-20 11:49:38,wallstreetbets,Jumbo mortgages are low margin and low revenue compared to agency mortgages. They also have way more risk since they don‚Äôt get sold to the GSE‚Äôs. How did it taste barfing up all that bullshit?
2021-05-20 13:30:44,wallstreetbets,"They are actually less risky. As you mention, after the subprime crisis, lending requirements became much more stringent and the credit quality of borrowers has increased. 
These loans tend to prepay faster did to the larger loan size and sometimes the rates are actually lower than for conventional conforming mortgages."

For your next go round, keep an eye out for solid DD *before* a stock jumps 10% in a day, set stop losses to keep your profits, and stay confident in your thesis.

Also if you can wrangle together another $700 and buy your way to 100 shares you can sell covered calls to make extra money on it."

They‚Äôre more risk on their books but the have much more stringent credit and DTI requirements. But they‚Äôre also selling things like servicing rights. This is a huge move towards not needing Fannie and Freddie.

The fees are absolutely the same or higher on a jumbo.

Just because they can‚Äôt sell it to be wrapped into MBS garbage doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs making them less money overall."
2021-05-20 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,"They do not have more risk. Often banks will sell these to private investors or retain. Even on non jumbos, banks may feel that the GSEs charge too much to cover the credit risk so they will just retain them."

I was thinking if you exercise them you buy 100 shares at the same time creating a short 100 share position in the assigned account which they then have to buy back.

2021-05-20 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,He has 94%.  He doesn't need more shares.  He probably should sell more shares.  That is the point.  Don't you think he would sell 20% at 40?  Sure the company can buy buy some stock but he can get millions or billions of profits by selling.

2021-05-20 13:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Options are cheap for spy.

And these posts arent that helpful unless you're day trading with 25k+.

Spy price has been mostly moved by unemployment numbers, inflation stats, fed announcements, and tech bouncing around.

Just buy otm weekly calls after it starts bottoming out on a red week. Or buy puts if it soars past ATH. I suggest buying some vix instead of spy puts because timing the dip after ath doesnt work out usually."
2021-05-20 13:36:55,wallstreetbets,Oh I feel u but spy actually is good to play it moves now from about 404-422 dips about every 4-5 dollars up till 420ish then slopes down dips a bit more bounces up then slopes again once u know the pattern ur gold

2021-05-20 09:45:09,wallstreetbets,Essentially. It depends on risk tolerance for sure. I always look for a retest picture f a gap fill for support. The. If that holds - load up. To note. I don‚Äôt hold anything overnight and exit it nice price targets are reached or if it getting close to bell. That‚Äôs just how I play. Look for resistance at 415-416 battle tho.

It's not a true resistance/support as it is actually the mean.  Bounce on 20 ema . So its soft support/resistance area.  Also a area that acts as a magnet due to mean reversion.  Happy trading"
2021-05-20 15:45:11,wallstreetbets,glad to be making money together
2021-05-20 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this bro, you're GOAT get busy in tomorrow's!

We hit the resistance at 416 but I don't think this is a problem. I think tomorrow could be flat with rotation plays and what not (energy will weigh it down). Monday we might test 410, and then head back for the ATH test like you said before. 

My main arguments right now are energy (Iran Deal and Israel ceasefire) oil will test March lows

Tech dip buying is over done, QQQ has been too strong compared to SPY. I think it will run out of steam. 

Commodities FUD around lumber, copper and steel needs to settle down, once market realises demand is still there regardless of inflation, this and also energy will carry SPY into June FOMC, which I think will be a non news event.

Jackson hole will be the taper announcement, so we will be back at SPY 400 but I do think we see 430-450 before we see 400.

Im not a fan of SPY puts, I do like VIX (not vxx etc) calls at the 25 strike when we settle at 15 or so (average in from 17)

I also like TLT and IEF puts (open when they're at 140/114.5) at the money, September or so."
2021-05-20 09:23:47,wallstreetbets,"If it goes above 415 then its 416, then 417, then 418. If 410 then 409, 408... I agree, 415 will be reached before 416, that is 100% true."

2021-05-20 12:27:57,wallstreetbets,"South Park: The Stick of Truth is heavily based on the ""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers"" episode, and is a classical fantasy turn-based RPG where you play as children pretending to be fighters, wizards, clerics, elves, dwarves etc

South Park: The Fractured, But Whole is the sequel and is superhero-themed, still a turn-based RPG but with a more XCOM style grid.

Both are excellent games and parodies of..well, everything, because South Park."

2021-05-20 13:45:34,wallstreetbets,"It's great - not like a lot of properties that spin off into games, Stick of Truth was legit like playing an episode of South Park that is making fun of games.  But it's not all gimmick, because on top of that, it's actually a really solid game."

This is like buying 4 NQ futures contracts and claiming a $1M bet, you can only lose $1M if Nasdaq goes to zero.

Which isn't to say this is not a ballsy play, it is, but $1M isn't really at risk here, at most OP could lose $200-$300k if the VIX dropped 6-8 points (which is a lot) and its hard for VIX to ""crash"" suddenly because any violent market swings causes the VIX to rise, not fall."

2021-05-20 11:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Black-Scholes won a Nobel prize for their work on options pricing, it's the basis for calculating volatility. A person who uses the phrase 'You go idiot' has zero chance of understanding how the value is calculated. If your not clever enough to show how its worked out dont try to make people think you understand it, clearly you dont.

Show me how its NOT related to large price increases.

The clue is in the definition of the word ...

""volatility"" noun

1. liability to change rapidly and unpredictably,...  <---- ie up OR down!

Carry on listening to CNN for your market 'news'. LEL"
2021-05-20 10:08:46,wallstreetbets,Lmao using the definition itself word for word instead of the implications of what that definition means. No wonder you can't understand shit you've got a way too narrow mind and way to feeble reflexion capacity. No wonder that you also conveniently ignored that you've got literally no education (technical or academical) in the subject whatsoever.
2021-05-20 11:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Let me guess. You think that because market goes up sharply, volatility increase and thus the VIX too increase ?

It's funny that you say someone saying 'You go idiot' has no chance of understanding it, as you also said it in your comment above. Maybe that's why you didn't expand your explanation of Black-Scholes. You might've heard of Black-Scholes, but I doubt you understand the formulas behind. You see, there's something called a negative delta, which implies that the VIX doesn't go up as the market increases. Even if it's sharply.

Of course, it's more complicated than just that, there is more factor to take into account, but basically, no the VIX doesn't go up as the market goes up.

Here's a quick and short explanation just for you :)

When you say that the VIX go up as market goes up sharply it's false because even though it happens sometimes it's not a trend and you can't make that claim. When I say that the VIX doesn't go up as the market sharply increase, it is simply true because that's what the data shows and that's what the formula predicts. Some small discrepancies doesn't make the norm. 

Of course they are a multitude of other factors that affect its price but because *sometimes* it does form a positive correlation with market prices doesn't mean that you can make the general claim that 'the VIX goes up as the market sharply increases'. 

That's called statistics."
2021-05-20 10:21:18,wallstreetbets,"So then you would know that the creators say it measures volatility , like I said? 

I'm literally just repeating what the designers of VIX said... why would that anger you so much?"
2021-05-20 10:24:51,wallstreetbets,"?? I literally answered someone else saying that VIX is basically a fear index.  You said it was volatility. I said it's basically the same and then YOU got triggered and started name-calling. 

You wanna know why you had no credibility?

Because I'm arguing that VIX is called the fear index because that's what it essentially represent. You're arguing that it's not fear, but volatility only because the 4 letters f-e-a-r aren't explicitly mentionned by the creators. That's why you won't win that argument because you're literally wrong. And now you're trying to make it seem as if I was arguing that VIX was NOT a measure of volatility, even though those words were literally never typed by me."
2021-05-20 10:30:56,wallstreetbets,"You're just Embarrassed that you never realized the true definition of it and you rely on ""other people"" and saying ""oh it's basically the same anyways"", but I'll just continue calling it by its real name and real purpose and reference the people that ACTUALLY DESIGNED IT, so I don't look like a complete clown like you.  üòÇü§°"
2021-05-20 10:37:12,wallstreetbets,"Says the uneducated 15 years old McDonald's dumbass employee. I sincerely don't give a shit if you can't realize what volatility means and even less that you can't admit that you fucked up. 

And it's pretty ironical that you say I rely on other people, because that's literally a psychological projection. YOU rely on what others say because YOU can't understand it for yourself. I, inversely, have studied in the subject, literally understand the formula that they use and thus can infer its meaning. Trust me that I have pushed the reasoning of the VIX faaaar more than you did. 

And don't worry, calling it the Index of Fear won't make you look like a clown, only towards an unlearned, uncultivated, illiterate person would you look like a clown (basically me vs you in this current instance)"
2021-05-20 10:46:55,wallstreetbets,"Yikes. I'm literally just repeating what the CBOE says it is and you're triggered beyond belief.  I really don't understand how you could be so angry and embarrassed by its actual definition. 

I guess you could call the Chicago Board Options Exchange and yell at them and explain how wrong they are if it will make you feel better."
2021-05-20 10:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Again with your infantile delusions **sigh**. 

Sure kid, you keep telling yourself that instead that you were wrong and that the VIX indeed is an indicator of fear. Again, I sincerely don't care since I'm not the one that's losing anything here (besides my time because obviously nothing stays between your ears). You're the one losing knowledge because of your own ego and arrogance (and stupidity, it goes hand in hand). But again, at 15, I'm not surprised."
2021-05-20 11:02:37,wallstreetbets,"I mean , it's already been proven that it was designed to measure volatility , and that overtime people gave it other nicknames. The source is the creator's white paper. I guess you can call them and tell them that what they created is wrong , I'm not sure if they're trained in mental health crises though. 

Contact Membership Services at 913.815.7002 or 312.786.7449 or by email to MembershipServices@cboe.com with any questions."
2021-05-20 11:04:39,wallstreetbets,"Well, VIX is more like the measure of uncertainty. Theoretically the VIX can correlate positively with SPX if there is no uncertainty about a slow and steady decline, as it is calculated by averaging the weighted prices of S&P 500 put and call options."
2021-05-20 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. 

But again; that was never my point. :/

Good try, though!"
2021-05-20 12:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Okay, is it fear or volatility?"
2021-05-20 12:17:52,wallstreetbets,"The math uses the volatility as it is a way to quantify risks and thus fear. 

The higher the fear in the market, the higher the risks, the higher the volatility, and finally the lower the stocks and the higher the VIX. Which is why VIX is commonly called the Index of Fear, because that's the root of its value. 

Edit : the higher the anticipated risks*"
2021-05-20 19:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Fear is not ""the root of its value"". It's juvenile and wrong to assign an emotion to a mathematical formula. It's cringey that you're miseducating others. Prices can be volatile and the people not be fearful. The people can be fearful and the price not be volatile. Just let go of the misconceptions you've been clinging to so embarrassingly."
2021-05-20 19:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you're still there. Still haven't understood huh? You know you don't need to 'believe' me right? If you're so damn smart I'm sure you can use your laptop/phone and open Google. You know Google, right? 

VIX increases in value when put prices increases and when call prices decreases because that makes volatility increase. That's literally the formula. Put prices increases when there is more demand for them because people are fearful of future events and want to hedge their positions. Do you understand so far? 

On the opposite when everything's good in the market and nobody's fearful, put options are cheaper because most people aren't hedging they're position. You're still with me?

So when aggregate investors are fearful, put options price increase making its volatility increase. And then the VIX goes up. 

Was that too complicated? And again you shouldn't talk about the mathematical formula, you know very well that you can't argue in that language."

2021-05-20 09:20:52,wallstreetbets,"I thought this place was for discussing stocks and our opinions, so Wallstbets I don't know if you're shorting GM but I am bullish Long on GM and here's my take: 

I believe GM stock is undervalued by half at least. Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90.  
My plays are as follow:  
BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts  
BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts  
GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level

5/20/2021 9:48am EDT
By Ian Bezek, InvestorPlace Contributor


UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC) is a most interesting company. UWM, which is short for United Wholesale Mortgage, rose to prominence earlier this year thanks to the r/WallStreetBets excitement. Traders bid it up in hopes of a huge short squeeze. This did not happen. In fact, UWMC stock has crashed. However, unlike many Reddit stocks, this one appears to be a fundamentally strong company trading at a compelling valuation.

Made a small fortune on it this year. I don't believe in a squeeze to crazy highs, but I do believe in volatility. I also think GME has an interesting case as a long-term investment.

It's the most popular retail stock in the world, and it has a pretty solid floor because of lunatic Redditors who I will use as my bagholders if I ever really want out.

I will ride its volatility selling CCs until I am assigned.

If you own GME shares, vote if you can.

The vote is and always was the **only catalyst**. The company can issue a recall of shares IF the vote is rejected from too many shares in circulation."

2021-05-20 09:23:19,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is famous for being highly vertically integrated. Which means it doesn't rely on outside  suppliers for its key components.

Their customers may be the biggest beneficiaries. Except telecom is the most profitable space-based business, and SpaceX itself has cornered the satellite internet business (Starlink). And Starlink can do a lot of things that used to be done by multi-billion dollar geostationary telecommunications satellites. All other space-based businesses are pretty niche. Maybe satellite imaging, like Planet Labs? (Though they are not publicly traded.) Or perhaps companies that make avionics and satellite buses for smallsats and cubesats.

The other possibility is that the success of SpaceX lends confidence to other space launch startups. But do you really want to bet on companies that are late to the game? Would you have invested in Fisker in 2012?"

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success? So just how big is **today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology**?

1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. 

**What does this mean?** Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. 

So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem.

**Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go** in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech.

In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. 

But remember, **the technology Sorrento is developing  will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases** related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large.

The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. 

**What does this mean?** Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. 

Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. 

The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages.

Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento.

The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system.

Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. **Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments**. 

This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. T**he fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE**.

As for the results themselves: **The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints** in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting).

This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised.  That is considered  moderate to high disease activity.  There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad.

Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. **That is a dramatic change**. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, **Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor.** 

I hope investors understand this. **It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline** which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. 

But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It‚Äôs the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!"

2021-05-20 05:41:55,wallstreetbets,OP somehow made a decent bull call on NKLA [https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:biutifo](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:biutifo). SRNE call seems to keep going down tho.
2021-05-20 09:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Good stuff, ty for sharing. I am long SRNE but for much different reasons. Either way it can‚Äôt go tits up if you just hold."

2021-05-20 04:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Dan, yes, I hold a long position in SRNE and it's an old position so I'm in the green at the current price.

I'm not a financial adviser at ALL. I do think i can help in understanding the value of the bio pharma potential. 

Everyone should do their own D/D. Sofusa is in phase 1, so this is not a product that will be available to the market anytime soon. The current trial is scheduled to end April 22."
2021-05-20 06:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Minh, btw, everyone KILLED me in the comments when I mentioned NKLA in a favorable way, it was like a was a sinner... then it went up 28% in two weeks.  It lost some ground since then, but still up 18%. Regardless, my post was about holding a long position.

Same with SRNE. It's due a big spike. If it gets the EUA it jumps 35% or more, IMO, even without it, I feel it will spike considerably before June 15th.  But I'm long, and everyone should do their own D/D. Keep in mind SRNE is trading at 7ish and has a TP of +25, is badly shorted and could be squeezed."

2021-05-20 06:21:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't know much about SRNE, but for NKLA their business model makes sense. Their tech is kind of a mesh of different parts from different suppliers, but even Tesla is not completely vertically integrated yet. Hydrogen is abundant, but processing it takes work. 

A bet on NKLA is a bet on them beating competitors at delivering that fuel efficiently. The trucks not working as shown and the sketchiness displayed by Trevor are obviously bad, but I think the tech can be more efficiently distributed than EVs. On a practical note, you get past a high hurdle and you're clear. That's why I think it's not a bad bet."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messaging Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast).

The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. 

Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high.

10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API.

Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages.

Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method.

Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US  that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through.

It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. 

Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap.

TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US."
2021-05-20 01:27:48,wallstreetbets,"I like twilio as a company (especially with their integration tech), but personally I think it is overvalued right now and there are better places to invest. I am an autistic monkey though, so who knows"

2021-05-20 01:33:48,wallstreetbets,This is pretty big if true. It'd be nice to buy some calls before that acquirement if it happens

2020 revenue growth was 53.3% from 1.134B to 1.762B.

2021-05-20 05:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Not only are all of these incredibly famous people pissing on eachother, but they're playing the young and old versions of the beastie boys as a continuation of the Fight for Your Right party from the 1980s. Young versions (Wood, McBride, Rogan) leave the party from the music video, break into a convince store, steal beer, and then go and pretty much torture every noteworthy celebrity from this century. And at the end of it all, old versions (Black, Ferrell, Reilly) jump out of a motherfucking DeLorean and challenge them to a dance off. That's the 5 minute video. There's a 30 minute extended version that just tops off the chaos."
2021-05-20 08:24:22,wallstreetbets,I thought Seth Rogan was Bob Odenkirk haha

2021-05-20 12:37:01,wallstreetbets,IMHO That is the greatest music video of all time. So many cameos. The last video to feature Adam Yauch. I have a hunch that the literally dozens of A-list celebrities that signed on for the video did it because he was in the end stages of cancer at the time.

He was a huge fan of Beastie Boys and his daughter was an absolute badass of a 6 year old and of course, this video was his daughters favorite. I have really fond memories of singing beastie boys songs with them and referencing videos like this.

That man was great, nonchalantly sharing tequila with my when I had friends over and my parents were out of town (I was 18 and a senior in high school) and we were both often outside playing baseball or something with the kids, being the best role models we could be (and him being a role model for me in that period of time.)

He gave me his old surfboard and lots of wisdom before I went off to college, this video always reminds me of that sweet, if not very wild family.

RIP Vic

Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the time and place for this venting, it‚Äôs probably a weird video to have such sentiment towards

2021-05-20 10:55:08,wallstreetbets,"I was lucky enough to catch the premiere of this at Sundance, sitting a few rows behind the Beastie Boys and Danny McBride in a 1200 seat theater full of very uncomfortable film snobs. I'll never forget hearing them howl with laughter as they looked around and saw how this scene was making so much of the audience nauseous."
2021-05-20 04:21:36,wallstreetbets,"Really? The only thing funny about this is the production value. I wonder how many $$$ were burned for this ""comedic"" masterpiece.

Premise: Somebody is dancing on the floor in a battle and usually the other guys start to join the dance. Punchline: Instead of dancing the guy just starts to piss on the floor. Now the battle is about pissing at each other. And then they just act surprised because hey, now they are getting pissed on. Who would have thought?

What a joke. Not.

e: you can downvote me for all you want but: Especially Will Ferell (and Jack Black and Seth Rogan) think you are idiots. If you analyze their comedy that is the only way this makes sense. Prove me wrong."

2021-05-20 04:28:00,wallstreetbets,"The SEC literally catches and busts people all the time, every day, all over the country/world.  And they reclaim much larger amounts of money in both restitution and 
punitives than people give them credit for.  They're actually one if the most profitable government agencies in existence,  technically.   They stay quite busy, its just mostly extremely humdrum procedural forensic accounting against people who are essentially nobodies (compared to world famous conmen celebrities and politicians.)  They don't rate high enough to get in the news.

Source:  my father works for the SEC auditing and providing oversight for his local group of around 200 investigators/prosecutors.  They stay busy.  But they also admittedly are subject to congressional budget approvals every year (even though they bring in far more revenue than they cost, and are essentially ""self financed"",  but that gives the politicians in DC enough leverage/influence to scare them away from poking around too much in any politically connected / involved offices.

The toughest part is actually just trying to wage a never ending battle to wrench pay exemptions from OPS or whatever bureaucracy is in charge of federal pay.  Investigating and prosecuting high finance requires you to essentially poach orher equally skilled and experienced high finance attorneys, which means competing with high end banker pay.  So they get obscure exemptions to federal pay scale regulations to poach away some sharks from Goldman Sachs on the promise that they'll get similar pay, but with the (often highly valued) benefit of being able to literally prey on all the douchebag assholes they used to  have to work with/for.

For the casting, these guys are know for setups like this, so there is really not too much surprise involved. If you see Jack Black, you know some farting-level-jokes are ahead, same with Will Ferell, there is going to be some quirky/silly character play.

Lets say the cast from the Dark Knight would redo that scene, Bale, Freeman, Caine and Ledger (he could play the guy on the floor), wouldnt that be more out of character, therefore more suprising and thus more funny?

I know I read to much into this shit, but man, I am sick of fart jokes, vomit jokes, where are the good jokes?

This Lordstown Week idea shows supreme confidence in their own legitimacy and ought to erase many doubts stemming from the short report and SEC investigation. This inspired a ton of buying pressure and bull flag after bull flag. 

There are 2 more catalysts on the horizon:

1. Earnings - Monday 5/24: could always be a rug pull... or the next leg up. Fisker moved upward after their earnings, as investors got excited by the Foxconn partnership amongst other things and understood their too young of a company to have substantial figures. RIDE's coming earnings gives them to speak on some hard numbers. ""Soft,"" speculative numbers are what they've been investigated for previously so this will shed some light, as well as any speak on any progress and projects they are working on. 
2. Lordstown Week - June 21-25: This is a full week event at their plant in Ohio. The guts of the operations will be open to the media and investors alike. the first 3 days will have media coverage. The event will include factory tours, presentations and test drives of the Endurance.

&#x200B;

I've been waiting for a red day since I heard the news after the pop, but idk if there will be one between now and Monday. And Monday could be an explosion or implosion. I don't have any positions, but I am thinking of buying shares and Fall calls. I just wanted to get some genuine discussion on a hot stock that is surely striking fomo in many of us"

2021-05-20 13:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Physics... Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Unsprung mass is the mass beneath the suspension. That is the part of the vehicle that is supposed to track the road. When you have bumps the unsprung mass acts directly on that. So the more unsprung mass the harder the bumps are hit and more work is needed (i.e. the wheels absorb more energy from the bump so you have to work harder to continue moving). The unsprung mass also reduces the damping ability of the tires as it does not have the suspension to help isolate the weight. So your tires will deform more on hitting a bump. Also, when hitting a bump, the more unsprung mass the more likely the wheel will actually bump up and leave the road temporarily as the suspension has to work harder to keep it down (since there is more force involved in hitting every bump).

Here are some sources that discuss unsprung mass to help you out:

2021-05-20 03:28:19,wallstreetbets,I would also assume the lower centre of gravity on each wheel would give it better balance and adhesion to the road - ultimately less stress on the frame and other parts/components
2021-05-20 12:47:19,wallstreetbets,"Really?! In the SF250 the Endurance drove 40 miles at an average speed of 20 mph before they stopped to charge and decided to quit the race. Trophy Trucks average about 50 miles (two and a half times faster!).

So please, before you or anyone else tries defending their pathetic performance in the SF250, explain why they were driving so slow.

You know what is common to going slow and low efficiency, the physics of unsprung mass.

Oh, as to brake assemblies... does not the endurance also need brakes?

Whatever. This race turned out as one would expect for a car built with too much unsprung mass. At this point, my view is that I will believe LMC will get this to successful mass production when I see it. My bet is they will end up bankrupt sooner or later (well their money is enough to keep them rolling for a while, but it too will run out eventually)."
2021-05-20 13:39:21,wallstreetbets,"I agree that there will be more deformation of the tires due to Newton's laws but I am not certain that the cost in tires would be a net loss when compared to the cost in maintenance of the rest of the vehicle and the cost of energy lost in bringing the energy from the motors to the wheels.

2021-05-20 14:08:21,wallstreetbets,You think their hub motors weigh more than a solid axle?
2021-05-20 12:51:57,wallstreetbets,Brakes built into hub motor.
2021-05-20 14:13:17,wallstreetbets,"That article addresses none of the significant issues raised with unsprung mass, rather it is dealing with handling and comfort, which may or may not be issues depending on the speed and road surface.

The issues I mentioned involved its impact on efficiency and the greater forces involved on hitting bumps, which this article does not address (to be honest, it does gloss over when road surfaces get rougher, but does not alleviate the concerns there).

Maintenance of an EV with the motor suspended is very simple as you have your half-shaft connecting your wheel to the motor. The motor is better protected so it will have less maintenance issues. The wheels get less abuse, so less maintenance issues. And frankly half-shafts should last the life of the vehicle without any major maintenance.

Regarding efficiency of transferring form a motor mounted via half-shafts versus in-wheel motors. Inherently a mounted motor allows you to use reduction gears and have greater flexibility resulting in a more efficient motor to begin with. Further, the losses of turning a half-shaft are probably very minimal and far less than unsprung weight causes. If LMC ever manages to release a vehicle for someone to test, I guess we can look at the weight, the kWh's, and range in real-life to get a better idea of what the real efficiency losses are."
2021-05-20 14:18:56,wallstreetbets,"CV Axels (half-shafts) weigh about 17 lbs each based on what I can find online. Part of that weight is connected to the sprung weight so probably about 12 lbs of unsprung weight from it.

LMC in-wheel motors, I think, weigh 88 lbs each.

So we are possibly talking about as much as 70+ lbs of unsprung weight extra per wheel. Even if it is 50 lbs it is still a lot."
2021-05-20 14:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes it would be interesting to see the test results, elaphe(the hub motor producers) have done testing on them. It is going to be a long time until we find out the best thing to do with electric vehicles as they are far more flexible with their configuration than ICE vehicles. Additionally I would like to apologize for saying you were talking out your ass. Normal people take the first thing they hear and do not apply and actually science to it before repeating it and I have certainly had enough of that this year. Though you seem well informed."
2021-05-20 15:08:18,wallstreetbets,"CV axles only came to fruition in trucks during the last 20 years. What do you think they used before that?

Take a look underneath a current trophy truck. What do you see in the rear? Solid axle. 

Again, what do you think those cast iron solid axles weigh? 

Unsprung mass only matters in relation to sprung mass. This is why CV shafts were adopted in small vehicles first. The greater the weight of the vehicle, the less of an impact it has. Would you call an EV truck with batteries light or heavy?

3/4 ton and up trucks are still running solid axles front and rear. 

It's quite a bit less detrimental than you make it out to be."
2021-05-20 14:49:57,wallstreetbets,"No problem, no apology needed. You get enough mindless repeating of claims without people making the effort to dig into them a bit for anyone to call out someone saying something that runs counter to what they assume.

End of the day, would love to see LMC surprise us and show us they can make this work, but things like the SF250 results reaffirm my doubts about the tech. If it does work, it allows more flexibility and perhaps efficiency in how to build vehicles, which is great. Bottom line, there are significant valid concerns here and the onus is on LMC, I think, to put those to rest."
2021-05-20 15:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Fair points.

Trophy Trucks in the front and the Endurance Truck in the front had similar setups, just the Endurance had that extra weight on its front wheels.

Regarding the rear, you might be right that a solid axle weighs a bit, but the axle acts as a component of the suspension in connecting the suspension to the wheels. You would need two independent suspensions for the Endurance which when you factor everything in (including the dual motors), well I can't say for certain, but am guessing the Endurance has some extra weight there (but maybe not much difference).

Also, thinking about a solid-axle with a single suspension versus in-wheel motors with independent suspensions (and no axle), I would think the solid-axle design, even it it weighs the same, would better allow the forces to be distributed over the full suspension whereas an independent design could result in more forces acting on one side or the other (i.e. unsprung weight is a bigger issue without a solid-axle perhaps).

Perhaps a rear-drive setup would have been better for LMC, but they might not get enough power out of just two motors, hence they need all-wheel drive.

I think you make good points and I am speculating a bit here. Bottom line, it seems to me, that the Endurance performed as expected if unsprung mass is an issue. Without someone having access to measure every aspect of it and compare there is really no way to know for sure whether what I am saying is correct, but to me it makes sense."
2021-05-20 17:05:15,wallstreetbets,"I agree it is on them to prove it. Part of me just feels there's got to be a better way to make vehicles, the efficiency of them is garbage and I feel it would go a long way towards green energy goals to reduce the amount of energy gobbled up by friction, heat, and other outside forces. Though like you said, this may not be it."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Crazy Put Option Play on AMC over the Next Week Huge Put option play on AMC over the next week.  Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% to $14.54 then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) that was followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24.  

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options.

If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide.  If the squeeze materializes then you make all your money there and lose alittle on some cheap put options that could be the real money makers."
2021-05-20 01:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Stop reporting this.

It is not spam.
It is not market manipulation.

This is a valid üåàüêª put play.  

Just because it's against a Stonk you may hold, doesn't mean it's reportable.

Bulls and bears both make the market."

If it goes up a bunch I'm winning at a small hedge cost, if it drops I have options to ape up more shares. If all the apes were doing this, it might be distort Max pain higher or at least higher than the put price that everyone piles into."

2021-05-20 13:42:07,wallstreetbets,"There's three photos in op's gallery. 

OP bought option contracts priced at about $4.00 and sold for $10.00.

The quoted price on an option contract is on a per share basis, so they paid circa $400 (100 shares per contract so $4x100 = $400). They sold each contract for about $1000 so OP generated a 2.5x return."
2021-05-20 09:11:57,wallstreetbets,Can u suggest a broker??
2021-05-20 14:59:14,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? Why would spx puts not be generating income if held for less than a year?
2021-05-20 01:38:10,wallstreetbets,Spy $450 next week confirmed
2021-05-19 22:21:58,wallstreetbets,"I bought SPY puts earlier this week b/c of the coming DTCC deposit requirements, but also, because the SPY seems to always retest a dramatic drop.  I was expecting 405 on the SPY again.   There was so much fear that I held the puts.  This looks like a relief bounce on low volume.   Volume was on the bear side today."
2021-05-20 02:32:29,wallstreetbets,I mean it doesn't have to be THAT extreme. Market doesn't always go up you know. :p
2021-05-19 22:16:58,wallstreetbets,SPY is directly correlated to the S & P 500 index. Picking which day the market decides to take a shit is a bit like trying to get a bee off your dick by throwing a dart at it while blindfolded. There is a small chance of success and huge downside potential. But damn if it doesn‚Äôt look cool.
2021-05-19 22:08:46,wallstreetbets,Try it and update us

2021-05-20 00:58:50,wallstreetbets,there's probably at least several people per day on this sub who yolo into SPY puts. this is just the guy who happened to do it yesterday
2021-05-19 23:27:13,wallstreetbets,Probably FOMC minutes.
2021-05-20 13:50:31,wallstreetbets,"They are.

An options contract gives you the right to buy or sell blocks of 100 shares depending on whether you've bought or sold them. The right to buy or sell only kicks in once the conditions of the contract have been met, i.e a contract comes into the money before expiry.

Options derive their value from a bunch of variables called the greeks."

Your context: some sexual innuendo.      

Welcome to this subreddit. We make a lot of sexual jokes, but nothing is ever sexual unless we are talking about our wive‚Äôs boyfriends."
2021-05-19 23:10:34,wallstreetbets,you assume OP won't lose it all before nest year.
2021-05-20 01:39:05,wallstreetbets,<the IRS enters the chat>
2021-05-19 22:56:58,wallstreetbets,Right answer that OP will ignore.
2021-05-20 00:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Just because nobody here ever knows how short term capital gains work, OP's gains will be taxed as additional income for this year and taxed accordingly. If OP made say 50k in normal job income and no other capital gains this year, then he's taxed as if he made $62k. 

He's in the 22% tax bracket if he's single, or the 12% if he's married filing jointly. And he's only taxed at 22% for his income above $40k, so 22k is taxed at 22%.

[This shit is not that complicated](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp).

E: a kind soul pointed out that I completely eschewed standard deductions. I‚Äôm gonna leave the math in despite it not accounting for them, but my core point stands. You end up paying even less tax after those than I was accounting for."

For day job income, no.  But with investing, if you realize a gain in the short term, it's taxed at your nominal rate.  Some folks, not being aware of this, will take all the gains from a single big YOLO, and spend it on additional investments, a home, lambo, etc.  The following year at tax reporting time, the IRS says ""hey based on how much you made last year, you either owe us more or we owe you.""  If they're a standard W2 employee, taxes are automatically deducted from one's paycheck so that come tax time, they aren't manually figuring out tax amounts owed from their job.  However with a large YOLO gain like this, no taxes are automatically deducted.  That gain will be reported to the IRS by one's brokerage as is standard, and during tax prep time, you have to report all your investment gains/losses.  Those investment gains/losses are added to your day job income, and that final number (minus any deductions) is the amount you will pay taxes on.  

All this to say, if you're not holding back some additional cash to pay the capital gains tax on a yolo gain like this, you're going to be in for a surprise come tax time the following year."

You see where the ball is landing, and where the other players are betting, and usually do well to not put your larger portion where everyone else is. Sometimes there are hotspots, but on big bets, the ball usually falls elsewhere. Slow and steady keeps the gains, and when the icer comes out, take a break. It also always helps to have a full table. 

When you're up, you don't bet big. This kills a lot of players. The same system applies to stocks. Some bets don't pan out, but with patience and proper attention, a lot do. Like I said, learn to Roulette. A system without modification and a plan only goes so far.

For the record, I've used and tested this system and my mods extensively on roulette apps before betting at the casino, and have beat the odds there too.

Correct. Having said that, I think brokers will autoexercise your options for you should they end up in the money at expiry. You get to keep the difference of course. I've never had an option expire in the money so I can't be sure this is how it works.

This is not actually a problem. If OP reinvests this money and loses it all, he will not owe anything on taxes. In fact, he'll get a deduction since he lost his initial investment as well.  

If OP reinvests this money and wins more, then he will have more to be taxed and more to pay it with.  

It becomes a problem if he continues high rolling 'til the end of the fiscal year and then the next fiscal year comes, he YOLOs and loses it all, and now he can't pay taxes on _this year's_ winnings because it he lost it _next year_.

You've got a roughly 33% chance at losing the entire bet, and it can and does happen, and can happen in streaks, but you watch and play the streaks as well. You make your small win betting side the side the ball falls to the most, and cover the next hot six with your medium bet. For American, you place between the zeros. Luck does factor in, but if you go to the casino, you go to lose money anyways. At the very least, you get to lengthen the loss. I walked in expecting to lose the $300 I walked in with.

2021-05-19 21:04:24,wallstreetbets,"There are, but I could barely understand half the words in that sentence, much less effectively communicate my limited understanding of the other catalysts that move this stock. I will say for the most part, it moves in pretty close relation to spot oil prices. I've been buying and selling calls for the past couple of months with pretty good success on the rise and fall of oil, with an overall hypothesis that oil prices will continue the trend up through this summer."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE - The Train Is Leaving The Station After an epic beatdown from a short seller report, $RIDE appears to have risen from the dead and is once again poised to reward investors.

The stock is up 64% since the close on 5/13, through 5/19. Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

It's still not too late to jump on the $RIDE train and ***squeeze*** the life out of the naysayers. All aboard!

Its fair to say to say its a very volatile time to be in the stock market. So it could easily fall. I will buy if it falls $5.50. There is too much at risk. The truck margins could suck, and not be profitable for a long time or ever. Also you could just have the truck not work. In-hub motors have not been proven yet.

If the truck was to fail, then what? They are going to be burning cash trying to get a vehicle. They don't have a product, and we still don't have too much idea if the truck works. The recent news was interesting, pointing towards test drives. Hopefully good news comes out. Right now? Still a huge risk.

I think it's already priced in for Ford, the only way that will cause a surge on their end will be if fleet sales go in an unexpected direction. Which I don't think they will. Because that's what unexpected means.   


However, I do see that hype as deflating RIDE a little bit.   


I got out yesterday with like a hundred bucks' profit. I got in late April for around $9/share for like $300 invested.   
Rule of three. If something's been going well for you three days in a row, consider taking profit.   


I'm not even pretending there was anything more to it than a superstitious impulse. No math, no logic, no patterns. I just felt like it was about to go the other way because it had gone the green direction for too long.   


Now I'm waiting until they get back down around $6 to buy back in in the hope that it comes back up to around $15-20 around December."

Held down by a lawsuit with zero basis in reality that has nothing to do with the product.

Still a risky pre-production move, but the reason for the low price has nothing to do with the company's ability to produce the product. If they come to market it has so much upside potential."
2021-05-19 22:27:23,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping there will be more insight given at earnings.
2021-05-20 07:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, so when it hit 6.90 that wasn't a reasonable valuation to take a flier? What about potential for ATVM, shores up the cash burn rather quickly. 

As far as working product, that will be addressed with an update on betas during the next earnings call. Given the recent announcement everything is trending up as expected. The current valuation is still attractive IMO. The truck also worked in the Baja besides inability to charge, so seems the product works. The cash burn is largely due to the advancement of the van which will be another revenue stream."

2021-05-19 23:11:05,wallstreetbets,"There is an SEC investigation that likely lead to the week delay in earnings from 5/17 to 5/24. Obviously if it had merit that wouldn't be good, but I think it's highly unlikely. Ride has been floating with the EV market for the last 6 months - nobody manipulated anything aside from the money flowing into SPACs in general.

The lawsuits that have been plaguing the news ticker for the last month are complete fairy tales when it comes to their claims about production and the battery fire. If you look into the engineering and current factory and beta status at all it's obviously bullshit and came from analysts that have no interest in understanding EV engineering. They just wanted a convenient target which worked out nicely for them. Now the claim about pre-orders has more teeth, but it's honestly pretty weak as a basis for any actual fraud and isn't exactly a new or novel development in the sector.

The riskiest thing about this is the fact that it's speculative EV on a deadline for production. The engineering and manufacturing risks are very real and it's going to be a serious challenge to meet deadlines and compete in the coming markets. But lawsuits? I'm not even slightly worried (which is why I intentionally used the lawsuits to invest when the price was held down)

Normally, I wouldn't even invest in speculative EV as I don't trust the industry. But in this case I think the ties to GM, Elaphe, and Camping World combined with the logistical and financial valuation of their current factory set-up gives them a significant leg up."

Without shitposting 

Look at the market cap if it had as many shares as Ford does it would be worth about .40 there is plenty of room for all players in the ev field.

This is like buying nio valued @ .80.

This time next year it will easily be worth CCIVs mc and that would put it at 170 a share

Never invest what you can't lose but this is the easiest play in the market right now.

Buy the fear."

One of my biggest regrets is not being able to buy RKT calls because I wasn't approved for options yet. Had an order placed and canceled for 10 contracts, $6 a piece, that were worth $1,000 later that day. Thought I had been approved but it didn't go through in time.

Then my dumbass bought MVIS shares at $12, doubled down (with margin) at $20, held through $30, and got margin called when it dropped. Ended up raising my cost basis to $18 and turned a huge gain into huge bags."

2021-05-19 23:41:03,wallstreetbets,"That should work, and you probably won't have to buy as many as you think. During Monday's rally it was only about 15k shares of excess volume that drove the price up by about .50. So to cover the 1.76 you need to break even you only need to buy around 52,000 shares for about $437,000. But realistically if you put in a big order it will most likely start a rally so I bet on the low end you could buy half that many split up a bit and still break even. So best case you are only buying 26k shares for around $219,000.

So for the low, low price of a quarter to a half million dollars you can save yourself 14 grand. Plus after that you will have a whole bunch of UWMC you can use to sell covered calls to morons who make stupid bets based on internet rumors."

He could buy 100 shares for $800 ($8/share) and cash out at $1000 ($10/share) and pocket $200. 

As an alternative, if the OTM option premium is $0.50/share, that $800 can buy 16 contracts, for control of 1600 shares. If the contract goes into the money, maybe it's worth $1/share for a total value of $1600, profit of $800. More leverage, more potential profit for the same money.

Unless it expires worthless, which is where it really wound up, pissing away the $800."
2021-05-19 20:04:10,wallstreetbets,"Leverage means you have control over a larger size of shares for less cost, but usually more risk. Option contracts are worth 100 shares. You pay a premium, and hope to sell them when they go up. You expose yourself to more risk, but more reward if you were right."
2021-05-19 20:00:54,wallstreetbets,Options leverage smaller amounts of money for bigger gains than holding the same dollar amount of shares. But obviously at a huge risk.

2021-05-19 20:29:00,wallstreetbets,Anyone holding an option to expiration while bleeding money is not doing it right. One can exit at anytime and lose some premium. if you trade the premium and not the underlying asset it changes the game. Also one can hedge a large long position with cheaper puts in another month and lower strike etc etc. I just cringe when people say options carry huge risk. You can mitigate the risk very easily.

2021-05-19 20:30:21,wallstreetbets,"No, you can buy the share for $8 or the option at $0.50 when the share is $8. You can ""afford"" 16x as many shares in calls vs. owned outright.

If calls go into money, the value goes up a lot (figure from $.50 to $1 in my example). That is less than the full $2 per share from $8-10, but you have 16x as many, so you make a lot more.

You can see exponential returns if you get something for a low premium and it goes up. At a fraction of the share cost, you can also rachet up your number of shares.

Calls can be relatively safe in that you can only lose the premium, and there can be amazing upside. Some guy spent $500 on Tesla calls in late 2018(?) and bagged a million dollars. But time can become your enemy and destroy you if you're out of the money around expiration."

2021-05-19 21:10:43,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it is no more gambling than anything else in the market.  You can use them for leverage, but you don't have to.  


Unlike stock, if you just buy options, you can at least limit your downside without having a stop loss that can get triggered and then the stock rockets without you.  


Selling options is a bit more tricky.  


OTOH you can't YOLO stock.  Like if I buy $100k of TSLA - it tanks, down 30%.  I still have $70k.  Of course I could use margin, but I'll keep getting margin called as it goes down, limiting my losses.  


Instead I buy $100k of calls, it tanks, I lose $100k.  


Or even better, I sell $10k of naked TSLA puts, it tanks, I lose $100k"

Petco earnings is tomorrow pre-market. But this also might be a potential candidate for a short squeeze.

Short sellers are gearing up for a bad quarter. For the last three days, the short float increased from 4 point-something Monday, 6.05 yesterday, and today it's at 8.75.

In addition, short interest is up to 35.2%

To top it off, there are hardly any shares available to short, though borrowing rate remains at only 1%. For the last five days there were no more than 100k shares left to short.

The average price target is $28, but if earnings goes better than expected, this could be the catalyst for something significantly bigger. Listen to your pets' beckoning calls, and keep this on your watch list!

2021-05-19 20:03:55,wallstreetbets,"I used to work at Petco through college during the 2008 recession and one of the things the company boasted about was that it was recession proof because even through that whole long recession they kept doing better. People don't usually ditch their pets, and pet ownership actually went up with people being home. It was a good company when I worked there. I invested when they went public again back in January...not a lot, but I'm trying to pick stocks I think will go up and trying to learn by putting a little here are there and watching them. Figured this might be a long game play.

They have also made a lot of moves in the last handful of years to stay with the current times like same day delivery and curbside pickup, before the pandemic happened, from your local store. Stuff that other brick and mortar stores that died didn't embrace. Hoping that I made a good play.

So your prediction is I should pay attention to it in the next two weeks and sell if it makes a jump? Or if I'm willing to hold long term it might be good? I know chewy is bigger online but I still see room for woof."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NUE is strong as steel. Buy the dips. For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. 

Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio.  With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year.

**Nucor‚Äôs advantage**

Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world.

**Record breaking year**

Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company‚Äôs history, and next quarter will be even better.

Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. 

**$3 Billion share buyback**

After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding.

This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).

**The future is bright**

Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems.

It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020.

**Other considerations**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE‚Äôs growth. 

It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

**Conclusion**

NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It‚Äôs stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns."

2021-05-20 00:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Oh that sounds nice, we‚Äôll see from a TA standpoint it‚Äôs ripe for a correction. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong man"

2021-05-20 00:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Sure, for next year. Your puts are for next month. I disagree with next year's estimates because they're based on the assumption that currently high steel prices will drastically plummet going into next year, and I disagree. We'll have to see about that, of course, but I don't think NUE is hitting less than 90 any time soon."

Meet Kevin also said Tesla won‚Äôt go below 800 again on the earnings day in January. He even bought more Tesla on that day. Then Chamath said Tesla will treble when it was at 815. All 3 even I trusted but now the only person to trust is yourself as the mainstream financial media is BS

Taking current earnings, assuming a correct P/E ratio of 25, Tesla is worth $17.50 a share.

Taking future earnings, assuming a correct forward P/E ratio of 25, Tesla is worth $56 a share.

Auto companies currently have a P/E ratio of about 10 to 15, so those are very optimistic, bullish figures already.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-05-20 06:18:32,wallstreetbets,"Automotive gross margin is way higher than others and they're growing at incredible rates. 

If you model teslas earnings, there are many future potentials where today's stock price would be a bargain.  

But yes, if you ignore the underlying buisness and focus 100% on basic financials, it is absurdly overvalued"
2021-05-20 05:20:54,wallstreetbets,"The same reason gold trades at $1800/oz (or whatever).

Scarcity of a resource.  Whether it is engineering talent, patents on a product or capability to deliver a vehicle... its stock is considered valuable and bought up.  New shares aren‚Äôt issued often and the last split I was in was something like 1:5

So just like the price of a commodity doesn‚Äôt dictate value, neither can the core metrics.  We can look at HD, LOWE and even AAPL demonstrating value, but getting hammered after earnings due to weaker guidance.  

So people are betting on future opportunity along with a scarcity of stocks.  

I exited at $750 myself, and based upon current market factors, would peg it at less than $500 right now.  If the market gets cut by one-half, massive more printing of more USD, or more bad news from China, that valuation would decreased.

It‚Äôs all relative for me.  TM buying the software from LYFT and the inflation power of the Federal Reserve.  Not just the PE or inherent value of a company."

2021-05-20 06:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Saying ""iT's ThE nExT aPpLe"" is not a real justification for the insanely overinflated value the shares have today.

Bad comparison. Computers have a specific oligopolistic effect, that cars do not have.

Software developers write programs for a platform, they will usually pick the most popular platform, reinforcing the value of that platform over time. This makes it more difficult for new players to enter the space.

As an example, see how Apple was not able to get a good market share until the industry switched to using webapps, and the issue of platorm dominance switched to the browsers (With firefox now being almost unusable since developers only support chrome). Previously, it was almost impossible to get developers to support anything other than windows. Now we've got a Microshaft/Apple oligopoly, but trying to get any meaningful marketshare for a 3rd desktop OS is a failure before trying.

For these reasons, it's normal to expect super-normal profits for a successful hardware company.

We're not going to have cookie-clicker apps on our cars, we'll have entertainment systems, and GPS, etc, but there is already an established, mature industry around providing these subsystems for cars. We don't have the platform-dominance effect.

Your little slogans don't change the facts, Teslas are not as much of a leap forward as iPhones were compared to the older generation flip-phones. It's still just a vehicle that gets you from A to B.

Furthermore, people are increasingly questioning if EVs really are the future, there's increased interest in hydrogen vehicles, which provide a much more environmentally sustainable solution to transport."
2021-05-20 06:23:30,wallstreetbets,"> if you ignore the underlying buisness

It's a car company, they sell cars. Or did you drink the ""battery company"" kool-aid? Those ""basic financials"" are an objective way to value a business. I gave a range of target prices, including the forward-P/E based value of $56, that's not ignoring the underlying business, that's acknowledging the potential for growth in an extremely optimistic way.

Don't pretend that I'm trashing tesla without any basis, I've acknowledged the potential for Tesla to grow, and provided a value based on the assumption that it does grow significantly.

The stock is still overvalued."
2021-05-20 13:19:49,wallstreetbets,"automotive margins are crappy because of the price of most cars. They chose to get their profits on volume instead of margin. what does the average tesla sell for? around $54k? how sustainable do you think  their current margins would be?  can they keep growing at the same rate with the same margins YoY selling $50k cars?

then you look at the other facts:

1. tesla has almost gone unopposed for US EVs (unless you consider things like the leaf/mini-E/500 etc actual competition). Only true competition  was the e-tron.

2. tesla is still just getting the new EV and new Tesla buyers. if you could spend 40k+ on an EV, you had literally 1 option until this year.

3. gross margins are cute but unless they have the growth to cover operating costs, it would essentially mean nothing.

4. all the new players in the game. Mach E, R1t/R1s, lightning, e-trons, air, fisker?, ride?, hummer, EQS/EQC.

I'm not saying tesla isn't going to continue. But to act like the landscape of how they propelled themselves to this point is the same moving forward is missing a lot of context."

[citation *really* needed]

Every car company has a very large software department now. Tesla aren't the only company doing self-driving research, they've just hyped it up the most.

This is classic Musk, overpromise, under-deliver, and overpromise again before people realise. Self-driving cars are a pipe-dream, even Tesla themselves are backpedaling on it now. Advanced driver-assistance systems are on the horizon, and car companies have not dropped the ball on it. Tesla is not the only player in town.

Tesla makes some income from reselling products with Tesla branding. But they are still fundamentally, a car company.

**Bottom line: 94% of Tesla's revenue comes from car sales, the remaining 6% are add-ons for the main product... the car. Those add-ons actually cost them money. 100% of Tesla's profit comes from car sales. They are a car company**

Yes, I've been on Tesla's website. I was an early investor in Tesla, I bought in 2011, I've followed them for over a decade now. I've been following them long enough to remember a lot of broken promises, missed targets, and failures to live up to the hype. Attack me if you want, but I'm only stating facts."

> It's a total waste of resources

Water and electrical power? Hydrogen fuel is cheap as fuck to produce. You don't even need purified water.

> barely any advantage at all

Aside from the zero CO2 emissions, being cheap to produce, and being light and easy to transport? As I've stated, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have a particular problem with excess production at peak times. I've literally spoken with a wind turbine owner who can't sell the electricity due to a weak grid that can't take the load. As a result he has idle wind turbines. Hydrogen fuel production is his solution, it's cheap as hell to do, and electrolysis is an efficient process, unlike charging batteries.

This is not a hypothetical. Get off reddit, stop sucking Musks dick, get off ycombinator and all the other mainstream shit. Go talk to people in the real world who work in transportation, trucking, energy, whatever. Hydrogen production provides a solution to excess energy production, and that's not a small problem."

In 2000, I was taking an excel class in school where one of our projects was to pretend we had 10000 in the stock market. In two weeks, I made like 20% on these stupid internet stocks.

Dude, really, you're hearing about Tesla more than their competitors because Teslas are most popular among redditors and zoomers who like to share their lives online. The boomers who can actually afford fancy new AI powered cars don't waste time posting about it online. Tesla have two things going for them, marketing, and range. Turns out 200km is enough for most consumers, beyond that there's diminishing utility. Competitors could boost the range, but the cost outweighs the demand from most consumers.

As for marketing, that only takes you so far. Maybe when the zoomers pay off their college debt, Tesla will take over the auto market, but I don't see that happening myself."

I think we are mainly looking at production constraints from pent up demand and reduced production from last year. It's going to take time to level out. Whether or not there's inflation after is irrelavent. 

I watched this happen in my industry first hand. There was too much product when covid hit and then they shut down production because no one was buying. Then you couldn't buy it if you wanted to. Then it was expensive then it leveled out after a couple months. Different industries will take different amounts of time but the process will be the same.

Also, 8% or 17% is far from hyper inflation. Hyper inflation is thousands of percent and very very rare.   8-17% sounds like nice price appreciation for the year for real estate. It will be figured into inflation soon as there is some lag with home prices and rent prices."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Apple Inc Technical Analysis D.D I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. 




If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 



The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 



At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.



With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.




But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher



This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.



An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 



Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 



While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 



This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.



This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 



Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 




**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards


I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes



TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the **law of cause and effect**. The range may be coming to an end.

# W-Shape Thesis Note

* As stated as a possibility this morning it appears that we may be at the bottom and beginning to form the last line of our w-shape recovery. 
* **Need to close around 415 - 416 - 417**
* **If so, look to test ATH early next week IMO - pending any black swan event.** 
* **Gap fill 410.53 - 411.34**

2021-05-19 21:17:11,wallstreetbets,"I feel you. Lost 15k when a family crisis hit. When it ended, fell into revenge trading. Lost 28k revenge trading. Vacillating between depressed AF and eye of the tiger highs. But now that I‚Äôve been grounded by my own stupidity I am finally being disciplined enough to follow neither (right this second‚Äîmight have an existential crisis about trading tomorrow morning, and while my brain is busy doing that my hands might do something potentially dumb like yolo into short spy puts)."
2021-05-19 22:35:03,wallstreetbets,"Yea, this is where Im at I know that after this level of loss. I need to be very disciplined and properly risk manage but my brain is like just go all in on this one move, you have to recover your losses and thats what started this mess. I make big gains and give it right back, dont know how to stop this yo-yoing. I tell myself to manage size and i always fail."
2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market is in a hella messy state and only certain thing is high volatility Ever since the Feb peak, the sell pressure has been high and news pieces coming out one after another to give investors reason to sell. Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023.

Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. 

At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. 

The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today.  Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. 

The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? 

Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go."
2021-05-19 20:06:22,wallstreetbets,"I honestly have no idea. I wanna buy the dip on a few stocks that took a 30-40 percent hair cut but then I zoom out the charm and most are still up 50-150 percent. Just sucks as theirs no easy plays right now, even for long term holds"
2021-05-19 21:59:38,wallstreetbets,This is the case for day trading - money can be made regardless of which direction the market is going. I'll leave my longs in my Roth and day trade in my brokerage account to capitalize on the uncertainty.

2021-05-20 18:48:31,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs just not much money streaming into the market. All it can do is ping around from stock to stock chasing news and eventually it will move gradually in one direction or another. Interest rates are likely to play a part in which way it chooses to go. Choose good deals if you can find one and hold. Until October to Christmas I don‚Äôt see anything particularly squrrelly enough to move markets

isn't europe like on its fourth by now? and it's apparently over in america,""back to business."" (wanted to write that in caps). i agree with you though, i think there's some boogeyman pressure going on, it may also be from coming to terms with the massive rescue spending, etc."
2021-05-20 08:36:18,wallstreetbets,"Instead of plunge protection, I think the Fed is orchestrating sell pressure to depress prices and keep the music playing."

2021-05-19 22:59:04,wallstreetbets,There are still stocks that are pretty bottomed out right now. It's why I'm not horribly concerned about major market corrections as I'm so far down from ATH's that it provides some protection.
2021-05-19 20:40:13,wallstreetbets,"exactly, hard to decide if should jump in or not"
2021-05-20 00:22:43,wallstreetbets,yeah...seems some people are doing allright with options but i haven't the nerve. i had some solid spreads that all tanked towards expiry...thought about selling when they got finnicky from one day to another but held and failed.

2021-05-20 05:20:04,wallstreetbets,"For me, it's simply risk management. I have a long ways to go until retirement, so I'm less concerned with tax implications and more concerned with not blowing up my IRA. So I've opted for slow and steady growth through my Roth with long term holds."
2021-05-19 21:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Yea, all the FEAR - oh no.  MASSIVE selloff can't even get a 5% retracement in SPY."
2021-05-20 00:33:58,wallstreetbets,"I got into RIDE near the bottom after the EV bubble burst and the lawsuits beat it down. There are others that are near all time lows from the SPAC bubble burst. Risky but they exist.

I was in Cruise lines a while ago.

British airlines and defense are still near bottom. I'm in IAG and RR.

To name a few. Now this isn't a WSB play. Some of these are very diluted and I don't expect to make anything until fall and I won't roll out until maybe this time next year or even 2023. For now they just float with the markets but are highly sensitive to Covid news both ways.

For me it's an options play off some major catalysts combined with long term shares and 2023 Leaps. If this was any normal market I'd never be in these companies haha

Edit: I forgot... I may get into CD Project here at some point, just debating where the bottom is. Similar story. Artificially held down by bad PR.

Edit2: COIN is an interesting one. I avoided the IPO but I'm curious where it goes from here. Maybe wait for a crypto winter and then jump in. VIAC also gets mentioned here, it's still up off pre-covid but it's been so abused that I wouldn't call it exactly at any kind of high. Air Canada and some other airlines are down, but again beware of dilution levels. Very susceptible to news tho. Cinemark is the good fundamentals and limited debt little brother of AMC that's held down by latin and south America."

2021-05-20 01:22:09,wallstreetbets,"I am in Ride right now and loving the last 3 days.  Issue with them is no idea what fair value is because they don't have any real financials yet. If the market corrects hard I actually think it could still go down 40 to 50% from where it is now.

T&H isn't going to be real for a while.

I am torn between market wide correction and just watch individual companies being systematically ground to dust in rotation.  Amd is one that in my opinion shouldn't be in the $70s given their solid numbers warrant a higher value.  Baba also seems very low (there is foreign risk, but still).  Fsly got demolished recently, Viac, Disca etc."

2021-05-20 01:43:53,wallstreetbets,"For me Ride is mostly a preduction play. I think they will produce and sell, which trumps any possible market correction on a year timeline. 

Agreed on AMD but I'm weary. 

I'm actually considering BABA.

But ya, it's really hard to know where things will head. It's part of the reason I'm in things that depend on vaccines beating Covid. That's a factor outside market sentiment and I don't believe in betting against human ingenuity when we're faced with a crisis."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer... Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show."

2021-05-19 23:19:20,wallstreetbets,"I sell covered calls on stocks I expect to trade flat but wouldn't mind letting go at a nice profit. 

Only an idiot expects AMC to trade flat here. It's going to moon or it's going to collapse back down under $5 based on its fundamentals. 

I've fallen in to the sell covered calls on a losing asset trap and believe me it's a trap. Because you're stuck with those crap shares as the price drills. Almost every time I would have been better off just selling. Your mileage may vary."
2021-05-19 23:25:30,wallstreetbets,"B Riley disagrees and I‚Äôd hardly consider that firm an idiot. They have a solid track record of outperforming the market during recoveries. I don‚Äôt currently hold positions in AMC but I made a very nice profit on CCs as it has risen and fallen this year. Honestly wish I still had them but hindsight is 20/20

Totally agree on how selling CCs can be a trap. For anyone buying under $16 I think it is"
2021-05-20 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"No one can predict the future but I've crunched the numbers on AMC myself. They run out of liquidity sometime in 2022. Early 2022 if box office lags behind 2019 which I expect later in 2022 if it rebounds to 2019 levels by next month.

I also acknowledge the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. If all of retail holds and continues to bid up the price up, then we could see AMC get up to $20. But the catch is there will be no buyers at this price. HF won't be forced to cover as they were a lot smarter this go around. So while a couple people might be able to sell at an all time high price most will get stuck holding the bag."
2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve analyzed the latest quarterly reports of most public companies in the US and here are the ones with the fastest revenue growth over the 1st quarter of this year.

I was comparing the revenue for the 4th quarter of 2020 with the revenue for the 1st quarter of the current year. If you want to see a new top for all companies, regardless of whether their report is up-to-date or not - just hit me up in the comments.

PS The list also contained companies Codiak BioSciences and Dynavax Technologies, but the bot did not pass them through due to weak capitalization. Although in my opinion, they are the most promising among all mentioned above.

Perhaps this analysis is an obvious thing and many have published it, but maybe someone will find it valuable

Thoughts?"
2021-05-20 00:35:17,wallstreetbets,"I also tried to DD these a little bit and here is what I came up with.

LBRDA - Though their revenue did go up, its still quarterly revenue of 243MM on a company with a market cap of over 30 billion.  The reason the market cap is so high has almost nothing to do with the new revenue.  The main driver of this stock's price for the foreseeable future is due to the fact that they own 26% (as of the last 10Q) of the stock of a much larger company - Charter Communications.  This stock that they own was worth about 36 billion as of the last 10Q, so with a 36 billion dollar asset, its not hard to see why the market fives this company a 30 billion market cap.  I like the company though you can expect the stock price to simply mirror whatever Charter's stock does at least for now.  Anyhow, maybe a decent company but the revenue change is almost meaningless to the stock price (for now).

BeiGene - Their product revenue doubled last quarter from about 50 million to about 100 million.  In addition there was a 500 million payment, (booked as revenue because that's what it is) for a ""collaboration agreement"".  I didn't research exactly what the collaboration agreement was because I'm not that interested but its probably for another company to sell and market their drug in some other part of the world, or for another company to use their drug (pehaps with another drug) as part of product they will market. The good news is that the sales did double in 1 quarter and someone thought enough about the company to pay them 500 million to market or use their drug.  The bad news is that this is a one time event and without alot more info its impossible to put a real value on this company, but don't think its worth 6 times more money due to this - its a one time event.

NRG - From the most recent 10Q; ""On January 5, 2021 (the ""Acquisition Closing Date""), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it did not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.""  This is why the revenue went up so much. I find this one very interesting as the stock price has gone down since the acquisition (probably due to a nearly 1 billion dollar loss from the storm).  This company may do very well with this acquisition going forward but there is so much more to look at and understand than just the jump in revenue.

Anyhow, you may have 3 decent stocks here (more by luck than brilliant stock screening), but there is a lot more to finding good stocks than simply picking ones with huge jumps (usually temporary) in revenue."

2021-05-20 00:58:01,wallstreetbets,"Glaciers are fresh water, right? And countries are worried about running out of water, right? And ice floats, right?

How long before China just sticks a hook in one and drags it home from Antarctica? Hell, what if the US did that and tried to dump it in Lake Meade or the Grand Canyon or Lake Havasu. I guess we probably can't really pull it up the Colorado from the gulf of California because Mexico and it's basically a tiny creek of a river by then.

But, I keep reading about glaciers cracking off and falling into the ocean and they're not doing anyone any good just raising sea levels. Might as well try to refresh our auquafirs or top off our reservoirs with the free water.

Edit: Holy crap, this is a thing. From a water company in Hong Kong, to the old timers in Alaska, to this MIT proposal that is closer in spirit to mine.

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say."

Almost all analysis suggests that on a y/y basis inflation should be even worse than last month because the comparison will be to May of last year which had lower price index than April since it was further into peak lockdown period. After that market will react negatively to anything the fed says. Fed will either say it‚Äôs transitory and they‚Äôre still not worried and then market will freak out because nobody believes the transitory story. Or they acknowledge inflation concern and market will freak out that rates might be increased sooner than than expected. It‚Äôs just a lose-lose situation.

2021-05-20 01:05:44,wallstreetbets,"The whole GME drama and novice 6-7 millions users completely ruined the money making opportunity here. 

Most stocks have been moving in a way that results both calls and puts in red at market close, most days. 

Some shitty stocks fluctuate over 10% but contracts barely move 20%. MMs jacked up the IV and changed other Greeks to shittier than ever. 

6-7 millions degenerates gamble some $100s with a hope to make it 10K the next day on some random, overhyped, meme, fucked up FDs and MMs pocket billion on a weekly basis. 

Every few weeks either GME or AMC or MVIS or some other wsb stock goes up 20-30% on a random day and create new fresh bag holders. Then the whole market dumped by 5-7% over a week. 

Although I made some money from GME. I wish it never happened. Then we would have a new meme stock every now and then."

I'm monitoring Dow, PG, Chlorox Olin Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Westlake Chemical Corporation. I'm also looking at Copper.

I basically bought that domain to be sure nobody else could. I didn't really have the time or need to create a fancy website, so I just spent about 15 minutes to throw together a landing page. It was incredibly easy with the Squarespace template and, in my opinion at least, it looks great. Now I can give people one link that takes them to a page with the link to all my loss porn. You can really create a landing page like this, a blog for your dipshit trade ideas, an online store to sell your organs for PLUG shares, really anything with Sqaurespace and what's best is that you can get 10% off your first order by using the code ""Guh"" over at squarespace.com/GUH That also helps you help me make yolo spy calls!

The idea is that western societies have historically treated women like they're functionally retarded and that when you presume a woman doesn't understand something or needs help because of her sex you're continuing that tradition. 

I don't think it needs a special word and I think the people who accuse people of ""mansplaining"" tend to jump the gun and assume the worst out of others. IMO best policy is to embrace your inner misanthrope and avoid helping or explaining things to anybody."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Switch Inc. ($SWCH) Alright ladies and gentlemen.... mostly just gentlemen. Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele.

  
What is Switch? 

Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock.

Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company.

Pros:

* Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. **The Core Campus** (Southwestern United States), **The Citadel Campus** (Northwestern United States), **The Pyramid Campus** (Northeastern United States), **The Keep Campus**¬†(Southeastern United States). [source](https://www.switch.com/locations/)
* Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate.  
* Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. [source](https://www.switch.com/switch-vault/)
* Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. [source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/switch/what-switch-doing-right-ship#:~:text=On%20the%20TRA%20liability%3A%20Switch,liquid)
* Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too. Once Solar panels and geothermal pays for itself you reach a point of profitability on that investment, in turn reducing costs and increasing margins. [source](https://www.switch.com/about/#social-responsibility)
* Client base is huge. Come on... just look at this list. [source](https://www.switch.com/clients/) 
* Financials are pretty aight to me tbh.

Cons:

* As a play on data center real estate. We could see risks in the overall real-estate market that bleed to the stock. 
* Hacks that target Switch can possibly tamper with their reputation.
* Competition from another firm that provides services at a cheaper price or at superior quality. (obviously)
* Not paying dividends might turn off certain investors. Personally I think its more of a pro than a con.
* Rob Roy controlling a majority of the voting power of the company. (Caesar made Rome what it was with complete authority over military. So IMO who cares)
* Shares haven't really gone up. Down 13%.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I like the company and believe it has a lot of promise. With how low IV is options look like they are priced well. I wouldn't mind holding shares either. 

Here is some better and more thought out DD:

Position:

$SWCH 25c 1/20/23"
2021-05-20 11:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Upvoting because I love the effort here, but I have to be honest - SWCH is the by far the worst data center player in the entire space. They aren't a REIT because of control structure issues, not because they are trying to avoid paying dividends to retain growth capital. The are absurdly overpaying for Data Foundry (acquisition announced last week) and their investments are highly concentrated in one region

In order from most attractive to least attractive, here is how I rank the public data center players based on relative valuation, growth profile, leverage, quality of management, etc

1) CoreSite ($COR), 2) Equinix ($EQIX), 3) Digital Realty ($DLR), 4) QTS ($QTS), 5) CyrusOne ($CONE), and finally 6) Switch ($SWCH)"
2021-05-20 01:26:52,wallstreetbets,"Do they publish utilization percentages in any of their reports? 

I‚Äôve been inside one of the Las Vegas SUPERNAP facilities and the racks were shockingly empty. The place is huge and there are multiple SUPERNAPs located in close proximity, it‚Äôs possible I only saw an outlier. All the walls in the world don‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs nothing to protect however."
2021-05-20 13:01:27,wallstreetbets,"My company hosts in switch, we had 20 racks in 2 cages. But we, like everyone else I see in that space, are moving to cloud. Great company but not really casino material imo"

I prob would of gone with a further otm call strike since you already have shares.  Gamma alcelerates the closer you get to a strike and the percentage gain becomes more magnified.  Also I would have hedged not with puts since its only a 8 dollar stock.  Instead buy deep in the money 2 year leaps. Also I probably would have picked up some more shares since it also has dividends and the stock is cheap"

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inverse Cathie Wood Is there a fund where I can inverse Cathie Wood? I have followed Ms. Wood since she appeared on We Study Billionaires. From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances:

&#x200B;

She predicts CoinBit $500,000.

She is all-in on Tesla.

She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time.

She has decreased her position in Netflix.

&#x200B;

I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap.  She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years.

&#x200B;

Edit - I forgot that she is long COIN."

Then you can take their shares, sell them right fucking now, and then if you're right and ARK tanks, you can go and buy them back at a lower price, give them back to the dudes you lent from, who will then give you back all the money. If you do it right, I think you might be able to profit.

Not sure if this will work, just came up with it in the shower.

2021-05-19 21:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough! I'm still learning, but if you're strong about your convictions, price action, TA - however you're deciding on trades, higher delta moves closer to the underlying price. It's higher risk but higher reward."
2021-05-19 21:54:29,wallstreetbets,"And no judgement or criticism btw - just genuinely trying to learn. I'm trading with a much smaller account - started in March with 1k, grew it to 2 and took out my initial deposit and am back to 2.5k. But the past week I've had consistent success (5-10% account growth daily) by switching to higher delta options. Biggest problem is with my account size, I get priced out of some I'd like to play because high delta contacts cost 800-$1,000."
2021-05-19 21:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Generally, between .75 and 1"
2021-05-19 22:49:48,wallstreetbets,"I'll be the first to admit that 80% of this was luck + a high risk tolerance. And I never trade 0 DTE, so I could have blown up today just as easily.

I basically just looked at 1m candles with a VWAP overlay. When it went up, I bought puts, when it went down, I bought calls. If it moved against me, I doubled down. I clenched my butt cheeks, and as soon as I saw green, I sold. Most of my positions were open less than 30 min, and if it went beyond that, I shifted my focus more toward minimizing losses instead of making profit.

Granted, I left a lot on the table. I sold a 408c for $770 profit that could have been $20k profit a few hours later, but i didn't like being exposed for long. maybe I'll play with some house money next time and see if I can get a bigger return. Mostly just dumb luck though."
2021-05-19 21:26:41,wallstreetbets,"Yep, very good point"
2021-05-19 22:57:24,wallstreetbets,"Nah, Schwab in the US"
2021-05-20 00:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Higher delta options are actually lower reward and lower risk. The delta of an option is a rough estimate of the odds of an option expiring ITM. An ATM call will have a ~50 delta, and it has roughly a 50% chance of expiring ITM. A deep OTM call will have a 10-30 delta, and it has lower odds of expiring in the money. 


If you spend $500 on options, you will be able to achieve a higher total delta with cheaper options. Also, if you buy just one option and the underlying increases by $1, the higher delta call option will increase by a larger dollar amount, but the lower delta call option will increase by a larger percentage (usually). People on WSB trade deep OTM calls because they can easily multiply in value by orders of magnitude if the trade goes your way. For instance, with GME, someone on here bought a deep OTM call option for $6 (total contract price) and sold it for $2,000. Someone with a deep ITM call option might have paid $2,000 for it, and would have made maybe $20,000 (this number is made up, but you get the idea). The deep OTM calls went up 100x+, while the deep ITM call options may have only gone up 10x. If someone was crazy enough to take that $2000 and buy as many deep OTM GME calls as they could, they would have made ~$660,000 (using the made up numbers). On the other hand, if someone bought an $800 call on GME, they would have lost their entire investment, while someone with a deep ITM call would possibly have some intrinsic value left. GameStop is an extreme example, but the point stands. If you look at what DFV bought on GME, they were all long term, deep OTM call options. That is how he had 1000x returns at the peak of GME. 


If you are trading 0DTE or weekly options like OP, buying OTM options are much riskier, as the option is 100% extrinsic value. If the trade goes against you or stays flat, or even goes up slightly, you could lose your whole investment. If you buy a high delta option that is 0DTE, and the underlying stays flat, you will lose the extrinsic value of the option but you will retain the intrinsic value of the option, as it can be exercised for a profit."

2021-05-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC: Relative Rotation Greetings Gents,

I'm planning to continue doing weekly relative rotation analysis of the market, but wanted to create this mid week post to take a quick look at UWMC. Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate.

I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE).

My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date.

Lets jump into it and make it quick...

Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM:

[Looks like we have strong short term momentum when compared to the Russell 2000](https://preview.redd.it/4jlcf06t74071.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf27b245685d1ecf8e0d0d5937216f3d1ef719d)

Now for SPY:

[Starting to take off with solid momentum towards leading.](https://preview.redd.it/ii53n3ec84071.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1abdcb982358f1f5be5f7cd9482e5bfab12e3bb)

Finally, XLRE:

[No surprise. Similar to SPY](https://preview.redd.it/azj0le6i84071.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=84491c3d259a601a72339f9a7f53a7dc1078e3a1)

**My Thoughts:**

Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice).

I'm playing this 3 ways:

6/18 short put x 2 @ $7

7/16 long call x 5 @ $6

1100 shares @ $8.06

Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum.

**TL;DR: UWMC looks good. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**"

2021-05-19 20:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Someone doesn't understand bubbles, but here's the real case. Look at Tesla. It went up 22,500% since inception. Bubble right? Wrong. Look at the Dow, up 138,500% since inception. I've bought some $800 puts expiring next month. They're going cheap, I think I'm the first one to catch this."

2021-05-20 05:23:20,wallstreetbets,Bingo
2021-05-20 01:17:56,wallstreetbets,Log graph shows percent change. 100 to 110 is the same as 10000 to 11000.  The way you're showing this graph makes more recent 10% swings appear 100x greater than 10% swings 75 years ago. Wildly inaccurate/misleading.

2021-05-19 22:14:45,wallstreetbets,Name does not check out
2021-05-19 22:07:10,wallstreetbets,"Monday I got at 10am at work literally at the peak,
By noon I was up like 3.5k when I briefly looked at my phone, but I got a customer I‚Äôm in sales.  I was with that customer for a few hours and when I was running their card one of my coworkers said ‚Äúhey how did that trade go?‚Äù And I replied ‚Äúfuckkkkkkk I forgot all about it‚Äù and pulled my phone out to check.  I was up to 9.5k$ but it was literally 3:58pm est and I wasn‚Äôt going to just unload that close to closing, so I held expecting it to downtrend a bit more after hours. When it opened up the next morning my account flashed from 9,500 to 17,800$ and I watched it climb to 21k and sold when it started pulling back to 20k"
2021-05-20 09:02:25,wallstreetbets,Well that‚Äôs the part where I said I had an itch and got lucky lol
2021-05-20 08:55:33,wallstreetbets,This never works
2021-05-20 01:44:16,wallstreetbets,How did you do this

2021-05-19 23:07:51,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you again, I would have paper handed at Monday close if not earlier lol"
2021-05-20 02:53:43,wallstreetbets,"The lad not only held through on a dying position, he doubled down on it at the stock‚Äôs peak. True genius"
2021-05-19 21:35:19,wallstreetbets,"I answered it in another comment I felt it was over valued once it went over 30 because it was holding there for so long and when it finally broke it I felt it would pull back, so I purchased my ‚Äúlosing puts‚Äù on may 4th and when those went to literally 2 cents and AT&T went up another like 2$ I decided I wanted more puts and just got lucky with them deciding to half their dividend the same day and drive their stock to the ground"
2021-05-19 23:30:05,wallstreetbets,Lol sometimes getting distracted at work pays off big ü§£ and other times you lose everything
2021-05-19 22:40:35,wallstreetbets,How did you get this kind of return from 900 dollars? I've traded options before but at&t only moved like 4 dollars lol.
2021-05-19 22:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Well if you have traded options before then you should know that 4$ for AT&T is literally unheard of so when something like that happens this is the result if you get lucky and are in for it.  If this was a stock like Tesla 4$ would mean nothing, implied volatility went from like 25% to 75-85% which effects price of contracts as well as me buying pretty otm puts during a like 6% positive climb so the puts were basically worthless and then when it swung back the delta was giving me close to a dollar every dollar AT&T moved."
2021-05-19 22:47:59,wallstreetbets,So it was basically like getting to make 4$ on 4500 AT&T shares but they cost me .11 per share
2021-05-19 22:52:01,wallstreetbets,I understand. Thank you for the knowledge

2021-05-19 23:44:22,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what it needed to happen. Shitadel and all other HFs are shorting this for the XLNX merger arbitrage. The stock is down 17% YTD after their best quarters ever. Lisa Su just errected a big dildo up their ass. Love it.
2021-05-19 20:57:41,wallstreetbets,"They will have larger revenues than Nvdia when they merge. They are on an exponential share gain path in datacenter and their TAM combined with Xilinx is huge.

I think AMD's market cap will outgrow Nvidia by 2025.

This is a super company that's still under a radar.

2021-05-19 21:26:58,wallstreetbets,It will be back to $74 tomorrow.
2021-05-20 12:46:31,wallstreetbets,It's because of Taiwan. Ever heard of $TSM ? A pandemic there has hit AMD particularly hard because their CPUs also rely on advanced microprocessor technology which is solely owned and manufactured by TSMC as well as a all of the precious semiconductors required for their graphics cards. Nvidia took a hit too but not nearly as hard since they're only in the GPU market.
2021-05-20 13:25:02,wallstreetbets,"Nice I bought 80$ a little further out, August. Hope its working out for you!"

2021-05-19 21:46:03,wallstreetbets,"This is what happens when you're a semiconductor company that doesn't actually build any semiconductors. They pulled the tech company fancy move and outsourced all their shit to the cloud, well, TSMC in this case. Too bad everyone else did the same thing and TSMC has their own issues. Net result? AMD is stuck back in the queue. I have a 3 digit AMD CPU placed in late Jan that is supposed to ship in July. I don't want to buy Intel, but if there are more delays I'll have to. Why? Because I actually \_can\_ buy an Intel CPU right now. AMD is still just technical promise. It reminds me of Apple in the 90's with their production issues.

To be fair, this was working out nicely for them until it wasn't. But isn't that usually how things go? TBH though, it's gotta be pretty sad to be a fabless semiconductor company. That's like being a chef that doesn't cook, just makes recipes."

2021-05-19 20:51:33,wallstreetbets,AMD does a lot of R&D.. the split is probably like 50% AMD 40% TSMC and 10% ASML if I had to quantify it.

2021-05-20 17:40:39,wallstreetbets,Pandemic should not be an issue as fabs are very automated and cleanest places on the planet. The problem is TSMC is working at 100% capacity. Which is both good and bad. Good that they sell a lot. Bad that they can't adapt and expand easily to meet more demand. In the long term they should be a good play once US fabs are built and operational. Problems are drought (water is essential for fabs they were trucking it from mainland) and the political situation with China. Currently I'm just a avaraging down my losses so... I'm just a retard lol.
2021-05-20 16:54:57,wallstreetbets,Yup sold for a small profit then bought 6/11 76c

Refer to my original comment. The implication is that you‚Äôre better off just buying the stock (or XLNX) unless you‚Äôre able to time that 10% rare occasion where it moves bigly. I caught those big waves twice and made 300% on the first and 800% on the second, so I understand why people keep buying calls."

2021-05-20 01:45:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the guy's not wrong, and they could be talking about small plays they made when they first started trading. Who gives a fuck, half of investing advice is complete bullshit anyway"
2021-05-20 07:25:48,wallstreetbets,"My point is, the value is up 65% and it has to cool down eventually. Nothing just goes up without ever going down. Plus it's ""Sell in May and walk away"" season and we just had tax day. Some people sell shares to pay off their tax bill. Mask mandates are going away and everyone is anxious to get out and live a normal life. People are gonna sell so they can have cash for vacations."
2021-05-19 22:24:41,wallstreetbets,"I can't give them credit for Intel slipping and not being able to execute on 10nm process node... but holy hell did they make a misstep at the EXACT wrong time.  AMD has just kicked in the door and taken everything in the room.  And at this point, Intels extremely bureaucratic and top-heavy management is 100% holding them back.  Such a big ship is tough to right when every single move has 30 middle managers and 5 senior managers fighting over who (what department) should be allowed to lead the turnaround.  It took AMD, what, almost 20 years of cratering before they were desperate enough to actually listen to the engineers?  Will it take Intel that long to tell the managers to shut up and give the engineers the time and resources they need and business needs be damned?  Time will tell."

Oil company‚Äôs are making loads of money now. 

Have I missed something important in my DD? Why is it lagging so much? Anyone any thoughts on this?"
2021-05-20 00:31:54,wallstreetbets,"In order for oil to go up you've got to bring in money, which will typically come from sell-offs in tech.  They need to unwind that slowly to keep the market from collapsing.  Encouraging people to come to oil and commodities is admitting defeat before you've been able to get out of your positions.

If you look at the chart comparing oil price to oil stock prices there is a massive gap recently with the oil price being significantly higher than the stock prices.  The stock prices will start to come up and fill this gap.

Inventory levels are 1% below where they were in the last 5 years for crude, 5% for gasoline and 18% for natural gas in the us.  No big deal right, except, that we are running nowhere close to the number of rigs that we were in the past 5 years making it impossible to increase inventories When faced with increased demand.  We definitely could be seeing mother of all oil short squeezes.

Iran is already selling two and a half million barrels per day on the black market and some people estimate they could get up to 4 million barrels per day to sell if the sanctions between the US and Iran are lifted.  Saying you're going to make oil and actually doing it are two different things they can't just turn all these wells on and get up to that production level in two to three months like some are projecting they can.  It takes months to dig a well from scratch.  Reality check, Iran is already selling everything it has on the market right now and it's going to take them a min. Of 6 months to a year to increase to 4 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia also has a massive interest in keeping prices high, So will be on the opposing end this.

Oil has multiple catalysts each week that throw it up or down in each direction making it the ultimate target for shorts.  As such, retailers have also picked up on this momentum and no one really holds overnight it's a lot of just penny stock trading at the moment.

It's funny watching everyone stumble over the different reasons why oil is down in a particular day today they said it was due to unexpected inventory increases.  The inventory increase was quite a bit smaller than what was forecasted, which should have been good news for oil.  Alas, We can blame Iran except that they came out and said oh no wait that deal's not going to go through yet.... Well then it's got to be demand....

Unfortunately, oil is the only sector that's has come up this year, which means there's a lot of room to short it and it seems like they're just making up excuses to slow the transition from growth to value stocks.  We've got wars looming, decreased inventories, decreased production. It's only a matter of time before the stock prices catch up.  If citadel goes under I think you'll see massive increases."

2021-05-19 20:15:19,wallstreetbets,"not only that, no big consumption countries are actually fully back to pre coof levels, and likely wont be for the next few years.

50 Million of humans die every year at full activity; what coof did, and how badly it changed all this is skewed; all those measurements and metrics will take a loooooong time to figure out for the bean counters (go check the models they have no fing idea what to do and just left them on trend for the most part.)  And add on top of that most excess consumptions ground to a halt for 6-9 months worldwide, this will likely will lead to persistent (1-5 yr) and possibly long term changes (lifetime) in consumer behaviors no matter where you are in the world or what market you are/were in.

More than likely after they start trying to reel in the # totals it's going to show we will have a lot of surplus shit and it may take years to actually figure out what took the hardest hits vs what is soon to become major successes.

Not only that, we still do not yet know long term side effects of coof or lack thereof and it's impacts it will have upon the medical/long term assistance type jobs worldwide.

If it turns out there is some long term life struggle type hinderance upon the body, I would suspect consumption will slow down drastically for a very long time until we hit a new generation which won't have known anything of coof in their life.  (10-20+ yrs to see a bounce back if there's long term persistent health problems)"
2021-05-20 02:13:27,wallstreetbets,This. Oil is still the most hated sector in the market. We are still in the first inning of the oil bull market.

2021-05-19 22:50:52,wallstreetbets,Betting that covid is completely changing how we live for next 20 years. Counter argument: CDC and governor dictators dropping mask mandates and social distance based on no new science but too many other crises going on and economy needs to go back on a roll asap. I‚Äôve bet it‚Äôs the second.
2021-05-20 00:36:45,wallstreetbets,Inventory is supposed to be rising this time of year to prepare for summer.  This is the cyclical nature of oil.  Increase we saw today was quite a bit lower than what was forecasted.
2021-05-20 13:13:34,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't exactly pinning this all on coof, correct, it's about the complete abuse and violation of nearly every civil liberty upon those people living in America which changed consumer behavior over the last year, and to a lesser degree the remaining people of the world under the thumb of the inept authoritarian leaders.

If they ever decide to come out of the caves and fight back, that's when we will see true volatility, second to that we have yet to understand long term trend changes as a result of these factors which are still currently ongoing."

2021-05-20 11:24:11,wallstreetbets,"The saga ended, the damage was already done, they lost 70 bils.

It was shorted 140% and the price was under 40$, whatever it went up it affected all 140% of shorts.

Now its like any other stock out there, shorted like under 30%, part of it shorted at probably very high prices and part also probably at around 180$.

Idk what else you all are waiting for at this point, its definitely not a short squeeze because there is not going to be any by the technicals alone. Nobody is going to swoop in and buy 55 mil of GME shares to force a short squeeze, they probably can't even buy so much of a company without huge documentation that will be public and allow every remainind short to run.

On top of that the price before doubled, tripled, quadripled, 10x, when you wake up and stock you shorted went up 10x, this is something. Right now nothing like that is even remotely possible, best you can get is the stock price doubling, and that is if you are lucky. Whoever is shorting it is just not going to be that affected.

There was even a case when it was 70% shorted still, but now the stock is like any other stock on the market, except for the army of cult retards following it.

Yall also say you are ok with losing money, but when the tears finally come, we are both in for a show."

2021-05-19 20:17:45,wallstreetbets,"That stuff bothers me. There's no reason to jump someone for asking questions about a frickin stock of all possible things.

FTR, there are at least two theses for GME that aren't total trash.

1. They have significant real estate holdings left over from the days when the company often bought the land their stores stood on. This is the original Michael Burry thesis for GME back when it was trading below $5, IIRC.
2. The company is trying to compete in the space that Newegg occupies by selling components to PC gamers online. GME is doing everything in their power to push graphics cards right now, but the supply shortages have created a weird situation.

You can argue for the short squeeze as a third thesis, but that seems to have lost some steam.

My advice is simple: don't buy stocks you don't like. If you don't understand the company, try to buy as small and cheap as possible.

I had looked at GME in march of 2020 based on Burry's investments, but I passed on it. I opted to tail Burry on CLF at $3, and I haven't felt terrible about that play."

Everything still points to decline, consistent, inconsistent numbers. You gotta drink a good amount of believe juice to actually think there is still short squeeze going down. Then again advocates have no idea what it is and what is necessary to trigger it, that is why every 10 - 20% short is a candidate for short squeeze and endless stupid posts like that.

You would have to have shorts to squeeze in first place, and we did the first time around, squeezed the bastard so much it increased over 7000%, even the most ludicrous squeezes in history never hit that amount, the craziest price increases usually stop at 3000%.

saved plenty of it, but as you said, all that is some big information around, but its links with GME share price ever going up is dubious to say the least. GME saga can both be over and it can also have exposed the truth. Just because it exposed the truth doesn't mean there is any squeeze left in the damn thing.

Using market orders on Robinhood is literally giving 3% straight to Citadel, as you said. But they cannot give you a worse fill on a limit.

2021-05-20 00:32:58,wallstreetbets,">It might take its sweet ass time getting filled

that's exactly it. You want to buy a put for $3.50 and it will never fill at that price until price fluctuates down to $3.45. Then citadel buys it for $3.45 and then sells it to you for $3.50. Limit order doesn't mean anything when they can wait on filling your orders."

2021-05-19 21:44:08,wallstreetbets,Why are you guys so proud of these idiotic gambles?
2021-05-19 21:46:13,wallstreetbets,"Huge Put option play on AMC over the next week.  Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) and then followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24.  

We‚Äôve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17.  Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22.......

Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28.  If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options.

Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt materialize that could be a 10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options."

2021-05-19 22:03:48,wallstreetbets,What is the margin requirement to sell a naked AMC call if I may ask?
2021-05-19 22:18:44,wallstreetbets,"Bruh $3,369 in premiums is not even close from the total loss if this blows up in your face :/"
2021-05-19 22:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Updates for the apes interested:

I am using Tiger brokers (NYSE:TIGR).

The margin requirement for selling calls is dependent on the share price itself, so it moves. I am not sure about the exact requirements but it is somewhere along the lines of (share price\*100\*(IV / 2).

For example, AMC is at $10 with 200% IV, margin requirement per call would be 10\*100\*(200%) = $2000

During the post of thurs and pre of friday (I think?) where it went up 11% to $15, [I would have been margin called.](https://imgur.com/a/Nime90c) But luckily the broker couldn't call me on my options then :) and the market opened lower subsequently bringing me back to the margin.

These calls were not sold all at once, but I started selling them when $AMC was $10 (smooth brain moment) and kept averaging up until I ran out of margins.

The reason I can sell so many contracts is because I hold shares too, the 5k I mentioned were cash. These can all act as collateral. So if my holdings drop, or $AMC moons, margin call."

2021-05-20 09:09:36,wallstreetbets,You can sell naked options the easy way to control your risk so regardless you keep the contract premium is to a stop limit buy at the call strike. You only required to sell the shares at that price. Then you set a stop limit sell in the event it goes under the strike price. Regardless you keep the premium for the options with 0 risk as long as you are sure to set the orders properly.

Short term I could see a 20% swing in either direction before Friday expiration and not be shocked, especially with how much it has swung lately. OP is the definition of a yolo and realistically at least with selling calls he wins if: stock goes down or stock stays even or just up a bit. It isn't a horrible play and those calls are well out of the money but well we'll see if he gets called.   


I have AMC covered calls (bought calls early, sold some higher ones when price spiked) and covered puts expiring Friday. Only way I lose money is if it crashes down to sub-9.5 levels I think but ending up around \~13.5 would be ideal."

2021-05-20 05:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, it‚Äôs a simple matter on how the market works. Not to be rude, but how long have you been trading? Stocks go in cyclical patterns, up and down, up and down, depending on many factors (mostly fundamental), but also the overall market, interest rates, inflation, technicals, etc.

Right now if you do a free cash flow analysis of AMC, debt, growth, income, etc, you‚Äôll see that the stock has a fundamental value of around 5-7 dollars aprox (it has always traded in that range even when it was actually going well pre-pandemic, now the situation is much worse).

The retail craze has made ‚Äòmeme‚Äù stocks such as GME and AMC completely diesregard any fundamental or technical analysis. It‚Äôs just a simple ‚Äúmass psychology‚Äù experiment, if people think it could go up a lot, they will buy in, and as long as this keeps going on, it goes up. But it‚Äôs also a classic case of the ‚Äúprisoner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù, when if a single piece ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù, everything goes down, because the ‚Äútrue‚Äù value of AMC is much lower. For example, many pieces ‚Äúbroke‚Äù yesterday and that‚Äôs why it came crashing down - everybody wants to make their profit and don‚Äôt wanna end up holding bags, since trading is definitely not a team game. When somebody wins, BY DEFINITION, somebody must lose. 

And it‚Äôs not bad to take profit, many people who had bought at 9 dollars sold yesterday at 15 to make more that a 50% profit, this is an insane ROI. But any quite of speculative bubble (and AMC is one, nobody is even doubting that) eventually goes back to reality as people don‚Äôt wanna get caught in the crash and want to actually make a profit.

So that‚Äôs the simple truth - when a stock is overvalued, it eventually corrects back to its true price. This happens in every single stock in the market eventually, be it good companies such as APPL, AMZN or GOOG (a good company is one that has a great discounted cash flow model, healthy growth, and a unique advantage over competitors), or ‚Äúshitty‚Äù ones (aka high debt, poor prospects, not much growth, no unique moats against competitors, etc) such as GME or AMC."

2021-05-19 20:25:39,wallstreetbets,"The debt for me is a huge factor, added to that the dilution of shares, understand there is strong retail resistance but for how long. AMC as a company I think will do stronger revenue and maybe a bit of profit but nothing that's going to materially pay down the debt. Cinemas as a whole including Cineworld in the UK have really taken the piss in terms of bonuses and debt leverage. I hope they do better but I don't see them worth more than 8 dollars a pop"
2021-05-19 21:30:32,wallstreetbets,"Bro uh there debt isnt an issue also there isnt no share dilution. I dont kno where u have been but amc addressed all issues that kept investors away thats why now the stock on current fundamentals is undervalued. Now this fight we are currently in is a fight against the short sellers and the inevitable squeeze, we own the float and numbers tells us theres alot of synthetic shares that has been shorted in circulation. Do some research brody amc is fine and we are in a war."
2021-05-20 03:44:09,wallstreetbets,Debt over 1.5b is not an issue for a company that had struggled to make profit pre pandemic the synthetic shares issue is a whole different issue
2021-05-19 22:22:50,wallstreetbets,"My perception of GE is that GE is an MBA circle jerk. Just a bunch of jackass mbas jacking off other jackass mbas jacking off other jackass mbas all the way down. It's like an MBA human pyramid of jackasses jacking off eachother. You hold yourself up by the two dicks in your hand and in turn your dick helps hold up another jackass mba.  Maybe it's a tower more than a pyramid, but you get the picture. Just jackass mbas doing reports for report sake all the time, six sigma, stack ranking, a million layers of middle management.

I have the feeling that they could get lucky and have an engineer invent, I don't know, a way to turn plastic into gold and they'd middle-manage it to death. Take anything I hate about corporate culture and look it up and I'll eventually read that it ""came from the GE school of management"".  Six sigma, not in manufacturing like Toyota, but as a cult practice with rewards for timing how long people take in the bathroom or saving water by putting timers on the drinking fountain. Bullshit for bullshit sake. Forced stack ranking where you have to punish the lowest performer on a winning team. Imagine the NBA firing the 10th best player of the NBA championship team every year. Forcing managers to rotate to learn different areas to develop this general arsenal of experience. That might work in a limited capacity, like a machine shop, but it's probably okay to have experts be experts. You don't need Tom Brady to be a line backer for a season.

Not to mention cooking the books, faking their business, putting short term profits ahead of not only safety but actual engineering and long term growth, hell long term income.

GE fucking sucks and like a cancer their fucking former loser executives spread out and infect other good companies with their cult of GE management bullshit.

GE will have to do a lot to get me to believe they're not going to continue to suck the life out of everything they touch. 

It might be a good investment despite their massive debt, lack of direction, and horrible toxic culture, because maybe they'll tap into the good ol' boys network and do what they did before, fake it really well and take corporate welfare in the form of government contracts.

And maybe, like you said, one ceo will be enough to actually change that place. 

But I won't be expecting much and personally, I think we'll all be better off if they fail and the business world writes a post-mortem on a lot of their ""best practices"".

Here's a nice article from a couple years ago. Maybe it's better, but this is partly why people hate it like the plague. If you've ever had a GE guy come ruin your company and your life, you'll hate it too.

2021-05-19 20:25:30,wallstreetbets,"GE is a rough buy.  I only had about 100 shares, I thought that they would eventually climb back to their at least half their previous high of $80.   COVID hit, their bottom dropped out, so I bought blind.  After doing very little DD I found so much just backwards.  They brokered a deal with a European energy company and inherited some massive debt obligations to their retirees, then they were suffering because companies that were leasing their jets, which they were financing, backed out of their leases.  Then they started talking about the reverse split (8 to 1) and people went wild in a sell off and finally they sold off the aviation division (in part) to the Irish.    That was the a rough one as after the virus issues clear up that would have been profitable.  When I finally saw that their dividend was .01 per share I threw my paper hands up and said fuck it.  I‚Äôm a paper handed bitch and I really need to lose my money elsewhere, which I did."
2021-05-20 01:13:15,wallstreetbets,GE a good stock for trading. I never lost when trading GE. But didn‚Äôt gain much because it is stable not too volatile.

2021-05-20 11:02:34,wallstreetbets,"I've told this story before but I will tell it again.  GE Capital makes terrible decisions and I have no idea why.

We were working on an $8M capital improvement project.  The largest costs on the program were 4 air compressors (2 COTS and 2 custom jobs).  The cost of the custom jobs was $2M.  These things took like 8 months to make by the supplier and a huge cost liability for them if GE (with their crazy net 180 purchasing terms) decided to not pay or take delivery.  So Atlas Copco (supplier) said we need you to make progress payments on these compressors to the tune of 10% per quarter until delivery or we will charge you 10% on top of the final value.  GE scoffed at the progress payments but decided the 10% upcharge was no big deal.  So GE paid AC $200,000 just so they didn't have to make progress payments.

Also, with GE's net 180 payment terms, a lot of suppliers won't even sell to them (see Unholtz-Dickie).   They have to pay this middle man (Ferguson) money to make purchases for them.

Until they can fix these issues with GE capital they won't become the force they once were."

    I'm currently building a Miltary Aerospace/ Imaging Technology List:
    SPCE, TDY (recently acquired FLIR), UFO, MRCY, BA, RTX, LMT
    And now heres where my tinfoil hat got me thinking: - UFO/UAPs entering and exiting ocean - remembering conspiracies about antarctica, ancient aliens, and ATLANTIS - WHAT TICKERS ARE FOR NAVAL TECH AND OCEAN EXPLORATION!?
    I think that along with military aerospace industry, they're gonna be looking in the ocean for where these things are going TO/FROM

2021-05-19 22:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Good point.  I remember doing so research a while back when Snopes first came out to be the authority of the internet.  I found that the company it was ran by was somehow related or owned by a company owned by Amazon.  I found this to be interesting since Bezos served on the Defense Innovation Board. What betters Innovation than a modern disinformation campaign. 

Maybe it's coincidence, the six degrees of separation, or nothing at all.

Just thought it was worth bringing up."

2021-05-19 20:31:30,wallstreetbets,And AMD was sub $2 five years ago with no hopes of recovery. These moves take time and Nokia is primed to benefit greatly from the next wave of telecom infrastructure improvements. Question as always is about execution but so far Pekka seems to be doing well.
2021-05-20 16:49:08,wallstreetbets,"Past performance bears no weight on future performance 

What matters is where the stock is, what are market conditions, who's in leadership, bottom line,cash flow,Contracts,etc,etc,etc you know the meat.  You can skip all the fat around a company and look at it for what it is, Nok is a big player in a small but very important field.   


What they do has real world benefits to all shorts of things, with the other players in the market not having their stuff together and missing out on these contracts, it give NOK a golden window, just like when Intel gave AMD a golden window....Look back at what Intel was doing when AMD started to make its comeback, they got complacent, started making bad choices., thought ""who cares, its AMD and they suck"" well look at those tables now, they turned."
2021-05-19 20:38:42,wallstreetbets,I heard the same thing about 3G and 4G for NOK. *yawn*

2021-05-19 20:37:39,wallstreetbets,"No but what are they doing that makes them either above their competition or some thing thats so innovative they are a market leader? Oh yeah, nothing.

They‚Äôre competitive with Ericsson who is also set up well. Chinese providers are blacklisted due to security concerns. The market for 5G equipment and services is set to grow exponentially. It‚Äôs not a GME or AMC but it‚Äôs a real strong multi bag prospect"
2021-05-20 03:29:26,wallstreetbets,They share **a lot** of their patents with Ericsson so seems smarter to buy Ericsson at that point.

2021-05-20 17:05:33,wallstreetbets,"\>Gold is for the most part useless

No, it's used as the main contact point for computer parts, the entire socket interface of a CPU is either made of pure gold or electrum alloy that uses gold to prevent corrosion. The demand for gold will go up as the world becomes more reliant on computers. The counter argument against this of course is that it needs very little gold to ensure reliability so the demand is still low and cheap labor in india and china ensures that it is cheap to recycle computer parts for their gold/silver/copper making it a competitive source of reclamation vs mining new gold outright.

We can also argue that when the monetary system does collapse, gold will maintain it's value through the next system since demand will still be there assuming that our society further ""cyberizes"" in the new technological age (because gold/silver/copper is needed in technology). You can argue that silver can be used as a replacement for gold in many interface components since it does perform much better however silver does corrode where as gold does not and remains stable as long as it does not get exposed to amalgam agents like Gallium or Mercury so in solutions that require stable performance, gold cannot be replaced."

But it‚Äôs not the same thinking with commodities. Although using that could help with the time series analysis"
2021-05-19 21:23:05,wallstreetbets,The problem with weather is that it involves diffusion equations with PDEs which are hard to extract long term. But really earthquake research is probably applications of convergent series. Probably easier to look at convergent series and then use that for integral convergence to use a form of calculus. You can always take the time series approach and use signal processing. Anything from wavelet analysis to C* would work. My app linked in the original post has wavelet theory applied to this.

So if your $1M apartment used to require a 5% cap rate ($50K/year in rent), and it‚Äôs now worth $1.2M but the cap rate falls to 4% because of lower interest rates, then rent can be $48K/year and you‚Äôll still end up doing well as an owner relative to what you‚Äôd get in the bond markets."

2021-05-20 13:28:33,wallstreetbets,"This is kind of skewed becuase you didn't correct for energy and food prices. These are so volatilile that it doesn't really represent core inflation which is what economists working for the fed are looking for.

What core inflation is looking at is if prices of goods and services are going up without the effects of energy prices which go up and down so regularly its not accurate to include them.

So basically what could cause core inflation to go up?

Well you said it in your analysis...wages. wages are the core source of inflation in an economic model. If wages go up then everything becomes more expensive. This is taking everything else equal of course. Wages CAN go up without causing inflation if it is paired with increased productivity. 

Think of it like this: how much does it cost to make something? Well you need raw resources, energy, and then manpower or technology. If manpower costs go up they aren't ever going down which means inflation. Of energy prices go up, well they can go back down in a month...its temporary. Raw materials are the same...during supply shocks like we ha e right now prices go up. But then produce trying to capitalize on higher prices increase supply and prices go back down. Simple market dynamics. 

So tldr: inflation is caused by higher real wages without increases productivity."

2021-05-20 17:56:25,wallstreetbets,"So I don‚Äôt agree at all, and I‚Äôll tell you why:
First off, food and energy prices are in there, and with the exception of gas, lag very far behind the index as a whole. Gas on the other hand jumped way up this year, but otherwise hasn‚Äôt been particularly inflating over the last ten. Utilities in particular had something like 15% inflation over the last 10 years, and that accounts for half of most people‚Äôs energy expenses.

On the part about wages: I believe this chart shows an increasing drive towards assets, which implies that the greatest source of inflation in the last ten years comes from asset prices, not the weak wage growth and subsequent spending shown in the last chart. Moreover, if you look at a chart of productivity vs wage growth in the last 50 years, you‚Äôll notice that estimated productivity continues to rise radically, while wages begin to flatline in the ‚Äò70s. If what you‚Äôre saying is true, then we could expect to have extreme deflation over that period- fewer wage dollars are now chasing relatively more goods. But capital and rentier income has grown massively at the same time, offsetting that effect. 

The main place I‚Äôd argue you can see that effect in action is the difference between inflation in essential consumer goods, and in luxury goods and assets. Consumer goods have a really hard time inflating, while assets are free to explode. That‚Äôs because wages haven‚Äôt grown, so poor people have the same amount of money to spend as in the 70‚Äôs"

2021-05-20 11:47:37,wallstreetbets,"A majority of what they are buying right now is new crop corn. IMO it's to get some on the books before the possibility of a suboptimal US crop as the growing season begins. It is already known that a near-perfect crop will be needed to replenish US inventories this year. Big crop = lower prices and China backs out of the sales they have recently made. Bad crop = higher prices and they keep their commitments. 

We're seeing this take place right now. Argentina is undercutting the fuck out of US exports which is where a majority of the world's corn is coming from and China is backing out of a bunch of prior commitments. With Argentina exports coming to a halt (as of yesterday) due to a worker strike, nearby July corn could see some life yet. 

If you're going to play corn you better make damn sure that you're not in a position on 6/30 because it's going to shit the bed on higher than initially forecasted acres planted this year. It has been a remarkably dry spring and prices are the highest they've been since 2013. 

The market is going to be paying attention to domestic weather closer than ever this year and if the US does go into a drought and cannot produce a crop the size of last year or better, corn/soy/wheat will hit all-time highs.

TBH with all the gambling that takes place here, people would be better suited to trade options on futures rather than the CORN ETF."

> Moses saw in vision that the Savior had created many worlds like this earth that were also inhabited (see Moses 1:27‚Äì29). The inhabitants of these worlds are sons and daughters of God and are precious in His sight. The Savior is responsible for these creations and visits them in their times and seasons. Elder Orson Pratt explained: ‚ÄúThe Lord wanted to represent these kingdoms so that we could understand what he desired to impart, and he gave it as a parable, in order to assist our weak comprehensions. ‚Ä¶ Says the interrogator‚Äî‚ÄòI do not comprehend this idea of the Lord‚Äôs withdrawing from one and going to another.‚Äô In order to comprehend this let us come back to our own globe. Do we not expect that the Lord will, by and by, come and visit us and stay a little while, about a thousand years. Yes, and then we shall be made glad with the joy of the countenance of our Lord. He will be among us, and will be our King, and he will reign as a King of kings and Lord of lords. He will have a throne in Zion, and another in the Temple at Jerusalem, and he will have with him the twelve disciples who were with him during his ministry at Jerusalem; and they will eat and drink with him at his table; and all the people of this globe who are counted worthy to be called Zion, the pure in heart, will be made glad by the countenance of their Lord for a thousand years, during which the earth will rest. Then what? He withdraws. What for? To fulfill other purposes; for he has other worlds or creations and other sons and daughters, perhaps just as good as those dwelling on this planet, and they, as well as we, will be visited, and they will be made glad with the countenance of their Lord. Thus he will go, in the time and in the season thereof, from kingdom to kingdom or from world to world, causing the pure in heart, the Zion that is taken from these creations, to rejoice in his presence."

2021-05-19 22:09:57,wallstreetbets,Many thanks!  Any updates based on 5/19 moves?
2021-05-20 09:28:52,wallstreetbets,"Never able to clear 14.53 unfortunately - momentum got crushed.

13.24, 12.77 are resistance we need to clear to make that a possibility again. 

Otherwise, support is back at 11.58 - 11.41 - these really have to hold. Below there, it's likely we trade sideways/down for a while again."

My main point with this is that in the absence of movement on global policy, I don't see TLRY significantly outperforming the market in the short term.

2021-05-19 21:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I'am looking to buy between 100 and 200 share, do you think is a good move?"
2021-05-20 07:42:59,wallstreetbets,"I have 29, but I plan on buying $1000 dollars more"
2021-05-20 08:38:05,wallstreetbets,Sell now and take the profit.
2021-05-20 08:42:12,wallstreetbets,Why take tiny profits now when the stock is poised for growth?
2021-05-20 05:45:11,wallstreetbets,Thats kinda funny I admit

2021-05-19 23:50:13,wallstreetbets,Uh if their GDP had decreased for five years straight that would‚Äôve plunged the state into its worst recession in a hundred years. From 2013-2019 the state‚Äôs GDP growth rate was positive and fluctuated between 3-5.2% making it one of the faster growing economies in the country. It grew by like $600 billion from 2014-2019.
2021-05-20 10:10:19,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs going on with this stock - it seems stuck between 34 and 36

I‚Äôve got shares and July 30 C, bought in around 30 ish and have added more shares up to 34.

I feel it should be at 40 just based on fundamentals. Hopefully the next earnings blows it out of the park."
2021-05-20 10:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Give a little, then gain a little more, give a little then gain some more. Name of the game. I'm trying to abide my time in patience..."
2021-05-19 20:46:15,wallstreetbets,"I had thought similarly about the market being too scared of a rise in interest rates and I bet the market might go up once JP says ""we told you inflation would go up and we told you we would still keep rates down for a while"" in his next address. However, the only thing that gives me pause is that the market usually trades 12-18 months in advance, not 6 months. It might not be unreasonable to assume that next year they might change their policy after inflation has been up for a while and unemployment is down. What do you think?"
2021-05-19 22:24:07,wallstreetbets,Yes they win
2021-05-20 12:07:44,wallstreetbets,"We saw an overreaction to the news of the hack. Then, after the earnings release, it actually bounced and closed positive, but short sellers took advantage of the downward spiral in the broader market to short all remaining shares to be borrowed and scare the remaining weak hands. It's now trying to recover, but the action is a little shaky as this remains a rather illiquid stock (due to the fact it's mostly institutionally owned). But make no mistake, this has formed a solid base around $8 and once it gets a bid and increased volume as another institution steps in or insider purchases a few more shares, it will have a massive short covering. Last year, such an instance occurred and pushed the stock up intraday as high as 75%.Fundamentally, it is oversold and underpriced and I would be very nervous if I were a short. Some large shorts aren't able to cover because of the lack of liquidity as if they were to cover 100 or 200K shares, it would fly 10% higher in a matter of minutes, so they churn it. Good luck and welcome to the SDC trade if you wish to bet on a 50-80% upside potential within 6 months. Cheers"
2021-05-20 13:30:20,wallstreetbets,"There was a great overreaction to the cyber attack. Ofcourse they were being conservative with how much they potentially lost. If and or when the insurance covers any damages, shorts are screwed. It‚Äôs almost 30-40% short float interest."

2021-05-19 22:07:09,wallstreetbets,I think The Galactic Federation is demanding we wear masks forever to protect the aliens from our bad breath and germy bodies
2021-05-20 01:16:20,wallstreetbets,"This is a fun read, but at this point I think most people have accepted aliens exist. I don‚Äôt think it would cause the type of panic you think it would cause. 

However defense companies are generally a safe bet considering how big the USA defense budget is and because there‚Äôs always a war on. If anything what is happening in Israel should have us looking into defense companies."
2021-05-20 09:30:37,wallstreetbets,Right. So some apartheid engaging Israeli can expose the ‚ÄúGalatic Federation‚Äù but Trump can‚Äôt? Biden can‚Äôt? üôÑ
2021-05-20 10:21:02,wallstreetbets,Care if I share with some  friends ? This post  will get a lot more attention.
2021-05-20 12:32:19,wallstreetbets,Wow I just stumbled upon this. I've been heavy into LMT calls for the last week in anticipation of some big moves up in defense stocks. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who's figured this out :) I assumed the move would have been bigger after the 60 minutes segment but I'm still holding - I think June will be a big month.
2021-05-20 14:57:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm currently building a Miltary Aerospace/ Imaging Technology List:

SPCE, TDY (recently acquired FLIR), UFO, MRCY, BA, RTX, LMT

And now heres where my tinfoil hat got me thinking:
- UFO/UAPs entering and exiting ocean
- remembering conspiracies about antarctica, ancient aliens, and ATLANTIS
- WHAT TICKERS ARE FOR NAVAL TECH AND OCEAN EXPLORATION!?

I think that along with military aerospace industry, they're gonna be looking in the ocean for where these things are going *TO/FROM*

Anyone got vision on related tickers?"
