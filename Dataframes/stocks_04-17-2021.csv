2021-04-17 19:46:04,stocks,"You should sell when you're happy with your profits. Personally if I get a stock I don't plan on holding long term. Then I aim for around 10% gains. But sometimes I'll hold for more than that. 

In conclusion, sell when you're happy with your gains."

2021-04-17 19:08:13,stocks,HYLN. Total carnage. Dead bodies everywhere. Tons of bagholders at high levels. You can make massive returns
2021-04-17 18:55:53,stocks,I think it’s because of CCP overhang and the implications of ADRs of those firms.
2021-04-17 18:23:16,stocks,"The best strategy for building long term wealth is to buy broadly diversified total market index funds and buy them regularly rain or shine. It’s not sexy or exciting, but empirically someone’s ability to pick winners consistently over years and decades is nonexistent. Being properly diversified and continuing to save as much as you can as frequently as you can is the time tested way to make consistent progress towards real wealth. 

You can look up statistics on what’s called persistence, or a fund’s ability to continue outperforming over a multi year period. It’s abysmal and these people are professionals."
2021-04-17 18:29:43,stocks,"I was new like you. Last year was great for me as well. In the beginning I was serious and very conservative about my investment. As soon as i started buying penny stocks and holding them  for  big profits then he started down fall on top of that I used margin accounts to buy stocks in a bearish market. Now, I’m clueless and don’t know what do. Probably, sale all my stocks and pay off the loss. I have almost 20k worth of shity stocks which lost more then 50% value."
2021-04-17 18:21:04,stocks,"Know and set stop loss upon trade entry. Keep the diamond hands gme meme out if you are looking to consistently make money. Document your trades, your results, lessons learned, and review to get better. 

It’s hard work if you are not meme lucky."
2021-04-17 18:44:11,stocks,"Makes a lot sense, I guess it should be a no brainer that hard work is better than get rich quick schemes but hearing it helps"
2021-04-17 18:33:35,stocks,I’d recommend transitioning to index funds like I mention in a comment on this thread. It’s always good to have a core baseline and once you build up knowledge and confidence again you can buy small positions and see how they do. But index funds are really key for long term success. You can be clueless but if you keep buying VTI you can do better than someone who knows a lot. Luck not skill drives a lot of people’s returns. Research shows most people are not skilled.
2021-04-17 18:41:00,stocks,"This makes sense, thank you! I’m done with any “sexy” advice for sure. My meme luck has absolutely run it’s course and I’m ready to stop bleeding money, or at least understand why I am instead of just blaming the “down market”"
2021-04-17 18:45:28,stocks,Do you typically have a rule of thumb for setting up stop losses or does it vary a lot depending on the stock?
2021-04-17 18:50:01,stocks,"It’s not even hard work. My significant other doesn’t know anything about investing but she keeps buying VTI every month and she’s done very well since last year. And she will likely continue to do it well as long as she sticks to that strategy. Hard work and effort don’t necessarily yield better results because the market isn’t rational. Outcomes don’t have to be tied to effort or insight. If you bought a stock on a hunch and it went up, it doesn’t indicate anything about your hunch being right or wrong. The negative is also true of that. 

People need to invest based on the empirical evidence and mathematical analysis and not on what they “feel” or have conviction on. Spending 20 hours looking at financials isn’t going to yield better results than my significant other spending 0 hours. She just spends 2 minutes in her brokerage account per month buying vti and she will outperform most people on this subreddit day trading or swing trading with literally zero effort."
2021-04-17 18:38:11,stocks,"Because of the state of the market recently I have seen this advice come up a lot. Other than VTI are there any others, in your opinion, that are good to get into right now?"
2021-04-17 19:12:25,stocks,"Depends on the volatility and your risk tolerance. Mine ranges between 1-3% stop loss dependent on volatility and what I am seeing for trends.

I’ve chatted with a few others that are much better candlestick readers than me who get out immediately if the stock does not go the direction they want.

Read trading in the zone by mark douglas. You can get the free pdf by googling it. I think there may be some videos as well...but I’m old, so I got the hardcover from Amazon.

Very good perspective on trading psychology."
2021-04-17 18:57:03,stocks,"Hmm interesting point there, thank you"
2021-04-17 18:40:51,stocks,I’d give the same advice regardless of market condition. VTI is a solid foundational index fund. Others that I like kind of try and capture other risk premiums like small cap value funds AVUV/AVDV. But those are for “tilting” towards capturing more of a specific subset of stocks based on size or profitability criteria.
2021-04-17 19:01:24,stocks,"I spend a decent amount of time every day basically giving people the same advice. It’s not because I’m on a high horse and preaching to peasants; it’s because I went through a similar journey and did a lot of research and realized I was spending so much time trying to beat the market. Instead, I could save all that time, not worry about buy and sell points, and just accept the market return year after year. I can control my savings rate and remain optimistic on the stock market overall and that’s pretty much it. You may not believe all the stuff I’ve said but if you google it you will see all the different research papers on the subject."
2021-04-17 19:15:19,stocks,Retirement money follows this approach for me. Play money pretending I can get rich being a swing trader follows the other path. Short term returns beat my retirement account fairly significantly but but understand that the sun shines on a dogs @ss every now and then...
2021-04-17 19:18:03,stocks,If that scratches the itch for you all the power to you. Congrats on the great returns. Best of luck with your journey going forward

2021-04-17 17:51:50,stocks,"More often than not, stocks with high level of short interest are stocks that have larger issues.  Or are believed to be running way ahead of their valuations.  So general market conditions will often prevent a squeeze, unless there is an overwhelming amount of momentum aimed as a single security.

GME had an insane short interest combined with a natural run up in it's stock price, combined with the shorts doubling down on the way up.  

And while the run to 400 was virtually unprecedented it never squeezed in the way many predicted.

Chasing shorts because of GME seems like a quick way to lose money, as GME was a very unusual situation."
2021-04-17 17:58:00,stocks,Most of the time a stock is shorted for a reason. Gme happens and now people chase crap companies hoping for a short squeeze. Just search for a good company.
2021-04-17 18:54:27,stocks,"If you think that’s the case, you can look into highly shorted stocks that you think have high growth potential or won’t go bankrupt.

Moderna, ARCT, and other biotech stocks are also shorted. Moderna seems to have climbed back up from the low 120s and are around 170 now? 

Bed bath and Beyond was shorted as well, but their revenue numbers jumped in their reports."
2021-04-17 17:40:11,stocks,I got my amc bag and I'm hodling but you are absolutely right it is very possible the high boys will screw us over somehow. I'd like to see them try.
2021-04-17 18:14:55,stocks,"Gaming company stocks are usually boom or bust. If they have a hit console or game, they go way up. If not, they go the other way. Compare NTDOY from Wii, to Wii U, then to Switch.

Sony is a giant conglomerate and has all sorts of divisions under them, a lot of which don't do much for me. If I could only invest in their entertainment side (Playstation and Sony Pictures), I would.

I'm long Microsoft bc in addition to Xbox, they have lots of other big products (Windows, Office Suite, LinkedIn, plus many more).

The chipmakers are a good way to play gaming stocks. Buy the dip from the shortage."
2021-04-17 17:31:58,stocks,"20 percent in only two companies in the same industry based in the same country...that's a few too many eggs in one basket.  I wouldn't want to put more than 5 percent myself.  If you are considering covering the home gaming industry, consider adding $msft as well."
2021-04-17 19:39:35,stocks,"You could find countless reasons to not invest in Sony, I only needed 5 myself. There are many reports you can find if you google on some of them. At the end of the day however, the biggest one is what is the potential growth?!"
2021-04-17 17:53:45,stocks,"1 big problem with Sony is playstation 5 is pricey/unavailable and the games sell for 70$ + they're missing a killer game like bloodborne + the power advantage they used to hold over the xbox is gone.

Xbox game pass is a better value proposition across a several year period.

Nintendo's the one with the clear moat atm.

Everything else Sony (tvs, headsets etc.) are good quality but don't sell as well as others (or their margins are lower). Imo sony stuff is great value but i rarely see the brand compared to others."

2021-04-17 19:17:26,stocks,[removed]
2021-04-17 17:40:59,stocks,"Both companies are incredibly vulnerable long term to cloud streaming (Microsoft, Google, Amazon).

- Google Stadia is struggling to make an impact even though the technology is incredible but could get there eventually.

- Microsoft XCloud is already making a huge impact without their technology near as good as Googles yet.

- Amazon is very early.

This part shortage is just another example of why consoles will be obsolete someday."
2021-04-17 19:24:09,stocks,"It's hilarious to say that the new PS console is ""pricey"", especially when you consider that the original PS3 with a 60gb hdd, which came out 15 years ago, was priced at $600, compared to the PS5 with the ssd at $500. You don't even have to calculate for inflation to know that's a lie.

Sony and Microsoft both have exclusive games for their consoles and have both built up followings for them with their own benefits. Both consoles are relatively the same in comparison, with a few differences here and there, but loyal brand enthusiasts are going to stick to what they like mostly. Plus, both consoles are hard to find because of the semiconductor shortage, where both cpu/gpu originate from AMD. 

Video games as well should be priced higher than what they were 15 years ago because of inflation too, so there's nothing wrong with that. Just because people get bent over paying more for the price of a game, doesn't mean developers should make less for more work. If you go to your favorite restaurant and they need to charge more because of rising food costs and the want to pay their employees a decent wage, are you going to complain and never dine there again? Hopefully not, but I'm sure a bunch of boomers would. What happens when other restaurants have to increase their prices as well? It's stupid to disregard inflation in specific industries when it effects everything. 

Nintendo is only in the spotlight because they've been doing what they always have, creating something different. They've done it previously both successfully and unsuccessfully, but they know what's working well now and should continue down that path. 

They all have their upsides, but Sony and Nintendo both have a higher chance to bring more returns than Microsoft. Just look at Sony after they launched the PS5."
2021-04-17 19:19:05,stocks,"Sony, apple, and google are my favorite stocks"
2021-04-17 17:49:51,stocks,"Cloud streaming is shit. 

""someday"" will be when gigabit fiber becomes the norm AND some miracle protocol will make input lag a thing of the past. Ask AT&T and Comcast how that's going."
2021-04-17 19:34:39,stocks,"The PS5 is pretty much exactly in the middle price wise when you look at inflation and compare against the earlier playstations. And the no-disc version is the cheapest yet.

2021-04-17 19:35:52,stocks,"Developers on average are not making more money. Only the individual companies are. I.e. look at Mr.Blizzard's bonus cheque(200million.) 

The amount of games bought have completely leveled up compared to the past, so already the amount of money flowing into a successful game's company's pocket is substantially more. Add to the fact that deluxe, gold, legend and different forms of editions for the same game have become extremely common. Meaning a company can make double or even triple the base price on the same game. Add in the increasing commonality of micro-transactions and it becomes harder to justify a price increment. 


In Japan, an average PS4 game on release would cost between what would be 65-80 USD. That was unreasonable, but we won't complain so they can get away with it. They'll do what they can get away with.

The console on the other hand is underpriced. They usually sell at cost or even at loss since Sony makes their money in other formats. Psplus being a huge one. PS4 was sold at loss or cost as well."
2021-04-17 17:04:19,stocks,I mostly use an Ichimoku cloud + MACD + StochRSI / RSI

2021-04-17 17:16:49,stocks,"I’ve used those indicators besides, ichimoku cloud. I’ve looked breifly into ichimoku cloud it seemed a little compliacated and didnt really fit on my charts"
2021-04-17 17:17:47,stocks,"Maybe at first, but it’s a nice indicator to use. Also, what do you use? On tradingview it fits perfectly"

2021-04-17 16:38:05,stocks,">	it seems like everyone who is anyone uses Twitter 

I think that’s part of it. Twitter has warned of slowing user growth, whereas Snapchat is valued higher because of its growth potential."
2021-04-17 16:32:07,stocks,Twitter seems way more influential.   If they can monetize their ad platform better I think it's the better company.
2021-04-17 16:37:41,stocks,Just look at what snapchat is doing with augmented reality and you will see why investors like it more than Twitter. Snapchat has a much longer runway than Twitter beyond the social media aspect.
2021-04-17 17:52:44,stocks,"Twitter is on decline. Companies dont fit in the industry forever.  Some new fad is always around the corner ie. SNAPCHAT

Young people aren't asking each other for their twitters or facebook BUT their snapchats!

Many users are aware of the privacy concerns with social media now as well. Twitter and FB/instagram the biggest."
2021-04-17 16:56:55,stocks,"Twitters user base is basically the elite and those users that love following the elite

It doesn't have a path towards growing its user base"
2021-04-17 16:35:20,stocks,"Twitter has not been growing its user base for years and, ever since they blocked Donald Trump, users are leaving over the censorship issue.  Facebook is in the same situation: declining active users and censorship.  Instagram, Snapchat, and a few smaller outfits are growing their user base and don't censor."
2021-04-17 17:02:09,stocks,Augmented reality
2021-04-17 16:31:11,stocks,"Like OP mentioned, Twitter has a higher profit margin though. They make a lot of their ad revenue on promoted tweets and accounts which are more subtle than Snapchat’s ads."
2021-04-17 16:23:20,stocks,This. Twitter’s ad platform isn’t great at all
2021-04-17 18:11:50,stocks,"I noticed the ads stopped a few weeks ago. Kinda curious why, they're probably selling user data now."
2021-04-17 16:42:03,stocks,"That's actually a good point and something I didn't think about. It just seems like Snapchat has such a novelty to it, I wonder if that will wear off eventually"
2021-04-17 18:55:04,stocks,"it’s a miracle twitter made it this far, and all the banning they do will only make people run away faster."

What does this even mean?"
2021-04-17 17:07:51,stocks,"Instagram...which is owned by Facebook.

Also, consider that Facebook's largest market is India, with over half a billion users. And the Indian economy is projected to overtake and outgrow the US economy by the end of the decade.

If you're thinking on a long term investment horizon, Facebook is a fucking monster of a stock to own."
2021-04-17 16:38:41,stocks,"Yeah that's where I'm kind of confused, like if Snapchat is more profitable how come Twitter has a higher profit margin? Is this the market looking forward, where people are thinking that Twitter has kind of capped out its growth and Snapchat has a lot more room?"
2021-04-17 18:26:25,stocks,Snapchat does promoted accounts and stories andddd has loads of news/ads. Twitter is also web based and you can easily ad block any of their regular ads from a browser
2021-04-17 19:49:03,stocks,On what platform?
2021-04-17 18:33:08,stocks,I heard myspace is making a comeback...
2021-04-17 19:47:52,stocks,"That’s what the consensus is, they will grow faster, bigger potential market gains and better demographics but I think it will end up being the opposite if Twitter succeed with their paying for membership, monetization.

Honestly everyone is using TikTok though and I think neither are good long term. Pinterest is more interesting as well and other up and comers. I don’t own any."
2021-04-17 19:03:01,stocks,For every elite on twitter there are 10000 wannabees
2021-04-17 19:03:24,stocks,It means normal people don't use twitter
2021-04-17 16:46:49,stocks,"I’d like to see a source on u/WeakError2115’s claim that Snapchat is more profitable because every number I’ve seen online points to Twitter actually being profitable (since 2019) while Snapchat is still losing money. In terms of stock valuation though, yes it’s probably due to Snapchat’s growth potential."
2021-04-17 19:10:38,stocks,"Most of twitter is inane garbage so it seems pretty normal for social media to me. Calling the users ""elite"" in anyway would probably be a compliment."

2021-04-17 19:34:31,stocks,"Don't leave options open if you can't afford to have them get exercised. But why would they margin call you if you've been credited? Just close the position ASAP. Maybe call them and ask what to do. I don't think they'll liq your other assets because there's nothing to ""recover"". This is on their end."
2021-04-17 17:17:58,stocks,I did it removed my post
2021-04-17 15:51:47,stocks,"Proper diversification empirically and mathematically is to hold the entire stock market via VTI/equivalents and VXUS/equivalents. That way you capture what’s called the global equity premium, which is what we want when we invest in risky assets like stocks. 

Many people have other theories saying 18-30 stocks are enough but the goal is to diversify away individual company risk and 30 holdings isn’t really completely doing that. It’s a lot better than 2 holdings, but we’re still making a judgment call on what we think will outperform."
2021-04-17 16:29:12,stocks,"I would generally suggest that if you’re trying to build a long term portfolio (and not just trading short term to try and make a quick buck), then you should build a base using VTI/VXUS or ITOT/IXUS (or some similar combination) to get access to the full world market.

Once you’ve built that up some, you could start adding individual stocks or if you believe that a certain sector or industry is going to outperform you could use a sector specific ETF.

But for true investing, I would always suggest keeping a well diversified base that makes up the bulk of your portfolio and then accentuate from there."
2021-04-17 16:34:01,stocks,"This is just me so take it how you want...How I've grown and changed my portfolio over the years (I'm 31 now, started at 17). Started with broad based funds, mixed active and passive (about 70/30). Once I grew it to where I could spread it out more I added my own researched sector funds too for mid term growth based on what I think will outperform the broad market (about 15% of total portfolio). Then added individual stocks (about 5%) that I like for the medium to long term as well. Now I dabble in short term trading of stocks as well (barely 1% of portfolio)."
2021-04-17 16:46:28,stocks,"For an average investor, holding at 15+ stocks in different industries is a common rule of thumb.  You are at 25 which is great.  Be aware that for your overall financial situation, you need to also diversify.  Ideally have some money in home equity, some in cash, have your car paid off, and otherwise diversify your assets.  Good luck.   : )"
2021-04-17 15:55:32,stocks,It’s more about protecting yourself from a bubble 2 stocks in energy and retail is way better than 100 different tech companies. You want to have as many sectors as possible so if tech or automotive goes to shit you only take a small hit not your whole portfolio

2021-04-17 19:33:21,stocks,Diversification is protection against ignorance. Use that information as you want
2021-04-17 15:58:21,stocks,"Respectfully I have to disagree, it doesn’t work exactly that way. At the highest possible level you have market risk. You cannot diversify that away it’s the inherent riskiness of the market. You discuss sector risk which I can understand. However, it’s cloudy because 2 stocks is very risky from an individual risk standpoint. You’re very sensitive to company specific risks when you only hold two stocks. 100 stocks is better from that perspective. But if you own 2 or 100, it’s still worse than buying a total market index fund. You’ve diversified all the individual risk you can and you’re left with what you cannot diversify away. That’s optimal mathematically."
2021-04-17 17:07:52,stocks,"Good explanation. More simple explanation; Not diversifying will theoretically make you take on uncompensated risk. For 95%+ of the people, buying a broad market ETF is the best choice."
2021-04-17 17:25:02,stocks,Yeah people here generally don’t think about compensated or uncompensated risk. They just think purely from “more risk = more return” when you have to look at it from risk-adjusted basis.
2021-04-17 17:39:39,stocks,Exactly. Atleast someone here has taken some finance classes haha
2021-04-17 18:17:35,stocks,Don’t expect a lot of people on this subreddit to know the mathematical underpinnings of successful investment strategies haha they just want to make money (rightly so) and quickly.

Of course, there might be some more positive catalysts possible if e.g. more Biontech is used in China or similar large markets.

Also, if you want to follow this hypothesis, keep an eye on Moderna as well. Their vaccine is just as effective and also hasn’t shown severe side effects like blood clotting."

Basically I’m trying to assess what really counts as undervaluation, how inefficient is the market, how prone the market is to overreactions. But a vast majority of my money is in index funds because I’m not going to beat the market consistently."
2021-04-17 16:39:29,stocks,"I make sure that no less than 50-60% of my overall portfolio is a well diversified base made of things like VTI and VXUS in my IRA that makes up a big chunk of our portfolio and index funds in my 401k.

I’ve got about 25% at the moment in large cap (mostly dividend focused) types of individual stocks (e.g JNJ PEP VZ MO ABBV MRK BTI TD RY LMT MSFT etc)

I have a smaller portion (< 10%) at the moment that are in a couple of smaller cap purely speculative plays. Once I sell out of them I will wrap the proceeds mostly back into VTI or maybe top up some of the individual holdings.

But for me personally, I will never let the ETF/MF portion get lower than 50-60% of our overall portfolio.

This structure lets me sleep at night knowing that I’ve got the base of ETFs, another chunk in what I believe are mostly long term holds, and then a little bit of gambling that won’t break our plans apart if they went to $0."
2021-04-17 17:01:59,stocks,"I started buying MSFT a few weeks ago as a long term investment, and it has since then performed better than any of my short term investments. 🙄"
2021-04-17 16:36:50,stocks,Yep that's what I do.  But there are others like SHW IDXX ODFL that aren't at tops of indexes that have done double digit returns for many years.
2021-04-17 16:34:56,stocks,Right but certain stocks have beat the market for many years.  Idxx lrcx msft aapl nvda hd unh etc.
2021-04-17 16:51:06,stocks,"Right but even broad indexes can crash and take years to recover.  But I get what you're saying.  I only have about 20% indexed right now.  The other are large cap.

20% is in msft and AAPL .  I consider that part fairly safe with some growth.

My AAPL is 50 shares @92 and MSFT is 20 shares @202.

  I also have 5% in NVDA which is fairly stable and growth.  My cost basis is 477 so I'm not too worried."
2021-04-17 18:19:13,stocks,In 10 years you'll thank yourself.
2021-04-17 17:06:24,stocks,Yupppp.
2021-04-17 16:38:00,stocks,Yeah but as investors we shouldn’t care about past returns we care about future returns. GE was beating and leading the market for decades until it didn’t. XOM was the largest company in the world until it wasn’t. These are things we can’t predict and to say otherwise is just being arrogant because no one can see the future and the market acts irrationally.
2021-04-17 17:11:39,stocks,"Right, but if you’re only in a handful of individual stocks it can hurt a lot worse if one of them doesn’t make it through the crash. If you’re mostly in blue chips that’s obviously far less likely but not a 0% chance.

Agree on MSFT and AAPL. I’m working on building up a position in MSFT. For now it’s in VTI and my 401k index fund but I’ve added QQQ and XLK to get additional exposure while getting some diversification."
2021-04-17 19:10:42,stocks,So I shouldn’t sell my 6% gain!?  🤣
2021-04-17 16:42:27,stocks,"That's correct, but it's funny how even value investors site past returns.  I think most people look at past returns to some extent. 

Look at MNST returning 80,000 % or something.  Is that not good for anything when evaluating a stock??

What about a company that has returned 3% for the last 10 years?  Would you seriously think about owning it?

I can bet than the above companies I mentioned will continue to beat the market.  At least for another 5 to 10 years.  I don't KNOW but I'm willing to gamble."
2021-04-17 16:49:57,stocks,"If I thought a stock that returned 3% for past 10 years had a better probability of outperforming MNST, going forward, I’d buy it. I don’t look at past returns to guide forward looking decisions. Sure, they’re historically interesting and it’s important to understand how successful businesses continued to return value to shareholders. 

But that’s in the past. Microsoft treaded water until Satya came onboard in 2014. Even NVDA underperformed for a stretch in 2018 or 2019. As long as you acknowledge you’re gambling that they’ll continue to go up, then that’s fine. But a lot of people don’t and they think they’re more skilled or knowledgeable than they are. That’s dangerous hubris. 

I’ve had great returns but I’m not skilled. I got lucky and I don’t think I’ll continue that kind of performance but I want to better understand the financial market so I’m willing to underperform to gain knowledge."
2021-04-17 16:58:05,stocks,"The way I look at it right now is if I get a 10% return per year im happy.  Yes id like 12 to 20%, but I will take whatever I get.  There are no guarantees in life as we all know.

My first year I got about a 25% return with my stock picks but I realize it is mostly luck and blue chip companies.

I don't go after meme type stocks.

I have fun picking out stocks and seeing what happens.  I don't put too much in each stock other than MSFT and AAPL at the moment."
2021-04-17 17:08:31,stocks,So if the market returned 15% you’d be happy accepting 10% if you picked stocks? I think that’s fine honestly as long as you’re picking stocks because you think it’s fun and enjoy it. I’m the same way.
2021-04-17 17:22:01,stocks,"But the next year his stocks may return 15% and the market only 10%, lol."
2021-04-17 17:58:44,stocks,I'd live with it.  But I don't think that'll happen since 20% of my portfolio is msft aapl. If msft goes down so does the sp500 in most cases.
2021-04-17 17:23:55,stocks,"Yeah but no one knows. Or his stocks could return -50% and market returns 10%. Future returns don’t have to resemble past returns, right?"
2021-04-17 17:57:26,stocks,Is msft aapl hd unh lrcx going to return -50% while sp500 does well?  Don't think so.

2021-04-17 15:26:05,stocks,"If you went from 10k to 20k and pulled out 10k (half), you’d have a realized capital gains of 5,000 because you invested 5,000 of your own money to make that 10k."
2021-04-17 15:36:16,stocks,"You didn’t “put 10k into a stock” and “pull out 10k”, ... you bought x shares and sold y shares. You pay tax on the gains of those y shares. So you need to know how much those y shares — those exact y shares if you bought shares at different prices — cost to buy (your cost basis), how much you got from selling them (the 10k in your “pull out 10k”), and you pay taxes on the gains which is sales proceeds (10k) - cost basis. Long term capital gains if you held those y shares for a year or more, normal income tax if less than a year."
2021-04-17 16:36:44,stocks,if you hold for a year and make under 39k it will be 0
2021-04-17 15:22:46,stocks,Yes.  You pay cap gains tax on any realized gains.
2021-04-17 15:22:50,stocks,Yes you have to pay tax
2021-04-17 15:36:43,stocks,"You’d have to pay capital gains on your profit.  Example: you buy 500 shares of ABC company at $20 per share.  (10k investment) In a month its valued at $40 a share so you sell 1/2 your stake to take out your $10k.  250 share at $40/ea. 

You realized a gain of $20/share for those 250 shares, that you are liable for taxes on."
2021-04-17 15:33:18,stocks,"This. You pay tax on the shares you sold.
100 shares at $100 each=$10,000.
The stock moves to $200/share so your total is now $20,000. In order to withdraw $10,000 you need to sell 50 shares at $200 each. So 50 @ $200 is $10,000 minus the initial investment (on just those 50 shares) of $5,000 means you pay capital gains on $5,000 profit."
2021-04-17 15:29:16,stocks,"Sorry maybe my post is confusing, I was speaking purely in dollars. If I invest $10,000 into a stock, and then the worth increases to $20,000, and I pull out just $10,000 to cover my initial investment, I'll be taxed on that?

Edit: Oohh wait, I see what you're saying now. Thank you. Man, the government really knows how to get their cut no matter what huh (unless you're rich rich of course)"
2021-04-17 15:23:31,stocks,"Huh interesting, so how do they know it's gains if I started with 10k and only cashed out 10K? Technically there's 0 realized gain correct?"
2021-04-17 15:23:59,stocks,"Interesting that's confusing to me. If I put in 10k and cash out 10k and leave the other 10k in the stock, isn't that 0 realized gain?"
2021-04-17 15:34:56,stocks,"Yep I understand now, thanks."
2021-04-17 15:31:37,stocks,Yes
2021-04-17 15:55:31,stocks,It’s on a per share basis. Your broker will automatically track your cost basis for you so you’ll know what the unrealized gain is prior to selling.
2021-04-17 15:26:07,stocks,If you are cashing out a gain yes mo matter what. Only when you cash out at a loss you wont.
2021-04-17 16:22:16,stocks,Just pay your taxes. You won’t outsmart the IRS.  It’s all tracked.
2021-04-17 15:25:04,stocks,You're still selling a partial amount of shares you bought
2021-04-17 15:37:23,stocks,You're welcome. It was fresh in my head because I literally just got home from my tax professional's office 30 minutes ago so his explanation is still fresh in my head. :)
2021-04-17 17:00:34,stocks,"Haha I wasn't trying to avoid the taxes, just wanted to fully understand how it worked before I made any moves. Thanks."
2021-04-17 15:26:32,stocks,"Right but I was under the assumption you're only taxed on realized gains? Like if I put in 10k and it drops to 5k and cash out I'm not taxed on that right? Maybe I need to do some more reading, thanks!"
2021-04-17 15:56:18,stocks,It would love to get into CELH but it’s way to expensive at the moment
2021-04-17 16:37:48,stocks,"Yeah, but you could always buy a share or two and average down just for fun.  $60 a share not much to really lose.  Or add to watch list."
2021-04-17 16:45:23,stocks,I was considering buying when it was $20 a share but sadly didn’t pull the trigger. And it hasn’t had a correction like a lot of stocks which is a sign of strength but too expensive to me right now as a long hold
2021-04-17 15:30:19,stocks,"The profit is typically bigger when you sell the calls, executing them losses all extrinsic value they have left.  There are only a few weird instances where you want to execute."

2021-04-17 14:09:18,stocks,"I look for growth at a reasonable price. Unlike other investors, I don’t actually care if Facebook or google are broken up by anti-trust rulings. That may actually unlock a ton more shareholder value so regardless of outcome I’m a buyer. 

I look for strong growth, long runways, and great cash generation and proven profitability. Being a leader in their market matters a lot too. I also look at growth names that have gotten their wings clipped because of an earnings miss or some negative news and see if there was an overreaction. It’s harder now to find solid value but it all depends how you define it."

Right now is the time to buy high risk growth stocks. Everyone's ignoring the picks I make which tells me that I made all the best picks. It hurts to look at the blood on the streets but I'm setting myself up with some amazing positions, especially on HYLN. I find it hilarious that not a single soul on this subreddit ever even mentions HYLN lmao. WKHS, NKLA, RIDE, BLNK they all get tons of love but everyone hates on me for liking HYLN."

There was a guy trading options on Robinhood whose account showed a -$700k balance, he panicked, and killed himself.

City tax - same as states, pay for working in a big city but if you live outside it maybe taxed less.

Federal - can't escape it (?) Unless you're a church or other few things like that.

WHY can a business make tons of money in the states but 'have a HQ' elsewhere outside the states and completely avoid federal taxes?! (Similar thing with states, something about having HQ built elsewhere you don't deal with anything but taxes in the state of HQ)

WHY is there no 'okay, but you still do billions in business here, we're going to tax you based on that $""

These companies would be better off investing in anything — a product, a service, a corporate acquisition — that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards.

Here in the USA the politicians/lawmakers seemed to have forgone ""we the people"" in favor of ""we the corporations"" or ""we the billionaires"", because the corporations and billionaires can pay for favors.  Yep, I'm sure Google did their part in paying lobbyists to pay politicians/lawmakers to make tax avoidance legal, ... but maybe they didn't? Maybe the are just benefiting from laws that the Koch brothers paid politicians/lawyers to implement. Regardless, blaming the beneficiary of a low is wrong, blaming the creators of that law is more reasonable (which, yes, may be the same person/entity, but maybe not).   My point is, disallow politicians being bought and everyone benefits; target a particular beneficiary and only only that one bad apple is addressed. (Sorry, that got a bit rant-y)"

Look how horrible the quality of the school system is. 

The reality is that government is horrible at allocating and managing resources and indulges in wasteful spending to bids going to cronies.  We started the great society program to end poverty.... ~60 years ago. After trillions spent, poverty has only worsened.  We had a ~1 trillion infrastructure package in 2009 which state governments used to shore up their finances, reduce debt and very little being used for its intended purpose. The cost of destroying and rebuilding the 3 mile  Mario Coumo bridge in NY after delays will be 4 billion. $4 billion for 3 miles and renaming it. And that's after an initial revision from $3 billion. Would have cost a fraction of that if they just repaired and maintained it every year.

The government comes up with laws, taxpayers look for loopholes in them.

On this, it seems, we fundamentally disagree.

I want taxes to go towards education, healthcare, higher education, roads, bridges, the betterment of our society. Not wars or bombing children in the middle east.

I want the taxes I pay to go towards those things, and I want corporations to pay taxes towards those things, because those corporations benefit **from** those things. They benefit from a healthy, educated workforce. They benefit from usable roads and bridges.

It is **heinously immoral** for corporations to pay zero in taxes after having benefitted from these things on the backs of their workers and on the taxes of individuals such as you and I. It is **absurdly short sighted** that corporations should be allowed to continue shoving more money into their own coffers and that of their rich share holders without giving back to the society that supported their success.

There’s no doubt clean energy is the future but I wouldn’t want to pay the current prices for some of these names. I care about future expected returns though and if valuations have run up significantly ahead of actual growth to justify the multiples, then you’d expect future returns to be muted."

Basically any stock that was a retail trader trend stock at any point since November has been beat to shit.

Volume has dried up across the board as well. Margin hit a record high last month, wouldn't be surprised if a lot of deleveraging is going on as part of the reason for lower volume and that we'll see a not insignificant reduction in margin numbers for April.

The storage of excess energy seems speculative? Hard to select a winner, ... so a basket of same makes more sense? But, same problem, batteries getting cheaper and cheaper means manufacture of batteries getting paid less and less over time. I mean, we saw it as Moore’s law on the chip side for the last 60 years, so it’s net good, just tough to figure out who the winners are in clean energy.

If you have the funds available to put in and are not afraid of losing those funds, they are a great high risk play.

2021-04-17 12:23:49,stocks,"Have you looked at some of these businesses and their valuations more closely? The fact that PLUG was 8% of ICLN was enough of a deterrent for me not to invest.

2021-04-17 12:39:48,stocks,"Yeah things aren’t binary, the stocks are all from different areas of clean energy whether it’s solar or hydrogen or EV makers or EV suppliers. Look the unfortunate truth is, these companies are generally finding more and more competition in their space. Tesla is now fighting basically every car manufacturer on the planet for EV share. Traditional utilities and oil majors are also bidding on renewable projects now. Small companies can’t afford to compete on price to the extent that these massive profitable companies can so that’s a risk you need to understand. 

Companies don’t tend to just sit back and let themselves get disrupted. It’s going to be a slugfest and it’s hard to tell who is going to win or lose right now it’s early innings."
2021-04-17 15:54:03,stocks,Yeah which is why I used past tense. Not sure what reshuffled ICLN looks like but thematic ETF’s don’t fit my personal investment philosophy. But hopefully the new version is better for other people.

I pick stocks in small quantities for fun and also if a fund I’m looking at for sector exposure (like real estate) isn’t reflective of the sector. A good example is VNQ which is the real estate fund Vanguard has, I think the largest one available of any provider. 

Most of it is composed of industrials like Prologis or cell towers. There’s a decent under allocation to residential and a massive under allocation to offices (not saying good or bad just an observation). So I wanted to capture more of the sector that I understood, so I didn’t buy VNQ and instead picked the best quality REITs I could find in residential, retail, and offices. And I’m much happier with the results so far. Doubt it’s skill but certainly I have been lucky."

2021-04-17 14:39:00,stocks,"You can do both. I do both.

Have a bulk of my overall portfolio in a Rollover IRA and I’ve had that invested in VTI, VXUS, and SLY. I’ve got my 401k in index funds.

I had had my wife’s IRA holding all bonds for the overall allocation but recently moved those to what I believe are long term solid holds (e.g. VZ, PEP, LMT, and a few others) that pay dividends with a yield substantially higher than bonds at the moment.

I’ve been moving a chunk of my IRA to other long term mostly dividend plays (e.g. JNJ ABBV MO O MSFT etc) with dividend reinvestment turned on to let those compound. 

I’ve also bought some speculative shorter term plays just to see what happens.

Working on building a position in RBLX because I think it’s got long term growth potential (but who knows).

None of the individual positions make up more than 1-2% of the overall portfolio and that should roughly stay the same or decline since the majority of new money goes into my 401k.

But I’m also not concerned because I believe that most of the individual positions are solid companies with long term track records. I’ll obviously keep an eye on them over the years but I can sleep at night because I’m not too heavy into any more speculative positions and what not.

So, you can certainly do both, but just understand that depending on what individual positions you own may dictate whether your tilting more toward investing or gambling."
2021-04-17 16:14:43,stocks,"For better returns. ETF's are great (likely for most) and I even buy into one every month.

2021-04-17 12:01:18,stocks,"I invest in individual stocks, rather than an ETF. I'm also beating the market, so I don't see it as a mistake.

>people who do this for a living fail to beat e.g. the S&P 500

Large institutions have major disadvantages retail investors don't have. Even Buffett himself guaranteed he could get 50% in a year if he was only working with a million dollars."
2021-04-17 11:43:20,stocks,"I like to make sure I'm not investing in companies that have business practices I don't approve of.

Example: Philip Morris (tobacco company) is in S&P 500. No way am I having my dollars support that."
2021-04-17 17:39:31,stocks,"My goal is to retire by age 50 and the S&P 500 ETF isn't going to get me there in time. I wouldn't be able to retire until I'm in my 60s with the S&P 500 and that is unacceptable to me.

And if I'm going to bet on anything, I am going to bet on myself. I like to be in control of my own destiny and I have  confidence in myself to accomplish my goals and outperform the S&P 500. I'm thus far way further ahead on my goal than I would be if I invested in the S&P 500.

Plus, I don't believe the bullshit about how you can't beat the S&P 500. And if you trace where that bullshit originates from, you will find that it is from people that have a vested interest in you investing in ETFs. Yeah, people that don't do their homework or can't control their emotions will probably fail to beat the S&P 500, but if you do your homework and can control your emotions, it is very probable to beat the S&P 500 and likely by quite a lot.

And lastly, investing in individual companies is fun! And given that it is fun, it leads me to investing even more of my money. For example, if I have a choice between buying a new game or investing in a boring index fund, I might choose the new game to have some fun, but if investing itself is fun like it is when I invest in individual companies then I'm more likely to use that money towards an investment. And thus this helps me get to my goal even faster while having fun doing it."

2021-04-17 18:07:21,stocks,"ETFs based on simple sector strategies will have stocks with a range of quality. In a fund with 50 companies you can do a little DD and find 5-10 that will obviously perform above average. They will still get the benefit of the sector improvement you're anticipating, and they won't be sandbagged by bad management, aging assets, and stodgy products."
2021-04-17 18:36:29,stocks,"Few reasons.

1. I'd rather back myself than any other person. I genuinely think I can beat the market.
2.  I need a hobby, and learning about companies, fundamental analysis, macro economics is a good way to spend some of my down time. 
3. A lot of the ETFs on offering are not appealing to me. For example, QQQ is riddled with some absolute garbage. I'd rather construct a concentrated ETF of my own.
4. I want full autonomy. I don't want to own any company I don't personally believe in. If you buy an ETF, you're just about guaranteed to own a stock you don't want."

2021-04-17 13:28:39,stocks,"I foresee significantly higher oil and natural gas prices in the future. Owning additional energy stocks is a way to hedge these increases in prices. Additionally, energy stocks have the highest free cash flow yields of any sectors that I have seen (6-18%). The lack of general interest in this sector has led to lower price/FCF and price/book ratios. The energy sector is one of the few sectors that is still below pre-COVID levels, despite higher oil prices than shortly before COVID. 

Some investors may be concerned about a peak in oil demand within the next decades. Oil demand is projected to be about that of 2015 levels in 2050 in most base case scenarios. If oil demand peaks that should not make oil prices drop significantly, as the continual drop in supply of ~5% per year will require continual reinvestment, which will only occur at higher marginal barrel prices. Marginal barrel prices for tight oil investment in the Permian may be about ~$45/barrel now, but drilling inventory in the U.S. is running low and tight oil will soon no longer be able to make up for falling conventional oil production around the world."

If you have frontal lobe development, which most redditors in masses doesn't have, you can beat it.

But when we talk about various passive index funds and etfs, then its a good question. 

I will add to it that the most underrated thing about invidual stock investing is the experience you gain. Losing money, winning money, out right being confused plenty times, you can read as much courses and books as you want, but none of it can really make you experience how it is actually like to be out there and do it.

That said experience led me to be there, jump in on GME at 40$ and make hilariously ridiculous amount of money, other times it lets me get some seriously free money from bounces or momentums. Sure one could say its always risking money, but by end of the day many of my plays had nothing to do with excessive intelligence, just enough knowledge to know how to scoop up some free money, and that free money almost always beats directly investing into S&P500.

Just my 2 cents on the topic."

I've learned a lot from reading. I've taken ideas from other and treat my portfolio like a laboratory. The more significant failure in 2020 was seeing good value and waiting, or not buying at all. I did that a lot. That's encouraging. It means I am able to recognize good buys. Just need the confidence to buy them. There is always a part of the stock market that's suffering.

Most of the time it's because you're particularly bullish in a specific sector/company, and want to invest more into it. Other half is because it's kinda boring just to put it all into a few ETF's. By investing in individual companies I'm more active with looking at quarterlys/news/company statistics/watching patterns/trends, etc. It gives me something to do in my spare time, andi honestly enjoy it and the process. If you want to invest in something with little interest in the market / not much time to dedicate to research, then there isn't much reason to buy individual at all excluding maybe the top 10 companies or w/e. 

The main reason I see people failing at individuals stocks is because they're much more volitle than an etf. Like with the recent crash: I saw so many people selling on the way down Becuase they lost like 20-50% of their investments on a particular stock.

What the market does has little relation to your opinion on a particular company. If you thought the company will boom in a few years, then trust that. Trust your dd. Trust your research"

safer ETFs have diversified risk - VOO, VTI, or even something more specific like SPYD spreads risk across multiple sectors and industries."

2021-04-17 12:36:20,stocks,"Good question - happy to discuss. At heart I consider myself to be a contrarian investor, so when everyone said offices are getting killed by zoom, malls are getting killed by Amazon, and California is going to be a dead zone once everyone moves to the sunbelt, I made bets against that. 

So I own KRC, ESS, SPG, ELS, VICI as my core REIT positions. They all have strong management (David Simon especially is in a league of his own) that make accretive decisions and understand market conditions. I’ve done very well, can’t say I’m skilled, but I’ve crushed the market so far this year. How about you? What do you own?"
2021-04-17 13:34:43,stocks,That’s why I think “ethical investing” is kind of a joke. Also if you own shares of a company you get voting power to change the decisions a company makes.
2021-04-17 16:52:49,stocks,Exactly.  And there are ETFs that cater to this eg. ETF funds that only invest in 'sustainable' businesses.  The problem is that the definition of 'sustainable' is up to the ETF manager!

2021-04-17 13:38:10,stocks,"I bought Simon as well. I just laugh when I see people recommending Macerich instead, and I totally agree with you on SPG being a great contrarian bet and the only mall REIT worth owning. For offices, I own SLG, KRC, and BXP, because I think Class A properties are going to do just fine. For net lease, I own O, WPC, ADC, NTST, STOR, and STAG. I also own GMRE (small cap medical office REIT), and IRM (paper storage REIT that is transitioning to data centers). The last two are a little more speculative than the others, but they are smaller positions and I think they are worth the calculated risk.

I own almost all of these in a Roth IRA too, so I don't have to worry about about the tax issues. I'm reinvesting dividends for all of these, so I think the compounding is just getting started on those. I also own some mREITs like NLY and AGNC in a normal brokerage account, but those are more short term trades where I get paid to wait instead of long term holds."
2021-04-17 14:35:40,stocks,"I mean I agree, Capitalism more or less encourages unethical behavior, and you can probably make a case for at least half of the companies on the s&p. 

From outsourcing to cheap labor to increase profits to companies encouraging rainforest deforestation, to companies testing products on animals(hi Johnson and Johnson), or the companies that treat their workers in the US like shit. Your response of “they’re all evil so fuck it” is a common one. 

Other people can draw the line of evil somewhere in the middle there between pure evil and capitalistic reality, which is my approach."
2021-04-17 17:50:42,stocks,"I work for one of those “sustainable” companies(I’ll stay vague just in case), and I can tell you many of them are just virtue signalers marketing to the “eco conscious” market without actually giving a shit."
2021-04-17 19:08:15,stocks,"You need to  be very careful about holding leveraged ETF's as long term. It is very much not recommended holding for any extended period of time. It is not looking to match the total movement of the ETF over time, it's *aiming* to match the **DAILY** movement by a leveraged amount. Read this:
https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/dont-buy-and-hold-leveraged-etfs

These ETF's are designed for people to hedge against potential losses as insurance or short term amplification plays through options. They are dangerous to hold as an investment."
2021-04-17 15:04:58,stocks,"YES. THIS. Personally TQQQ maybe risky, but UPRO I feel is almost safe? UPRO will be killed essentially only when the market crash real hard, and that doesn't look like it will happen (crossing fingers), why not reap 3x the profits?"

2021-04-17 14:04:56,stocks,"Oh yeah. I see what you mean, but there are so many places where AAPL and MSFT are complementary and not direct competitors, especially since MSFT has shifted focus from Windows dominance to cloud and productivity. There is still plenty of room for both companies to continue to grow."
2021-04-17 14:09:03,stocks,"That wasn’t necessarily what I meant especially with both companies diversifying in so many different ways. Macbooks make up only 14% of their revenue(sometimes as low as 9% in some quarters).  

I can’t find similar stats for MSFT with a quick search rn but it’s probably more or less the same. If tech takes another downturn both companies take a hit which was my point."
2021-04-17 13:21:30,stocks,"I think the issue isn't so much the choice itself, but its the timing. I did buy at all time high, wasn't too smart. As to WHY i did it, i was a new investors and they were being advised by r/etf."
2021-04-17 13:50:30,stocks,"Yeah all of these are in my Roth. I wouldn’t own in taxable. I like your style, I sold out of WPC after it had appreciated a bit. Worried about the anemic dividend growth and high payout ratio and moved all of that into ELS instead. Figured I didn’t need an immediately high yield so rather go for a total return approach and get more residential exposure. 

All your picks I like. I just wanted larger more concentrated positions personally and ended up consolidating a bit. But I’ve been interested or have owned a lot of the names you mention. ADC is particularly an interesting name in the net lease space. Joey Agree is smart."
2021-04-17 15:37:57,stocks,"I’m almost positive you’re somehow investing in an industry you oppose, probably through passive index funds or a 401k. What’s the difference?"
2021-04-17 15:40:16,stocks,Yes I’ve been riding UPRO for the last 3 weeks and it’s up over 20%. Gives a little cushion for any bumps in the ride that will come.
2021-04-17 14:10:34,stocks,"Yeah, it is frustrating to see the dividend growth for WPC, but I do think it will eventually reprice to around 4-5% yield, and then I might sell and reinvest somewhere else. I’m 25, so I would be better off owning dividend growers long term. 

I actually forgot about these two, but I also bought AMT last month in the Roth, and IIPR in a regular brokerage account. If you like dividend growth, those two are solid. IIPR is definitely a little more speculative, but I bought shares at 90 last summer and I’m reinvesting dividends, so that one’s off to a great start. 

ADC I actually own in a regular account, but I think that they are definitely one I want to add to my Roth next year since I already maxed this year. If WPC shoots up this year, I might sell it for ADC."
2021-04-17 16:03:24,stocks,"I only pick stocks, I’m young and only have a small portfolio. But yeah someday I’ll probably have a 401k"
2021-04-17 14:14:31,stocks,"Yeah I’m in a similar boat to you, mid-20s. Sounds like you really know what you want to do. I’m impressed. IIPR and AMT definitely have been on my watch list but AMT is a bit expensive for my taste despite growth profile and IIPR I have concerns about their business model if/once traditional financial institutions can lend to cannabis industry. IIPR will quite frankly no longer need to exist because capital will be cheap and available. No more 20% margins on loans. 

Need to see if WPC’s acquisition spree will be accretive to FFO and not just portfolio size otherwise payout ratio will remain uncomfortably high. I like the idea of perhaps selling to buy ADC. They have definitely more room to go."
2021-04-17 14:16:24,stocks,"Yeah, the one thing I do like about WPC is their Europe exposure, which you can’t get with a lot of other REITs. I do think IIPR will see some near term headwinds with margins after legalization, but I still think there is room for the dividend to grow, and I don’t think they will get dominated by the competition after more traditional players can enter the space. I was lucky enough to pick up shares of AMT around 215, but I think if you can hold long term, they are a great way to get international exposure to telecommunications."
2021-04-17 14:49:14,stocks,"Yeah towers make a lot of sense. I’ve just kept it pretty simple as I have a better understanding of residential real estate and I’ve done well when I stick to what I know. Diversification is good for WPC but investors tend to reward focused REITs, not sure why. I hope IIPR continues to succeed regardless of the regulatory environment."

The is no profits in that business at the moment as interest rates are nearly zero if they buy £100,000 worth of mortgage debt and they only get £3000 even £100,000,000 would only give them £3,000,000 a year of income before expenses and tax and             3 million or 3%  is nothing for a public limited company a year when they have business running costs and staff,  offices rent,  rates,  electric to pay out I would guess"

DIS - A huge entertainment conglomerate with good growth in the form of Disney+ and future acquisitions. 

PYPL - We are moving to a cashless world very quickly and I believe that PayPal will hold their position as a giant in fintech. Their active user and total payment volume growth has been rapid which indicates a good future for them.

PINS - They have built a good product where ads don’t really make the user experience worse. That’s huge for a company that develops their revenue through ads.

The stock has pretty much found its rock bottom around $57 this week, and Cathy has been buying the whole time. Earnings are May 7 and will likely be a major catalyst for the stock considering the amount of revenue they are likely to have made in Q1 from some major sporting events. However, this is a long term buy and hold. Currently only a quarter of the population has access to legal mobile sports betting. Also, SB Tech integration around September. DKNG is moving away from Kambi, their backend sports-book operator. SB Tech is owned and operated by DKNG and will allow them to vertically integrate the company and cut reliance on 3rd parties. They’ve moved into media as well. The company is positioning themselves to take over the sports betting/DFS landscape for years to come. Hop on board.

FB (Facebook) - regulatory hurdles are overstated as we are at least a decade away from the antitrust department forcing a breakup. Very attractively valued compared to other tech names at 22x 2022 earnings. 

RTX (Raytheon) - increased tensions with China and Iran are going to lead to a military buildup in the Middle East and East Asia, both with respect to the U.S. and regional powers. Raytheon stands to benefit, and is trading at a 2017 price. 

EMXC (Emerging Markets ex-China ETF) - as long as China and the U.S. continue to squabble with each other (and China does not crack down on fraud) their stocks will fail to achieve consistently positive returns. Additionally, concerns over forced delistings of U.S. ADRs may lead to a tit-for-tat that results in U.S. holders of Chinese/Hong Kong-listed shares being left out to dry. Invest in emerging markets without needlessly exposing oneself to the drag and tail-risk of China’s stock market."

They are big in Europe and India and are getting their feet in the USA through a recent acquisition. A potential of multiplying it's value by 10 or 20 in the next five-ten years.

2021-04-17 15:01:50,stocks,"I’m going with APA and GM. I think GM is going to win out in the electric truck market. I live in west Texas. While I don’t know stocks, I do know the oilfield and a little about the oil and gas market. I’m also am OEF veteran and I’ve noticed some things going on around the world politically. Most of the advise given to early investors is study what you know. Well I know war and I know oil. 

Normally drilling and exploration occur when the price of oil is high. The price has been relatively low the last 5 years. Most of the major oil companies build wells on a 2 year plan, after which they are sold to smaller operators who install more affordable equipment and the wells don’t produce near what they used to. Most of these wells I speak of are into this played out phase. They aren’t constructing oil wells and fracing 100+ stages right now. 

The government has taken a stance against oil. This will increase the value of oil. Granted the restrictions on federal land regarding drilling permits are at worst single digit percentages. But, the restrictions on exports were lifted only 4-5 years ago. Could they be reinstated? 

APA has sold all of its assets in the states, and decided to explore off the coast of South America. They have found 4 major reservoirs containing billions of barrels of oil. These are offshore. From these offshore platforms the can drill several directional wells into these formations. Billions of barrels, untapped, just waiting. 

If we look at the global political climate. Some of the peace deals from the Middle East have been thrown out. The conflict to get gas from Qatar to Europe in order to break up the Russian monopoly on heating Europe, is getting ever more interesting in Syria. China is encroaching on Taiwan, India, and the Philippines and so many more countries around the world. Disputing borders and over fishing their oceans. India is fighting China on one border and Pakistan on the other. If the war machine starts, APA value goes nuts, and increases with every well they drill. The record price of oil occurred in 2009 when the government decided to surge Afghanistan. If there’s another surge, doesn’t have to be by the United States, the price goes wild. 

I’m new to this, so let me have it. IMO, there is zero risk this oil company goes under in the next 5 years. Despite oil being on the edge of profitable in recent years."

I think tesla may have more potential but it has to grow a lot still to fit its current valuation and that growth may be a lot harder with all the EV competition coming in the next few years along with everyone else investing heavily in new battery tech too. Tesla is limited by Panasonic for battery tech, so if Panasonic gets left behind by solid state lithium ion batteries or some other tech it can cause a lot of trouble for Tesla too. Of course other companies are starting to reveal their more advanced self driving tech too which will also hurt Teslas current market edge.

And compare only people who buy and hold for 5-10+ years vs S&P 500 ETFs. I feel like you'd get a higher percentage of people who do end up beating index funds.

2021-04-17 13:12:00,stocks,Same here. Just can't pick a stock to save my life lol. Good thing I considered that money gone as soon as I deposited it into my brokerage.
2021-04-17 16:26:41,stocks,"Lol right? It already went up 500%, means it'll keep that pace forever. 

I think the one speculative stock I like that I purchased recently was lam research, I aim to hold that for years though. Other than that I'm bullish on banks, I picked em all up early March 2020 so I'm already doing well on them. Goldman Sachs I really liked  last year, it's growth is priced in, if it doesn't keep it's pace the share price will likely falter. 

I like Cigna a whole lot right now, as well as vertex pharmaceuticals. I do not own vertex, I sold last year. but I would like to own it again at some point, I've been buying cigna more recently. 

GE is my favorite, I've been playing it last year with leaps and 3-6 month calls and decided that I should finally buy some shares with all the sweet gains it has given me. 

Constellations and altria I like a lot because it's safe marijuana exposure without the pump and dumps. Also altrias dividend is nice although I don't view it as a value stock, I may have to trim that one down as I see it getting close to overvalued. 

APD is a great stock, good green hydrogen and commodity play. More low-key and a boring slow mover but I see in the next 5 years it doing very well."
2021-04-17 15:33:20,stocks,"I love COST. Not to brag but my DCA on Costco is 200 with ~200 shares which I’ve accumulated over 5 yrs. That special dividend earlier this year and the recent pullback to $310 has been a great start to 2021 to further entrench my position.

Golden age of AWS is over, as revenue starts to stop growing at rate it has been in past decade, it will be hard to continue Amazon's strategy of ""keep investing"".

Considering how much Home Depot has grown in the past 10 years, I think it’s going to continue on that course for the next 10. 

I didn’t want to put all my money into tech, so I thought Home Depot would be a good alternative, it’s not going to grow as much as say, Amazon will, but I think it’s a good mix.

Home Depot probably will not go out of style anytime soon, you can’t just order pieces of wood, off of Amazon, I think it’s a pretty solid business that is not going away anytime soon, considering all the services they offer, you’re not gonna buy a refrigerator or a lawnmower off of Amazon are you? That’s why I think Home Depot is such a good stock, because it’s essential. 

That’s just my reasoning, not everyone will agree with me. Another reason I chose Home Depot was because it is in the top 10 holdings in the Dow Jones industrial average, and in the top 10 holdings of XLY - the consumer discretionary ETF.

So I figured if it’s in the top 10 holdings, it must be a good stock. I briefly look at it earnings and EPS, revenue growth over the last 5 years. Not a lot of research just surface level stuff. 

And it’s past growth looks pretty steady to me, something I look for in stocks.

It's by no means a growth play (Humira patent expiration will hurt) , but even if it were to trade sideways for the next 5 years you'll still get your 5% Dividend at a cash payout ratio of below 50%.

Let’s say their data, solar energy, super charger network and battery manufacturing accounts for 66% of the free cash flows in the future (more than optimistic)

It would still mean that Tesla as of today is the most valuable car manufacturer by far. Other manufacturers change into the EV business (e.g. Volkswagen) and have a higher market share overall. In my eyes they will benefit from the slow transition of the human population towards EV. They will build their EVs and can rely on a good revenue stream from gas powered vehicles. Moreover, I strongly believe that the old big players simply build prettier cars in the same price segment (e.g. Mercedes EQC vs. Tesla Model X) when it comes to interior and in part exterior (e.g. gap size model S vs. BMW i8). Of course they are superior when it comes to the battery and range but let’s be honest if you would get an EV most people don’t want to travel 600 miles in it (there’s been some research that the average trip in Europe is around 30 miles). 
That’s my thoughts on the car manufacturer side. 

In terms of data: I just don’t see the business case which bring in ~$50-100 bn a year. (Based on Facebook forward looking revenue multiple)

In terms of solar: I am honestly not keen when it comes to this topic. But a lot of European and American manufacturers of solar panels got into trouble because China was able to undercut their prices. 

Super charger network: either they stay solely for Tesla which leads to the conclusion that they have to become the biggest car manufacturer in terms of revenue to justify the valuation or they open up to other manufacturers and suffer from a USP. 

Last argument against their valuation (probably the one I get the most hate for): Elon musk. I love him as an entrepreneur and visionary but I don’t think he is a good lead of a company. Being stoned on an interview and tweeting stock related information is just not of help sometimes. Moreover a company should not invest in bitcoin. As a shareholder he takes on a risk that I am not willing to take and he is certainly not in the position to evaluate the risk and rewards threshold of every shareholder. 

However, I strongly believe that Tesla is a good company and will be around for a long time. The valuation is build in such a strong growth case that even great result and stellar performance by Tesla will not result in growth potential of the Tesla stock itself. The bar is simply to high already. 
Tesla is not apple and has stronger competition on a less affordable product."

There are no debt problems as far as I’m aware of or companies with too expensive valuations. For France I would look towards energy, aerospace or luxury brands, perhaps banks etc. You even have companies like Ubisoft. Sounds good yankie?

I'm optimistic about it, but any bad news on that front may force me to exit my position. Hopefully, they aren't too early into that space where it becomes difficult to monetize. My biggest concern is that they have this product, but the technology in vehicles prevents them from marketing and profiting from it.  To me, it seems like they're REALLY banking on the EV market and the improved tech that comes along with it.  That would maximize the potential of IVY, but potential doesn't pay the bills."

I really like Costco as a company; feel they have a clear advantage/moat over Target because of the experience they provide that brings loyalty. Look at their membership retention numbers and you will understand the fan following. I (family of 4) spend $750+ a month at Costco on average. That is not counting all the appliances, insurance, mortgage, cars and other services I have bought through them over the years. I (and millions of others) are very loyal to Costco for the experience, quality and customer service they provide. I like them so much that my home rent/purchase decisions are based on proximity to their warehouses. I don’t feel the same way about Target or even Walmart. I do shop at Target, sure, but it’s in no way shape or form compare to Costco experience.
That is the reason I will go with Costco any given day. Just my personal opinion."

2021-04-17 13:45:04,stocks,"This is just my analysis, a non-fintech guy, so it could be completely wrong. I think the major advantage Visa had over the years was their network of banks. It was really tough to interface with so many banks 30 years ago, almost impossible I would say. Banking wasn't online and none of the banks had APIs exposed. Visa/MC invested a lot and created the partnership. At the same time, it was insanely expensive to do so for other players, hence the duopoly in this sector. Well, now fintech landscape has completely changed. All banks have decent APIs and we are seeing uprising of companies like Plaid. 

Also, one of the major growth stories of almost all tech companies has been their expansion and success in developing countries. Visa is out of luck there. Look up UPI payments in India. Its a free payment gateway for transactions in India. All banks have to comply by it. Thats just one country and a major one in which Visa could have grown. Its fairly new and has few delay issues but its here to stay. As a merchant, free transaction is better than 2.5%.

And yeah, of course, crypto. Because why the fuck would you want to pay 2.5% of transaction value to Visa for EVERY transaction! Its 2021."

Series like Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Punisher weren't super popular but I am sure Netflix exec were happy with the production quality. Once Netflix lays hands on a new superhero script like The Witcher, but better, they have a chance at creating their own Marvel.

I think it might start to climb higher sometime soon in the next few months. 

Maybe now is a good time to get in? I think it’s got a few years left, maybe 5-10? But that’s just me guessing. 

According to analyst reports on TD Ameritrade it should reach 5200 in a year. Other people have said 4,000. I’m not sure. 

Amazon is building a lot of new warehouses including one near where I live, so I think they’ve got some more time to grow and expand before the party’s over. 

Take this with a grain of salt. I’m no expert. Thank you."
2021-04-17 14:10:54,stocks,Good time to get in with the new CEO. The Cloud service and tech side of biz have a lot of room to grow.

So I get an investment w plenty of Amazon and then a decent mix of other core consumer discretionary businesses.  Don’t love Tesla is their #2 now but that’s indexing, it chipped Amz down from closer to 28%.  Still like it."
2021-04-17 18:22:17,stocks,Hell no buy now. Amazon is going to at least 3800 by year end.
2021-04-17 13:09:39,stocks,Amazon still has a lot of growth ahead in the next 5 years mostly due to AWS

Home Depot sells plenty of things contractors and renovators need that they can’t necessarily get online / quickly enough online, but Amazon and the rest of the internet have got to be eating into them in a big way.

That said I put some into Home Depot and Lowe’s a few years ago and they’re both doing pretty well."

They sell construction materials and plants and whatnot. 

That’s pretty interesting though."

2021-04-17 13:00:46,stocks,"I feel like you’re touching on a point a LOT of people miss when referring to electric vehicles.

What about people who rent? How in the world are we supposed to transition to plug-based electric vehicles when 40 million adults in America live in apartments? Places that don’t usually have charge stations or an outlet routing to their garage. That’s 1 in 8 people and roughly 1 in 3 car owners who do not have the luxury of a simple option to charge their cars at home when not in use, which means they have to use public charging systems exclusively.

Give me all the supercharger arguments you want, I promise you the headache of trying to alter your commute to hit a supercharger/public charge station on the way home from work for a reduced range total and significantly more time spent commuting will absolutely reduce the amount of people who can reasonably buy an electric car, affordability aside.

I currently rent an apartment. Looking at buying a townhome. My household income is roughly $120k annually. We are pretty well off for two twenty somethings. I am looking to purchase a new car, my promotion necessitates more driving and I have to upgrade from my 1996 Avalon. I cannot guarantee that I can charge my vehicle at home consistently foe the life of the loan/vehicle, because I do not own my home nor would I have enough equity in a home by the time of purchase to reasonably assume I will not lose my home under any circumstances.

Therefore, I’m buying a hybrid because it is more reasonable. I could easily afford, be approved for, and buy a Tesla or a Mach-E or a Volt or a Leaf, but I can’t charge the fucking thing so why in the fuck would I spend hundreds of dollars a month for a car that’s HARDER to own than literally any other vehicle?

So, Toyota gets some more of my dollars."
2021-04-17 12:27:07,stocks,"Stop thinking about only electric vehicles.  It's still a pie in the sky dream for almost all of the developing world.

Would like to be able to return at some point as I’m sure it’s a growing economy. But you should buy more, Europe has more to grow now also as they are further behind in the reopening trade and their valuations are more reasonable still."

Keep in mind, leadership at Visa has never had ANY real competition outside of MC. This is not a well polished industry like say consumer devices, where China alone has created 10 companies in last 5 years. The fact that Visa wanted to acquire Plaid should tell you how much they wanted to safeguard their ""network benefits"". Well, they failed.

But yeah, you do you. If it helps, Visa/MC is in no way outperforming Apple in any future year. Everyone wants an iPhone."

For these homeowners, EVs are going to be most convenient and give best performance & safety. I am not arguing what is better. I am just arguing what will be most profitable in near future."

2021-04-17 13:48:40,stocks,"Not saying this is you, but I think a lot of people often really underestimate the risk that big banks creating their own solutions is for fintech companies. 

I'll give you an example that I think about every time I hear about how great Square' Cash App is gonna be for the company: In Spain, where I live, banks have created something similar to cash app called ""Bizum"" and it's so popular and widely used that if Square were to try to come into this market I can't see them succeeding. Everybody got so used to it, you can use it right from the app of your bank, and you can transfer money to any bank that has it (all the major ones I know have this functionality), you can donate to NGOs through it, and recently I've seen small businesses processing payments through it too.

This is just one example of big banks seeing what fintech apps can do, creating their own equivalent and using their existing customer base to out-scale fintech companies out of the market. I can't see them not doing the same with crypto purchases, and if they do it well it can really hurt COIN's future revenues.

But I can't see the future, who knows, just giving you a contrarian opinion to consider before buying in/more."

2021-04-17 19:45:59,stocks,You clearly don’t know what a .NET shop is. A .NET shop is not a company that runs some SQL workloads on AWS or hosts .NET Core apps on AWS. A .NET shop is *exclusively* Microsoft. They only hire .NET developers. Their DBAs only know MS SQL. Every server they run unless they’re forced to is running MS Server. Their sys admins have likely exclusively Windows experience. There are tons of these .NET shops out there and I can tell you based on personal experience that most of them won’t even entertain AWS.

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
> From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson & Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
> So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
> That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
> # Signs of margin pressures?
> Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
> Utilities was the best performing major S&P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
> “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
> “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
> While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
> “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
> But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
> # Searching for hints of inflation
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
> “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
> He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
> The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
> Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
> Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
> “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
> # Economic rebound
> In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
> There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
> “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
> However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
> He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
> “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
> # Watching bonds
> Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
> Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
> “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
> “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

> # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

> “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

> The bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

> Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

> First, the S&P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&P 500 was up >10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Third, the S&P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

> After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

> The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

> Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

> # Growth a Market Cap Story

> Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

> That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

> In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

> With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

> # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

> Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

> In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
2021-04-17 12:18:27,stocks,Why are JP Morgan and BoA issuing billions worth of bonds? Around 15 billion each?
2021-04-17 13:35:22,stocks,Best weekend post. Thanks for posting these!
2021-04-17 19:49:27,stocks,Thank you so much. Unbelievable research and insight. It’s much appreciated.
2021-04-17 18:47:10,stocks,RY looks to be down almost 60% in AH?
2021-04-17 15:26:49,stocks,"With the trend of companies dropping and bouncing on a good earnings beat, are there any particular companies people have their eyes on?"
2021-04-17 15:53:52,stocks,"Am I crazy for eyeing a small cap growth etf like VTWG?

I feel like small caps can catch up after the big caps take a run"
2021-04-17 17:53:26,stocks,Hyln one of the tiny red squares 😁
2021-04-17 15:25:36,stocks,For etfs users do you guys selling may ?
2021-04-17 12:36:50,stocks,Fed most likely gave them a go ahead signal that they won’t raise interest rates for foreseeable future .
2021-04-17 19:50:20,stocks,I am thinking the same thing and have recently adjusted my 401k accordingly. Good luck!
2021-04-17 19:43:44,stocks,Hodl’ing till I retire bruh
2021-04-17 13:36:50,stocks,"But they are both records, didnt the same happen before the 2008 financial crisis?"
2021-04-17 13:59:03,stocks,"Banks were selling more of mortgage backed securities (subprime ) and covered them with credit default swaps.  In a sense, it’s a bond backed by mortgage but I am more particular on interest rates because inflation is bonds kryptonite."
2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Russel 2000 Historical Volatility Swings Getting Bigger. Is a Crash, imminent? [Russell 2000 Monthly Chart](https://invst.ly/uh-g0)

Is 2021 gonna be like 2008? No. If historical volatility swings continue to get bigger then 2021 will see a bigger crash. See [chart](https://invst.ly/uh-g0) for details. 

Relative Volatility Index, which is the standard deviation of prices over time, is at a lifetime high. It is signalling a TOP

Archegos Capital hedge fund imploding might be the Lehman Brothers moment for 2021."
2021-04-17 19:45:43,stocks,"I dont know when the next crash will happen but i do know how it will happen: too many people on margin so even a small correction might trigger a massive sell off. With that said, buy good companies with real earnings and low debt and youll be fine."
2021-04-17 09:41:44,stocks,No one can predict the exact moment a crash is going to happen. So I will continue to invest how I have been. If people listened to those saying a crash was happening soon every month last year so many gains would have been missed.
2021-04-17 16:24:35,stocks,"Idk why everyone is saying there won’t be a crash? We are in the biggest bull run ever, more retail investors joining now than ever before, and what goes up must come down. He raises some good points and didn’t give a date. So, YES, OP is correct a crash/correction/pull back is imminent. You’d be a complete idiot to think we will continue a bull run forever. We always have lines of support and resistance for a reason. Don’t just not buy when opportunities arise but stop saying there WONT be. Say we don’t know when so I’m gunna go about business as usual."
2021-04-17 11:46:35,stocks,Its different this time!!!!
2021-04-17 09:59:47,stocks,"Who knows, but most of these companies make no money."
2021-04-17 12:56:32,stocks,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiny-company-boom-makes-markets-look-silly-11613666534
2021-04-17 16:24:42,stocks,"Hoping for gradual market correction .  Bubble usually had that subtle pop on Fed raising interest.  You will see portfolio shifting from growth to values right before retails get a clue .  By the time it’s done, it will be like Plug bag holders"
2021-04-17 10:59:40,stocks,Sweet. More FUD and imminent doom prophecies
2021-04-17 13:06:46,stocks,"Everyone is gonna joke about this is the Nth market crash prediction this year, but like every single metric used to predict it in the past is screaming for it now.

Also if you’re gonna hit me with some FED power mysticism (printer go brrrr bro), please realize they won’t be able to stop a cascade of deleveraging."
2021-04-17 12:36:39,stocks,So this is like the 10th imminent crash this year? Got it.
2021-04-17 09:47:14,stocks,"A crash is imminent because the chart has to get filled out. We are severely overbought, you can tell by the weak action in stock price. I don't think the Archegos is equivalent to Lehman because it only affected those two stocks. But if more scams like Viacom start poping up then it might turn to 08."
2021-04-17 09:41:11,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-17 12:25:15,stocks,"Where's the mechanism for deleveraging? You can stare at data all day long, but unless you figure out the underlying process it might as well be noise."
2021-04-17 09:43:04,stocks,I'm not saying anything. I let the numbers speak for themselves.
2021-04-17 17:04:50,stocks,"Why worry about it and keep spreading the “oh no a crash is coming!?!!!?!” story. Manage risk, change your asset allocation. These stories about fear and doom make me want to puke"
2021-04-17 13:26:56,stocks,Which companies are you talking about?
2021-04-17 11:12:15,stocks,The wall of worry is sort of comforting to me.  It's when the bears go silent that I start to get nervous.
2021-04-17 15:50:46,stocks,"You can tell that somebody started investing this year when they bring up ""FUD"". 

""FUD"" or whatever you wanna call it is healthy and good. Don't be an idiot who only wants to live in an echo chamber of positivity."
2021-04-17 11:01:07,stocks,It's nearly impossible to believe when everything is looking SO good with the economy. I hear you.
2021-04-17 13:12:19,stocks,I totally agree. I wasn't looking for a crash when I stumbled across the Russell chart. The implications have shocked me. Inflation is real. Soon it will start to dent demand for goods and services. Covid isn't going away anytime soon.
2021-04-17 12:38:28,stocks,Historical volatility indicator is about to go higher than when 2008 crisis hit. We shall see it's implications soon.
2021-04-17 12:46:58,stocks,"Consider that the amount of margin debt in this market right now is disastrously insane it’s only a matter of time before more funds blow up.

Credit Suisse lost like $5 bil on Archegos alone, idk how much they lost due to greensil. Then factor in that GS, MS and Nomura all got whacked there too."
2021-04-17 09:49:00,stocks,More over leveraged hedge funds blowing up might do it.

2021-04-17 12:34:51,stocks,"The only way to prevent these shocks to the system, is to slow everything down. Reduce money supply and increase Interest rates. The economies are overheating."
2021-04-17 10:03:55,stocks,"That's what everyone was saying a month ago, 2 months ago, and 6 months ago, yet we're still going. If you really think a crash is imminent, put money where your mouth is and buy some puts. The 2008 crash was not caused by high RSI numbers, it was caused by the housing bubble collapse, alongside a lot of other catalysts."
2021-04-17 17:13:30,stocks,A story about fear and doom? The title is a question. The “story” is reference points to his question. There is no story. And that’s all well and good but I had to explain lines of resistance the other day to someone. People are not always aware of things. You’re spreading more misguided information than the OP.
2021-04-17 15:31:53,stocks,"Practically every 2020 tech IPO.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fool riding the wave ... but, not very tech company is a future FANG, but the valuations seem to think they will be"
2021-04-17 15:58:38,stocks,"They already have. There are few major players calling for a crash, and on every post like this, the top comments are saying no.

Do you have examples in your past experience where this tule has worked for you?"
2021-04-17 16:09:46,stocks,"Im 47 😂

And its not healthy. Risk management and proper asset allocation is healthy. Worrying about a collapse is stupid"
2021-04-17 12:57:55,stocks,"That is very true, I've noticed to many regular people are hedge. There are so many stories of people taking a 2nd mortgage, using credit cards to invest in the market. If the markets go bad the repercussions could be catastrophic"
2021-04-17 12:59:20,stocks,"What if redlining economies is what's desired at this moment? At least the Fed has declared its wish to let inflation run. As long as they keep on wrestling down IR growthrate, I don't see why they can't continue for now.

To put it differently: being correct in a few months is not relevant *especially* if your thesis is based on high vol forcing IRs up. You can get rich on one swing alone, let alone several that may still occur before hypothetical tightening of monetary policy."
2021-04-17 10:06:57,stocks,😁 the indicator measures price movement. Price is about everything else.
2021-04-17 17:03:05,stocks,"Where are these stories gathered of people taking loans on homes to go to the market? I dont know a single person who has done that. If its so widespread i would know at least 1, right?"
2021-04-17 10:17:04,stocks,"Ok, suppose that it's the predictor of all evil, then why look at the RSI of Russell 2000 over SPY. Because you know that there's no case when you take a look at RSI on SPY. For example, take a look at February 04, RSI of 71. Traded sideways for a couple weeks, before going into a long bull run from $100 to $150 over the next 3 years. Look at another example, RSI indicated overbought in 1995, 1996, 1997,1998. If you listened to RSI then, you wouldve missed out on SPY at $50, which was never seen again, while also missint SPY at $70 and SPY at $91. And to add to that, SPY isn't considered to be overbought right now, with an RSI of about 73"
2021-04-17 18:25:30,stocks,"Then you must be living under a rock. I knew of a few people that borrow against their home. Seen hundreds of comments online of people doing the same thing, young kids using their money for college. These stories are all over social media."
2021-04-17 10:18:49,stocks,It's not RSI. It's RVI Relative Volatility Index.
2021-04-17 10:25:50,stocks,"The story is still the exact same. At each point, SPY was considered overbought, like SPY at $87 and SPY at $110. As another example, it indicated overbought on October 2017 when SPY traded at $259, just before the run-up to $288, and is trading inside the range even now. That is all while looking at the weekly candles. It's very easily to make that number seem higher than it is using the monthly candlesticks, because looking at the Russell 2000 on the weekly candlesticks, the RVI is actually sitting at the midpoint"
2021-04-17 10:30:40,stocks,"You will continue to see a divergence in Dow, SPY and Nasdaq and that divergence is getting bigger. At least for some time. 
Nasdaq day chart clearly shows a double top 14,050 levels. 

S&P VIX has dropped around 16% which is unusual just before earnings week. A $40M Bull Call Spread went up for the VIX. It's the biggest bet on VIX futures since who knows. Someone is betting the VIX to double by June."
2021-04-17 10:40:07,stocks,"You don't have to look far to find plenty of examples of bullish behaviors following a double top, October 2019 being a prime example of such.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"$wish - crazy undervalued or am I missing something? Recently market has been dog shit for small cap growth stocks. Jmia, wish, fubo and etc to name a few have been selling off non stop.

Wish is trading at $12.50. last year they generated 2.5b in revenue. they have 2b cash on hand and no debt. current market cap is 8b, and analyst expect revenue to be around 3b this year. when you subtract cash on hand to market cap, the business is currently valued at 6b.

the company is growing and has no debt, so it looks extremely undervalued at current level. I don't own shares, but am I missing something about this company because they are trading 2X next year price/sales much more cheaper than competition.

What do you guys think? so far I'm leaning toward opening a position on Monday.

When I reached out after the first two arrived and then weeks later nothing else, I was told to give them more time to arrive... I had written them off after 2 months, the pleasant surprise was receiving anything at all.

I started buying at debut, paused, and I am back at it."
2021-04-17 14:31:06,stocks,"Wish is well known in the hobby community for being a mystery package kind of thing. You order what you think you will get and hope its similar or that it arrives at all.

Once burned, most people never use it again or maybe once or twice just for laughs. With disposable income being tight for the demographic that wish targets, I cant see them growing much once word gets around to everyone else.

Why risk throwing away your money  when you could just buy it straight off ebay or aliexpress and have a much better chance of getting exactly what you ordered."
2021-04-17 12:42:54,stocks,"Crazy undervalued. Trading at 3 times 2020 price to sales. Even if they only do 3B revenues in 2021 compared to 2020 the valuation should be at least 15B. The last private valuation for this company prior to IPO was at 11B. Amazon also tried to buy the company in 2017. CEO is a former Google engineer and Peter Theil is an early investor in the company. I think Wish sells garbage but the numbers speak for themselves and I jumped in with an initial position after hours Friday. Currently less than 7.7B valuation. 

I would not go heavy in this company due to major issues in quality of products, customer service, and the impending logistics issues that stifled revenues over the last year during the pandemic. It is my smallest position and it will remain that way unless the next earnings release is something to be excited about."

The poor quality of products doesn't bother me, as if you pay $1 for something that supposed to cost $10,then expectations should be low.

NY Times had an article this week about Wish setting up local pick up points to address the shipping wait times and issues they have. This is a positive for me, as cheap shipping and speed is important in e-commerce"

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"How to zoom out without missing important news? Feeling seriously depressed and stupid. Hi guys, like many of you, I started investing in the beginning of Feb. It's been a real struggle ever since, and seeing every day how other people make lots of money while I'm sitting on my (mostly) losses makes me feel like an incredible failure. 

*Just for the record: I don't own PLUG, ENPH etc., I'm being dragged down by stuff like DOCU and SPOT, and some European stocks which go down for seemingly no reason at all. Re-balancing didn't seem like a good option because I didn't want to sell e.g. SPOT at a loss to chase a gain which may never come.* 

I tried to just stay away from the news, but then I don't learn anything. And then everybody suddenly starts asking me why I didn't just buy dog$shit coin. Or even worse, people tell me about their 2020 gains and how loosing 20% is, like, nothing because they're still up 150%. 

How do you deal with all of this? It's not even loosing money as such that bothers me, it's the feeling of being a complete failure. Is this something that goes away over time? Did you find methods to retain some inner peace and confidence, or did you have that kind of personality to begin with? 

I'm really looking for some advice."
2021-04-17 07:40:35,stocks,"Don't be sad. For everyone who posts profits, there are hundreds who lost plenty of money.
Think about it. How inclined would you be to post your losses everyday but if you suddenly were up 5K youd probably just post about the 5K gain. Your not seeing the big picture. Just keep at it with small amounts and one day you'll be profitable so they say."
2021-04-17 10:05:42,stocks,"Not everyone is cut our for individual stock picking. And that's ok. This is why passive ETFs exist and thrive. Most people end up not beating a broad market index long term because at the core, emotions get in the way. The emotions you describe are what you said are getting you down, more than the loss of money. The psychological aspect of trading is something few mention but is at the core of most trades. 

While you are learning about stocks and doing research, put the majority of your money or future money in a broad market index. Something like VTI or VT if you want to include the whole world . 80% of your money goes in these, and every month contribute some more to it. The other 20% of your money can be for your more speculative plays. These speculative stocks though go up or down. Tuning out other people's chatter is something you'll have to do no matter what in life. There's always someone bragging about a new car, new job, new house, etc in real life and the echo chamber of subreddits is no different. Gain porn and loss porn is a thing and some people just love watching it but at the core, they are bets and gambles. Things based on feelings or because someone else did it, or because they think it's a part of an overall movement. Whatever it is, it's not logical and that's why they are speculative. If ppl are asking why you didn't invest in dogcoin, shrug your shoulders and say you didn't want to. If they tell you how much they gained and how you missed out, nod and say good for you. 

There's always gonna be another bus. Always. You may not have got on the GME bus or the dogcoin bus or the next yolo bus....but there's gonna be more busses. There will be more opportunities. Something people forget is that DFV actually did years long research and didn't just yolo because of nothing. He had conviction and had studied this stock in and out and was mocked incessantly in wsb by the same ppl what now worship him as their lord and saviour.

Put 80% in an ETF and sleep a little easier. Don't let others live rent free in your head--dont worry about their money. Focus on yourself and your own."

I was lucky enough to start investing about March / April last year. I'm probably down about 10 or 15% from the high I got but still way ahead because of when I entered the market.  Getting in february this year, that's right about when we had that tech correction and stuff.

I won't pretend like I understand a lot of it. I can look at the major indices and they are all up, green. I can look at my portfolio, and most of it's red. I look at my watch list, and most of its red.  So I'm with you, obviously there's something that I'm missing, but I also know that I'm in this for the Long haul. The stocks that I bought March and April of last year, I still have them. I'm to the point now where they are all long-term capital games.  Most of what I'm invested in, I figure it's a at least one year investment, possibly two or three.  I don't expect the losses I'm incurring today to still be there when I'm ready to sell these."

I too, got in in February, first time ever buying a stock outside of retirement accounts and mutual funds. Immediately lost a lot of money, but I took it as a learning experience. In the weeks that have passed, I have made sure to be more deliberate in my stock and ETF picks. Some have worked out, others haven't. For example, I had to cut losses on HITIF after they had a great earnings report but the stock continued to drop. I couldn't explain it, but I sold at a loss and am glad I did, because it continues to drop. In another example, I made a stupid mistake in setting a trailing stop loss at a level lower than where I entered. When it triggered, I thought I had made a profit, but in fact, I lost about $24. Not bad, but not great, either. Still, a good learning experience.

I'm still down about 10%, but my more recent picks are working out better. Weed and green energy ETFs are dragging down my portfolio right now, but I'll just hold on to them. I have found it helpful to keep a journal of my investments. Writing down strategies and reasons for stock picks helps me be more rational in my decisions than emotional. It also helps in keeping a record for me to refer back to when those emotions start to take over again.

I hope this helps."

My goodness, I know people who have been doing this for 10 years and still aren’t successful. You bought into the hype and thought you could get into stocks and instantly start making money. If it were that easy everyone would be rich. Stop looking for self worth in the fucking stock market. Wake up in the morning and decide to be happy. Tell yourself self worth isn’t in the fucking shitty stock market. It won’t be easy but make the damn decision and enjoy life."

Being a successful investor, long term, requires more work than most people are willing to commit to. You’re really better off buying ETF’s that track the major indicies and forgetting about them. 

If you really want to speculate then have a separate small account that you can use to gamble on stonks. When they have big swings you’ll make better decisions because it’s a small percentage of your portfolio and you’re less likely to make an emotional decision."
2021-04-17 10:43:36,stocks,"People don't usually talk about their losses. Except on WSB, where loss porn basically is a form of group therapy. Plenty of people are in your situation. A bunch of my stocks are real dogs right now, though I'm still at an overall profit. Amazing how a drought in Taiwan can have such far reaching consequences. The smartest thing I've done recently was buy NEE 80c 5/21 when they were cheap. The dumbest thing I've done recently was wait too long to buy really good puts on PLUG, because I kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet or something... I don't even know. Both of these were based off of good DD from here: https://theyeet.substack.com/ 

If you have a strategy developed, you can check how it's working or even submit your portfolio to the ""rate my portfolio"" on here. But remember, ""I thought this was a Wendy's casino"" is only funny as a meme because it contains a big grain of truth- this stuff is risky and not for everyone, and the whales can afford to get into stuff (like close to the money options) and buy extra help ($24,000 a year for a Bloomberg terminal would sound a lot better if I was investing 100x that amount) that exists outside of my price range.

One more thing- I was reading some good DD from a billionaire VC, and then I read his comment history. Good God, that guy certainly knows his area of expertise, but his wrongness on other things is painful to read. It made me uncomfortable and I realized it was because I had been comparing myself to him and subconsciously figured out he was not who I wanted to be. I don't need 7 homes, I don't want to use ""winter"" as a verb, and I don't want to have to call the cops because a poor maid stole a family heirloom. I'm sure that guy is helping exciting and innovative new cybersecurity companies make a difference in the world, but that life is not for me. I'd like to make money to supplement my income because life sciences research doesn't pay spectacularly, but there's value in other things beyond money from trading. In fact, I wouldn't even call trading ""making money"", because it's not like it's an invention or social contribution that adds economic value. It's more like ""taking money"", which I am totally into... but let's call it what it is. 

If you start comparing yourself to others on the basis of ""taking money"", you are now in competition with people who are willing to use unscrupulous means and a huge wealth advantage to make spectacular gains and losses (looking at you, investment banks dumb enough to do business with Archegos.) I don't know what you do with your life, but even if all your stocks go to 0 you'll never be as much as a failure as anyone who was happy to make money off selling synthetic CDOs knowing what a pile of shit they were.

I had a little exposure into doge but it was less than 1% of my portfolio. It’s very easy for other people to say why didn’t you do this or that after the fact but you can only do what you know at the time. People online are only posting extreme losses or gains you’re not seeing a true representation of how well people are doing.

So are you investing or trading? If you’re investing you’ve only been doing it for 3 months so I don’t know why you’re beating yourself up. Here’s the thing, right now we are still in a bull market so the people that don’t know what they are doing and just follow the crowd thinking they are investing by putting most of their portfolio onto on stonk and diamond hands  congrats we made money yay. 

Those people will jump ship and eventually loose interest in investing during a slowdown like if we get inflation based factors creeping in. Also many of those people have no idea what to do with the money they made and will waste it in some type of way. Look at a community such as wall street bets. A very small handful of the people involved actually demonstrate a deeper understanding of markets while the vast majority are dumbasses posting memes. If they do gain they will eventually make a market mistake and loose it over greed or take the money out and buy something that depreciates like a car. 

I think the point is that you’re learning from these early losses and in the end you’re going to be a stronger investor. This is a long time experience and not one that you become an expert in within a few months and suddenly become a millionaire. 

I loose sometimes, I bought CHPT at the ipo thinking the fundamentals were good and they had an established EV network in north america. Turns out people hate SPACs and I was in the red for a long while until Uncle Biden announced the infrastructure plan, I was able to sell at a small gain thankfully before  it dropped again."

2021-04-17 11:58:35,stocks,"I am with you. Started in mid-Feb, lost 15%+ of the sizable portion I put in. It hurts.

If you're looking for advice, here's what I've done:

\- Tried to learn what I did wrong. Honestly, I (and possibly you) bought at the top after a massive bullrun in 2020. I didn't know what any of that meant in mid-Feb but I do now. Now, when I buy stocks, I have a much better sense of stock valuation so I think I'm buying stocks when they're good deals rather than inflated at ATHs.

\- Chalked it up to education. Honestly, the losses hurt a lot. I wish I'd invested a lot less to start off with, I wish I'd bought VTI at 200 it was at a month ago, etc. But it's the price of education. I'm trying not to let it beat me. I even created a second account where I put different money in (smaller amounts) and I've made much better decisions with it. Helped me get some confidence back and keep going.

\- Cut some losses. I think \*most\* of my investments will be ok long run. The only one I have doubt about is NIO, which I didn't even like in the first place but got pulled into hype. So I'm loathe to take a loss but I'm genuinely scared it's too inflated with limited future and it's stressing me so I'm selling some at a loss. It sucks, but it helps me feel/sleep better. I tell myself in a few years (or 30 when I retire) that it'll be worth the learning pain and I'll have a higher net return than if I hadn't been investing at all.

Hope that helps! I'm feeling the pain too. Better luck and growth to you."

Here's a good non-stock comparison of what typically goes on with these gain-porn posts:
My friend lives in Vegas and is known as the video poker guru. Anytime I come out to visit him, he brags about hitting 3-5 royal flushes the previous year and knows the trick of the game. Now a royal flush is the top prize of video poker and averages between $5k-$10k payout when hit. Sounds incredible at the surface, right?

He also has a diamond membership to the casino chains and gets cool perks like skipping nightclub lines and discount rooms, etc. I looked once into the details of eligibility for the diamond card, and to my suprise you need to spend upwards of $50k gambling at their casinos. He has 2 different cards, but for simple math lets say he spends exactly the threshold of $50k in a given year and hit the max payout range of $10k five different times that year. He only broke even that year... before taxes and before the enticement of diamond perks to use and spend even more money at the hotel, nightclubs, etc.

He would never tell me but he is losing a MASSIVE amount of money gambling each year, but to everyone on the outside he is a guru living the high life raking in the dough.

Moral of the story... there's ALWAYS more to the single stock win or a lucky month in the market. Stay diciplined with your own strategy and don't let FOMO posts online put your investments on a detour route."

2021-04-17 15:36:12,stocks,""" There are two general approaches to investing: active and passive.  Active investing implies you are actively buying and selling stocks,  bonds, options and so on, conducting research and making active  decisions about the investments you make. Passive investing implies you  are more disconnected from the market, passively investing money into  mutual funds, ETFs, IRAs, 401Ks and allowing the managers of those funds  to manage those investments, not focusing on individual stocks, or you  may have hired a financial advisor or wealth manager. 

&#x200B;

Neither approach  will make you rich quickly. Using active approaches you are very likely  to lose money as a beginner. Active investing takes a large amount of  work and research and most people will not beat the market's returns  over the long term. If you are brand new, it's best to start with  passive approaches while you get your feet wet and learn about more  active strategies, and gradually work towards becoming more and more  active.""

Everyone loses sometimes and there is no shame in it. You got to learn from the mistake and use that to move towards the next trade.

If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Listen with a grain of salt- again, EVERYONE has an agenda, and it's usually regarding making money. 

Be gentle on yourself and keep learning. Turn off the news. Read and take pointers from known investors... and find the 'pointers' that contradict each other just to see both sides of the idea and which one works best for you in different situations. Ask ""why"" at every turn AND THEN FIND THE REASON. 

Personally, I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm not sure I ever will lol but I will never put 100% faith in the media or Reddit again. Love love my fellow apes, but as always, we all have our own agendas. I feel stronger learning and waiting to invest until I feel I put in the time."

2021-04-17 09:24:17,stocks,"The ""March madness"" was known to happen since January, in theory before that but at that time it could have gone either way. But no one knew when exactly it'll start.

Reading your comments I'll give you this advice: get out of penny stocks asap. You belong to the targeted group of people that want to promote a stock and get out asap after a profit, leaving you in there on a negative. This can be a pump and dump or you simply missing the move - or if you came from GME, then screaming ""hold the line"" while there never was a line. Jokes aside I think you get my point.

First of all you would need an indepth analysis of those companies since they exist or had possible name changes, what people changed in leading positions and where the fuzz came from and what changed. If you have no clear answer as to why you should continue (and no, saying it's at -70% so who cares is not a clear answer) then get out, take what you still have and go for something else. The market is already recovering for I think 1-2 or 2-3 weeks, so if you didn't get major jumps upwards your stock is most likely dropped.

Next, where to go from here? I recommend leveraging ETFs. Either something like S&P 500, ARK or a share that is considered a boomer share. First educate yourself throughout what leveraging is, the risk, the cost, the difference of leveraged ETFs and leveraging ETFs and take these as a safe approach (well, as safe as the market can be) to build up a decent position and feed from that. Just being in the market and the top economical holder is usually a guarantee to grow, but it's slow. So leveraging amplifies that but comes with risks.

I have a main account I invest into options, but after 3 years that was too much for me and I needed some rest, so I went into pennystocks. I kept nearly all of my money in that account but put 5k into one for pennystocks. Overall I'm happy but the gambling aspect feels even worse than with options, so I decided to put 2.7k I had open from that account into a CFD account of the same broker and bought ARK ETF worth $16k. Not the safest purchase but definitely one that can pay off way more than regular economical ETFs and if it goes wrong I lose only 2.7k, if it goes well it will have 16k as a baseline to profit on and not only 2.7k."

VTI is basically the entire stock market, so yea the entire stock market is at it’s all time high...and will continue climbing as long as the global economy keeps operating.

This isn’t a get rich quick scheme or WSB pump and dump, it’s a reliable way to save money and earn roughly 6-7% year over year average through your entire life.

$150 per week, compounded at 6.5% over 30 years is $653,000.  However $150 per week for 30 years is only $234,000.  Slowly save $234k but it can be $653k.

Extend it for 35 years you get compounded $939,000.  That’s a nice million for retirement if you start at 25 years old and stop at 60.

If you’re young and can save $150 for 40 years, it’s a staggering 1.33 million. 

And all this assumes you only contribute $150 weekly.  As you advance in your career, you may be able to afford $200 or $300 or even $400 per week.

$400 compounded at 6.5% for 40 years is a whopping 3.5 million."

I have also ABNB at a similar price. At this time its down to 178.69, which makes your investment a 2,9% loss. That is literally every day noise in the stock market.

However, I know that feeling when we make an action, we want immediate feedback. We want validation. We look for that feeling of: I did my DD, now I deserve a reward. It's this process that releases the dopamin in our brain before even buying the stock, just the expectation of reward is enough. It's basically the same mechanism in your brain as gambling.

When stocks turn green after you bought them, that's immediate validation. Now you want even more, since it worked last time, it will this time, right? That behaviour is quite common and creates a failed breakout that ultimately can lead to a correction. You can be assured, the way stocks traveled over the past months is some strong evidence that there is a significant amount of traders behaving just like you did. And always did, if you look back in time.

Stock market can be really tough to handle. It's an 8 hour a day 5 days a week open Casino with our bets on the Roulette wheel that we can carry on a phone in our pocket constantly around us. It is ideal to make us go crazy. I recommened to have some limits to when you check the stock market instead of starring at candles for no benefit.

What helped me was it what most people here wrote, making a plan. Make a plan how long you are willing to hold a stock, can you carry the risk of price drops. A plan can also be not to buy a stock. The result should be that no matter what happens, you are prepared for this. If something suprises you too much, your plan was probably too narrow.

An example of mine is, I bought Microsoft about 7 months ago. It was almost all the time crampling lower than my buy in level. But my conviction is: MSFT is too big too fail, too many people have interest in this stock, it's as essential as the air we breath. ETFs need this stock to move or they wont move either. No brainer for me. So I am highly convinced it will move higher over time, it may take up to a year for that to happen, but ultimately it will. All I can do is wait for that to happen. And I had to wait for almost 8 months now to see some significant upside. However, during the horizontal period nobody talked much about MSFT. People I told about it were like, urgh, maybe that wasnt a good pick after all ...

Another example is NVidia, that also traveled sideways for 8 months with their overpriced GPUs being sold out everywhere. Short term playing stocks is really trick and I would not recommened it.

Also, don't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to how you acted before. Improve yourself. There is no point to compare with some long term investors with different strategies, mindsets and experiences.

Back to ABNB: They are my late reopening play. I bought them at a similar price point as you did, but only as a small position. I think they are gonna have an insane year with the reopening. I cant even remember the alternative website, so competition is quite low. Their numbers got crushed due to covid, huge upside potential. Landlords already charging huge premiums with increasing demand. People will travel while Covid is not out of this world so they might be looking for something more private than a hotel. However, it's valued at over 100B, so it is already at high valuation levels. I keep my position small. If it drops, I will average down. Although it has shown some significant support at around 174$ among all this correctionw wave, so I dont consider that too likely. What I think is we will see some consolidation over the next couple months, until we see some uptrend towards September/October when Wallstreet realizes everythings booked out at astronomical prices."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Moving Investments Into a Roth IRA Hello all I've essentially come to the realization that I should switch my account to a Roth IRA. I know that you can simply flip a switch and make the change and that it will require me to sell my stocks and then use the proceeds to fund the roth. As of now if I cashed out my Schwab account it would find about 4 years of IRA contributions.

When I started my schwab accounts I didn't know about different accounts and I initially started it to use money from a CD to buy an ETF I can't name in 2017 ish. I guess my questions are should I seek to buy the stocks that I sell from one account in my IRA? Should I focus more on switching to ETF's? Looking at ARKF, VOO, VTI and maybe XLE.

The account that I will be selling positions out of to fund the IRA is heavy  on ETF I can't mention, followed by mostly energy stocks with good dividends (OKE, RDS-B, BP, EPD, USAC, KMI, ENB), then I have some DOW, EXPI (purchased at $8), KO.

Lastly as far as additional information I am 28 years old, working steadily in a job that will provide me with a pension when I retire. I have a mortgage that I owe less than 100k on and live within my means. Thanks in advance for your help or suggestions."
2021-04-17 12:11:56,stocks,"Also set up my ROTH ira last week! It is unbelievable how few of my coworkers have/or thinking about Roth ira. Most just have 401k and think that is enough to retire on. I'm working on convincing some of the millenials and genx's on my work to set it up without sounding like a man yelling on clouds. 

Watch out for ETFs with high expense ratio. ARKs expense ratio is at 0.7% and most Vanguards are at 0.03%. With compounding interest, after 20-30 years that's a lot of money lost on fees.

I have ARKF myself, but keep it at a small %.

So all in all I now have 401k with bias towards SP 500. a brokerage account that I made before discovering the wonders of roth ira with the trusty companies + some etfs + small meme stocks. And a Roth IRA which will eventually be composed of 70% VTI + 30% VGT/QQQ/solid company stocks."
2021-04-17 08:20:11,stocks,"I love when young people discover Roth.


I would sell whatever causes you less tax pain in your brokerage account to fund the IRA.

Due to the deadline push back for tax filing the contribution this year has been pushed back to May 17th, I think. So you could contribute $6k to IRA 2020 (by May 17th) and a separate $6k to IRA 2021 to jump start your tax free investments.

If you have a 401k (401k Roth) option at your company I would also invest in that, even if you are only limited in certain investments. I think they allow you max of $19.5k this year. After you leave a firm you can convert that entire amount into an IRA Roth. My biggest regret was not understanding this. I had a 401k that sat for 15 years after leaving the firm without converting to IRA Roth. Kicking myself missing out on being able to invest in stocks tax free. I just converted last year after the meltdown and despite having to pay the highest tax bracket for the conversion, I've already made it back through investment gains and now all future earnings will be tax free. That's 20+ more years.

At your age I would probably hold ETFs and 1 or 2 growth stocks. In 20 years you'll have a big pot to allocate risk dabbling in options...a tax free account means no worries about wash rules, freedom to buy/sell without concern for taxes...

Good luck!"

I understand it wouldn't be very diverse at first doing this but I'm not risk adverse.

Always match your employer's contribution 1st but the problem with a 401k is high fee mutual funds.

If you qualified for the roth last year, you should be able to contribute until that date.  Furthermore, since a roth doesn't impact anything in tax return, you won't have to do anything on your already filed taxes.  If you did a traditional contribution, then you'd have to amend your 2020 taxes (not a huge deal to amend).

Either way, if I'm able to, I'm contributing to max out last year if I can.

EDIT::::. Google confirmed this second info is not accurate.  Contributions must be cash or check.

For example, Apple pays a yearly dividend of $2.65 per share and each share is worth around $140 a share.

Assuming you buy 1,000 shares = $140,000 

You’re yearly dividend will only be = $2,650 ( $2.65 x 1,000)

The return on investment seems extremely low for such a huge investment, obviously this doesn’t take into consideration if Apple stock goes up, but this is irrelevant since as dividend investors you’re not looking to sell the shares anyway.

Why wouldn’t someone choose to invest the $140,000 into properties for rent that generates the same amount in a matter of months?"

1) Dividends are the only way money actually moves from the company to investors, collectively.

Side note, stock buybacks are equivalent to dividends in this case, plus or minus tax issues, but dividends are treated like a promise to the shareholders and buybacks are not.

A fancy way of saying what we colloquially call “Value Stocks.” There is some association with company quality although dividends can be a double edged sword on managers to continue to increase them.

What matters most is how companies are using their free cash flows and growing the business. Dividend investors get excited that excess dividends can be reinvested back into the business and you get a compounding effect. Taxes aside there’s really no difference from a company that uses that free cash flow to fund growth. 

As a very weak rule of thumb dividend stocks will likely hold up better in a world of rising interest rates just because their future cash flows are likely less discounted.

Dividend stocks are also less volatile and have high yields which is perfect for people who might only have few decades left. You might say that dividend aristocrats are low growing or even have declining share price but it doesn't matter as you are not looking to sell them. So for example, if you are in your 30s it would make no sense to invest in IBM even thought it has high dividend payouts. However, if you are in your 50s IBM is not a bad deal. You probably have many shares at that point in your life and you get high payments. Sure share price is falling but it doesn't matter. You are not looking to sell.

2021-04-17 10:14:00,stocks,"You can divide the stock market into 2 types of companies. Those growing and those that are mature. 

Growing companies put their profits into well growing. 

Mature companies are already pretty much maxed out and their profits go back to the shareholders as dividends while maintaining enough retained profits to make sure the company is relevant and maintains it's profitability.

Yes there are mixtures of this. One example is stocks like  Chevron or Unilever or Tyson Foods. There is only so much growth they can do. They are stable products during times of recession so they don't really drop but when times are good they don't really grow. So they need to pay dividends to maintain value as an investment.

Then you have companies that are not money machines but their future profit is great (tesla as an example) to make investor money they have to grow the stock.


Then you got the ones that are hybrid that don't follow the rules and that is apple. Apple pays good dividends cause it's a cash machine. But it isn't a dividend stock (you don't buy apple to live off the dividends) apple reinvests it's money to innovate. It's a tech company so if it doesn't find something new it will die.

Then you have REITs. They have to give a certain percentage of their profits as dividends to maintain their tax status (I think it's 90 percent but couldn't be 80) these are the kind I invest in for dividends. I try to have enough that each dividend buys another share. When I'm older I can transition to living off that income."
2021-04-17 10:23:49,stocks,"I am pretty sure AAPL pays a $0.82 dividend per year and is not really the best dividend stock to look at for an example. A company like Pfizer is a solid dividend paying stock since it has a yearly dividend of $1.56 per share which come out to about a 4% dividend yield (yearly dividend/market price). The dividend yield is what you want to look for in a high dividend paying stock. 

The benefits of dividend investing is the income that it pays out each quarter that can be treated as passive income. This strategy is not best for a younger retail investor since high yield dividend stocks tend to be fairly stable and do not have much room for price growth. Dividend investing is best when you have a larger amount of $ and are fine will less potential capital gains growth. 

It is possible you can find a good dividend paying stock at a time where it can appreciate in value along with paying the quarterly dividend. This strategy is not normal though and typically is going to only come into play when there is a large market dip like we saw last year with the news of Covid.

When you are looking to grow your money, growth stocks (as the name implies) are the way to go.

But if XYZ grew their dividend over time, let's say 10 years from now they're still paying 2% but now the share price is $100. 

By this point you'd be getting $2 year for each of the shares you bough. You bought them at $10 though. So on those shares that's like a 20% return. And if you reinvest you get the compounding effect. 

It's almost like your money compounds twice with dividend growth investing because your $ compounds and the dividend rate itself compounds.

Imagine how much dividend income you'd be receiving every quarter if you bought $10,000 worth of Microsoft shares and reinvested all the dividends for the past 20 years."

In a bull market you're right, dividend stocks make no sense. In a flat or downtrending market they help minimize risk and maintain capital.

On top of that though, dividend is starting to become less relevant with the growth of tech. Paying out dividends makes a lot of sense for a company that doesn't need to innovate, something like a Coca Cola for example. On the other hand, for the ever increasing amount of tech stocks innovating and investing in R&D is crucial if they want to remain relevant, and there's almost always a better way of spending your cash than paying out dividend.

Actual dividend stocks like REITs are different. I own a fair bit of DLR (a data center REIT) because it has a decent dividend at 3.5% but it also has potential growth in the future. Other people buy dividend stocks like O or VZ because there is less price volatility while still locking in a better annual return than a bank.

However, I would recommend everyone take time to find solid dividend paying companies. One of my favorites is BGS. The company has a $1.90 dividend and back in March of 2020 it dropped to around $10 a share for around 3 days.

2021-04-17 16:35:23,stocks,"seems like im seeing some confusion in the popular answers. dividends actually have a worse compounding effect when compared to non-dividend paying companies. briefly said, with a div paying stock, you get paid quarterly (although that frequency can vary), which you then have the option to reinvest. even if ignoring the tax implications of gaining that income, when compared to a non-div paying stock, your compounding growth is less simply because the company that does not pay a dividend does not have to wait to re-invest its earnings into new projects/expanding product lines/acquiring smaller companies. etc. so in effect, they are increasing their share appreciation with no time lag; whereas when you are waiting to get a dividend in 2 months time, you only then can benefit from that compounding effect. (in a perfectly efficient world, a dividend that is being paid has no net impact on the value of the company (so when you automatically have your div reinvested, in theory, the stock price will decline a bit but you will also immediately be buying more shares, thus ending with the same position size))

&#x200B;

so, to answer your question, historically speaking, higher dividend paying companies actually outperform non dividend paying companies (and lower div paying stocks). it can argued as to why that is, i personally would say it is mostly a reflection that dividend paying companies tend to be better established in the market and are just simply more successful operations, but of course that implies they have less growth potential. 

&#x200B;

you also seemed to ask about different asset classes. it is true that you can simply just target high income generating assets to achieve a higher annual income flow, but it should also be noted the risk/reward, expected return, and risk of correlation of concentrating your portfolio in specific areas to earn that higher rate of income. example: real estate does typically pay a higher dividend and even has lower volatility than equities, but it also has a lower expected total return over time, and you are not able to diversify as well as with say different stock sectors."

Stocks are also incredibly fungible, and property is not. Apple is also less risky than most properties. So Apple stock has liquidity, and is less risky than property ownership. Because of this you are getting a risk premium for owning property.

I think that what is happening is that you're seeing a different payout structure, not recognizing the downsides and risks to property ownership, and drawing some false conclusions.

And really it's not a good comparison in the first place, as Apple's value is largely based on growth, not dividend payments. A much better comparison would be between REITs and property ownership"
2021-04-17 17:40:21,stocks,"If you are reinvesting your dividends in order to see appreciation of value in a company:

1. The company distributes the dividend
2. The company shrinks in value by the amount that was paid out for the dividend
3. You take what you received and buy from the company what it shrunk by

If you are living off the dividend:

1. The company distributes the dividend
2. The company shrinks in value by the amount that was paid out for the dividend
3. You buy food, housing, vacation with what you received form the dividend.

If you are holding a non-dividend paying company, then the company just grows, and doesn't shrink in value.

If you are living off of selling the stock:

1. You sell whatever you need.
2. You buy food, housing, vacation with what you received form the sale.

In both cases of holding for appreciation in value, it's the same result... except with more steps with the dividends since you need to re-buy in order to recapture the value that the company shed in order to pay.

In both cases of living off of the proceeds, the value you are holding is shrinking.

There is often a misconception that the dividend is ""bonus"" money as compared to a stock that do not distribute dividends with new investors.

The most important thing you want is total return. If you expect stock X to make you 8% more wealthy over some timeframe through appreciation and dividends, and stock Y to make you 12% more wealthy through pure appreciation. Then go with stock Y."

2021-04-17 19:59:07,stocks,"dividends are important because: 

(a) calculating the value of future dividends is one of the major ways to estimate fair value a stock, with the 'discount cash-flow' model. professor Robert Shiller of Yale takes the position that dividends are the primary reasons to invest in stocks, otherwise it's verging on 'greater fool theory'. don't have a link on this, he's discussed it in one of his open-course videos. 

(b) there is a ton of academic research data showing dividend stocks tend to outperform. this is partly because dividend paying stocks skew towards value rather than growth, and value stocks tend to outperform over long periods. 

the sweet spot appears to be companies with high dividend yields, but low payout ratios ... they pay out a high dividend (as a ratio of share price), but they're not paying out most of the profits as dividends. from a 2006 study:

>We tested companies within the S&P 1500 and found that investors should look for companies with a high yield and low payout ratio for their portfolios. The high dividend yield and low pay out ratio basket of stocks had the best performance in our backtest since 1990. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=946448

the firm Tweedy Browne compiled a lot of this type of research 

http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf

>Why wouldn’t someone choose to invest the $140,000 into properties for rent that generates the same amount in a matter of months?

I've known several mom and pop landlords, so let's break this down: the typical property rent, nationwide, is about 1% of the fair market value per month. it can vary from city to city, but 1% is about right. that's gross, before taxes, repairs, vacancies, legal costs, etc. so if you had a rental property that cost $140,000 it would generate abut $1,400 per month in rent or $14,000 per year. the average rental property is vacant about 5% of the time, so let's round down to  $13,500. that's a ~9% return *gross*. but assume property taxes are going to be say $2,000 per year, insurance is another $800 or so, and repairs are going to be an average of 2% of the fair market value per year so that's $2,800. gross $13,500 minus all those expenses equals $7,900. so that's a 5.6% return on investment. 

and that's for a property with no mortgage. if you have a mortgage on the property, the ROI is even smaller, because the interest you pay on the loan eats into profits. plus, there's the hassle factor. mutual funds don't call in the middle of the night because the toile is overflowing, and you never have to evict a dividend stock for not paying the rent. 

a lot of landlord wealth comes from appreciation in dirt value, not rent."

There are various ways to estimate the stock price of a company. However, let’s use the dividend discount model as our valuation basis. Following this model, the stock price is the sum of all of it’s future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value.

When a company has positive free cash flow, it has multiple options. Two of these are investing in new projects and paying out dividends. Let’s look at both.

Investing in new projects can deliver value to shareholders in the future. When a company does not have a way to create value in the future with this cash, it is better to be paid to the shareholders (as they own the company). 

You will see value stocks usually having a nice dividend, but “lackluster” growth compared to some other stocks, as they do not have many attractive growth opportunities as they are already in a very mature stage. Growth stocks on the other hand usually do not pay a dividend, and have many attractive investment opportunities which will deliver value to the shareholders in the future. (Value can be seen as free cash flows, which can then be paid as a dividend to the shareholders).

Therefore, when a company has a high dividend, it usually lacks growth, and the other way around."

On the flip side, my uncle have several rentals. Yes,  he had 2 shitty tenants who used the pandemic as an excuse to not pay. Yes, he dealt with bad tenants over the years. But overall, he's made bank and this is in one of the most tenant friendly city in the US (nyc). 

He was actually set to close on a 2 family unit in April 2020,  tried to back out due to covid but can't since he put down a 80k deposit already. Thought it would be a disaster but the units are now rented for the past 5 month and all the tenants have been paying. Also the price of houses in nyc has actually gone up since covid after an initial dip in March to May.

Anyways, rentals are not for everyone."

2021-04-17 10:15:31,stocks,"If you’re investing for dividends for income you sorta should ignore the growth of the stocks.  The focus should be on achieving ~20% yield on cost in 10 or more years.  Meaning, yearly dividend growth is far more powerful than starting yield.

If you had bought apple 10 years ago, your yield on cost today would be about 20%, meaning that Apple has been an excellent pick for dividend investors.  Just because the share price has skyrocketed with it doesn’t make it worse, LOL.

People who want to invest in dividend stocks need to stop looking at current or starting yield.  Judge your success only on yield on cost."

Once travel got shut down over covid. A well established company no one though would stop paying anytime soon especially with the revenue they brought in.

5.9% is high compared to most out there, but companies that pay 8% or higher at some will most likely cut their dividend by some or completely as they are paying a larger portion of their profit to attract investors.

Main Street Capital has paid a dividend monthly for the last 5 years and has increased it as well. I only used them as an example of a stock with a cheaper price and pay more often. I have held their stock for over 2 years now and it is one of my best performers. If stocks are too risky, you can invest in ETFs. VYM, SCHD, VOO, SPY."

If a dividend is paid, say in Apple, and you reinvest it, you're buying shares from someone else (again in aggregate) and cashing them out. So it's like Cook saying he can't invest this chunk of $40 million and wants you to have it. Reinvesting it just tells Cook to pay out someone else, not you, you're staying in.

So basically, yes, you're figuring out who can compound it better, you or Apple. But unless you've got the votes to influence the dividend payout, Apple's ROIC is going to be whatever it'll be. You can't really influence that."

2021-04-17 10:00:44,stocks,"I understand your sentiment. But it is simply not true, because it would basically be an inifinite money glitch - you could really just buy a stock, receive dividends and then sell. But unsurprisingly, that does not work.

If your stock issues a dividend of 1%, the company might still grow by 10% next year. But share price would have grown by 11% if there had been no dividend, basically. (not 100% correct math here, but you get the idea) 

Issuing dividends does not mean that the stock does not grow, but it means that the stock will grow slower (check financial mathematics why that is - has to do with valuation). If you reinvest the dividend, you are back to square one as if there had never been a dividend - BUT: you would have had to pay taxes nonetheless. Therefore, dividends are mostly bad because of forced liquidation and taxation (depends on the tax system in your country ofc), no matter whether you actually needed the money and would have sold yourself anyway (if you reinvest the dividend, that obviously would not have been the case then)."

My grandma built up quite an estate in rental apartments starting in the early 60s, but to do that now would be quite challenging, I feel. Depending on the state you live in, evicting bad tenants can be next to impossible. We had to evict someone who was literally squatting in one of our apartments in CA Bay Area, took 6 months and legal fees. During that time they messed that apartment up real good.

2021-04-17 14:39:25,stocks,"Care to elaborate?
If anything, you're wasting more money on taxes with dividends. If you have $10,000 worth of a stock and you get to a $200 dividend, you'll have to pay tax when you get it, let's say $30. If you then reinvest your dividend back into the company, you're now reinvesting $170 dollars, so after all that, you now have $10,170 worth of that company's stock.

2021-04-17 10:07:01,stocks,"The approach I described is the rational way to value a business and is how it would be taught in university.  

Practically speaking, supply and demand determines share price. The factors affecting supply and demand are numerous, and many people certainly like receiving regular dividends. Many also like speculating and don’t bother valuing a business at all. But you can’t formulate an investment strategy around that. I think it’s better to focus on financial reality to the best of one’s ability than to try and predict supply and demand."

In the end, I much rather invest in a company with decent growth potential that also proved to be able to grow without a dividend (e.g. Amazon), rather than a company that offers a large dividend but actually stagnates or even decreased revenues (e.g. Coke - my god that stock is so bad actually)."

2021-04-17 10:15:57,stocks,"I agree with you.  Many people like receiving regular dividends, and that's actually more reliable than trying to figure out what a stock price will or won't do, right?

I mean, with a company like AMZN you're betting that it will go up, so you don't really want the dividend.  And the bet that it will go up is based on, of course, the fundamentals.

But with a company like PM you don't really care where the share price goes, you just want the dividend.  Trying to figure out the fair share price isn't really important as long as it's within a range which is reasonable... the main thing is still the dividend.

I think I'm understand this correctly?  At the end of the day it all comes down to preferences."

check the Royal Dutch Shell stock performance over the last years (and ignore the Corona development). The company continuously increased their profits, but stock price excluding dividends basically stayed flat - they only grew because of the dividends (check stock price including and excluding dividends).
Now, do you think the stock would have stayed basically flat if they did NOT offer a dividend even though they increased their profits? No, of course not - with rising profits, you would expect the stock price to grow to keep a relatively similar p/e ratio. But because of their dividends, that was not the case. Therefore, it really does not matter whether a company offers a dividend or not, the total return will stay very similar."

Dividends are only bad for a company when the company pays out TOO MUCH of their income as dividends, ie AT&T, RDS etc.

You're right that dividends take away from the balance sheet. Can't argue with fact. But to say that share price won't grow, or can't grow a lot while a company has a dividend is just not true, and I'm not sure why you are basing your argument on this."

2021-04-17 19:34:45,stocks,"You have absolutely no right to be condescending based on opinion. We can have a conversation or debate without being dicks to each other.

A company keeping money and not distributing it as dividends does not mean that the company will grow more because of that. Typically the decision would be made to offer dividends because the business thinks that the capital is worth more to shareholders than to the business. I'm sure that most people would rather have dividends than have the top executives receive more in compensation.

If the business has no way to utilize the capital that they have, it's better to give it to shareholders than to let it sit in an account and gain .1% in interest.

""A quick Google search"" could have answered this for you. 

Apple pays out about 3.4 billion in dividends to shareholders each quarter. To put this in to perspective, Apple has 200 billion IN CASH on hand. I don't think the 3.4 billion really makes a difference to them. They have an income of 64 billion and are probably unlikely to lose any traction because of having a dividend.

We are both right. For certain companies paying a dividend could be bad, but for many companies it makes more sense to pay a dividend than to hold more cash. T and many other companies (RDS included) probably should not be offering dividends now, and should be trying to grow their businesses instead.

Take a moment and understand that there are multiple sides here, and that while a few things you've mentioned are true, it is not nearly the whole story."

Thanks"
2021-04-17 04:58:01,stocks,">	Is it something to be expected every quarter and therefore is it a good idea to wait for ER dips to buy stocks ?

Nope, but you could backtest it yourself and find out exactly how often it happens."
2021-04-17 09:22:07,stocks,"It depends if the stock ran hard before earnings or traded sideways. I know this is a very vague description but it is the pattern I notice. If the stock is trading at a high valuation or has risen quite a bit since last earnings many are expecting really good things. It's rare for earnings to exceed ""perfection"" when it's expected. At this point profit taking occurs. It has nothing to do with the outlook being ""poor"" it's just people getting out and moving on. The first month after earnings can be flat a lot of times so traders move money to something else. 

I'll be watching for sell offs so I can get in on a couple new positions."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Buy LEAPS or buy underlying with x5 leverage (20% margin)? Edit: 5x leverage is a bad idea. I have been enlightened.

I see everyone praising LEAPS for long term profits over buying the underlying with leverage.

Maybe I'm missing somethint but from some quick math in this example, buying the underlying with margin is much more profitable. 

Current AMD price: $82

Dec 17 2020 82 strike premium for 1 call: $1220

If underlying goes to $110 the profit is roughly $1900 


Now if I were to invest this premium with x5 leverage:

$1220 * 5 = $6100

$6100 / 82 (current price) = 74 shares

Lets say the underlying goes to $110 like above.

74 shares * 110 = $8100

$8100 - 1220 = $6880 profit


So why are people investing in leaps instead of underlying with margin?"
2021-04-17 04:04:54,stocks,"If the stock drops 20% you lose 100% of your money. But when buying leaps, you don’t lose money until expiration date depending on the price and you can weather the volatility."
2021-04-17 04:23:57,stocks,!remind me 4months
2021-04-17 04:01:40,stocks,"1. Where can you get 5x leverage?
2. Options and stocks behave differently in different market situations. For example, buying ITM LEAPS is essentially like buying the shares with a protective put, and is less risky than owning the stock (of course, you pay the premium for that protection)."
2021-04-17 16:23:14,stocks,why not buy options on margin?
2021-04-17 04:17:53,stocks,"1. You don't buy ATM leaps, they're the most expensive relative to intrinsic value and ""real"" extrinsic value.
2. You pay interest on margin.
3. You become the broker's bitch. They have full control over the margin requirements, and they're fully within their right to raise margin requirements at their own discretion.
4. You can't ""hold"" past dips because you're forced out of your position.
5. Nothing stops you from getting leaps on margin lol

I could go on, but fundamentally you gotta remember that there's no free lunch. If the broker is willing to give you 5x the leverage, he probably has a reason that probably works against you. 

Also, your math is wrong. You're taking into account only intrinsic value, while often times extrinsic is the most profitable part of the process. If you buy that 82 AMD call today, and it goes up to 85, your option will not be $300 more expensive, it'll be more like 600-800 because of extrinsic."
2021-04-17 04:14:03,stocks,"Yeah, the risk is obviously higher on leverage but the rewards are also much higher. 

Lets take another example. SPY in the past 5 years never dropped more than 20% and it always rebound (except the covid drop in march). So, unless something major happens boomer stocks and etfs are pretty safe for investing with leverage?"

2021-04-17 04:07:37,stocks,"1. You can get 5x leverage from pretty much every broker in Europe.

2. I cant see how the ITM LEAPS are less risky when you factor in time decay and delta."
2021-04-17 04:25:30,stocks,"Thanks for the detailed answer. 

I just checked the fees for x5 leverage and it's around $3 / day for $1200. In 8 months thats $720 just in fees. Major downside, over half of your money gone just from fees.

Second downside, if the stock drops by 20% I lose all my money and cant hold, unless I add more cash, which increases the fees even more = broker fucks me even harder.

So, you're saying that for leaps the best approach is to buy OTM and profit from volatility and extrinsic value."
2021-04-17 04:34:11,stocks,"Also, indexes go up less than individual stocks so you can argue that a leap on a stock can make you more money than 15% X5 = 75% return on an index."
2021-04-17 04:30:10,stocks,"There is a flaw in your calculations, when you leverage X5, you only put down the 1220, you don’t own the rest of the 6100. So you end up with 8100-6100= $2000 in profit + $1220 of your initial capital which means ur left with $3220."
2021-04-17 05:36:20,stocks,"1. That's crazy. How many stocks get this ratio?
2. You pay theta every day, but if you buy LEAPS that is very little and you can just roll it out later. You do however get exposure to gamma, which reduces your exposure if the underlying drops and increases your exposure if it gains.
3. Also you can think what happens if you hold to expiration. As long as the stock remains above your strike, you will be exposed to the underlying, but if it drops below, you are shielded from the loss.
4. As mentioned, this is also equivalent to a protective put. It reduces risk, but you pay a premium for it. The deeper the LEAPS are ITM, the lower the strike and the deeper the premium."

I’m not saying RYCEY is a diamond in the rough, but 28% of their revenue is from defense. The company isn’t going anywhere the UK and German government will see to that.

My main conclusion seems to be to just keep to myself all my thoughts on anything related to money or stocks from now on, because that seem like such bullshit.

For clarity sake: I was up about 3-5% on apple after 6-8 months, and they told me, ""never a bad idea to take profits"" and I sold all my apple shares and now they are up a lot more obviously."
2021-04-17 03:52:16,stocks,I make it a rule not to talk about stocks with friends/family. They won’t understand the dips and flows of the market so will panic whether you’re up and down which will make you second guess yourself.

I am not from the US, so the stock market is not perceived as something ""normal or familiar"".

They have seen me make money... Yet, they don't trust me or the stock market, and they reject the idea of putting 100€/monthly in a brokerage account managed by me or something.

It reaches absurdity levels when they even KNOW (My dad, aunt and uncle have had bigger salaries) that I have more money that the 3 combined just because I began investing at 18. I didn't make particularly great decisions, but the stock market comes with financial awareness and discipline.

At the end of the day, I think I could retire before my uncle who is 55 and my aunt who is 50. But they say they ""don't trust"" the market or that ""they don't have that type of money"". Double lol."

It comes down to this - if they are correct, they get to say I told you so; if they are wrong, you are out the money and they shrug. You are now resentful and the dynamics of who’s assets are on the line are out of wack. Don’t discuss specifics with anyone, only generalizations. It doesn’t help you for anyone to know that you are up 40% in a month on a position (hypothetically), so keep everything vague and I’d even suggest you are only trading a paper account."

I play the slightly less conservative game. 

We had a bunch of ideas to bounce off each other during peak covid.

As far as sister, I discus less with her as she's less interested. 

As far as my wife, I give her a summary of my gambling results one per month. She liked it so much she asked me to out her whole personal savings in the market. I did, made it all ETF VOO... And haven't touched it in 6 months. She is out preforming me month after month. I should learn a lesson from this but I won't."
2021-04-17 10:40:32,stocks,"Sounds like this is your fault since you listened to somebody else and then BLAMED this person and not yourself. 

Never blame others. The reason many don’t discuss stocks with people like you is that when the stock is up, they are smart, if the stock is down, it’s YOUR fault for giving „bad advice“."
2021-04-17 02:16:05,stocks,"Opinions will differ, and people generally hold dearly to opinions they really thought about, stocks are like that: you think it through and come to a conclusion that you deem right, then you tell someone who doesn’t necessirly get the same inputs you have and they basically tell you that your opinion is wrong and so you do tell them they are wrong. You both end up getting offended.

It is like religion and politics, discovering that family members hold contradictory views usually end up like that. That is why people shouldn’t discuss these things unless they want a fight

So I would say no, don’t discuss money with family unless it really impact them personally what you do with your money."

so no.

as to your situation: just do you. and be happy with your returns. don´t get greedy, hava goal. and stick to it. and ignore the naysayers.   
also, always try to distinguish your trades between 

\- long term investing (buy, hold to have something in years)  
\- trading (buying in hopes to sell for profits within a short timeframe.

Any advisor that tells you he/she “knows” family offices should scare you away.  The same holds true for families of any size net worth.  

Every family is different.  Use good judgment, start conversations small, and don’t be too upset if they call you silly for learning about finance or ridicule you for making a mistake. Continue learning. Read. Talk. Post. Whatever, just learn. 

I was encouraging my parents to refi their mortgage a few months ago and my mom said, “I don’t do high finance.”   Okay, enjoy your 4.5% rate.  I can’t want it more than you do."

I'm vaguely aware that my parents may have some stocks (not sure how actively they are investing - I suspect not actively - and I don't know any specifics) and that other members of my immediate family invest in various things like stocks, funds, endowment plans, etc. But we don't discuss what we are investing in besides the very occasional ""oh, I have some shares of xxx"" if it happens to come up in conversation. They vaguely know that I started my foray into investing this year but I've never discussed what I'm investing in with them besides the broad generalities (i.e. that I'm mainly investing in blue chips and index tracking ETFs).

I've discussed stocks more with my colleagues than I have with family..."
2021-04-17 11:06:51,stocks,My dad works in the industry as well so that is pretty much all we talk about. Weekends are a bit boring of course then. Just find people who could even challenge your investment thesis a bit. That might improve your returns
2021-04-17 12:11:54,stocks,"I do discuss stocks with my family, they also said something along those lines. They're not invested in US markets though so most discussions are less in-depth, but I'm not putting money in my domestic market anyway because it's utter bullshit."

2021-04-17 13:01:10,stocks,"Mentioned it to my dad once and he had a similar suggestion, told me I should sell because I was up a few %. To me that totally defeats the purpose of investing, at what point do you draw the line? When you're up 1%? 0.1%? If you've invested in a meme stock that is up 50% in one day then fair enough, maybe best to sell and gtfo. But if you've made a wise investment in a strong performing stock (which Apple is) then there's absolutely no reason to sell unless you desperately need the money. 

It is probably wise to just not discuss it tbh, people automatically think you're well off if you tell them you have some investments, which might lead to some awkward situations and people begging for money."
2021-04-17 13:42:35,stocks,My old man and I discuss the market & stonks 2-3 times a week. I always look forward to our discussions. Kind of a bright spot in my day bouncing ideas off each other.

2021-04-17 02:34:00,stocks,"When they said ""never a bad idea to take profits"" did they tell you to sell 100%?  
Why not sell 10% ? Or 25 or even 50%?  
Often times people on Reddit ask ""Should I sell ABC stock?"" like they have to either sell 100% or nothing at all.  
This is the unique era of $0 commissions. No reason that anybody needs to sell 100% of their position.  It's never a bad thing to sell into a rally and take *some* profit.  I just had 1 stock that went up 33% YTD. Had 500 shares and sold 20% (100 shares.). If it continues to go up, I'll sell another 100 shares. Should it keep rising, I'll sell more. If it drops, I'll buy more. But there is no reason I would think I need to sell 100% all at once.  
""never a bad idea to take profits"" is actually very sound advice."

I expect no money from inheritance and won't plan for it either. 

If there financial issues past retirement where they can't make ends meet, then I can step in and help or my siblings. But, that's a road to cross later."

It has its own factories and creates its own hardware but it's not necessarily a semiconductor stock because the chips are still supplied by AMD, Intel and nVidia. I like Dell and the fact that they have their irons in so many fires but it has tremendous debt load and at $100 it is a definite no dawg for me."

2021-04-17 12:21:58,stocks,On the other hand there is a lot of uncertainty weather or not the ARM aquisition will go through.
2021-04-17 02:32:16,stocks,Don't look any further than ASML tbh.
2021-04-17 12:44:43,stocks," I think that's creating a discount in nVidia. People are hesitating unnecessarily.

 However the arm deal comes out, nVidia is going to pop, either because the uncertainty goes away, or because both the uncertainty goes away and nVidia gets to own ARM. Even if there are anti-monopoly provisions added to the deal, which is very likely to get European approval, it would still be a win.

nVidia doesn't need to own ARM in order to make ARM-based server chips, either.

I'm not really sure why they're trying to buy it, except that If nVidia starts making AI chips with specialized cores, and they take off any huge way, then they'll save a little bit on cost. But there's literally nothing stopping them now from licensing technology from ARM and modding it to make those same chips.

The bottom line is, nVidia has the best ideas in the business right now, and I think that makes them the king of the future."

* online retail division
* tZero crypto exchange
* decision to keep half of the bitcoin they receive as an investment strategy
* P/E ratio half of Wayfair's

With Coinbase going public and crypto in general generating renewed enthusiasm, I believe they are in a unique position to benefit long term from more online sales due to COVID changing consumer behavior and cryptocurrencies becoming more legitimized. Also, the lowest analyst price target on Overstock would still represent a 25% increase over the current price.

All of the above is nice, but it doesn't matter. While I am excited about the potential in this stock, I would like to hear what other people have to say about Overstock, especially people who think it's overvalued."

2021-04-16 22:46:28,stocks,"There's too much speculation in Overstock because their ties in crypto. I'm not as enthusiastic about their online retail division, mainly because amazon and  [walmart.com](https://walmart.com) have created a large brand loyalty and there's no reason for someone to switch to what I'd describe as an inferior retailer. tZero is also trash and no one uses it."
2021-04-16 23:23:31,stocks,Wtf is Overstock? you might as well own Wish... both trash
2021-04-17 01:53:34,stocks,"I own a whole lot of Overstock (around 100 stock). The bear case is very obvious: Medici ventures and tZero are somewhat of a ""pie-in-the-sky"" proposition, meaning that if they fail in their execution their worth to the overall valuation drops very quickly. That being said, Overstock's price doesn't reflect the inclusion of those two entities fairly IMO so I'm still bullish.

Those calling it trash, I mean no offense but that's just short-sighted. The company has benefited tremendously from the pandemic and if consumers stick with this type of online shopping they could be gaining steam for years ahead. Couple that with the potential of Medici & tZero and I think their current market cap of around $3b represents a lot of upside."
2021-04-17 00:50:06,stocks,"One of the main purposes of tZero is to provide liquidity for private markets via security tokens. Their platform allows you to make investments in private companies that settle the same day when it traditionally takes weeks. That is a huge advancement. By the end of the year, it will be the only platform that allows you to trade public securities, security tokens, and crypto. And unlike traditional exchanges, it is t+0, so no BS like we all saw with GME.

I can assure you it is not ""trash."" They still need to merge the ATS with the crypto side, which is expected to occur in the next few months. Then they need to get approval to trade public securities which should occur later this year. It's going to be an awesome product once everything comes together.

Full disclosure: I'm long TZROP."

The 1st chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&P 500. The time period shown is between June 1987 - October 1987. The chart consists of 3 up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows) before the final double top is put in place (bolded orange box). Once the double top was in place, the S&P 500 proceeded to experience downward price movement until falling 20% on October 19th, 1987.

The 2nd chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&P 500. The time period shown is from November 2020 to April 16th, 2021. Subnani Investment Research, LLC believes the S&P 500 price action is making a similar double top pattern as in mid-August 1987. The firm believes the current pattern emerging consists of 3 similar up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows). The firm believes the S&P 500 is in the final process of forming a double-top bearish chart pattern that would lead to downward move in price and potentially a repeat of a double-digit %down day similar to October 19th, 1987.

The 3rd and 4th charts are from the time periods of April 16th, 2021 and October 1987. These charts are zoomed out to display the entire price action of the S&P 500 (candlesticks) and 10-year interest rate (blue line).

It's playing hindsight now but there were apparently warning signs in the repo market, COVID or not, that something was going to happen in 2020 in the fall of 2019. The yield curve also apparently inverted as well in mid/late 2019 and that's been a good indicator of recessions. 

Back to back crashes have apparently never happened, but then this is the first time in history we had a crash and completely recovered within a year. Even though I think things move much faster these days, I can understand how the old school think. This is unprecedented and a fast recovery was seen as an issue in the past."

2021-04-16 22:50:21,stocks,"So I'm in the same position. Like 2% of my portfolio is BAC, I have some citi, hsbc, jpm, cof but they're less cumulatively than BAC. I was thinking of selling some BAC and buy JPM. I think that it is important to have bank exposure..I have regional bank exposure via small cap value funds but wanted more investment bank exposure and though BAC is one of the largest, they don't focus as much if their business toward IB as does GS or JPM or MS."
2021-04-16 23:56:47,stocks,"BAC will perform the poorest of the big banks in the next 12-18 months from my perspective--you have options if you want to keep bank exposure:

JPM: Highly diversified, probably the safest of the big banks to invest in.

Citi: Consumer banking and credit exposure, high potential upside (it hasn't reached pre-covid levels yet).

Goldman: Trading and iBanking exposure, traditionally outperforms.

Morgan Stanley: Similar profile to Goldman, but also a potential Wealth Management play. High risk given the runup post-acquisitions and the uncertainty around how eTrade will contribute to the bottom line.

I don't think you can go wrong with any of those four depending on what you think will outperform and what your timeline looks like. I don't personally like WFC, but that's a play if you have extremely high risk tolerance.

MSFT is a very safe play and has tremendous upside in the longer term, especially bullish because they've really ratcheted up their M&A offensive in the last ~5 years and learned from their Skype mistakes. I'd pour money into MSFT over every bank if you're well diversified, but might steer you away if you're already heavily overweight in MSFT/Tech

Disclosure: not a financial advisor etc, ~11% portfolio in MSFT, ~7% in JPM, smaller position in MS and a very small position in C."
2021-04-17 00:36:57,stocks,Investing in ARK just because you’re down big doesn’t sound like “shoring up” to me. MSFT has my vote and keeping the BAC allocation is second place. Banks can still do well in the next few years but MSFT is in a different class of business than BAC.
2021-04-17 01:55:00,stocks,"Wait for bac to hit 50, than act accordingly."
2021-04-17 04:04:16,stocks,"From a valuation perspective would probably stick with BAC. 

From a stock you can close your eyes and wake up in five years and you’ll be in a good spot I’d go with MSFT. 

I personally don’t buy banks because I think FinTech is going to eat their lunch this decade but I also won’t touch ARKF since I don’t want to time the lunch eating."
2021-04-17 13:35:00,stocks,The answer to buying more MSFT is always yes.
2021-04-17 05:19:03,stocks,"Yep. 

I was down in ARKF too, I just let it run its course and it is slowly getting better."
2021-04-16 21:57:54,stocks,"Thanks for the thoughts. Why would you stick with BAC? I'm a little worried it \*might\* do the worst of the big banks and go sideways for a while. I do have a lot of tech already, like MSFT, and they are all in the green and I really don't want to sell any of my tech.

At the same time, I'm down quite a bit in ARKF. BAC is my only position now that I'm OK with cutting, and that's the only way I could buy some more ARKF to help get me out of there"
2021-04-16 23:15:39,stocks,"Thanks. Yes I also own some JPM. I'm also thinking about selling BAC to buy more JPM because of what you said. 

In my mind BAC is definitely a long term winner. Its just a question of how long will it take them and how much will they gain relative to their peers or other investment opportunities."
2021-04-17 12:56:29,stocks,Thanks for the good overview. I do agree that C is a great play too.

2021-04-17 13:00:37,stocks,Yeh I know what you mean. Its getting back up there but will need a lot of gas to to get back to highs.
2021-04-16 22:03:47,stocks,Just to diversify and minimize risk. I love my tech but its important to keep assets across various sectors. What if we see tech take a hit like we did in March. In March tech was going down but the rest of the market was doing good including financials. BAC is a pretty stable stock but if you wanna sell because you feel like its overvalued rn thats up to you. If you do I would not put the money in tech especially if you are already heavy in it.
2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Massive Inflows into Stocks This is interesting.  More money poured into the market during the last five months than in the last twelve years.

How to play this?  I have no idea.  I tend to believe the market will continue melting up as we see spectacular earnings over the next two quarters, and will probably continue on through the holiday season.  But that unusual amount of inflows underlines the current mania.

Usually I don't put stops on positions that are bought as long term investments rather than speculative plays, but I am rethinking that.  Stops saved my ass on the S PACs and green stocks/ETFs I had earlier this year."

2021-04-16 23:46:49,stocks,"A lot of people started investing once covid hit so they haven’t seen a 2008-09 bear market before. Lot of speculation going on for better or worse and once a correction or more serious bear market hits again I’d be curious to see outflows then. 

Not predicting any bear market is imminent but at some point we will face another one."
2021-04-17 00:12:32,stocks,One of the more interesting things I have seen is the number or retail investors from outside the U.S. who are participating in U.S. markets.  A month or so ago someone posted a map to r/europe that showed the most popular stocks traded in each country.  GME was the top stock in nearly every European country.  That is something that is truly new.  You have to think those outside the U.S. will be more likely to pull their money out in a bear market because investing in the U.S. won't have the local bias most people have.  Exchange rate risk does not help either.

The tech bubble, IPO squeezing before windows close then guys racing for that moment to cash it out.  Then there that market deli with a market cap of 100 million despite only 35 k of revenue.

In October 1999, the market cap of the 199 internet stocks tracked by Morgan Stanley’s Mary Meeker was a whopping $450 billion. But the total annual sales of these companies came to only about $21 billion. And their annual profits? What profits? The collective losses totaled $6.2 billion.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  

* On one hand people have a low propensity to send out of savings. 

* But, America's have saved ""too much"" during COVID.  As lockdowns subside and travel opens up ... It's conceivable that large chunks will leave the market and go to discretionary spending.

If people pull to fund discretionary spending ... This will bring down all equities insofar as money leaves the market.  But since that money will move into discretionary spending, these companies earnings will be positively impacted.  High flying growth will struggle and discretionary sector is ambiguous.

I think it all comes down to the distribution of savings.  If it's skewed toward the rich, there will be little impact (rich people have a very low propensity to spend out of savings).

Obviously there is also the wrinkle of how investors would react to a bear market ... Which is interesting as it would trigger a reshuffle in savings vehicles... Not withdrawals.  That said, there aren't many other attractive saving vehicles for retail investors at this time."

2021-04-17 05:00:40,stocks,"I wrote abput that before in other threads as well.   
I am from the EU (germany) and looked at the market development a bit before deciding to invest about 75% of my assets into the US markets. the rest is world, not germany, not EU. 

reasons can be seen here:  

**DAX Growth (German Index)**   
Last 10 Years . . . . . . . . . . . .   140.9%       Rank: 13 out of 23

**S&P 500**

**Nasdaq**  
Last 10 Years . . . . . . . . . . . .   404.7%       Rank: 1 out of 23

sources:

[https://www.forecast-chart.com/](https://www.forecast-chart.com/)

so many investors see this and ask themselves: why on earth should I be satisfied with 140%, if I could make 200 or even 400 as well ? 

the US Market is probably the most hyped equity market in the world. 

historically, it moved the fastest. it took the shortest time to recover from massive drops. 

most people looking to make money, look at past performances and say ""I want a piece of that pie"".   
and since the US is and was painted as the ""good guys"" in the world (the western hemisphere that is), people rather invest into the US market compared to lets say.. china / asia. 

(although, china might actually be the smarter move, depnding on how you look at it and who you ask.. )"
2021-04-16 22:36:16,stocks,"Pretty sure it’s more of a cultural thing than it is a protection against risk. 

Social media wasn’t as big of a thing back in 2008, platforms existed but no where near the magnitude were at today. Securities and the finance world has always been like another language to the average person, with everyone watching the massive rebound we’ve seen in the past year a “get rich quick mentality” has taken over the minds of the now average retail investor to a point where stocks are no longer being traded on fundamentals.

There’s no more protection against risk than there’s ever been, there’s just a greater demand as a result of people being more reckless.

Out of the 3 major “investing” subreddits, /r/Stocks, /r/Investing and /r/Wallstreetbets, WSB has over double the users of the other 2 combined. You think that’s because it offers the best advice or because the media painted WSB as at the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?"

 If I sell in under a year my short term capital gains is taxed higher than my regular income(again because I jumped into a higher tax rate) so another 31% which includes 9% to my state. If I had held it for a year and/or offset the short term gains with some losses, the long term gains are taxed at a lower rate. My state sucks so it’s still 21% long term tax.

They don’t. Before taxes and fees, there’s no logical basis for an investor to prefer cash from dividends over cash from selling shares. 


This happens due to the fact dividends aren’t created out of thin air. When you receive a dividend it comes from the company, hence why on the ex date the share price drops by the amount of the dividend. 


The easiest way to explain why dividends don’t matter is: 


You can own 100% of $90,000 or you can own 90% of $100,000. At the end of the day you have $90,000.

2021-04-17 09:20:20,stocks,"When Buybacks Fail

Some of the time, share buybacks can be a great thing. But oftentimes, they can be a downright bad idea and can hurt shareholders. This can happen when buybacks are done in the following circumstances:

1. When Shares Are Overvalued
For starters, buybacks should only be pursued when management is very confident the shares are undervalued. After all, companies are no different than regular investors. If a company is buying up shares for $15 each when they are only worth $10, the company is clearly making a poor investment decision. A company buying an overvalued stock is destroying shareholder value and would be better off paying that cash out as a dividend so that shareholders can invest it more effectively.

2. To Boost Earnings Per Share
Buybacks can boost EPS. When a company goes into the market to buy up its own stock, it decreases the outstanding share count. This means earnings are distributed among fewer shares, raising earnings per share. As a result, many investors applaud a share buyback because they see increasing EPS as a surefire approach to raising share value.

But don't be fooled. Contrary to popular wisdom (and, in many cases, the wisdom of company boards), increasing EPS doesn't increase fundamental value. Companies have to spend cash to purchase the shares; investors, in turn, adjust their valuations to reflect the reductions in both cash and shares. The result, sooner or later, is a canceling out of any earnings-per-share impact. In other words, lower cash earnings divided between fewer shares will produce no net change to earnings per share.

Of course, plenty of excitement gets generated by the announcement of a major buyback as the prospect of even a short-lived EPS rise can give share prices a pop-up. But unless the buyback is wise, the only gains go to those investors who sell their shares on the news. There is little benefit for long-term shareholders.

3. To Benefit Executives
Many executives get the bulk of their compensation in the form of stock options. As a result, buybacks can serve a goal: as stock options are exercised, buyback programs absorb the excess stock and offset the dilution of existing share values and any potential reduction in earnings per share.

By mopping up extra stock and keeping EPS up, buybacks are a convenient way for executives to maximize their own wealth. It's a way for them to maintain the value of the shares and share options. Some executives may even be tempted to pursue share buybacks to boost the share price in the short term and then sell their shares. What's more, the big bonuses that CEOs get are often linked to share price gains and increased earnings per share, so they have an incentive to pursue buybacks even when there are better ways to spend the cash or when the shares are overvalued.

4. Buybacks Using Borrowed Money 
For executives, the temptation to use debt to finance earnings-boosting share purchases can be hard to resist, too. The company might believe that the cash flow it uses to pay off debt will continue to grow, bringing shareholder funds back into line with borrowings in due course. If they're right, they'll look smart. If they're wrong, investors will get hurt. Managers, moreover, have a tendency to assume that their companies' shares are undervalued—regardless of the price. When done with borrowing, share buybacks can hurt credit ratings, since they drain cash reserves that can serve as a cushion if times get tough.

One of the reasons given for taking on increased debt to fund a share buyback is that it is more efficient because interest on the debt is tax deductible, unlike dividends. However, debt has to be repaid at some time. Remember, what gets a company into financial difficulties is not lack of profits, but lack of cash.

5. To Fend Off an Acquirer
In some cases, a leveraged buyback can be used as a means to fend off a hostile bidder. The company takes on significant additional debt to repurchase stocks through a buyback program. Such leveraged buybacks can be successful in thwarting hostile bids by both raising the share value (hopefully) and adding a great deal of unwanted debt to the company's balance sheet.

6. To Get Rid of Cash
It's very hard to imagine a scenario where buybacks are a good idea, except if the buybacks are undertaken when the company feels its share price is far too low. But, then again, if the company is correct and its shares are undervalued, they will probably recover anyway. So, companies that buy back shares are, in effect, admitting that they cannot invest their spare cash flow effectively.

Even the most generous buyback program is worth little for shareholders if it is done in the midst of poor financial performance, a difficult business environment, or a decline in the company's profitability. By giving EPS a temporary lift, share buybacks can soften the blow, but they can't reverse things when a company is in trouble.

(Investopedia.)

Also as opportunity cost to an investor, do I want a business to reinvest, acquire, give me the money or buyback. I chose all the rest. Also unlike insider buying it doesn’t show confidence as it isn’t their money. It doesn’t diversify shareholders or bring in an institution.

> So it might be a good buy and hold strategy with a bonus of dividends. 


Right...however dividends aren’t a bonus nor should an investor care about them when selecting stocks. They’re irrelevant for a lack of better words. Honestly I’d prefer it if REITs didn’t pay a dividend and reinvested the cash into new properties, too bad the government doesn’t allow that. 


> some people believe in dividend irrelevancy, some don't.


Some people know the earth is round, and some don’t. Yes I’d compare dividend irrelevancy to the earth being round, it’s an undeniable fact that only a select few seem to deny simply because they do not understand the ideas or math behind it. Case and point, the guy I replied to, everything he said that disproved dividend irrelevancy had nothing to do with the idea at all. 


There’s plenty in the investing crowd that don’t understand it, most notably Joseph Carlson, I saw his video on YouTube and all he did was either make up facts or attack strawman arguments because he didn’t understand the theory in the slightest. People like their dividends...what else can ya say."

Nah. Invest how you want. Keep doing whatever works for you, however at least understand the fundamentals of dividends and investing while you go cashing dividends.

This is literally you right now. You have no clue what you’re talking about. You clap back at me by attacking strawman arguments that just show you have zero understanding of the irrelevancy of dividends. You didn’t even read what I said, yet you felt smart enough to reply. Jesus people these days."
2021-04-16 23:33:05,stocks,">It literally does happen every single time. It’s done by the analysts and computers. Even options get rewritten for the post ex-date price if I’m not mistaken. 

You sound exactly like the original person you are replying to. If it literally happens everytime why would someone not just buy all the dips post Ex-Div. Because people do, and price often rebounds after the drop ex dividends. Many larger cap stocks don't really dip much or dip at all post Ex-Div. Anecdotally, about half of my REITs don't really dip at all. The other half perform as expected

>He has over 195k subs while sputtering utter bs. 

What's the difference from some random reddit giving shitty DDs. If his subs decide to actually get into investing they will do their own research and find out about dividend irrelevancy and they will make their own decision. If they do not research more, then they kinda deserve to lose money.

>Yeah who knows. I’m just sticking with 10% in REITs because Fidelity did a study and found that if you hold 10% it reduces volatility and increases returns when backtested.

Yeah REITs are pretty great in that aspect, just gotta make sure the ETF you hold has REITs in the right places. I exclusively invest in REITs in my home country as I have a better understanding of trends and can react to changes faster. But in general, most developed countries are moving away from commercial and office REITs with the rise of E commerce and work from home. The future of REITs is Logistics and Industial, so maybe it's good to look through it's holdings or you might be caught bag holding. But to emphasize, in general."

Ding ding ding. You understand part of dividend irrelevancy, well you more understand why dividend capture strategy doesn’t work. 


You can own 10 shares at $10 for $100 total, or you can own 10 shares at $9, and get $1 in dividends for a total of $100. Before taxes and fees, it shouldn’t matter to you the investor. 


By the way. Most people don’t even notice the dip because it’s sub 1%. Like with NVDA, their quarterly dividend is less than an minute long fluctuation in their share price. 


IMO this is what makes it hard for people to comprehend. They can’t see it, therefore they don’t believe it. Since they don’t believe it, therefore it can’t be true in their eyes. However Warren Buffett broke down the math in a letter to shareholders where he makes it clear mathematically....oddly enough nobody wants to refute the Buffett and his math. 


> Because people do, and price often rebounds after the drop ex dividends. Many larger cap stocks don't really dip much or dip at all post Ex-Div. Anecdotally, about half of my REITs don't really dip at all. The other half perform as expected



That’s because usually it’s so small market forces often can hide it, not to mention it opens at the adjusted price, so people won’t see it unless they compare close and open prices. 


And also. The price doesn’t have to recover immediately or at all. A stock can have red days on the ex date. Such as COST. Costco’s share price still hasn’t recovered from its $10 special dividend back in December. 


> What's the difference from some random reddit giving shitty DDs. 


He makes money off it. People on Reddit don’t. 


> If his subs decide to actually get into investing they will do their own research


Have you been on this sub long? Lmao. /s 


Individual investors don’t do their own research 80%+ of the time imo. I know for a fact the majority won’t even touch academic research papers on investing and another majority won’t even look at a company’s financials. Even Peter Lynch says most investors hear a tip on the bus and by the time they get home half their life savings is in that random stock. 


> and find out about dividend irrelevancy and they will make their own decision. If they do not research more, then they kinda deserve to lose money.


They don’t. They just listen to Joseph make up stuff and trust him. I think he’s points on his holdings are interesting and I like that he shows his portfolio...however he’s a dingbat when it comes to debunking dividend irrelevancy, and his followers just listen to him without actually reading about it.

> my education/work experiences for that matter, 


So you’re telling me you are a professional investor yet you haven’t read Dividend Policy, Growth and the Valuation of Shares? Or Buffett’s now famous 2012 Letter to Shareholders? What about Dividend and Taxes (both papers)? What about Dividends: The puzzle? What about the proven concept that if you expose a portfolio to an equal weight of the five factors, you’ll get an similar return regardless of if the stocks had dividends. I can go on with papers that empirically support the concept of dividend irrelevancy. 


Honestly I could tell you haven’t done any research because of how you describe dividend irrelevancy, you don’t understand the basics of it. 


Wait. You’re telling me you’re a professional investor and you spend time on Reddit talking to children? Bigger yikes XD

The penalty to sell and withdraw from a Roth IRA is 10%. If I were to sell and withdraw from my individual investment account, it would be subject to capital gains tax (which should far exceed 10%). 

Assume all the money I invest is unneeded and I have 6-months worth of cash in my bank account. What is the best play here?"
2021-04-16 20:15:21,stocks,"Many in this thread is wrong. You can borrow from your IRA for a first time homebuyer whether Roth or not. There is no penalty for a Roth because it’s after tax dollars. The house has to be your primary residence & not have bought a home within 3 years. I forgot how soon, if at all, you need to put the $ back. 
However in a ‘self directed IRA’ you can take the funds without ANY tax or penalty & invest in real estate as an investment property but you & nobody you know can live there"

2021-04-17 12:23:08,stocks,"> Also - it’s worth noting - that it’s extremely risky to put $200,000 for a down payment you need in three years into the stock market. Particularly when the S&P and NASDAQ are at or near all time highs. I’m not saying it’ll go down for sure - but I’m also saying in a short time frame (and 3 years is a short time frame in investing terms) - you have no clue what will happen.

What’s the risk in setting a trailing stop loss on your investments so you can take advantage of higher gains in the stock market while insulating yourself from major losses? I mean, sure, they’re a chance the market tanks from 100-0 out of absolutely nowhere, but it’d never be an instantaneous thing in reality. 

Worst case you have your trailing stop loss at -5% and it initiates the market sell at -10% or something. I mean, that sounds bad until you realize that your investment grew by 25% in stocks compared to like the 5% you would’ve gained in a high-yield savings account. And I’m being pretty generous with a 5% savings yield lol. 

The major risk IMO is that the market crashes within a few months of you investing, before your investment has really had time to grow. I definitely acknowledge that risk, but 1) major crashes don’t exactly happen all that often, and 2) you can adjust your stop losses as time goes on. Regarding the latter point, that would mean you would have to more actively monitor your account, but it’s definitely a means of insulating some risk. 

At the end of the day, I guess it all comes down to your risk aversion and whether or not your goal is to grow or preserve wealth. When it comes to investing in a house, I understand that you probably just want that money to be safe in a savings account, I guess I personally don’t see investing in stocks *that* risky as long as you have hard risk management rules in place. And keep in mind that while your cash is sitting around in a savings account growing 1% per year, the cost of real estate is probably appreciating at higher rate. When it comes to this particular example, you’re actually steadily *losing* buying power by not investing — there’s hidden costs to even the “safest” of investment vehicles.

Just my 2¢. I would personally still keep a sizable of my savings in a cash account, but I’d rather take a risk on growing some portion of it instead of watching it slowly depreciate due to inflation."
2021-04-16 22:57:08,stocks,"You can't borrow, you can withdraw. It's an important distinction because with a withdrawal you're not allowed to put the money back, and therefore lose out on all the potential future gains."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"RSI is the most undervalued gambling play  

$RSI DD - undervalued compared to peers, online gambling stock

The company is Rust Street Interactive. RSI operates the #2 nationwide online casino in the nation, as well as the #3 or #4 online sports book in the country.

\*\*\*\*The company\*\*\*\*

RSI operates [https://www.betrivers.com](https://www.betrivers.com/) which is an online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in:

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, and West Virginia.

\*\*\*\*The value\*\*\*\*

RSI has growth on pace with the king of gambling stocks DKNG. RSI is also guiding for 60% of the revenue of DKNG. Despite the amazing growth and guidance, RSI is trading close to 1/10th the market cap of DKNG. Based on their growth and future guidance, I would expect RSI to be trading closer to 1/2 the market cap of DKNG, or about $13.5 billion. That is 4.3x higher than the current market cap which is at about $3.1 billion market cap.

A quick comparison to SKLZ and DKNG below:

$SKLZ FY2021 Guidance = $366M w/ a market cap of $6.3B Forward PS = 17.2

$DKNG FY2021 Guidance = $950M w/ market cap $23.6B Forward PS = 24.8

$RSI FY2021 Guidance = $440M w/ Market cap $3.1B Forward PS = 7.0

Comparison of MAUs (Monthly active users) with DKNG

For RSI, Real-Money Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2020 were up 116% year-over-year and 22% sequentially from the third quarter, with average revenue per MAU (“ARPMAU”) of $328 during the fourth quarter of 2020. ([ir.rushstreetinteractive.co/](http://ir.rushstreetinteractive.co/)...)

For [DKNG](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/DKNG): Average Revenue per MUP (“ARPMUP”) was $65 in the fourth quarter representing a 55% increase versus the same period in 2019. ([draftkings.gcs-web.com/news](http://draftkings.gcs-web.com/news)...) RSI has plenty of room to grow and capture even more market share and their customers are spending about 5x as much as DKNG. I like my prospects with RSI

\*\*\*\*The finanacials\*\*\*\*

RSI crushed Q4 earnings and 2020 earnings overall. Here are the highlights.

Revenue was $278.5 million during full year 2020, an increase of 337%, compared to $63.7 million during full year 2019.

Net loss was $138.8 million during full year 2020, compared to a net loss of $22.5 million during full year 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million during full year 2020, compared to $(7.8) million during full year 2019

According to Eilers and Krejcik, RSI’s U.S. online casino was the second largest online casino operator as measured by GGR for the full year.

RSI expects revenues for the full year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $420 and $460 million, up from our previous guidance of $320 million. At the midpoint of the range, revenue of $440 million represents 58% year-over-year expected revenue growth when compared to $278.5 million of revenues for 2020.

RSI has submitted applications to have its sportsbook and casino apps available for download in the Google Play Store for Android users in connection with Google’s decision to permit use of real money gaming apps in the United States for the first time.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

2021-04-17 07:55:45,stocks,"So, at a very basic level, leverage ratios are a measure of how much of your current wealth comes from debit. A simple and common way of calculating this is your debt to equity ratio, simply all the money you owe divided by how much money you have.

Under normal times, banks are heavily regulated by the FDIC, among them being a set leverage ratio that banks must meet at the end of every day. This is important as, in the event of a crisis, banks will have enough cash at hand to liquidate. This prevents a bank run like we saw in the 1920s.

During covid, banks were given an supplementary leverage ratio (SLR). Basically, restrictions were lowered so banks could take on more debt. This allowed more money to flood into the economy during the worst of the covid pandemic. Along with the SLR came the caveat of banks being restricted from giving out dividends and share buy backs. These two actions really only serve to make the banks and their shareholders more wealthy, so it makes sense that they were restricted. Banks normally try to please their shareholders before trying to fix the world economy.

~~Recently the SLR was done away with.~~ Recently, the lowered SLR was done away with and now things are back to normal. So now banks can give out more dividends, do share buybacks, and now they also need more physical capital to meet the usual leverage ratio requirements.

A bank selling bank bonds is basically the bank taking out a bunch of loans. Its the equivalent of you or me getting a student loan and spending it on whatever the fuck we want. The exception is that banks will be paying off these loans at current interest rates, which are tiny and will go up in the future. So banks are basically getting this money at a discount.

Increasing dividends helps them as its great for shareholders. If you look at most bank stocks, youll notice a recent uptick because of this. Same with share buybacks.

So, according to the article, SLR was done away with, interest rates are low, so now banks are gobbling up as much money as possible. The size of these bonds still kinda concerns me, but I guess its probably fine?

EDIT: i just woke up so I made some spelling errors

EDIT: u/merlinsbeers pointed out that I said that SLR was done away with. Thats completely incorrect, SLR is still in place but the lowered SLR requirements are gone now. Basically, things are back to normal."

2021-04-17 15:47:41,stocks,"It's exactly because of home run earnings and the record market highs actually. The macroeconomic momentum from the unwind of containment policy coupled with unprecedented govt stimulus and the liquidity from record breaking short term performance throughout asset classes  is creating significant inflationary pressures with relevant price appreciation appearing on a day by day basis across nearly every core commodity class. 

Powell and the Fed keep delivering their market lullaby about rates but institutional holders are still dumping Treasurys, which is why we've seen the yield curve begin to steepen and the market shed some earlier velocity in growth stocks. 

A bank makes its core return off net interest margin, the difference between the interest it pays across its various financing sources (deposits, bonds, and equity, in orders of lowest to highest required return) and the payments received from its assets or loans outstanding. 

In anticipation of secular rate increases, a bank would want to maximize its funded capacity at the low end of the yield curve in order to lever up its net interest margin against a higher expected future rate profile. 

The takeaway should be to be wary of the Fed promises on rates, especially since they do not solely dictate what those are. Most of the big boys are gearing up for inflation, higher rates, and if history is a good example, the attendant asset troughs that come as a result."

If there are large sales of the reserves it puts a lot of pressure on the market and volatility increases. When volatility increases...collateral requirements increase. Which brings us back to the selling of these bonds by the banks. 🤷 you make the call.

2021-04-17 12:21:29,stocks,"Alright, let's enlighten and enhance then. Let's break down the conclusion section:

> In March 2020, sales by real money investors led to rising volatility in Treasury markets, and corresponding increases in margins and volatility in repo markets. Large sales from hedge funds trading the basis seem to have followed this event. We show some evidence that these sales may have had a smaller effect on dealer balance sheets than might otherwise have been expected, and in fact that dealers attached particular value to these Treasuries during the peak of March stress.

Hmm ok, this is interesting, could have a point here. 

> However, these facts must be interpreted in the context of a timely and large intervention of the Federal Reserve into Treasury and repo markets. Without that intervention, our model suggests that the amplifying role of hedge fund sales could have exacerbated illiquidity in the Treasury market.

So... their model is guessing what would have been the case if the Fed didn't do exactly what they said they were gonna do, which is to keep highly accommodative policies rolling until the economy is back on its feet. Got it. Things could have been different if they were different.

> In the context of ongoing discussions of Treasury market reform, policy makers should therefore consider both the potential impact of the basis trade on Treasury market liquidity, and the broader context that allowed these trades to be profitable in the first place.

Ok, so because ""things could've been different"", lawmakers should maybe pay attention to hedge fund treasury basis trading because it could've caused issues. That's fair.

> While this broader research project is only at its beginning, our paper points to important links among repo markets, Treasury markets, and futures markets spanned by hedge funds.

Aaaaand there's the kicker. ""While we feel we have some good points, this research is preliminary and we can't say for sure yet that we're right, so we're gonna keep looking into this"". That's what ACTUAL researchers say after they make statements that they can't back up 100%. So they are literally saying that this an unproven THEORY based on a MODEL.

> “Conspiracy theory” that is a .gov website. Read/enlighten/enhance

It goes from a legitimate theory to a conspiracy theory when someone tries to pass it off as fact. Like with the tinfoil hat post on r/GME, where apparently the author cried several times as they were researching it? Like... what?

Here is my Q: Was there any OTHER stocks, causing losses that day, that did NOT get frozen? If it was about the loss of cash on hand, Then yes, lets say GME, AMC and BB caused some of this, but had another (non reddit) stock also caused a loss of money but did not get frozen that day?  I am still confused as to why so many other smaller stocks got frozen, if there was another non reddit stock causing a large loss, that should have been frozen also, but did any of those get side-stepped so they could only freeze reddit stocks? I just cant imagine some of those smaller stocks being a reason to freeze trading.   


Thanks in advance and I'm sorry if my terminology or understand is just wrong. Any help comprehending this would be appreciated."

But if you can prove that they weren't doing it as protection but as a means of attempting to profit, then they're breaking all sorts of regulations as well as doing something that you can sue them for.

Good luck with that."
2021-04-17 12:59:53,stocks,"Then there's your answer. Brokerages and market operators determine risk based on volatility. When risk goes up it becomes too risky for them to even allow your trades to cross. They're afraid they'll get stuck halfway into the deal and then something will break leaving them holding the bag. Or else there will be some sort of illegal activity going on and they don't want to be liable for getting you stuck in that. They're also responsible for not allowing those things to snowball and cause disruptions in the rest of the market. Halting transactions in volatile stocks lets everybody step back and figure out if they're doing the right thing the right way.

And RH is a toy brokerage that didn't have enough money to cover the 100% collateral requirements on the tens of thousands of 1-2 share trades its muppets were making.

They're paying for it in lost customers.

Unfortunately other brokerages are paying for it in customer service costs and delays.

If you're asking questions like how do capital gains taxes work, then it's guaranteed there are a hundred other holes in your knowledge that will drain money out of your account.

As for that question: short-term capital gains are taxed like ordinary income; long-term capital gains have a different bracket structure that can be affected by your ordinary income. Net losses are limited to a $3K deduction per year, but you can carry losses over to the next year. Wash sales reset the cost basis and entry date of newly purchased shares to the basis and date of the sold shares and you don't get to deduct the loss on the sold shares."

2021-04-16 21:10:34,stocks,"Not a source but gathered from several samples. John Carter of Simpler Trading does share his performance to his subscribers. He shoots for I think 2.5% per week on a million dollar account (at the start of each year.) He averages  better than that each year and also ends up with 2-5 trades per year that are big trades  (for him million dollar trades or more, but again big account, big gains) 

Some other traders such as Matt Diamond run smaller accounts in the 100k range and they also post their results and it is in that range as well. 

Other traders on YouTube also post their gains. I weed out the scammy lambo driving scammers in my estimate. 

There are some good podscasts that feature traders where it’s not uncommon that they share their P&L.

There are traders that post some crazy gains consistently on YouTube but their risk profile seems a bit high for me so entertaining but not my style. 

While you can make a lot more per day by risking more that’s also a great path to blow up an account, or two. I do know for me 1% per day is a conservative estimate and is what I use to determine when I know I can quit the safety of my day job. 

The other thing that I consider with regards to risk / reward rations, I normally trade 1-3 round trips a day. Usually I’m at a 1:1 risk reward ratio so if with each trade in risking $1k to make $1k then on a $100k account that’s a daily risk of $1-3k per day so well within a reasonable margin of safety to handle some draw downs.  

A couple of caveats to call out: consistency to pull a small amount out of the market every day is more important than home runs. 

I trade options on big cap stocks that have good ATR so there is always something to scalp and when the market is trending the swing plays pay out nicely. 

What would you estimate it to be or do you have any other sources?"

This would come out to about a 350% return on that million dollars every year, which sounds unrealistic.

>While you can make a lot more per day by risking more that’s also a great path to blow up an account, or two. I do know for me 1% per day is a conservative estimate and is what I use to determine when I know I can quit the safety of my day job.

1% per day comes out to 1200% per year, I realize you're not using your whole account to do it, but if you were doing 1% per day and only started with $1000 you would have $20,000,000 in just 4 years.

It is very hard to find data on individual returns from day traders, which is kind of why I asked, you were essentially just guessing what returns are as I would be if I provided a number. The youtubers and people you mention are anecdotes, and people that make a profit are more likely to post about it, but that doesn't make their situation the norm. The people losing money probably don't post about it, and if they do they certainly don't blow up on youtube at the same rate as successful ones. Essentially the anecdotes you're using are confirmation bias and therefore unreliable. 

But we do have data about the general success of day traders if not their rates, [here is one from Taiwan](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trade%20040330.pdf), they found that 8 out of 10 day traders lose money, with a very small subset that makes enough money to offset costs and beat the market.

Pinterest shares fell as as much as 11% Friday, the most since early March, which Shmulik said created a buying opportunity.

The analyst said channel checks for Pinterest are as strong as he has ever heard, acknowledging that they remain challenging, given that significant changes from large ad buyers can have a material impact. Shmulik has a market perform rating on the stock. It has 18 buys, 9 holds and one sell rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Full disclosure, Been buying since $2.75 but I bought more 5000 more shares today at $5.75. So I still feel really good about the PPS. Could be a truly amazing run this year!! 

Taken from article links below...

“The size of the potential upside for Recon Africa, combined with the speed the company is executing its exploration program, means that this is not likely a scenario where investors are forced to wait for a potential payoff five years or more into the future. Positive drilling results could trigger an increase in share value – or potential partnership and acquisition news – at some point in 2021, probably making this a rare short-term opportunity with significant upside potential.”


Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) is a small $300 million company that has secured petroleum licenses for an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana...two extremely resource-friendly countries with very low royalties fees.

This basin – as deep as the Permian – could prove to be one of the world's last-ever giant onshore oil discoveries.   And as a new basin, the potential is likely for Conventional Oil and Gas.  No Fracking, normal production profiles, low water requirements which means low cost per barrel. And Recon Africa has secured the petroleum licensing rights to the entire basin.

With one of the world's largest onshore, undeveloped hydrocarbon basins – whose potential has been analyzed and acknowledged by some of the industry's most sought-after experts – the oil that is hoped to be discovered by Recon Africa could ultimately prove to be worth tens of billions.

With drilling now underway, it's unlikely that this company remains under-the-radar for much longer – and the world will be very interested to learn about any major discovery made here.

The Most Exciting New Oil Frontier

Recon Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) owns the rights to a massive sedimentary basin loaded with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas. Under several long-term petroleum licenses, they have acquired all rights to an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana.

The Kavango Basin is comprised of 8.75 million acres and is said to be similar in depth to the Permian. New data on the basin shows that not only is it large – it's also as much as 30,000 feet deep.  The Kavango is a rift-basin, which refers to geologically how the basin formed.  All of the major onshore oil and gas fields in sub-Saharan Africa are contained in rift basins.

The source rocks in the Kavango are believed to be the same age and quality South Africa's 600,000-square-kilometer Karoo sedimentary basin, home to Shell's massive Whitehill Permian gas play. The difference is that the thermal history in South Africa led to much higher heat flow and subsequent over-cooking that lead to only dry gas remaining. This year, armed with new data, noted source rock expert Dan Jarvie has estimated that the basin could be capable of generating 100 billion-plus barrels of oil. 

In November 2020, the highly respected global energy consultants at Wood Mackenzie issued a report proclaiming that the Kavango Basin ""represents one of the largest onshore undeveloped hydrocarbon basins in the world.""

In this report, the experts at Wood Mackenzie identified three basins that provide a useful benchmark as to what the potential for the Kavango Basin might look like...one of which was the US – Midland Basin (Permian) in Texas that has an estimated overall development value of $540 billion.

Experts Are Backing This New Oil Boom

Bill Cathey, President and Chief Geoscientist of Earthfield Technology is known as the ""geological interpreter to the supergiants,"" as he has consulted for every oil and gas major and large independent in the business. Here's what he had to say about the Kavango Basin:

""Not only was the data on the basin some of the best he had ever seen... nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin of this depth that has ever failed to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. ""

And Cathey is not the only expert to have weighed in on the potential for Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF).

&#x200B;

The market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.

sure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). 

companies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)

I see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.

Furthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). 

I believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated."

I understand Forward P/E is based on anticipated future earnings,  what if those assumptions/forecasts are incorrect. I am of the belief that market hasn't taken into consideration is that corporate taxes, debt service cost and inflation.

Airlines are a good example. Shares are back to pre pandemic level but how long before earnings are back to pre pandemic? 

With all the new debt, debt service will be a big factor in their earnings and I'd say it will be a while before earnings are back to pre pandemic level.  If one buys now, it's money stuck untill earnings are back at a level where it is fairly valued. At some point investors will say look this company is not having decent earnings over time periods and I'm out, they sell and shares fall.  So if I'm holding, I'm now at a paper loss and I'm stuck. Would it be profitable until the PE comes down to reasonable levels before you buy these shares ?

Since then many of these stocks/ETFs are still struggling, but the broad market, the QQQ and the SPY have been hitting record highs. It's almost impossible for an individual investor to pick a portfolio of stocks that will beat the best ETFs over the long run. I don't know what you are trying to do or how, but you need to reevaluate what you are doing. The market is really overextended now with the RSI on the SPY and QQQ very overbought, and the VXX very oversold. You should wait until this reverses - the RSI on the SPY is oversold and the VXX ""spikes"" to overbought. Then, you should buy some quality ETFs, and possibly some good stocks. But right now is not the time to get aggressive. Maybe you should just get out of the market at these overextended levels and wait for a good buying opportunity."

If you like the stick still and it’s price is deep underwater, you could write a call. That’d make you a few dollars while you wait.

You need to decide if the time horizon to ride out the dip on your investments is worth it and make sure you aren't riding a sinking ship. A few years ago I sold JD for a big loss since I had no insight into the Chinese market. If I would've held I could've returned 300-400%.

As soon as that dollar reaches its bottom and rises, the market is going to experience a huge tumble.  There will be mass selling, and it's only a matter of time before that happens.  There will be a crash at some point, it's just a matter of time.  No sudden economic fluctuation, especially during a severe pandemic, is good.

That should be a major eye-opener that it might just not happen in 2021 at all for the 2020 darlings (well, 2020 up to February 2021 darlings). And it doesn't need to happen for the market itself to be able to continue."

In 2019 I was down 30% on TSLA and seriously considered selling.

Dips are truly buying opportunities. Last month I spent $7k on nothing but AAPL shares and options all the way from $125 to $117. On 3/30 I was down nearly $4k of that initial $7k, two weeks later and it's worth $13k now.

My next play is VIAC. Both shares, $50 September calls, and $80 Jan 2022 calls. At this price I believe they are an absolute steal. I've already bought $2.5k worth of options this past week and am down 50% but I'm honestly not worried."

The problem is that recovery names have surged well ahead of the actual recovery and now in earnings season we are seeing that proof.  Airlines , banks , casinos, hotels and restaurants are posting earnings that show sales still down substantially.  Right now banks are posting earnings and most show sales down 15%.  So a pause here is natural.  The market got ahead of itself.  At times like these the markets crowds into big liquid growth names like the fang stocks on the theory that they can't under perform the market if they are the market.  There are 50 stocks that account for most of the performance of the S&P 500.  Thats where the $$ is going.  They will rotate back into recovery names once they settle back to the 200 day moving average.  This is the last quarter of difficult quarterly comparisons.  Right now we are comparing pre covid to post covid quarters.  Thats a tough ugly comparison.  Next quarter things will so rosey."

If you want to make income mostly passively just use these 2 things:
Pick a very safe stock like VOO or SPY and then
Use LEAPS calls against them

The goal is to get guaranteed gains but LEAPS call option will intensify those gains. Picking an in the money option strike price and choosing a comfortable expiration date further out. Because you are choosing a safe stock, you can even relax the strike price and move it higher, which will intensify your gains further.

Basically, $10k in LEAPS call option contracts are much more profitable than $10k buying the stock normally and using safe stocks will almost guarantee gains"

If you want to make risky “bets” on options, there are good stocks that consistently pay (up or down) if you get to know them long enough: AAPL, SPY, QQQ and others are good stocks with healthy option activity, that are a good way to get a feel for the option game - Doesn’t mean you will always make money, but, they are a good place to get a better grasp on option behavior."

Regarding your question, ETFs are better than mutual funds in a taxable account. The reason is that ETFs incur less taxable events than mutual funds, and ultimately less taxable income flows-through to you. Mind you, Vanguard has patented their ETF trading algorithms so their mutual funds are just as tax efficient as their ETFs. In a taxable account I would prioritize US stocks since their dividends are qualified and thus taxed as capital gains. Most dividends from international stocks are not qualified so you are stuck paying  ordinary rates on those.

On one hand, you have institutional investors with teams of analysts that are paid a lot of money to only look at fundamentals and math when buying companies, and they are the ones with the power to move prices. So obviously, that points to a rational market, since the ones with the biggest power in the market are rational. 

On the other hand, you have situations like GME. So it can't all be rational. And I mean there's GME and there's hundreds of other examples where I can point to not just ""retailers"" being idiots and investing into a bubble, but institutional investors that are supposed to be good at their job too.

[See Andrew Lo's Adaptive Market Hypothesis. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_market_hypothesis)

Both Eugene Fama, the founder of the EMH, and Robert Shiller, a behavorial economist, [mostly agree on everything. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-A7eCUrYk) It is the interpretation of the results where they have diverging opinions. Are you aware of any other financial frameworks?"

I think the big problem is that people have a misunderstsnding about what the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) truly is. EMH is not a valuations tool and it does not explicitely state that the current market price is the intrinsic value of an entity. As a matter of fact, this has been discredited in modern finance.

The EMH is a financial framework used to somewhat explain where equities get their valuations from. Again, it is not a valuation tool, it is a framework. EMH states that it is very difficult or nearly impossible to beat the market because all known or knowable information is already priced in. Simply put, what this means is that stock prices reflect current public information about an entity. As new information (earnings guidance, quarterly financials, industry reports etc.) becomes available, the stock prices will adjust accordingly to reflect that new information. This have always happened and will continue to happen. In the case that someone has insider information, the EMH does not apply because the information is not publicly available to all."

Its actually the opposite. Beating the market in the short-term is a bit easier than in the long-run. You can still beat the market in the long-term, but the reason I would assume is already discovered by academia. You are ""beating"" the market because you are taking more risk than the market, and thus you are compensated with a higher expected return. Small-cap and value stocks beat the market in the long-term. It is because they are more inherently risky than the market.

>Finding opportunities when they present themselves to beat / crush the market is actually pretty easy, I’ve done it consistently. Problem is those don’t come around often to every year. Just have to wait for the right opportunity

I don't suppose you could disclose your strategy but if you could provide some insight into how exactly you are beating the market can help me understand.

PS. Warren Buffet's success is often used as an argument as how the market is inefficient and can be beaten. During his investing career, Buffet has almost delivered twice the CAGR of the S&P500 index. That is....until academia [caught up to him.](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Buffetts-Alpha) Turns out that Buffett was not really beating the market. Not to take anything away from him; he is an incredible investor, but the market still stands as the undefeated champ."
2021-04-17 11:14:45,stocks,"I mean beating market not any one year but year to year is much harder than 5 years or 10 years. Research bears that out


My approach is pretty simple. Look for companies taking heat because of bad press, or bearish short term industry trends, but have solid financials. Nothing systemic. You and academics may argue this excess return is because of the risk. I’d disagree, but oh well.

My portfolio is by and large total market vanguard funds. But when opportunities present themselves like the financial sector around 2011, chipotle when they had that ecoli scare, or a ton of Covid hit stocks like airlines and cruise lines - I bought and crush market returns every time


Again call it added risk if you want to justify it. But IMO it isn’t. EMH is a useful guide that everyone should know but the market isn’t rational"

2021-04-16 20:37:53,stocks,"I'm long on it too. As others have posted, very long. I'm not even thinking about it for another 5 years. I think with all the ev stocks, weed stocks, renewable energies etc. It's going to take a few years of market battling to figure out who the winners are. As a whole I think the sectors are going to rise but knowing which one is the best is tough. I've seen a lot of people down on PLUG. I don't have an opinion on it other than people who read much more than I do seem not to like it.

My investment strategy is basically to invest in sectors that are necessary for earth/ people to survive the next 200 years. I can't wait to see if anyone comes up with a feasible carbon capture plan, (many companies working on it) and am interested in the reflective white paint to cool surfaces. It's gonna be an interesting few decades.


Edit: and solar windows and roofing tiles, I've been waiting on those for a long time"
2021-04-16 20:11:59,stocks,"Yes.  I believe there are two major catalysts for charging companies: 1) EVs are the future, and 2) Biden's infrastructure plan."

I did a Google maps search and found many locations to charge my car. On closer inspection, 5 of 5 of my local charging stations aren't functional or no longer exist. Is anyone here actually using ChargePoint?"
2021-04-16 20:04:42,stocks,I use ChargePoint daily. I love it. They have fast DC chargers near by and are cheaper compare to EA and EVGO is a total rip off. But I still don’t understand why this and other EV stocks crushed this week :/

2021-04-17 01:39:20,stocks,"Their most recent quarterly earnings reported gross margin of 21%. That probably doesn’t map exactly onto station by station profit, but it’s in the neighborhood. 

Their breakeven is going to vary a lot by location and electricity rate structure (ie how many cars use the station, how expensive was it to install, cost of land, what are their demand charges, etc). Definitely not a straightforward calculation."

2021-04-17 12:17:12,stocks,"Though we understood and have been using similar technologies for over 50 years, the basics will have to be looked into. There are lot of advancements in the materials. And dealing with high voltage, high current in metals is difficult as the there are heat losses. You need all this without discomfort of having bend a chunky cable to plug in the EV.

I don't know the magnitude of R&D expenses and their focus at Charging point. But R&D is essential."
2021-04-16 20:27:46,stocks,So you think that a company spending no money researching and developing their product is a good thing?
2021-04-16 20:34:42,stocks,Isn’t a negative PE a bad thing
2021-04-17 14:45:53,stocks,"High voltage high current wires have been used in industry for a long time.   The ones I'm most familiar with are in submarines which operate at a much higher current than any electric car, but getting parts and equipment and cables were easy because they aren't unique to submarines.   

The batteries are relatively new technology,  and i would definitely say battery R&D is essential and if any new breakthrough would make a lot of money so it's worth doing.   

Battery chargers don't need any R&D, a small engineering team can get everything designed with well known parameters example: temperature ratings of wires, resistance, min bend radius are provided by the manufacturer, equations to calculate heat based on current are  well known (and taught to every electrical engineer student).  There is no reason this would be a noticeable part of a battery charger company's budget."
2021-04-16 20:33:15,stocks,"Depends,  like I said,  things that are unknown,  yet to be understood,  like an unfortunate amount of biology,  no, spend the money.   For something has been understood solidly since the 1960s, yes, minor amount for how to mount the components in an efficient manner and nothing else is required.   Battery chargers really are simple things that have been around for >50 years."
2021-04-16 20:16:02,stocks,"Seriously, do a little math.   Look at the capacity of a solar panel say 1 square meter and the capacity of a moderate EV, say a 32KW TSLA model 3.  Do rhe math...quick,  I'll be down voted away in under 5 min.  If nessisary look for the theoretical maximum amount of power from the sun that hits any given square meter of earth surface.   Still doesn't add up.  You can't violate the laws of physics and walk away with a slap on the wrist."
2021-04-16 20:40:05,stocks,"Yes, it indicates that the company is expected/estimated to lose money.

However, I believe that this figure is calculated with estimates for 12 months, so the negative P/E ratio makes sense, as we can’t expect the EV industry to massively take off within the next year or two.

That’s why I’m not significantly concerned about a negative P/E ratio here."
2021-04-17 17:01:05,stocks,"Agree with 'there is no reason this would be noticeable part of a battery charger company's budget'. They have to try it out before adapting it.

Imagine using 1.5 inch cable to plug in to your car... it will be f'ing deal to plug it... poor in compliance. There are designs trying to use conductors designed like robotic arms. Superconductors are being tried out.

Conventional AC/DC converters are about 80~90% efficient. And not all of them are at that level too. I don't think the charging companies look into that but if they want to differentiate, they should.

There are more such aspects that demand improvements."
2021-04-16 20:37:20,stocks,"The automotive industry has changed significantly since then, and EVs are a truly possible prospect now; they were not back then.

We can’t use the same battery from 1960 to power a 2030 car"
2021-04-16 20:20:00,stocks,"lol, I wasn’t referring to being able to charge a whole electric lorry with the solar panel.

If the charging point isn’t in use, it’s a chance for energy storage?

I also wasn’t looking to make the whole charging point reliant on just the solar panel, I suggested it as a way to reduce pressure on the grid."
2021-04-16 20:47:24,stocks,"Sure,  batteries have changed and can change more.   Battery chargers control the Voltage and control the amount of current at that voltage,  maybe some adjustment at certain points,  how to do that is commonly in use today with everything from your rechargeable AAA batteries to very high capacity submarine batteries.   Very little R&D required."
2021-04-17 01:47:18,stocks,Yeah I think the better comparison for Chargepoint is whoever supplies hardware to your local gas station.
2021-04-16 20:28:43,stocks,"Sure..... still,  do the math,  a small solar panel is a gimmick compared to the amount of energy stored in a EV battery,  like that silly solar roof on a high end hyundai sonata that adds 1 mile per day.   Do these charging stations have batteries or are they direct fed from the grid? Batteries are expensive you know?"
2021-04-16 20:55:58,stocks,"“Sure, batteries have changed and can change more”

Yes, they can change more. So how do we categorise the additional money required to find out how to change these batteries as needed? Research and Development.

Edit: battery _chargers_"
2021-04-16 20:32:03,stocks,"The technology still needs some work and more R&D, I’m not denying that, but there are still ways to get around it that we may discover in the future. These problems aren’t just limited to CHPT."
2021-04-16 21:07:26,stocks,"It really is simple,  a battery charger is a different thing than a battery!   Batteries are chemistry based,  battery chargers are very simple electronics!  Seriously,  do a little research and you will improve your odds of making money.   I'm really not trying to be insulting,  but battery chargers are very simple and haven't changed (in any theological sense) while batteries have changed significantly."
2021-04-16 20:42:23,stocks,"Seriously.   Do.  The.  Math.  

Find the total absolute maximum amount of solar energy deposited per square meter.   That gives you the starting point and you really don't need to go much further.  If you really want you can look at where all the losses are and the improbability of getting beyond 33% of that hard limit.  There is absolutely no way to get around the laws of physics,  it's really hard (as in almost impossible) to get close, but just looking at the maximum gives you enough information to give up on solar panels for charging stations."
2021-04-16 21:16:06,stocks,"Sorry, I was referring to a battery charger in my last comment.

I’m with you on the battery chargers part, but the fact is that there are so many other sectors and parts that require Research and Development.

How about the possibility of creating a new model for a different setting, or maybe a different vehicle if it may be needed etc. That is also an R&D expense. How about making sure that their cloud-based system is ready to take on an increase in volume in the future? That’s an R&D expense too."
2021-04-16 20:50:09,stocks,"As now mentioned for the 3rd time, we are not expecting the solar panel to power the whole charging point.

We are suggesting it as a means of relieving pressure from the grid, as one solar panel on every charging point may make a cumulative difference on the demand placed upon the grid.

Even if that doesn’t make a big difference, I am confident that other solutions will arise that solve that problem."
2021-04-16 21:29:00,stocks,"No worries,  but really,  batteries are at their heart a chemical reaction freeing electrons , while battery chargers simply reverse the voltage and make the chemical reaction in the battery go backwards. It really is that simple.   Yes,  adapting a database to adjust that a Chevy Volt needs X Voltage and Y current max vs a Bolt that needs different max voltage/current is a legitimate expense,  it's too small ( less than rounding error in a financial statement) to matter."
2021-04-16 21:01:19,stocks,"What ""other solutions ""?  This is a serious question.   I'm asking you to do the math,  it's hard but required if you want to avoid  scams.  You aren't going to be more efficient than a dedicated power provider (utility).  Economy of scale is a real thing. Do the work if you want to make money,  relying on hope and scams is how other people take your money.   Don't let them take your money,  I mean really,  I don't care,  but you do."
2021-04-17 00:53:30,stocks,idk how you guys are arguing about how much this company might spend on R&D when u can just go see that they spent 75 mil on it last year. Its on their statement
2021-04-16 21:06:25,stocks,"Clear to see you’re bearish on this stock, but thanks for presenting an alternative perspective."
2021-04-16 21:14:30,stocks,I'm not buying or selling this stock so I really don't have a dog in the fight. I just have a little experience with batteries and battery chargers from both home and nuclear submarines and nuclear power plant and have a bad habit of wishing for real people to get more money and scams to get less.   I honestly wish you the best of luck.   I own 99% boomer stocks and ASTS.  What happens to stocks in battery chargers doesn't affect me at all.
2021-04-16 21:17:25,stocks,"Thanks for your input, appreciated :)

You are also talking about Amazon as the pandemic started. There were massive fundamental reasons why Amazon was burning hot for weeks on end. You need to stack factors together. And a high RSI does not outweigh everyone being locked in their houses and relying on delivery services for a year. Of course Amazon ran overbought for a while. 

There are plenty of nonsense TA patterns that are bullshit. RSI is a legit indicator that can give you a high win rate all by itself. Stack it on top of moving averages, trend lines, dojis, volume, etc and you can be really successful.

2021-04-16 22:00:02,stocks,"I am a bearish on the US market in the medium term. I am aware of various arguments that try to justify permanently higher P/E ratios after 2000 and they do hold some water, but imo at this point the US market has entered bubble territory and I expect it to crash badly sometime during this year or the next. It's not just P/E ratios (more precisely CAPE) that worry me, but many other indicators and worst of all the extreme risk taking by the wave of new retail investors (see bitcoin, ARK Invest, Tesla, SPACS etc.). What makes it worse is that many of these new investors are quite inexperienced and they could be affected very badly by a downturn in the market. Which could have a serious social impact for example on millenials, who already got the short end of the stick since the GFC in 2008."

Thank you so much for saying this. People forget that the stock market does have consequences in the real economy, which means the lives of people like everyone here.

I want to add something that has been saddening me to no end. I have noticed for years that most retail investors don't vote the shares which they hold in the companies they are invested in, which I think is irresponsible and self-defeating. Everyone should vote if they want to improve those companies and to hold management accountable -- and to put an end to the absurd level of inequality between management compensation and the salary of ordinary workers. We can hold those people accountable if we all stop throwing away our right to have a say."

2021-04-16 20:06:37,stocks,Do you think we'll see more of a push toward Insulated Concrete Form homes or just concrete/brick in general with these increased prices?
2021-04-16 20:10:09,stocks,This ties in with my warning; yes business is booming but there simply isn’t enough bodies to do all the work. So don’t expect a crazy crazy boom because there’s a huge shortage of workers to meet the demand. This will slow things down considerably as it booms.

2021-04-16 20:08:11,stocks,"So when will the next housing market crash occur? I'm looking to buy in the next 2-3 years and am saving up for a down payment but some of these places that are even half decent in my area are like 400k townhouses, mind you I will be paying a premium to live in the area I am in which I am okay with but holy shit 80k down is like 4x my net worth right now and I can't afford any of the houses/townhouses/condos/etc in my area even making 25/hr. And if I don't put 20% down I get slapped with mortgage insurance which just makes the monthly payment even worse so I am relegated to renting (basically flushing money away) until I have a net worth of like 100k, 80k for the down payment and 20k to have a nest egg and some investment money. It's kind of fucked how expensive the market is right now. When my parents bought the house I grew up in 30 years ago they paid my current rent for their mortgage, around 1200/month, and that place was like 2500sqft 3 bed 3 bath in the suburbs of Portland Oregon. And now to get a house even remotely similar it would take a 100k down and 2k+ a month. Inflation is a hell of a drug, man."

Q1 earnings are priced in. But i dont Q2-Q4 is because the analysts project almost no earnings for q3-q4. Q2 is going to extremely higher than q1. Q3 may be as well.

2021-04-17 00:01:45,stocks,"I have a nephew that works at the port, it basically just sums up to ""manpower shortage""

1. Not enough people getting wood to the port, hence the over slurpus of wood at mills across the globe that itself were a response to dramatic rise in lumber price

2. Countries that are heavy on exports have their shipments stuck waiting, because ships that are suppose to take them are stranded somewhere else awaiting entry. Countries that are heavy on imports are jammed up with queueing ships, because people grom all walks of life are ordering too much to compensate depleted inventories due to pandemic, and ports can't handle all the ships coming at once.

It's anecdotal of course, yet there are also evidence that piece together the same picture https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-imports-are-stuck-on-ships-floating-just-off-los-angeles-11617183002

2021-04-16 20:40:02,stocks,No change because all the new properties people just got kicked out of will be equaled out by all those who just got kicked out now looking to buys something. Or the banks will probably offer refinancing to roll the moratorium debt into the mortgage.
2021-04-16 21:07:34,stocks,There’s a bubble getting ready to pop. 30 million households behind on mortgage or rent.
2021-04-17 01:04:03,stocks,Nobody who bought a home in the past year will be unable to afford it when it ends. That's just wishful thinking. Banks aren't dumb.

2021-04-16 20:38:24,stocks,"No shame in renting brother. Your decision shouldnt be based on FOMO or 'throwing your money away' but your monthly payments not exceeding 30% of your income. When you factor in mortgage, PMI, repairs, home insurance, and extra in utilities / maintenance then this is becoming increasingly difficult. Do not buy off more than you can chew because others are. In that situation rent for as cheap as possible that you can still enjoy, save, invest, and wait.

\- gov policies intended to encourage banks to give mortgages to people who weren't exactly qualified for them because they had shitty credit (present in 08, but not today)

\- boom in housing prices (present today and 08)

\- boom in demand for housing (present today and 08)

\- low interest rates that made mortgages, on the surface, appear cheaper (present today, but not back then - but the end result is increased demand for housing regardless of the cost of the actual house)

\- high housing costs caused home builders to build even more houses, putting downward pressure on housing prices (present today and 08)

\- because people with shitty credit were able to get mortgages they were defaulting on their loans and banks were foreclosing their houses and putting them up for sale at a discount, putting even further downward pressure on houses (present in 08, not today)

\- many homeowners found themselves owing more on their houses than their houses were worth, as a result of a collapse in housing prices (TBD)

of course the other component of this is that the banking industry was creating financial instruments out of these shitty home loans and selling them to each other, so when shit hit the fan these financial instruments made the shit fly even further"
2021-04-16 20:06:22,stocks,"At what point would the housing market correction change that equation for you? Supposing there is a 20% correction? 30%? 70%? 

Housing prices have not kept pace with wages. JP Morgan and other banks appear heavily leveraged in real estate, both commercial and private, and its pushing prices up. If the big banks have to draw down their real estate holdings and flood the market with houses at a significant discount, do you think that it’ll put enough of a dent in housing demands that new houses and developments will see a significant drop off? 

Not trying to fud mind you, just curious to hear your thoughts."

I mean, yeah, Canada is quite speculative, but I don’t personally think that 1/4 of a persons lifetime meets “the crash is just around the corner”.

Eventually they’ll be right."
2021-04-16 20:29:53,stocks,Local markets periodically correct. Mine has historically multiple times in the last two decades. But my goal isnt to wait for a dip.
2021-04-16 20:38:00,stocks,"I couldn’t tell you. General housing sentiment is a loooong term indicator that will precede the more immediate indicators like lumber futures and the weekly lumber cash prices. Thats why i follow DHI, TOL, LEN, etc... as long as they think they will keep building at an accelerated rate, im feeling good about the next few quarters. 

Also, unless there is a flash crash, it would take multiple months for something like that to impact immediate lumber demand. Because of the nature of cyclicals, for now my conservative exit strategy is late Q2/Q3 unless conditions continue to justify holding further. As result, i haven’t really done a deep dive into that angle because i think the probability of something like that grinding the whole housing construction industry to an instant halt is incredibly low."
2021-04-17 13:21:13,stocks,"I haven’t because I felt i had such high confidence in very high returns with RFP (due to use of shares and calls) that i largely focused on RFP. Because of its history, it was a deep value play. 

I know HD has done well. They probably will continue do well supply the remodel and housing boom but i havent done a deep dive on it to say it with confidence. RFP is a more focused lumber / wood pulp play. I dont think HD is a way to benefit from the lumber surge, if thats your goal, because they dont make their own so they pay the same high prices too."

2021-04-17 01:05:59,stocks,"That’s only highlighting how truly bad it is. $60,000 is barely above minimum wage in 1970. The median individual income now is literally poverty. A person cannot afford housing on the median salary."
2021-04-16 20:35:14,stocks,"Bullseye. There are a lot of financially educated but not financially wise people out there that believe two thing: Low rates = free money, and with rates this low you are throwing money away with a high down payment. Outcome at a macro level:

\- low rates = free money means people are focusing on the rate, not the principal. Doesnt matter if you have really low rates if you can barely afford the monthly payments.

\- Low down payment = yes, IF you can afford a 20% down payment BUT choose to put minimum down AND invest the rest this makes sense. However, these are american consumers we are talking about. That means they will just use all their savings on that 5% down payment buying a house they can barely afford. Instead of 'investing the rest' that money ends up going on cars, vacations, negative ROI home improvement projects.

Tale as old as time."
2021-04-17 02:15:31,stocks,2008 wasn't really a real estate bubble. It was a sub-prime loan bubble. I don't really see much of the same going now.
2021-04-17 11:38:51,stocks,"I think we’ll see a sharp decline in the stock market but it will creep back up. Not a true crash.

2021-04-17 11:41:54,stocks,"Yeah, those evicted are going to be scooping up new construction left and right with their stellar credit scores, great jobs, and huge down payments.

The evicted will be moving into slum lord owned apartments. The one’s that were sold to a low ball cash offer because the tenants weren’t paying their rent. Very little work will be done on these apartments and none of it will be quality, but it’s better than what happened to the last tenant."
2021-04-17 06:56:41,stocks,"They dont. They sell houses worth two, three times more than the ones they buy and with a bunch of equity on hand they pay cash and have money left over."

2021-04-16 21:10:28,stocks,"Exactly. I need low rates and a house at the correct price.

Also, I have never understood the point of a down payment on a house. In the Automotivd industry you put a down payment because the car is going to be worth less than you paid almost instantly after you buy it, so the bank wants some of their money up front. Houses for the most part don’t lose value. I don’t see why I have to put 20% down on an appreciating asset."
2021-04-16 22:52:35,stocks,"Whether to refinance or not is all about math. But it sounds like there is a 99% chance you should refinance. We've refinanced twice since our first loan in 2015 (at 4.375) and each was a brilliant move. The most recent one, they paid all of our closing costs plus gave us an extra $800 to reduce our mortgage rate from 3.625 to 2.875. Literally 0 chance of downside with that."
2021-04-17 11:07:05,stocks,Thanks I will look into it.
2021-04-17 11:05:51,stocks,"I would refinance to add a room. My original rate is 4.5% iirc. I have enough cash already. A few years ago I didn't have as much savings and I was considering buying a vehicle. You are right, I don't think I should refinance. Thanks for the info."
2021-04-17 02:10:45,stocks,"Yeah it’s really very typical Reddit to assume the number one reason real estate is increasing is due to some massive conspiracy where nobody is paying their mortgage, when there are very obvious and normal reasons like you mention for home values to go up like lower interest rates and suburban relocation. 

You can make some pretty big financial moves when you’re still getting paid your Manhattan salary but you can now telecommute from Paramus. The dude offering $50k over asking price is not the dude defaulting on his current mortgage.

But no, clearly it must be some massive black swan event that will inevitably lead to a full collapse of not just the real estate market, but the national and global economy as well. And we figured it out first. So much bitter doom and gloom lower in the comments here, like we’re just wishing for an economic collapse."

2021-04-16 20:32:44,stocks,"Don't go much bigger than 2000 sqft, it's a pain to keep clean and more $$ for utilities. Unless you have a big family. Don't do 2 bedrooms if you have a kid and plan to have company over. Just pick a good school district and good neighbobood. Water damage sucks and is inevitable. Bugs/critters are too. Learn how to fix appliances and basic handy man stuff. Renting is easier but way more expensive, especially right now. Do your research and get a bunch of quotes to save cash if you buy. Make sure you understand your finances and how the payment will affect you going forward."
2021-04-16 20:38:40,stocks,Are any of those hidden fees or agreements more important than the others from your experience?
2021-04-16 20:41:42,stocks,"About the 2 bedrooms, kid, and company over point you made... do you mean you should have 3 bedrooms total? Sorry if it’s obvious just trying to confirm.

And yeah my dad and I did all of the construction on the house I grew up in so that should save money instead of paying a handyman. Sweet thanks."
2021-04-16 20:43:53,stocks,"The fees aren't really hidden. They're in the contract, but just not something the everyday person looks at.

2021-04-16 20:50:44,stocks,"Since the closing bottom by both on March 8th...

NDX: +14.2%

.IXIC: +11.4%

If the Nasdaq is just going to keep going here (and I wouldn't rule out this being the case), it looks like we've flipped back to NDX driving the price action here like it did last summer (which means I would put .IXIC not making another record high yet on ignore, it'll come if NDX keeps going, just hasn't quite yet). The November to mid-February rally was broad with the composite side leading in gains, but it's not leading so far since March 8th. 

It doesn't have to lead though for the Nasdaq to rally. It did not lead in 2017 (NDX was +3%ish on .IXIC) and it did not lead last summer either.

TL/DR:

Small cap tech could easily continue to lag.

Bonus:

March 24th-April 16th: 

.IXIC: +8.4%

Dow: +5.5%

Tech ""has"" retaken the lead for a few weeks now, it's just doing it mostly in a different way from the way it did it from November to mid-February. Even if this isn't a start of another ripper that lasts months from it, it's just like how it was able to fight its way back through a different way from how it did it in the summer late last year. The summer strength was largely in the top stocks, the November to mid-February rally was broad, and this strength has been back in the top stocks."

I am confused about his existing $40k account... The article and video I watched had said to make sure there's no other money in any IRAs before doing a rollover?

Whether that's true or not is something to investigate but may not yield much. Closing less profitable outlets to capitalize in more profitable regions might actually be a good thing. Regardless, Citi just posted very strong earnings that well exceeded expectations, and that datum is proof positive that the business is, at least in the interim, performing very well. Yet, the common stock has not enjoyed upswings like their rivals that also posted strong earnings---in fact, the market value has *declined* since its earnings release. I wonder myself if there's something to which the market is privy that I am not.

Let's say that the apes are completely correct here. Let's also say that something happens to really kick start it again and it REALLY gets kick started (as in it doesn't stop where it stopped)...

Considering what we saw in January, you're right that most will get left holding the bag, and not only will most get left holding the bag, it will likely wreck the market as well.

And honestly, although I suppose I'm a bit of a Nancy here by saying this (even if I get excited about what the market is doing), I don't think you'd see a quick bounce back this time if **** goes down. It will likely be faster than the past as things move fast now, but not like what was seen in 2020. 

But even though I was a Nancy there, I'm also optimistic that the ""**** goes down deal"" isn't happening for a while. A pause will happen at some point, but it won't be a crash, and I'm sure it'll push me to where I was almost puking like it did in September."

So while global markets will take a hit if the US market does, it most likely will be a softer hit than the one felt strictly in the US.  

I don't know what your robo account told you, but I don't think it's an either/or scenario.  I think the best option is to have some sort of a mix."

Sometimes it feels like people see the rest of the world as some sort of other planet unaffected by an US crisis. I think almost every country is very connected to the US economy."
2021-04-17 09:58:54,stocks,"Fair enough, I just don't see any reason to go 100% US when there are plenty of great foreign companies and markets out there."
2021-04-17 09:58:14,stocks,"It's absolutely all affected by the US economy!  And the Fed raising rates absolutely has an effect on the whole world.  But the Fed can raise rates while the ECB (European Central Bank) keeps them low.  This might make investing in Europe cheaper and more profitable in the short-term.  You never know.

It's just a diversification play."
2021-04-17 10:02:33,stocks,"That's not a bad point actually. I still think VTI > VT, but if you do your research and you find a really good foreign company and want to invest in that... i'd say that's a great idea. I am myself invested in ASX (Taiwan) and i think its an amazing investment.


That being said, my justification in being invested in ASX isn't ""oh if the US falls then this company will do great!"". I totally expect it to crash with the rest."
2021-04-17 10:22:38,stocks,"Fair enough.  You know, you could always combine VTI and VT or similar.

And yeah, that may not be your primary motivation for holding ASX but it's still a nice benefit, right?  It might crash less than the others.  It might leap ahead.  Who knows?

I think sticking to only US no matter what is just kind of short-sighted."
2021-04-17 16:10:01,stocks,"Thats kinda my thoughts and even sort of saw it here in March. But when the US has another big crash whats stopping the rest of the world from crashing too?

Someone mentioned its just as bad investing early as late and thats kinda where im at. US on average is out performing international and to me it feels like chasing potential gains by doing intl."
2021-04-17 19:35:35,stocks,"Yeah, if the US crashes the rest of the world will probably crash too.  But the thing is they might not crash as much, and certain markets might outperform the US in any given time period.  The benefit of diversification is you don't have all your eggs in one basket. Yeah, they're all connected to some degree but two firms in the S+P 500 are much more connected than one of those firms and, say, a firm in Japan.

I don't think you should hope to outperform the US by going international.  I would only look at it as a diversification play for additional protection and a small potential for better gains at some point or another.  If you're just looking for better overall performance in the long-term, 100% US might be the best idea.  But that also comes with a tad bit more risk, IMO, and there is a small possibility that you actually end up doing worse in the long run."

There are plenty of morons that will use shit tech that has been sold to them by con artists and buzzwords. 

It literally does not do anything. Feel free to try and explain what blockchain is offering in any specific implementation you might be referring to. 

90% of the ones claiming to use a blockchain aren't even. It's just a regular distributed database but they want to sell bullshit to clients or other stakeholders and call a glorified excel sheet with some hash values a ""blockchain"". Which isn't too far off, in fairness.

> Blockchain tech most definitely does provide better features than current database tech for some use cases. 


Name them. Give their use cases. Explain why they can't be done without a blockchain.


>I won't claim that blockchain is our savior and will fix everything, but saying the tech itself has no value aside from criminality is just ignorant.


It's the opposite of ignorant. It's because I've been following blockchain since 2013. And worked as a dev for a blockchain start-up.


I know too much about the bare bones, nitty gritty of what the blockchain aspect of any project actually brings to the table to fall for any vague bullshit like ""companies use it in supply chains"" or ""it has features""."

2021-04-16 22:09:19,stocks,I got 500 shares at $30 Wednesday morning. Wednesday and Thursday were not good days but today it leveled off. I’m bullish on a bounce back and think a full recovery in the next few months is realistic. I set a limit sell at $40 and I think it’s very likely. I’ll take that 30% when it comes. Even if it doesn’t rebound I don’t think there’s much risk. The company’s value didn’t change when the CEO got charged so this is just a market sentiment drop to a resistance level. Patience will pay off here.
