04/02/2021,stocks,"It doesnt matter, the price will stay the same level regardless of time period so dont worry about that, the key is to try and touch the top or bottom of as many wicks as you can. Generally from what ive read and watched, 4 hour and daily candles closing above a resistance or dropping below a support line is enough of a sign to start or get out of a position, given that there is also an uptick in volume to correspond with the price movement."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Interesting. The only thing that comes to mind is VICI, which is a REIT.

VICI's real estate assets are located in nine states, including hotels, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. They also own & operate golf courses. 

I am long VICI but am just watching it for now - waiting to see if people start traveling again."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure if you're aware (apologies if you are), but the contents of an ETF still have to be publicly traded companies.  So the pub opening up on the corner will not be reflected in any ETF, unless it's a chain that's part of a corporation (say, a McDonald's corporate-owned restaurant, for example).

I'm not personally aware of any ETFs that focus specifically on food and restaurants, but you could look into individual companies that are in that business.  McDonald's is one.  QSR is another one (they have Burger King, KFC, etc.)  I'm not sure how active they are in the UK, that'd be something for you to research if you'd like.

I decided to do a quick google search and came up with [these ETFs](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/there-arent-many-food-etfs-but-here-are-a-few-to-consider/).  The first one looks like it's got some restaurants, like Chipotle and Wingstop.  Again, though, not sure if those are in the UK at all.  Be careful though because it looks like a lot of them contain brands that you can buy from home... Pepsi, Beyond Meat, etc.  So not exactly a reopening play.  You can see what stocks are in an ETF [here](https://www.etfchannel.com/).

The last thing that comes to mind is that there are lots of other industries that will benefit from reopening, ie, hotels.

Just 2 cents from a noob.  Good luck with your investing!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think travel will be a slow one. Here in the Uk it’ll be a color system. Green if the country’s ok. Red if you need to isolate. This summer, their could be some things happening but it won’t be a huge amount. That’s how I think about it here in the Uk though. Can’t say about anywhere else. 

Rolls Royce stock is cheap too. At 100 now and was at 1000 pre covid. As they sell to airliners I’d imagine they’d go back up too. Something to ponder on for the future."
04/02/2021,stocks,"
""Rolls Royce stock is cheap too. At 100 now and was at 1000 pre covid."" I just looked at there stock its at 1.57, not even close to a 100 and pre covid was around 10 a share."
04/02/2021,stocks,"What is the symbol for Rolls Royce stock? You're right, they sell engines to airplanes - including military aircraft if I remember right."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not a financial advisor but here’s what I’d do if I were you. I’d trim each of those positions to around 7-8% the total value of your portfolio. Then take the cash you have and grab up some total market ETFs. 40-50% allocation would be your target here. That will increase your diversification.

Then you can take names you like and buy those to 4-5% allocation (keep In mind if the names are in the etf when you calculate the allocation). 

This strategy gives you broad diversification in the market while also allowing you to pick names you like. 

Take these thoughts and do with them what you please. They’re only for educational purposes."
04/02/2021,stocks,"So what you are saying is you want to diversify your tech heavy portfolio by adding a straight tech company in PayPal, a play on EV tech which is what Volkswagen is (Lets not kid ourselves NOBODY is buying Volkswagen for it’s ICE busines) and Black Rock which is up to its eyeballs in tech stocks, tech bonds, and lord knows how how VC money they have tied up in tech. Diversification from tech means things like manufacturing, raw materials, retail banking"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm 23 and am in the same exact boat as you in needing to diversify as I'm tech heavy too.  I started putting more money into companies such as: DIS, JNJ, JPM, MMM, COST, WMT, SBUX, VZ, WM, etc."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I like VW and made some money on it recently but I sold it. I monitor it daily and it has turned into a pump and dump stock, sadly. It is up 8% one day, down 11% another. Way too volatile for what it should be. 

I will buy it again once it stabilizes a bit."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’m in my late 20’s, started investing when I was 12 and have managed my parents’ portfolio since the beginning. My first recommendation is if you’re not married to the idea of individual stock picks, go boring and pick a broad market etf. 

If you really want to pick individual stocks, i personally employ a strategy that looks for quality companies with strong balance sheets, strong FCF generation or the prospects of doing so, and have excellent management and/or are market leaders in their segments. 

I take a barbell approach where I have traditional “value” picks on one side and “growth” on the other, but they all fit the criteria I have above. I think value and growth are stupid labels because you always want to buy when it’s good value relative to prospects and you don’t want to buy companies that aren’t growing in some way. I like some pharma names like MRK and VRTX; I have a good position in PYPL, V to capitalize on secular trends in payments. Look for sectors that don’t have much attention at the moment since you want to buy before people realize they’re gems."
04/02/2021,stocks,Just commenting to follow along. I'm in a similar situation. Lots of tech and looking to rotate more towards commodities/ other sectors
04/02/2021,stocks,For a long play I would look at hydrogen players and copper miners.
04/02/2021,stocks,"BGFV. Trading at very low multiples. Has consistent earnings growth. My price target to sell at current metrics is about 3x its current price.

KT. Korean telecommunications company. Good earnings growth. (No dividend). If you want dividends, VZ is an okay alternative (although I think their growth is somewhat limited. 

STOR (is a REIT). Low debt. Higher profit margins than competitors."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Diversify as often as possible. Over time you'll notice which companies are dragging and be able to cost average if you choose. I wouldn't recommend buying dips, reoccurring investments could potentially payoff. My first portfolio got saved by AMD because they were one of the couple dozen I bought. Basically my one winner is covering the initial investment and all my others just need to mature. Everyone's risk/reward are different. I hope you do very well!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Since you're considering VW, some DD:

i started 8 weeks ago and my portfolio is up 60%. i use voyager as a semi passive long term saving account and am setting her up as an even more passive long term account. ada is stable with lots of projects to strengthen itself due this year. nervos is a beast i just can’t. vechain is most underrated coin according to twitter poll i agree and will blow up in next month. hedera is owned and operated by numerous fortune 500 companies. chain link like filecoin is on grayscale now largest international exchange. polkadot and chainlink share a common trend. bittorrent is a cheap great investment. ripple does 95% biz overseas and is being sued by SEC, if they lose almost no impact if they win huge headlines = gains. basic attention was added to grayscale. quantum i don’t know much about but revelry invested and see nice gains. tron is running hot with btt due to asia up tick and from their parent company promo. and lastly stormx is real world retail application and with people spending more money seems like not long before breaks .10.. idk this is my thought process... she should double her investment by year end or atleast make 20%..."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I live in Spain.  Out of curiosity, if you feel like sharing, which Spanish stocks are you in?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Sorry, forgot to mention cash. Currently makes up for ~40% of the portfolio, I calculated the stocks % leaving cash out of the ecuation. 

Will look at it, thanks! But one problem of being European is that the ETF range to choose from is... reduced, to say it lightly."
04/02/2021,stocks,"These are good suggestions. 

When I come across these types of posts my answer is always the same.

HD/LOW. DIS. WMT/TGT. VZ/TMUS/T. A bank (I like WFC - think they have the most room up from current levels).

Home improvement stores that cannot be replaced through online.

Entertainment, content creator, theme parks, streaming, etc.

Brick and mortar retailers at the head of the class in regards to online ordering/pickup/delivery (could include AMZN here as well - but might be too tech itself).

Major 3 cell phone providers.

Banks are here to stay."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I regret not getting into VW when it got into my radar at ~160, I'll wait for it to correct a bit or at least stabilize for a while."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Higher volatility /= pump and dump

The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, is a $1.1 trillion or more EV company in the making."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm in a slightly different situation, my parents taught me a bit about this years ago and I have learned the rest myself, currently I have a separate portfolio with them and I'm the one making most of the decisions lately. 

And yep, totally agreed with that, I'm slightly married to individual stocks, that's why I've only chosen market leaders for their respective markets with strong balance sheets (and not an excessive debt level for when the Fed's interests rise) and even better forecasts for the years to come.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Right now I'm into Atrys Health (got into it at around 9€) and Soltec Power (bought the dip at 7.8€).

Of those 2 I think that Atrys has the biggest long term holding potential."
04/02/2021,stocks,"One thing I’d note too is that often people say they want dividend payers over the long term. I’ve realized people use dividends as a proxy of a strong and healthy business that has good resource allocation. In this case, you can find companies that are in a position to generate tremendous amounts of cash flow that may not pay a dividend now, but may do so later on and/or have a robust buyback program. Kind of widens the scope a bit to avoid ruling out exceptional companies that don’t meet income requirements."
04/02/2021,stocks,"iota is like my on the bench coin. 
i have not researched iota enough to buy into it. possibly my third or fourth next investment in next two months.
i had heard somewhere that ada was attached to africa. and by helping ada it helps decentralize africa economy... idk"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Interesting. I've never heard of either of them before.  I'm in bigger names: Iberdrola and Inditex, lol.

Any particular reason why you chose those two?  Had you heard of them before doing any research?  

(I mean, everyone here knows Inditex and Iberdrola without doing research.)"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm looking for dividends in good companies, I'm not ruling out companies for the fact that they don't give dividends. It's just another of the pilars at which I look like. 

Thanks!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I had heard a bit about Atrys, it's based on Barcelona. They are in an acquisition craze, creating their own monopoly buying other Spanish, Portuguese and Swiss companies that do similar things as they do. 

I don't like the big players of the Spanish stock market, they seem to be in a permabear scenario and nor the balance sheets nor the expectations are good at all in most cases. That's why I like to look for German or American stocks. 

Solaria was the exception until it had to announce delays with some of their projects, excess debt, and it went from 31€ to 16€ in ~2 months.

Secondary market stocks usually outperform them by a fair margin."

04/02/2021,stocks,This is great news! Really looking forward to Monday so I can watch it drop slightly more slowly than every other fucking day.
04/02/2021,stocks,"The company is partially subject to scrutiny  because they don’t have enough commercial business coming through the door. Too much government and some feel that’s not stable or big enough business I guess.

They’ll grow into more business and I’d buy it with that hope. They have big room for growth.

Price probably won’t go up much because of this news"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Just FYI, I work in this industry, this is not news and it isn’t very notable. It’s a sole-source to Palantir by an existing customer to renew licenses instead of having to recompete the work. The limited sources justification announcing the award was posted back on February 12. If anyone has questions I can probably answer them.

04/02/2021,stocks,And at $23/share palantir’s market cap is $42 billion. A contract “potentially” worth 89 million or 0.2% of their market value. This news should really move the needle...big news!

04/02/2021,stocks,I still have no idea what palantir does. Is it another pharma?
04/02/2021,stocks,This and CRSR have taken beatings they both don’t deserve. Hopefully we start to see some much deserved turnaround.
04/02/2021,stocks,stock will definitely go down
04/02/2021,stocks,Wonder if the guy who compared PLTR to GOOG in 2004 is going to say several more contracts like these and PLTR is well on its way to $3B revenue in 2023!
04/02/2021,stocks,Does this have anything to do with the 8k filing that I just read about? I dont understand it but looks like they took out a $200M loan?? Am I mis-reading all the lawyer jargon?
04/02/2021,stocks,Every new contract I lose another couple %
04/02/2021,stocks,Well here comes the call options
04/02/2021,stocks,Great news but some will say that too many contracts continue to be with (and depend on) the government.  To have the stock really rise they need to expand and show the overall value they can provide beyond this sector.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Based on my research and years of getting fucked by the fundamentals, this is 100% accurate.  


Fundamentals are like guessing the tides based on the moon. It might work here and there based on your observations but you don't really understand why. It's a much deeper than that."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah because that 89 million contract justifies a 42 billion market cap...
04/02/2021,stocks,You are getting a discount my friend!
04/02/2021,stocks,"What doesn't make sense is that in the past getting awarded a $40 million contract that they could maybe make a couple million in profit of literally led to hundreds of millions pumped into their stock.

It's a tiny contract and everyone owns the stock like it's about to be the new Google. Owners just realize that it's a company likely continuing to stick all resources to work on US govt contracts making a million here or there, and there are billions pumped into its stock. Basically their current status is of a US government contractor with the most overblown stock, and every time they act like it's the case is a a time more people realize this and pull out. They've been exactly that for the past 17 years."
04/02/2021,stocks,Stock market is forward looking and this news means PLTR has nothing new in the future so company loses value.
04/02/2021,stocks,Every contract they get like this it crystalizes a little more how over valued they are.

04/02/2021,stocks,This comment made my day.
04/02/2021,stocks,Right but significant growth is priced into their stock price. They currently trade at 39 times sales. That is ridiculously high. They could grow revenue 400% and not see their stock price move and it wouldn’t surprise me.
04/02/2021,stocks,Yup it's a standard extension with a giant cap for the clin so if they want to surge users in and out they can do so easily. The up to is a cap and will likely never be hit.
04/02/2021,stocks,You work in energy? I’m a recruiter and AEP and AVANGRID have kept us very busy hiring for smart grid projects. I was thinking Palantir would be a great tool for smart grids because they can track/integrate so many sensors. They have PG&E under contract. I was hoping this relationship just gives them more oomph to sell into those companies.
04/02/2021,stocks,"So in short you say that the contract was actually awarded in February, but they are announcing it now?"
04/02/2021,stocks,I don’t think Palantir has ever worked with the DoE so this is not an existing customer.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Everybody says this every time one of these announcements is shared. Like literally in the past three months I’ve seen maybe 10-20 posts with deals announced, and the top three comments mention how it’s a small contract. 

Well, if PLTR needs 100 of these contracts, that’s probably going to happen in a year or two."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yep, people love posting these but they are peanuts for a company with their market cap.  Might be interesting if the size was 10x larger or more."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I get a bit frustrated with these ""Company signs contract"" posts. Sure, it's good to hear something you've invested in has signed a contract, but you kinda just expect them to do that as part of normal business anyway. (I will accept having a DoE contract might be a bit exceptional though.)"
04/02/2021,stocks,Basically most tech stocks in a nutshell
04/02/2021,stocks,Underrated comment.
04/02/2021,stocks,Do you have the funds in an IRA or a regular account? I’m still deciding if I want to bite the bullet and invest in some ARK etfs.
04/02/2021,stocks,99% of people on here don’t even know what that is. They price growth stocks like mature value plays - then complain at PE ratios.
04/02/2021,stocks,The reason Palantir and the whole growth sector took a dump is due to rising interest rates - ans fear of it continuing.
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s more significant for Palantir - the contracts are usually larger and second Palantir only has like 130 clients.
04/02/2021,stocks,Workday pisses me off. It’s such garbage software. It’s sooooo bad. Yet somehow they have massive market share. It sucks. Like cheap Indian built software. Wish it would get hacked so hard. The fact it’s stock exchange listed shows a serious disconnect from what is really underlying that stock.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Assuming a price to sales of 50, this should add 4.5 billion to market cap. :)"
04/02/2021,stocks,"By the time the share price accurately reflects the market cap, PLTR will most likely own the moon."
04/02/2021,stocks,"They do not have the obligation to announce their contracts. Actually it is the complete opposite. They can't announce all of their commercial customers due to NDA agreements. Even this contract was not announced by PLTR, but by the U.S government. Check out  my link."
04/02/2021,stocks,Do YOU have 89 million dollars?

04/02/2021,stocks,May I ask what fundamentals you are saying PLTR is cheap? I look at the 39 times sales and see a company with growth heavily priced in.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’d say it’s more like guessing tomorrow’s precipitation levels by looking at annual rainfall. In the long term, when you subtract the noise from volatility, fundies always win out."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yah like WGO. Big earnings report... price drop and in the red . It’s recovering a month later and should go back up.
04/02/2021,stocks,This is just...🤦‍♂️

04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that’s what they said months ago when it was $36/share....."
04/02/2021,stocks,What does it mean by they trade at 39 times sales?
04/02/2021,stocks,"You're not wrong, as all stock prices reflect *potential* value, not actual value. The market is always looking forward. 

Tech stocks are generally always going to have inflated prices, because technological disruption has always been where the best growth comes from."
04/02/2021,stocks,Well it depends how fast they grew that revenue? If they grew that in a year - you would see the share price skyrocket.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Nope, I work in government contracting. I don't know much about energy, just intimately familiar with the government acquisition process, especially when it comes to technology. But I agree, I think PLTR needs to really drive commercial growth over the next couple years and energy / utility companies are a great use case."
04/02/2021,stocks,"The award was public knowledge in February, this is just the official ""start date"" of the new contract. As part of a justification for sole-sourcing a contract, the government is required to write an official ""limited sources justification"" proving that they performed adequate market research and concluded that only one vendor (Palantir) can perform the work without the government incurring significant costs or time loss, etc. For this contract, the government released that limited sources document announcing the intention to sole-source to Palantir on February 12. [~~Here is a screenshot of that document that includes the date.~~ *EDIT* Actually I'll do you one better and include a link to the actual PDF since it's redacted / public anyway](https://smallpdf.com/shared#st=22c74ef2-c139-402f-9131-4f9298cc2f5d&fn=12022021_LSJ_NA-50_SAFER_Final_Signed_Redacted.pdf.pdf&ct=1617400515588&tl=share-document&rf=link)"
04/02/2021,stocks,"the total delivery is a little less than 10% than their 2020 yearly revenue so it's not a small amount, but relative to its market cap, it's not a large amount"
04/02/2021,stocks,I don't see posts like this every time someone sees someone who has bought a Tesla. A $70k car? How do Tesla justify a market cap like theirs based on such a small sales value?
04/02/2021,stocks,ARK only goes up
04/02/2021,stocks,Rising Interest rates hit future earnings. Their stock price has run up very high and current revenues can’t support the earnings. That causes major down pressure on the stock. If they didn’t run as much they wouldn’t have as high expectations on the stock. It will continue to have downward pressure from their high evaluations and rising interest rates. Tesla is the poster boy of this. They have had multiple 30% drops in the past but always recover due to solid performance always breaking guidance. Will palantir becomes what people online claim it to be? Time will tell but saying the stock is overvalued on a normal metric is correct. They didn’t have a golden guidance stated on last earnings either. Most companies hit by the rising yields have recovered somewhat yet palantir is still toward the bottom of the down turn. By the way you saying rising interest rates is not correct. It’s the 10 year which is just the market prediction if rising interest rates are coming. Pltr has gone from 30$ to 20$ multiple times before the start of the year prior to the increase in the 10yr. The stock is volatile as it is depending on news of their contracts. I haven’t even brought up the numerous insider stock sales pushing the stock down. Ceo himself has 60 million shares he has been selling. Too much down pressure for me
04/02/2021,stocks,"Exactly that’s what people don’t get.

Plus, what tends to happen with Palantir clients over the long run? They pay more and more each year."
04/02/2021,stocks,So they could have some wild ass contracts and the market cap is that crazy then?
04/02/2021,stocks,The ignorant part
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s undervalued considering how much growth potential it has. Well see what happens in the next few years

04/02/2021,stocks,"For real, Corsair is a steal at the current price. I mean... at their current $3.1B valuation, that is roughly 2x revenue or 29 P/E for a company in full high growth in the highly growing sector of gaming and peripherals."

04/02/2021,stocks,"unfortunately being unethical can be a good indicator to invest. les wexner, ceo of l brands, was heavily involved in the epstein scandal. after the blatant assassination in 2019 and how i saw literally no media heat was coming back to wexner i decided to invest in L. Brands, it took a small hit in corona but is now worth $62 a share.

now im not sure what made the stock jump from ~$15-20 to $60s but i saw that the guy was insanely corrupt and untouchable, basically the caricature of an untouchable rich man. i heard Wexner sold a lot of shares though and now im pulling out. it could easily keep rising but i hope the heat of the scandal will eventually burn him and tarnish the stock. but tbh no one really talks or cares about the epstein scandal. so i think he's going to die a freeman with a clean reputation."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Depends. Palantir usually follows the Nasdaq, so if the Nasdaq does well, Palantir will likely also do well. However, if Nasdaq goes into a correction, or worse, a full blown bear market then Palantir is screwed. After a 20% drop, it would still be worth over 30B while they only made 1B of revenue last year, meaning it would still have a high valuation"

04/02/2021,stocks,"I mean, their current valuation would only be justifiable if they had an extremely unique selling point and if they were growing at incredible speed. For a high growth tech company I think 5-10 P/S ratio is fair. Let's hypothetically say Palantir is an amazingly good company that's just lacking in sales but makes that up in other areas, then a P/S of 20-25 could still be somewhat fair. That would put their valuation in the 20-25B range at the moment, so a 50% drop wouldn't even be out of the ordinary, I don't see a 90% happening though"

04/02/2021,stocks,You are correct. They charge $5 if you use it or not.
04/02/2021,stocks,"1 and 3 correct (i use rh margin)..haven't paid attention to 2, all I know is that I've played around with between 2 and 6 thousand in margin over the last 3 or 4 weeks day trading and swing trading and I've seen about a dollar, dollar twenty in interest totaled so far..watch out with maintenance and total margin because it shifts daily (early evening and overnight) due to options and risk of individual stock (high/medium/low)..they may call you on the larger amount borrowed if the makeup of your current holdings changes significantly one day"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Correct. In regards to 2. Whenever you sell anything at all, it goes to cover the margin."
04/02/2021,stocks,Better advice: get off Robinhood and on to a real broker like TD or Fidelity. You’ll also have access to margin investing if you so choose.
04/02/2021,stocks,Sweet Jesus if you can’t figure out the basic terms of a margin account you DEFINITELY shouldn’t be buying ANYTHING on margin!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the reply. Glad to know. I’m not going to go over the “free” 1k and I’ve got several thousand in portfolio total so I highly doubt I’ll ever drop below the maintenance. Heck I could just deposit some cash to always cover that. 

How long do they give you to pay if they margin call you? I assume they won’t just randomly sell some of your stuff to make it up except maybe after a certain time?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I see, I guess that makes sense, pay back what you borrowed first. But does that really matter since I can reinvest it interest free? It’s essentially an extra 1k I can play with as long as I never get called right? 

I suppose it only matters if I want to put money back into my bank then since I assume I wouldn’t be able to despoil the margin to my bank."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not sure of the exact time, maybe a couple days? I've only had it once and I took care of it same day"
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s not really interest free. Robinhood Gold costs $60 per year ($5 a month) and you get $1000 of margin. So the interest rate becomes 6% (60/1000). You also get the other features of gold, but I don’t really use them."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Sorry, misread 2 at first..your margin is always last to be used when buying and first to be paid back when selling..i.e. you have 10k invested in ABC then you use 1k margin to buy XYZ, you then sell 1k worth of ABC and it goes toward paying back your margin borrowed..at first I thought you meant when do they charge interest on margin used..if all of your cash is used on options and higher risk stocks (again, each stock's risk is located at the bottom of its page) your margin maintenance will be high, even if you only use 1k of margin on a low risk stock..anytime your account value takes a dip, that comes out of your cash value first, the margin always stays the same..the fluidity of cash and margin and values shown is odd at first but smooth once you are used to it"
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes it is interest free money as long as you have $2k+
04/02/2021,stocks,"Cool history lesson: the Dutch East India Company was worth $8.2 trillion back then. What's even cooler was that back then, companies had their own armies and conquered nations to gain control ha."
04/02/2021,stocks,">Surely a company worth 1/10 of the entire US GDP would be too powerful for the government to handle. 

That's misleading because GDP is an annual figure, where as market cap is a valuation of all shares combined, generally valued based on discounted cash flow over several decades. Apple's revenue was $274 Billion in 2020, so a little over 1% of us GDP. But they're a multinational that produces and sells abroad, so not all of that is attributed to the US.

As for anti trust concerns, look into their lawsuits over their app store. IMO that's the biggest antitrust risk they have right now. It's very reminiscent of Microsoft's issues with Netscape Navigator back in 2000."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s an interesting question and I think we have been and will be seeing more of these types of discussions from legislators. 

Most of these big companies have multiple moving parts, so spin offs may be required at some point. 

Another interesting component is the massive store of cash some of these companies have, and much more than they themselves need. Do the pay these to investors through dividends, do they buy new companies to continue the growth cycle?"
04/02/2021,stocks,However much money exists in the world assuming one company remains that has a monopoly on everything. I imagine this is what Cathy will cite in a few years when they announce their new TSLA price target.

If there are news/pr links (not unfounded opinion) on StockTwits - before it hits SA, Yahoo, or any other service -  it helps me steer my DD to determine if I want to sell, hold tight, or buy more.   StockTwits is never the sole arbiter of any decision.  They are the start of the DD nothing more.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Just be aware you’re going to be losing a good amount of money due to taxes and early withdrawal when you withdraw that money depending on what type of account you have. May be worth it to wait awhile to have enough capital to capitalize on a entry TSLA position, otherwise that 15k-3k (taxes) = 12k is a good amount however with TSLA being volatile like it is and spendy a larger amount may be warranted. I’m not a financial advisor"
04/02/2021,stocks,"You’ll lose close to half of your $15k in taxes and early withdrawal fees. Just something to consider. Personally, I would start investing new money into Tesla if that’s the route you want to go. Good luck!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Are you under the impression that a split doubles the valuation?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Is buying Tesla stock an option in your 401k? 

That doesn’t seem typical unless you actually work for Tesla"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I see you get a lot of advice without any explanation. My short answer would be, no it's a bad idea. If you believe in the company you can invest a decent chunk in it but never put all your money in one company. You never know what happens, even the best company with the brightest future can have problems. Even if it's not their fault. That's why you need at least some diversification to bring your risk down. 

Apart from this, a stock split won't change a thing for you. Imagine a company has 1000 stocks outstanding with a price of 10. You own 100 stocks of them. If they announce a stock split, let's say 1:5. Meaning you receive 5 stocks for every you own. 
What happens now? The new situation will be:
- total outstanding: 5000
- price of stocks: 2
- stocks you own: 500

A stock split is to make your stock cheaper, as in easier to buy, but it doesn't change the value. You will end up with the same amount of money. Investing and waiting for a stock split isn't a good strategy. Nothing will change. 

Now let's look at the future. My view on tesla is, they will go down more than they already did. Not because they are bad or anything, no because their stock is too overhyped. It's too expensive even if you take their future into account. At least in my opinion. 

A measure you can use is the price/earnings ratio. 15 is the avarage and you can calculate it like this: price per stock / earnings per share. With this you can take a look in the future and decide how much profit tesla should make to justify their current price. It's outrageous if you'd ask me. 

Tldr: never bet all your money at one company, a stock split won't earn you anything and imo it's not a good idea to buy tesla at this price. 

Disclaimer: this is my opinion and it's not advice. Do your own research and make your own decisions."
04/02/2021,stocks,""" I believe the stock will double or split in the future.  "" - This sounds like you just arrived in March 2019."
04/02/2021,stocks,What do you mean by “double or split” in the future? Isn’t this the same as saying “I think it’s going to go up or down in the future”?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Imo allocating most of your money to your top 2-3 companies is smart. Why invest in your 7,10 or 15th best company (in your opinion) when you can invest in your top 3. W this being said all in a single stock is much riskier. Maybe 2 or 3 could lower risk, or if you really dont want to take that money out for 10-15 years than I dont think it would be stupid to invest it all in Tesla. One of the best risk to reward opportunities in the market for sure. Especially when u see it as an energy company not just a car company. Also I’d like to say u shouldn’t go all in at once. Invest a good amount, and average down. This is called dollar cost averaging. Anyways I’m not a financial advisor so dont track me down if u lose all your money. I have like 30% of my portfolio in Tesla and 40% in SPCE."
04/02/2021,stocks,Like most said it. Dont do it specialy not all in on Tesla.
04/02/2021,stocks,Never allocate a 401k into one company.
04/02/2021,stocks,You have to understand that a stock split does not change anything fundamentally about the company. All a stock split is doing is for example so you have a twenty dollar bill which is one share. A 4-1 stock split will just take that one twenty dollar bill and make 4 five dollar bills. So a stock split doesnt change anything about the company or the value you would have in Tesla if the stock split.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Sounds risky. The company is still overvalued, despite the positive news about the car sales. You can put some, but wouldn’t put all in a single company, especially Tesla."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I believe the dawning realization that full self driving isn’t happening anytime soon should give you reason to pause here. Maybe you’ve already fully looked into this and made up your mind that it’s all good, idk. Personally, I’m looking to sell my Tesla stocks."
04/02/2021,stocks,"1.) TSLA is way overvalued. The only thing TSLA has that is unique is the software and eMPG. As competition heats up, many other EV makers will be able to compete with eMPG or even be innovative in this space. Hyundai already has a model with solar panels. VW has project trinity, which will compete with charge times and distance. 

2.) TSLA will face way more regulation when their AP goes past level 2. They recently told CA DMV that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving.

3.) I own a TSLA, and I can tell you there are many situations where the drive assist just goes nuts. I feel like many people who comment on FSD either do not own a TSLA or have not experienced it. FSD is likely not close no matter what Elon says. Even if it becomes reality relatively soon, people will not trust it and TSLA isn't licensing their software out, yet. VW CEO was interested, but I think they s

4.) Other companies are making AP or have lane assist already. A Ford exec called TSLA vaporware. I'm not sure if you are aware, but there is also a story about TSLA deactivating someone who bought a used car with AP.

5.) People like to cite that Cathie is buying TSLA. Michael Burry put out a huge short against TSLA. Also, what do people expect Cathie to do? She is not gonnna talk shit about  the biggest holding in some of her ARK funds. 

6. TSLA became profitable based upon how many cars they sell. They are doing well right now, but back in 2015 when I invested they were losing money. I believe they actually were staying afloat mostly by government subsidies. I don't think they became profitable until 2019. Direct competition will steal market share. I am sorry, no matter what people believe some poeple will only buy a certain car make. 

7. That Toyota article with TSLA collab shouldn't really be taken seriously at this point. The thread in this subreddit point out enough valid points. 


8. Nobody has seen a street legal Cybertruck

9. Shifterless seems like a horrible idea

10. I'm not gonna trust a semi with lane assist.

11. I do not think government contracts will go to TSLA, but rather GMC or F. I think TSLA got phased out of the subsidy since it was considered a luxury vehicle. 

I think the best case scenario is either bitcoin blows up. 

Or TSLA merges w/ SpaceX. 

The BTC investment shows to me how erratic Elon is. He fought so long to be against crypto and then randomly just bought in. Tax and payment with BTC seems like a nightmare, too. 

The fact that Elon even thinks TSLA is overvalued says something. He said this when TSLA was 150 post split. In addition, when asked about his direct competion, he said AAPL. 

I could go on, but I figured these were the main points."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I agree with the others that it is unwise to put all your investable cash into one stock. I have some money in a mutual fund and some in TSLA. The mutual fund has way outperformed TSLA this year. Not that TSLA hasn't crushed the fund in the past, but my point is, by having investments in multiple things you can(hopefully) have a good return in one when returns in the other are weak. 

IMO, Tesla won't have another big run like the last 18 months or so in a long time."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I love Tesla. But apple is essentially at the same valuation now as th day before the stock split last year. Tesla is a great investment but it's a couple years from being the biggest company in the world. I'd diversify.

For the longest time people were screaming about the crazy PE ratio, but no one ever dared move against the momentum that is the Tesla train, just stay on the ride.  I think the recent correction is probably the beginning to a more reasonable valuation.

First mover advantage made it a rocket ship, but now it’s gonna have to prove why it deserves to be where it is.  Plus, I definitely see Elon eventually shifting focus on ventures, Tesla and EV are now mainstream so no need for a disruptive visionary.  Maybe SpaceX finally goes public?  If that happens Tesla will definitely come back down to earth, since he was the voice of volatility."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Who knows.  Typical PE ratio for automotive industry is ~150 for Q4 2020, which equals TSLA $120, but how much of that industry average is due to Tesla?  Looking at the major established car companies investing in EV (F, VWAGY, GM), average PE ratio 20-30, which equals TSLA $16-$24.  I don’t think it’ll go that low though, because of momentum and also because TSLA isn’t just a car company.

So you might see pricing as a mix of tech and automotive.  However it’s currently priced at 1340 PE, which is something you’d see in a tech startup (which they no longer are).  I think they’ll have to drop below the 400s (where even Elon said it was overpriced), but you’ll probably see a new EV industry standard valuation based on where they land.

TLDR: probably somewhere between 120-400.  Who knows."

Any firm can ""pay"" an OEM to have their vehicles made right? Just how much $$ is the key. 

My greater concern is not Tony trying to take over - but the ""rushed"" change in the Biz model? The ""pivot"" appears unorganized to me? So I sold calls on most of my holdings at a strike price that will lead to a loss if exercised...

04/02/2021,stocks,"They probably didn't make a button to exercise an OTM option because the market price is better so there is zero reason anyone would do that.

You probably shouldn't exercise an ITM option either, but OTM is taking a worse price for no reason"
04/02/2021,stocks,Do you have the funds? Are you free-riding?
04/02/2021,stocks,"So you're saying I'd be better off selling the contract and then buy the stock at its correct price? I have one contract for FUBO at $23 strike price for 4/16 expiry. It's $22.44 as of Wednesday close. In the event FUBO goes to $25+ wouldn't it be better to exercise the option at $23, which the $25+ price also covering the option premium."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Got it, thank you. I didn't know if there was a way to do this online. I have a few hundred in Robin Hood to mess around with, and you just need to click a few buttons and then you're good to go on their platform. Did not think you would actually have to call someone with Fidelity."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I did see this, but it's more of a general FYI and example guide than an actual, ""go here and do this..."" to exercise the option. Others are saying to call Fidelity in order to exercise. That page doesn't even give you a number to call."
04/02/2021,stocks,Good advice. I probably won't exercise until close to expiry.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Agree, definitely not exercising OTM. Thank you."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I have the funds, it's only a couple of contracts and stock is in the $10-$15 range, so not crazy money."
04/02/2021,stocks,"An option price is made up of the intrinsic value (Stock price minus Exercise price) and the extrinsic value (time premium). Unless the option is deep in the money and close to expiry they'll likely be some extrinsic value that you are giving up by exercising the option. 

Fidelity will auto exercise options that are in the money at expiry if you don't take action before then, anyway."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)"
04/02/2021,stocks,Exercising option is a pretty complicated process and requires some old fashion calling the broker.. They will not charge you for the service (at least that is my experience..) but you have to stay on the phone for a while.. Good luck!!!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Almost all brokerages requires phone call to exercise early.  RH is the only one I know that let’s you exercise with a click of a button. Then again, they are also the only one that automatically let’s you open an account with margin as default, have game like animations for milestones, etc."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm super confused. You hold OTM calls and want to own shares of the underlying. Is this correct? If so, why would wait for the price to go up to exercise your calls? This is buying at a higher price and also giving up any extrinsic value your calls have. Doesn't make sense"
04/02/2021,stocks,"This makes sense, thank you."
04/02/2021,stocks,Good bot :)
04/02/2021,stocks,"Appreciate the feedback, thank you. Comparing RH to Fidelity, Fidelity is a little old school, but when using Active Trader Pro, I almost believe I'm competent enough."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I seriously couldn't believe how easy it was to get approval for options trading / margin on RH. Crazy. With Fidelity you need to fill out a few forms, wait a few days for approval, and even still they limit your options trading to certain levels depending on what you say your risk tolerance is."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If price goes up and call is ITM, and option is exercised, I get the stock at a discount price vs. what market price because of the call option? So if I have a $25 strike price and it's $35 on expiry, I exercise the contract and get 100 shares for $25 and will already be up 40%."
04/02/2021,stocks,"What im saying is, your call is OTM meaning the current market price is even lower and you could get an even better price than your strike price. By simply buying shares at the current market price.

- Apple is $120.
- You buy a $130 strike call.
- The stock moves to $140.
- You exercise this call and buy 100 shares for $130.

Why would you not just buy 100 shares at $120, instead of getting an OTM option? By doing this you bought at $130 instead of $120.

More importantly, and the part it sounds like you're missing, options have extrinsic value that you are paying for when you buy them. It also might grow, especially if volatility increases. By exercising the option you throw those gains away. This is why people almost always sell the option instead of exercising it.

Also worth noting your 40% calculation is way off because you paid premium to buy the option."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Thank you for explaining this, it makes sense. I did leave out the premium in my 40% calculation to simplify the math."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I saw a car hauler the other day full of Teslas. It was beautiful 😍
That's all I have to add."

04/02/2021,stocks,I was kinda hoping they would have a Q1 miss and I would be able to average downs by buying some more shares. But in the long term this is great news for Tesla.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I love r/stocks and the little scared bears here. But I don’t understand the constant need to compare Tesla to car companies. That’s like comparing Ford in the 20s to horse farms. 
I’ve been bullish on everything hated by stocks and I’ve seen nothing but green. But by far, Tesla is my highest earner. Let me guess, GME is a pump and dump. BTC is going to zero. 
r/WSB are indeed a bunch of degenerates, but at least they’re balls out to get rich or die trying. r/stocks is a support group for bag holders of Nokia purchased in 2008."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Here's my problem with tesla I have no doubt they will be a large car company but they are so grossly overpriced that it is ridiculous. Even if they smash all expect it won't matter because the market has priced in everything. Tesla is a large car, energy, software and God knows what else when in some of those categories they getimg beat by other manufacturers, so really it's just so much speculation. I have no doubt tesla will be successful but buying now is paying for perfection and more and I'm really not Into that. Also the argument that tesla is like apple or Amazon back in 2000 is ridiculous because those two had market caps bellow 10b tesla has a market cap of 650b and is like the 7th largest company so people should really compare it to the large cap dot com names like cisco, Intel,yahoo and Microsoft.

Edit- also I will add that I do not have a burning hatred for elon and actually find him quite interesting and inspiring, however I am not a fan of tesla's management for one big reason. Tesla's two industries, cars are energy are extremely capital intensive and require lots of capital to grow. And when tesla turns around and buys bitcoun with this capital even if they are right on bitcoin it is an extremely reckless decision especially when the company really need the capital."
04/02/2021,stocks,"i feel bad for folks who genuinely think tesla is overvalued... they don't understand the complexity of what tesla does. They say, ""how can tesla already be ""worth so much more"" than super well established car companies like GM or FORd? well, right there that shows you they have no clue what the're talkig about, A better comparison for tesla would be apple, or something more like that. Tesla is not just a car company... lol."
04/02/2021,stocks,Nice! Just need to ship about 100x  more and they will be on target with their valuation.
04/02/2021,stocks,So.. stock up or down on Monday?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Shout out to the guy saying everything is priced in to tesla. He just wants to sound smart. Please look at arks updated model on github and play around with it. 

Hell put the lowest possible numbers in it and you will still get a trillion dollar company.

Tesla will 5x from here or further with its battery / manufacturing / auto bidder / robotaxis dominance"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Pretty rosy outlook there, but we have to consider more than the sheer number of vehicles that can be delivered.  

How many of those cars needed to be refurbished?  Were rejected by the buyers or were taken back to get one or more warranty repairs?  What is the value (profit) in each vehicle that is sold, and are we talking about $39,000 Model 3's or the $80K Model S, or the $90K Model X?  

* Fremont factory was shut down by the health department in CA during the COVID crisis.  Can happen again, not by law, but by whim.  
* There are new factories planned but is there the capability to deliver?
* Is the factory in China to meet demand (no more car transports out of Oakland to China) or to avoid paying tariffs on imports?
* Plaid+ Model S pushed out to now middle of 2022, with a $10K price increase
* CyberTruck, estimates but no deliveries.  
* Model X will not be getting the newer battery (notice by range) as that's not even an option
* Tesla body shops are slammed for repairs - either for parts or labor (May 7th or whatever in CA Bay Area)
* Tesla authorized body shops can have delays in repairing vehicles, due to parts availability and when aluminum parts arrive, can be dented during transport needing it to be sent back and resetting the clock
* Wholesale (wrecked) price on Teslas are high because battery packs are at a premium, causing insurance to total them prematurely and raising insurance rates
* Beta FSD is seriously buggy (dangerous) as per the latest AI video shot in Oakland
* Missteps in telling buyers they'd be able to get a Tesla loaner, then get cheated out of even the Uber credits, when the vehicles are brought in to be serviced
* Increased difficult in talking to a human via email or phone.  
* MCU1 NHTSA near-recall forcing Tegra board installs and service scheduling
* GM and LG Chem teaming up
* Apple Car competition
* MCU / software slow failure to adapt (Slack to Spotify, but still no Waze nor CarPlay integration)
* Large delays (due to warehouse supply chain) in deploying Solar PV installs (approx 2 months in Bay Area)
* Biden administration push for tax rules which increase corporate taxes (21% to 28%), impacting revenue generated overseas in places like Germany where the other factory is going in to help with sales.  

There are probably more issues, but when you have other manufacturers starting to offer comparable options (including TACC) it increases the pressure on Tesla.  What does TSLA really have going for them?

* Tesla Gigafactory is still working with Panasonic in Sparks.  Full shifts.  Buses for employees coming from as far south as Carson City NV.  
* Toyota and TSLA teaming up
* Leaps on the auto-pilot software ahead of everyone else
* Sentry mode due to number of cameras
* Name branding (fancier than a Toyota)
* Potential tax benefits under the Biden administration for EVs.  States like NJ make it economical to buy a new TSLA due to the $0 sales tax for EV purchases.
* Electricity costs in CA ($0.25 kW/h) along with outages due to ""wildfire and other threats"" make Solar PV a better option, along with the $10-$15K power wall for consumers

I'd expect chip issues to drive issues in the future.  I followed TSLA since they migrated from Mobil Eye (and subsequent purchase by INTC) into creating their own solution.  This is the difference between AP1, AP2 and ultimately the options going into AP3 with users claiming better (smoother) performance from AP1 for months after AP2 was rolled out.  Anyhow, the NVDA and subsequent their own chips also play a role in terms of growing pains.  

I am long on TSLA with a bit over $165,000 invested.  Current price is an interesting proposition but I have no active orders."

04/02/2021,stocks,Just do that opposite of r/stocks you will be richer
04/02/2021,stocks,"You have wonderfully pointed out Tesla, GameStop and Bitcoin because they are quite similar: you have to believe in 'em.

And not like ""I believe Intel can turn the table and jump back in the game"", but as have religious faith.

All three have made millionaires and billionaires, all three can ride even higher, but I am really struggling to see any actual fundamental behind those mays or may nots, and I'm not alone here.

So, it's more about psychology of masses and will to take a gamble than actual investing, hence those endless posts from both camps regarding the subjs."
04/02/2021,stocks,"> But I don’t understand the constant need to compare Tesla to car companies. That’s like comparing Ford in the 20s to horse farms. 

Let's think about that for a second, the vast majority of Tesla's revenue comes from making and selling cars, and we're not talking some flying car or something – no, four wheels, steering wheel, seats for driver and passenger, windows that go up and down, etc..

Ford never sold horses, so it would indeed be strange to compare Ford to horse farms – Tesla however makes an electric variant of a car. Tesla is not the first EV maker, far from it, EVs have been around for many decades.

The notion that Tesla is somehow *very* different is comical, they're successful, sure, they make cars that work... but they're still a very small car company with a ludicrous valuation based on insane speculation that can only be described as fantasy (see various analyses done on ARK's TSLA report)."
04/02/2021,stocks,Do you have a real question or are you just looking for confirmation bias?
04/02/2021,stocks,">at least they’re balls out to get rich or die trying

Yeah I am invested in TSLA, BTC and also made some profit on GME. But you have to be a gambler to ONLY invest with that mentality. Majority of any portfolio should be stable. Sure, play in your 20s with less than 50% of your portfolio, but going long on market index is a sure shot bet in the long term. Everyone with SP500 index fund also owns Tesla and BTC. Look at it this way, those people chasing gains in TSLA had a dream that someday they will end up in SP500. Most do not. How you doing Tilray?"
04/02/2021,stocks,I guess this is how people from Dotcom bubble or Tulip mania thought at the time
04/02/2021,stocks,Wonderfully said lol. These idiots think TSLA will go to 150-300 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 TSLA 1200+ EOY
04/02/2021,stocks,Lmfao
04/02/2021,stocks,Well said. Bunch of boomers in here. No ambition.
04/02/2021,stocks,Pretty much lol. They bitch about wsb but some of the best dd I’ve seen has come from there.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I disagree. Too many of the folks here on r/stocks throw out the word overvalued. That’s a quantitative concept, you have to actually have done a valuation exercise to say that, and I have seen precisely zero commenters throw out a scenario and fair valuation when they call Tesla overvalued. 

I think Tesla will be worth close to $1,490/share by 2025 based on revenues of $234 billion (72% from 3.75 million car sales, 9% from solar/batteries, 9% from autonomy and software, 8% from service, and 3% from insurance) and profits of $28 billion. Hence the “overvalued” trope holds no water to me."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well a lot of people love Tesla and Elon.  My friend’s children even talk about Tesla.  Don’t think I’ve ever heard a child mention Ford, GM, or Toyota.  Also, I keep seeing more and more Teslas on the road.  There is also the aspect of autonomy and integration with Elon’s other ventures (Starlink and the Boring Company).  Tesla is looking far beyond just making cars.  Every Tesla owner I’ve encountered stated they love their car and will not buy another ICE car.  All of these things make me a believer in Tesla."
04/02/2021,stocks,How do you know it's overpriced? Saying so doesn't make it so.
04/02/2021,stocks,Bingo. And even if Tesla had a monopoly on all cars they still could not do it. Building cars requires large factories which are extremely capital intensive. As a car company there is no possible way they grow into their valuation.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I type out a post pretty much identical to this every few days, usually deleting it because I realize that most of the people buying in don't know what a market cap or p/e, p/s are.

It makes me so exceedingly sad to see people blindly following Cathie Woods because they think she's some kind of deity. 

It's wild that people think Tesla will outgrow the best in class tech companies."
04/02/2021,stocks,What is complex about Tesla's business model?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well it's in my indexes now so whatever. I could almost reply that to every comment ITT. 

I have the most neutral outlook on TSLA, I work in the auto industry and have been to the Fremont plant and the Chrysler plant in Detroit, shit is happening for sure with TSLA and it's real. But I think with it's like 1000+ P/E a lot of growth is priced in. I wouldn't bet the farm on it, but it's not like I want it out of my indexes and ETFs it's creeping up in."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It essentially comes down to your confidence that Tesla will dominate all these sectors. Some people think they need more certainty and time, and others don’t."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes so they need to smash on every other aspect of the not just a car company.
04/02/2021,stocks,"So much more than a car company? They lost money on solar, their Full self driving is just a glorified level 2, they sell less electric cars in europe than VW.. they are much less than a car company would be a better statement..."

04/02/2021,stocks,I am a financial major at Harvard with a degree in economics and my prediction is that there is a 50% chance it will be down and another 50% chance it will be up.
04/02/2021,stocks,I explained in a comment below in essence why I think arkks model is flawed because it assumes so much without much merit.
04/02/2021,stocks,"ARK’s model is full of blue sky assumptions that don’t necessarily have a basis in reality. Hell, their “bear” case is a bull case."

That goes on the assumption they will cont8nue to dominate once all the others start switching over to EV."
04/02/2021,stocks,Oh shit well if ARK said it then it must be true
04/02/2021,stocks,"Given the chip shortages and factory closures, and yet they still outperformed analyst expectations---yes they did some smashing."

04/02/2021,stocks,"I think the best description is that they are ""story stocks"".  They are stocks where people believe more in the story about what they will be than basic fundamentals."
04/02/2021,stocks,I would be bullish on Tesla if there were any headlines celebrating billion in battery storage sales or a headline of them rivaling UBER or Google. What i see is VW and others catching up.
04/02/2021,stocks,"The irony of using intel as an example lol

Gme has a better chance of turning it around with all their recent board members and bullish investors than intel has at catching up and keeping up with the competition."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Have you seen Tesla’s last quarter delivery data? +100% growth, but yeah, VW is tots gonna beat that soon, soonish, never fucking ever, but they’ll cheat on their next emissions tests, for sure while Elon is putting people on Mars. GME was shorted 130% at some point, 130%!!!!! No government in this world can print a single bitcoin - that and onchain data is enough for me. Believe? As in faith? No sir. Everything you need is there in the open. You CHOOSE to close your eyes and mind to it and still do DD like it’s 1995. Best of luck!"

04/02/2021,stocks,Here's my problem and I explain this in a comment below. These numbers are extreme speculation. I explain why I don't belive tesla will be a leader in software below and also about the energy business below on how it has very bad gross margins. I just think people are assuming that tesla will be a leader in all of these areas when all of the data right now says the opposite.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Do you know why Volkswagen will lose to Tesla?  Because it's not cool to have a Volkswagen, and it's cool to have a Tesla.
Same reason why people have a Apple and not a Huawei."
04/02/2021,stocks,Never doubted tesla and my parents own one but that dosnt change the fact that the market is pricing it quite irrationally
04/02/2021,stocks,Because it’s current market cap is higher than every other automaker combined?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well on a fundamental level there is absolutely no argument that it is overvalued on basically all metrics. Judging by the future it is extremely overvalued as a car company and I know that argument goes its not a car company, but when it comes to energy their solar margins are at an all time low around 5% and the energy division is very unprofitable. As for self driving the thing people say is that they will lease it out to other companies. The issue with that assertion is that all of the other car companies are creating their own, the car industry is extremely competitive and competitors don't help each other. And the competitors especially GM have great self driveing systems. And as a final point many people assume tesla will have a car monopoly, but the one fall is that cars are a subjective market. People have diffrent tastes there are many who love tesla's cars and many who don't like them but this simple fact is why tesla and by extension any other car company will never have a monopoly."

04/02/2021,stocks,That there are roughly 10 other businesses included in their business even if you ignore the fact that the other large automakers outsource most parts and give up profits on roughly 70% of their car parts. Then there’s all the profits given up to their dealer sales and service networks. There is no direct comparison between a large OEM and Tesla.
04/02/2021,stocks,"They're a car manufacturer, but they're also *not* a car manufacturer

Or you know, whatever it takes to justify a 1,000 PE ratio"
04/02/2021,stocks,"That’s why I’m tired of hearing that argument. I get it that they are not just a car company, but they would literally have to dominate all of the industries they are operating in to even come close to justifying their current price and they’d still be overvalued."

04/02/2021,stocks,"I would agree that ARK is very bullish. Their models are within the realm of possibility, just very (maybe overly so) optimistic. If you cut their base case in half its still an attractive return on investment. The key is how do you value disruption and how hampered will legacy OEMs be by legacy costs trying to compete. Can you imagine the boat anchor costs of shuttering mfg owned engine plants, remediating the polluted land, and paying all those severance and pension packages?

I think a Rivian has a lot better chance of competing with Tesla over a big slow behemoth like GM."
04/02/2021,stocks,"A lot of smart investors are saying the same thing, not same numbers. Why you acting like it’s only Ark. The smart money is on Tesla. 

Now they could all be wrong, from my personal research I could be wrong. But when more than a few people are looking that way it would be wise not to completely dismissive. But that’s just my opinion."

04/02/2021,stocks,"These numbers are not extreme speculation. I looked at each market segment Tesla plans to compete in by 2025 and estimated how many cars they would sell and at what price. It just so happens that it aligns pretty well with Tesla’s guidance to grow unit sales at a 50% compound annual growth rate over a multi year time horizon. By the way, I think these numbers represent Tesla only taking around 23% of the BEV market in 2025 (this is the same proportion as in 2019 and 2020, despite Tesla being on track to grow BEV market share this year to 25-30%). 

To your point about autonomy software, Tesla has a unique and critical advantage that no one else has and that is they have literally over a million cars with their sensor suite and billions of miles driven every year using their autonomous software, which they use to train their neural net. No other company has even 1/1000th of the vehicle mile data Tesla has, and none of them are doing training on the same scale. Besides, I’m not even saying they need to be a leader in Autonomous software and other software, just that they will sell ~$20 billion worth of it 5 years from now.

To your point about Tesla energy, the gross margin for their battery business is much higher and is currently being dragged down by their solar roof product, which is still in the early stages of production ramping and recently had a >50% price increase (which should improve margins)."
04/02/2021,stocks,"So...who gives a shit? 
That's not how you determine value. Everyone know that. 

Other automakers have tons of baggage, debt, pension payouts. Legacy factories, making legacy combustion engine cars.
So you can't compare a slowly dying industry with the future. 
When model T came out, you didn't compare it with horses. You didn't compare Ford with horse breeders.    

But you don't have to see the future now, just wait for it to come and smack you in the face. In a few years it will be obvious. Some people think ahead and some think in the present. Few are stuck in the past."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Fundamentals is is not the only way to determine value. It's a model of determining value but not the only one. 
You got to take into account potential, technological advancement, forward thinking, innovation and leadership. 
All of those legacy automakers are lead by beancounter boomers whose number 1 priority above all else is the share price. 

Legacy automakers like Ford and GM will be very competitive, that I agree. They will compete very hard with eachother in the bankruptcy race."
04/02/2021,stocks,">Well on a fundamental level there is absolutely no argument that it is overvalued on basically all metrics. 

I will disagree. I use the CAPM to value equities as many investors do. The past is irrelevant - only future cash flow matters. So you need to model TSLA free cash flows for the next 10-15 years and then discount those cash flows back into today's dollar - not that hard to understand...

TSLA free cash flows have been growing very nicely over the past 4 Q's, and will be moving much higher. 

TSLA space will be the EoE - Auto's are just part of that space, and TSLA will focus on software high margin areas as well...

The fact of the matter is that the stock appreciation has dwarfed the actual growth of the company, making it immensely overvalued by literally any metric that you use.

Are you suggesting the legacy auto companies (you know Ford, Toyota, GM, Chrysler) are dead?

There are other batteries besides Tesla (granted they are the best right now).  There is other battery tech being looked at that could put Tesla's in the ground.  Now take the cyber truck:  Who is that geared toward?  Not those who want to go off road (camping or hunting).  Bed isn't designed for the construction worker/industry.  

Self Driving -- Really not going to happen until near 90% of the cars on the road are doing it.  Other companies are developing their own.  Who knows, they might become better.

The one thing Tesla really needs to do:  Get the vehicle sales profitable without selling the carbon credits to other manufactures.  Once the other car companies stat producing EV's, they won't need to buy those credits from Tesla any more."
04/02/2021,stocks,"GME started as a personal thing for me. Anything I can do to put shorty in a deep grave of poverty and to see them driving around in VWs or Toyotas, I will do.

Onchain data reveals everything you need to know about crypto.

Have you been in a VW recently? It’s like climbing inside garbage on wheels. I test drove a Tuareg a couple of years back when I was looking to buy an SUV. They’re not going to beat Tesla unless it’s at an emissions test cheating contest."

04/02/2021,stocks,"To you counter point about software miles are not everything, my parents own a tesla and while it does do well on open roads and in highway traffic in dense areas the software just dosnt work because it loses the lines on the road often which is something GM's software seems to do far better with from what I've seen. Both companies have their own advantages but tesla is not miles ahead in practice like what many say. And as for energy we wi have to see the fact that their roof had a 50% increase kinda scares me I mean solar panels are not cheap and a 50% increase is quite a bit though we will have ro see how that plays out."
04/02/2021,stocks,VW is already selling more electric vehicles than Tesla in the biggest EV market.

04/02/2021,stocks,The only metrics that matter are forward looking ones like discounting future cashflows. The ones you mentioned are simple but backward looking. They're only good for initial napkin math or for the lazy. I feel bad for the people that don't understand this as they're likely to underperform perpetually.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah and Apple has iOS and the App Store. They make so much recurring revenue they'd be fine if they didn't sell iPhones for a year.

Tesla is a CAR MANUFACTURER that's priced like it's already the exclusive self-driving tech provider to the world, the only robotaxi company on the planet, and the largest consumer renewable energy company in existence.

Guess what? They are none of those, and it's a stretch to even assume they'll become one of them. All these bets will get commoditized. Tesla makes CARS. Car manufacturing is a historically shitty business to be in.

Could happen,  could go up by even more than that,  or it could go down.   Take VZ for example, it went from ~$61 in December to near $53 in February and now heading back up. Dividend stocks don't move as much as others, but they do move by more than the dividend payment amount. 

Also,  most companies have a quarterly dividend,  so your holding for 60 days,  then selling,  only to buy it again 30 days later.  Why not just hold it for a year, or for as long as you want to keep collecting the dividends?"

04/02/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the reply. I would imagine this strategy would benefit annual dividends or maybe twice a year payments, quarterly seems silly to move your money around.  

The reason why I could see it being beneficial is that I at certain times have money sitting in my brokerage account from selling a stock.  Then the money sits a bit before I find the next ""big thing"" to park my money into. The thing might take some to present itself. I would like to park my money in a annual dividend stock for 2 months receive the dividend, and hopefully the stock is higher or equal to when I invested 2 months prior. Of course all stocks could go down. But instead of risking my investment into something that only benefits me if it goes up. I'm risking my investment into something that benefits me if it goes up or stays the same."

And if you find nothing, and msft is still dipping, then you get to average down.

OP you are asking how to avoid this requirement that was specifically put in place to prevent what you are trying to do... Or in other words, us tell you how to game the system. 

Do you honestly think if there was sure fire way, that loophole would exist still?

More over, generally speaking shorting any stock around the ex-date time is a bad idea, far more times than not, it ensures price stability, if not actually leading to a price ramp towards ex-date.

04/02/2021,stocks,">-During this period, two CAOs one CFO and several GCs were replaced and Tesla restated its financials based on revised revenue recognition relating to lease sales. Red flags abound.

>-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.

https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/audit/articles/a-roadmap-to-applying-the-new-leasing-standard.html

Yes, the accounting standards changed so they were required to do this.

Tesla is also a public company and the auditors would not let them fuck about with the treatment of leases in such a way that cars would be considered an appreciating asset. He made this comment in a general chat not related to Tesla or its accounting. The treatment of future values is one of the specific audit matters looked at by the auditors to assess Tesla's actual consideration of future values, rather than a throwaway comment made by Elon Musk in a separate discussion.

I think I understand:

* Tesla had too many unsold cars
* Exported and entered into a repo agreement with foreign parties
* Repo agreement implies Tesla must buy back the car at full price + interest
* Sneaky part: 
    * Tesla uses robotaxis to justify idea that cars appreciate.
    * When they buy back they make money!!!

If true and if I understand correctly, very tricky.  But even as a TSLA bear, I'm not sure that this is anything more than crafty accounting justified by flimsy but plausible-ish assumptions.  Not sure it's illegal or illegality is provable ... Especially since much of it happened in China.

As someone who works in accounting and have friends that work in the big 4 auditing and auditing field, you will be surprised at how much you can get away with stuff. The big 4 severely underpay their staff and always push their employees to get everything done ASAP.  As a result, a lot of people in the field will be pressured to say everything is correct even when it’s not. 

In Tesla’s case, this hovers an extremely grey line on whether FSD will be able to contribute as an appreciating asset in cars imo. They can argue for this case because their Tesla cars can come with this feature and they’re constantly working on their FSD capabilities making it better and better. 

My point being is that just because a company is public and is audited by the big 4, doesn’t mean they can’t use shady accounting practices and not get away with it."

TSLA changed their revenue standard so they could record leases in full at the time of signing. That was on them. This change was not forced on them as you are suggesting.

It looks like this enables them to have a lower Sales Return Reserve(a liability) as long as the ""customers economic incentive"" AKA Resale Value Guarantee(lol wtf is that and how is it determined?) is above Resale Market Value(again how does TSLA decide this which is in dispute)? Their Sales Return Reserve would be 0 until the car's value lost enough value the customer wanted to bring the car back.

Before this TSLA recorded leases as leases. This change 100% increased their earnings.

Is this fuzzy accounting? Sure. It is abnormal? I doubt it.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Is Amd undervalued?
Have anyone a DD?
What‘s your PriceTarget?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"No. AMD is likely currently fairly valued at best, or possibly even overvalued a bit short and mid-term. 2+ years long term? probably fine but that might be murky too.   

The quick hitting points:

Higher than average PE paired with lower than average EPS

Lower than industry median margins paired with a chip shortage that impacting volume

Strategy flaw where they left a market void in the entry level and mid-range CPU market (price points under $200 and between $300 and $400) where Intel's new release is poised to land at and clean up. AMD still sits as king of the high performance chips, but that is a smaller percent of CPU sales. 

Did I mention chip shortage?

Intel releasing new GPUs and leaked info appears to indicate they will compete pretty well with higher end AMD and NVIDA cards. If the leaked specs are to be believed... Intel is putting out a pretty  insane GPU, easily on par with current 3080s at similar (MSRP, of course) $699 .  Of course that is leaked intel tease, but if reality is even in the zip code, this is a big problem for AMD and NVIDA.  They are also releasing  mid-range and entry level GPUs 

Because Intel makes their own chips, and can supply the market. anyone hesitant to try an intel chip might take the leap because they could actually get one. 

Long story short, AMD being a fabless chip makers is really putting them in a bind with the chip shortage, I can't feel good about the price in the short term and long term is murky because some inherent advantages AMD has built over the last couple years are being hampered by the inability to get products to market and unattractive margins. Intel, probably by pure luck, is getting it assed saved by this pandemic. Intel has a window to close the gap... they really do."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Okay hear me out, if AMD can succeed beating Intel in desktop CPU and Nvidia in desktop GPU, then it should have a market cap of equivalent to INTC+NVDA, so about $500B. AMD is currently trading around $100B, so theoretically it can reach $400 per share.

lmao yes I don't think AMD is ""overlooked"" nor ""undervalued"", but I do think it is at a good entry point right now."
04/02/2021,stocks,"after all we have seen from Intel, I would be fucking surprised if they came anywhere close to NVDIA or AMD. they are probably gonna come up with some ""fake"" benchmarks again."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Nice idea! Since this is for a long timeline and it’s really hard to predict individual stocks over that time, why not go with a market-wide index like VT to reduce risk?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"That early in their lives, VOO or SPY and let it ride."
04/02/2021,stocks,Could also add KO and/or PEP; MSFT and/or AMZN.
04/02/2021,stocks,VGT if you're not pulling out for 10 or 20 years.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’d put the bulk in VTI because considering they won’t touch this money for at least 14 years, and likely longer, a lot can change during that time. VTI will capture all trends and there’s a chance it outperforms all of these names."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I set up custodial accounts for our kids a month ago too.  I used a mix of mutual funds and ETF’s and picked a handful of stocks for various reasons.  Index funds to give everything else some solid backing, dividend funds to demonstrate how they can get paid to own stocks, Ark ETF’s to add a little higher risk higher reward, DIS to give them something relatable, T for dividends again, and VIAC because it was a steal at $45. I plan to add more positions as I go until they’re old enough to get involved in the decision making."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Be sure to pick something they are interested in as well. It will get them interested in stocks a lot earlier than other kids. That gives you an opportunity to teach them how it works and to understand ups and downs and everything else that goes along with it.

They will learn the value of money a lot sooner too."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I woud simply drop abput 60% into an S&P 500 ETF. better coverage of all sectors.

30% small-mid cap

20% emerging markets ETF. 

whatever you do, time is on your side. good idea and good luck !!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Put at least half in an index. That way when you hand it over to them they will see that index investing is best.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Good thought...I guess because they have their whole lives, I'm not too worried about risk mitigation for them.  That said, I did try to identify solid companies in each sector (they're all in the S&P), so I'm not out here buying them GME or anything 😆"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I had that thought as well....I think SPY averages close to 10% annualy over the last 20yrs, so that could be sizable for them for sure.  Also debating looking for dividend companies that keep pace or beat the S&P over the last 5yrs to try and go after growth with some level of consistency."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I thought about KO....good call out.

04/02/2021,stocks,"That's a very viable play....total market ETFs are pretty safe though.  I like that for my IRA, but I guess there's part of me that feels like I need to give the kids individual stock exposure.  But I very well could be wrong.  Seems like a lot of folks are going the ETF route, so that may be the right approach.   Thanks!"

04/02/2021,stocks,"Well, it’s up to you, but that timeline is exactly the reason to choose an index IMO. It is really hard to beat the market with stock picking, so you are taking extra risk without any clear benefit. Risk is only worthwhile if it brings greater reward.

If you want solid investments that will be around in decades, an index gets you that while also diversifying. If the biggest growth in the next two decades happens in small caps, VT has that. If it’s in international, VT has that. Etc. Again, it’s your money, but I personally don’t see the advantage of picking one company from each sector, which is very volatile, over picking an index with every company from each sector, which should approximate the same gains but with much more stability."
04/02/2021,stocks,Maybe that's the new plan... buy deep OTM call options for 2023 in essentially penny stock companies (who have options available) and hope for the best.   Now THAT'S a strategy!!!!

Once  Federal legalize it, banks will open up and corporate money will flow into US Weed producers domestically and once its started to get traded outside the pink slip, retails will pick it up.

04/02/2021,stocks,Hasn't this merger been in talks / announced since Feb though?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Fact is, no one knows where each stock will be when the day of the merger comes. After the reverse merger with Tilray, Aphria holders will get 0.8381 shares of TLRY for each APHA they hold.. so depending on the price arbitrage, Aphria may or may not be a better buy"
04/02/2021,stocks,"The arbitrage play would be to buy 4/14 ATM calls on APHA, while also buying 4/14 ATM puts on TLRY. That way when the prices align to their “true” value ratio of 0.83 you make a profit. 

The easier and probably less risky play is to buy APHA, they are currently under valued according to the 0.83 ratio. But it’s still possible that both APHA and TLRY drop in price in order to align with the ratio so it’s not a guarantee that you’ll make money. 

I am currently holding APHA shares."
04/02/2021,stocks,The benefit of owning Tilray over Aphria is that there is a very small chance the merger doesn't go through. Then you're left holding Aphria shares priced in near the assumption of the merger of the 2 companies.
04/02/2021,stocks,The merger will make Tilray + Aphria = Tilray Inc. so imo I'd go Tilray since they're keeping the name and using that as their trading handle for Toronto stock.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Part of the appeal of APHA/Tilray or other Canadian companies is that they have a strong presence in Europe/Asia as well, at least regarding APHA/TLRY.

To be sure, whenever cannabis is decriminalized/legalized federally in the USA, American weed stocks will be prime time material. APHA/TRLY will be in a position to hold some market share for sure, but I doubt many holding bet on them dominating the American market. But who knows, eh?

I'm personally more interested in them because of their strong European presence, not so much the potential for American legalization. 

I can't speak too much on American weed stocks, my apologies!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Ride the hype towards legalization. Think of it as investing into Budweiser when liquor prohibition ended.
04/02/2021,stocks,"US is not going to legalize it, which is the sole argument of bulls. Manchin will never vote for it. Biden has already said he is against it and will not sign any executive orders.

Dems are in danger of losing the House in 2022, and there are no close Senate races. So, the earliest it would even be legalized is after 2024 assuming the Dems control both House and Senate, which, imo, is a huge assumption with all the vote suppression laws going into effect.

Regardless of all that, its simply cheaper to buy weed on the black market.

Just, my opinion, but the weed market is ruining solely on misguided hopium."
04/02/2021,stocks,cannabis is medicine. The farms they produce help people around the world.
04/02/2021,stocks,No because the size of the new company will be more than double. The number of new shares won't affect the stock price since that factor was taken into account when they decided what the .8381 conversion rate would be.
04/02/2021,stocks,MSOS and chill
04/02/2021,stocks,"MSOS only holds US multi-state operators; no Canadian cannabis exposure. However, just about every other cannabis ETF has TLRY & APHA as its top holdings. I hold CNBS and MJ myself. As soon as I turn a profit on MJ, I'm selling it for MSOS."

04/02/2021,stocks,why wait for the us to pick it up when canada is already doing it?
04/02/2021,stocks,Don't you mean added to your existing \*TLRY\* shares. APHA company and shares will cease to exist after the merger.
04/02/2021,stocks,Would you recommend trading in both?
04/02/2021,stocks,I believe there will be two option chains after the merger the original (such as yours) will represent about 83 shares per contract. And a new chain with 100 share contracts.
04/02/2021,stocks,Chuck Schumer is literally saying he’s very close to introducing legislation with some of his colleagues. We can only hope for now though
04/02/2021,stocks,"With the March jobs report coming out strong, the Dems should have quite a bit of public support behind them in the near-term. If they frame this bill as boosting the economy and making it a state’s rights type bill, then they might see enough Republican support.

Granted, that’s my hope since I’m long APHA."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This. Long term.

Federally legal would lead to the people demanding the release of hundreds (thousands?) of prisoners convicted on marijuana related offenses.

Not sure the powers that be want to let that happen.

EDIT: yet"
04/02/2021,stocks,The problem is even if it is federally legal they would still need to be licensed in each individual state. States aren't going to let cannabis be imported from other states let alone other countries. I want to hear about a plan to buy licenses otherwise I'm very skeptical they will be able to maintain their market cap post merger.
04/02/2021,stocks,TLRY @ $50 here. Still waiting for it to dip around $20 to average down.
04/02/2021,stocks,I remember when it dipped to 30 and seemed like it found it’s bottom. Ahhahahah. Glad I got out even. Was hairy for awhile.

04/02/2021,stocks,They already trade across the border. Do a little research before you talk. Also most of these big companies like Tilphria have well-established businesses I'm sure are ready for the transition to marijuana production.
04/02/2021,stocks,Time to bring down my APHA average...I bought near the peak and average 19.20 now.
04/02/2021,stocks,"You mean the opposite, correct? You would certainly want to have APHA instead of TLRY if the merger were to fall through."
04/02/2021,stocks,So my aphria shares will be converted over to Tilray?
04/02/2021,stocks,"If the merger fails APHA is the safer one to hold. It's a reverse merger, APHA is absorbing TLRY, they are just keeping the name and ticker as it's more well known. APHA CEO is taking over. It's all in the merger information on their sites."
04/02/2021,stocks,Canada has $99/ounces which beat black market prices. The weed is also tested and safe. Can't say the same about organized criminals growing for the black market.
04/02/2021,stocks,"That’s true, but I worry that future growth is already priced in. All the Canadian companies are up 100-300% this past year. Not to mention, how many of those places you mentioned will legalize cannabis in the near future? 

Not to say the Canadian cannabis companies are bad investments, I just think the US companies have more growth potential with legalization potentially on the horizon. And unless you trade OTC, I believe MSOS is the only way to get that US exposure."
04/02/2021,stocks,I parked mine at MO (Altria).  Low beta stock with steady growth .  They will buy the competition once it’s legal.
04/02/2021,stocks,US weed market is way bigger .  The projected sales is 6 times bigger than Canada and that’s without Federal legalization with half of states only allows it.  The payout is way bigger
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes the name will become TLRY just any APHA shares you currently have before the merger it will get an increase of .86% after the merger is complete
04/02/2021,stocks,It can’t hurt ... Tilray is currently a little more expensive but I don’t know if they will be a bump in price per share for Tilray share holders
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah but that doesn't mean dudes like Joe Manchin, who have been quite anti-weed before, are gonna roll over and let it go through without being a mega pain the in the ass for 6 months."

04/02/2021,stocks,Why would anyone want to go to a state dispensary and pay outrageously high taxes.  Plenty of good good goin around.  Or grow your own..
04/02/2021,stocks,Agreed
04/02/2021,stocks,They buy options to purchase MSOs once they are federally decriminalized. Case in point: CGC and Acherage
04/02/2021,stocks,It’ll come back hard and you will both be picked up along the way. No question. The 2018 boom will repeat itself again. We are still early in this game.
04/02/2021,stocks,The Canadian Canabis companies have agreements in place to purchase MSO.
04/02/2021,stocks,They absolutely do not trade a substance categorized by the federal government as category one across the US border
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’ve been buying on the dips and selling highs, made like 40% returns doing that. Holding about half what I want to be holding at the moment, will buy more if it dips this coming week!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes. The calculation is 1 TLRY = 0.8381 APHA. If you have 100 shares of Aphria you'll receive 83 shares of Tilray + 0.81 cash.
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes as I understand it aphria holders will receive .86 tilray shares per aphria share at time of merger. A while back when aphria was tracking tilray lower in it was a better idea to hold aphria shares but now it's much of a muchness.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure you understand the math.  The conversion is 1 APHA to 0.8381 TLRY.  TLRY stock is 1:1 - you keep what you have.

It isn't an increase of .86% (which is less than one percent increase).  

If you have 100 shares of APHA, you will have 83 shares of TLRY plus some cash (for the partial share) after the merger.  The cash represents .81 x $22.34 (if it were to close at today's price)

So 100 APHA @ 18.12 = $1812.00
And 83 TLRY @ 22.34 = $1854.22 
Plus .81 share worth $18.09 cash.

Somebody check my math"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Back in Feb the difference was pretty nuts, and both of them went through spikes in price before leveling back out. APHA actually rides out at 18 now, and it was closer to 14 or so in Feb, but it spiked pretty high in the 20s, maybe low 30s, I haven't looked recently.

It's muuuuch closer to the ratio now, but still slightly in favor of holding APHA shares. I made some money on APHA during that time buying at the low selling near the high, and I dipped out for the past month or so before opening up a small position again last week. Tilray went through a similar spike and level, but I only ever had my toes in APHA."

Also, high taxes haven't stopped sales in the states that have legalized rec weed."

And at least near me, the black/grey market prices are still much more expensive than dispensary weed. 10 or 15 a g at least for anything decent, and even then you get CBD crap half the time depending on who you deal with.


As far as growing... it smells, a lot. It's just not feasible for a lot of people in illegal states. Not to mention the electricity, and that growing a plant with high THC takes some effort and research, it's not a plant and forget type of deal.

So, yeah, there's definitely a sizeable market for legal weed retail of not just plant, but also the various products derived from the plant."

""No Fractional Shares
In no event shall any Aphria Shareholder be entitled to a fractional Tilray Share. Where the aggregate number of Tilray Shares to be issued to an Aphria Shareholder as Consideration under the Arrangement would result in a fraction of a Tilray Share being issuable, the number of Tilray Shares to be received by such Aphria Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Tilray Share.""

04/02/2021,stocks,If you get a response can you report back?
04/02/2021,stocks,Thanks for looking up that documentation and linking it. I was sure I saw the fractional share was rounded down during the many APHA DD arbitrage threads. Thanks again!
04/02/2021,stocks,yea

2021-04-02 18:16:56,stocks,"Tencent's Timi gaming studio generated $10 billion in 2020 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG

The $10 billion would make Timi the world's largest developer, the sources say, which many industry watchers had suspected to be the case.

It also provides a hefty basis for its ambitions to move beyond mobile games and compete directly with global heavyweights developing expensive ""AAA"" titles on platforms such as desktop computers, Sony's PlayStation, Nintendo's Switch and Microsoft's Xbox.

Last week, Tencent reported 156.1 billion yuan ($23.79 billion) in overall online game revenues for 2020 but did not break down revenue for individual studios, which are run independently and compete with each other."
04/02/2021,stocks,"No surprise. It's the studio that made Tencent's version of League of Legends on mobile, and it's wildly popular. Some would say it's the reason why Riot decided to develop mobile version of League of Legends for the West.

 Quick google tells me Timi is making a pokemon MOBA that I never knew before, and I can easily see that being very popular in the future too, considering the IP.

Tencent has some serious cash cows in their gaming department."
04/02/2021,stocks,Tencent made pubg run better on mobile than PC. They are also making the apex legends mobile game. I know nothing about stocks but this company is handing the biggest shooter mobiles that I know of. Not sure how that translates into stocks but they do a good job

2021-04-02 18:04:40,stocks,"How do stock orders get eventually fulfilled when placed during a holiday? I've searched this Reddit and Googled it, and I can't seem to find an answer. I see that during holidays, the stock markets are closed, so orders won't fulfill. But if an order is placed on a holiday, when is the earliest it will fulfill? And what exactly determines the price the stock will be at that point?

For example, TSLA reported higher than expected deliveries. One may want to buy some of their stock, but the markets are closed until Monday morning. If one placed a limit order at $658 (the last price in Thursday's AM) right now on a holiday, what determines if it goes through on Monday or not? Would one want to place a higher limit price to make sure it goes through?

Thank you for helping me understand, fellow investors!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I gets submitted when the market opens after the holiday/weekend as if it was sent on market open.

I personally don’t like to submit orders when the market is closed because of this.  What’s the point?  I would rather just wait to see the prices an hour after market open and buy then.  That’s just me though.

Edit: “fulfilled” to “submitted”.  Whether or not the order is fulfilled depends on market at open."
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s the same as a weekend. Then you’ll have to factor in pre-market on Monday.
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you have a webull account which trades from 4:am till 8:pm and you buy or sell you can watch the sales in the time and sale window, if your broker doesn't open before 9:30am or closes at 4:pm your orders will wait for your brokers open hours.

Note the time and sales each day at 9:30 am, hugh blocks go through within minutes, all the sales from brokers that open at 9:30am.

When you buy through say for example again, webull pre or post market hours, you see the time and sales and the money is deducted from or added to your account."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Thank you! Can you help me understand how limit orders placed before the market opens would fulfill? I guess any limit order would only go through if someone had an ask that matched your bid, which it's entirely possible there wouldn't be, and the order wouldn't go through. Do I have that right?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"News of something could break over the weekend though and point to an obvious direction, so might be helpful to place orders then.  Though I get the risks, but seeing how things gap up/down at the moment of open seems it's just something lots do."
04/02/2021,stocks,"The point I was missing (which I realized in SoapHorse69's thread above) was that PM and AH orders don't actually get fulfilled until 9:30am at market open. Because I have never placed an order in PM/AH (and was cautioned against by Investopedia), I wanted to understand how the orders fulfill, and now I do, thanks to you all. I appreciate it!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"It would fulfill the same as if you placed the order on 9:30am day of market open.  Keep in mind that stocks trade premarket and after hours so the spread will most likely move away from where it was when you placed the order.

If the spread has moved above your limit then the order will remain open for the duration you specified and either fulfill when it hits your limit or expire if it doesn’t, starting on day of market open.  If the spread has moved below your limit you will be fulfilled immediately at the best price available.

Also realize that prices are extremely volatile at market open.  You may be fulfilled at 9:30am at a price much higher than at 10 or 1030, even though both may be within your limit."
04/02/2021,stocks,"The only reasons I could see someone doing that is if they won't be available to enter an order after open, or if they think their order will get fulfilled ahead of others. I guess that begs another question I have: does it benefit at all to enter a limit order before others in PM/AH? I guess processors do have to process pending orders in some order or sequence at 9:30am, so what determines that?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"If news breaks while market closed, a broker with PM/AH trading would be the place to do it, but due to low liquidity it’ll most likely be priced in by the time you hear about it.  Setting a limit order for market open to take into account the PM/AH prices would just be buying at the priced-in price.  What’s the point?

Just my opinion.  Others more advanced may believe differently.  I usually don’t trade PM/AH unless I’m closing out a position I forgot to earlier in the day."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ah, that was a piece of information I didn't have! You mentioned 9:30am, and I just read this on Investopedia in my continuing research: ""Market makers are not permitted to execute orders until the 9:30 a.m. EST. opening bell."" I had no idea the orders weren't actually going through until 9:30. This is very helpful, thank you for your explanations!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"No problem.  Yes, the broker will hold your order and treat it as if it was submitted at 9:30 next market open day.

Just my two cents, what advantage do you think you’d receive from submitting while market is closed?  This is more of a general question, and I might be wrong in this but here goes.

Say it’s trading at $5 now and you submit a buy limit for $5.50 which you believe is a fair potential max entry point.  On market open, one of three things could happen.  Option A: stock trades sideways, there is no difference between submitting now and submitting at market open, all you’ve done is taken on more risk by relinquishing time.  Option B: the underlying moves to $7 in premarket and trends upward in an up day in which case you’d have to adjust your limit anyways after market open if you still wanted to buy, so there’s essentially no difference.  See risk and time above.  Option C: the underlying drops to $4 premarket and you execute at the lower price but you could’ve gotten it at $3.50 if you waited for the downwards trend to normalize by mid morning.  This is all assuming a relatively stable stock trend (up day or down day), and not an extremely volatile stock (in which case all bets are off)."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I totally agree with your described scenarios and that it is nearly always best not to trade in PM or AH (which Investopedia and all other reading I've done agrees with). Again, the part I was confused by that I didn't read anywhere else was that orders aren't actually going through in PM/AH. Sounds like it's basically just an huge list of bids/asks that begin fulfilling immediately at market open. And another reason I could see someone putting in a limit order before PM: they think they are getting ""ahead"" of others putting in their orders; that their order will be fulfilled ahead of others' orders. I wondered if that was the case, but you've helped me realize that is not what's happening."
04/02/2021,stocks,One last question: is there any benefit at all to entering your own limit order as early as possible during PM/AH? Could you like get your order in ahead of others for when they fulfill starting at 9:30? Or would that only apply in the far-off chance multiple people bid the exact same amount or something?
04/02/2021,stocks,"PM/AH is offered by brokers but it varies depending on the company.  Some may offer extended hours trading by default, some you’ll need to call to activate, others will not offer at all.  You can look into that if it’s something you’re interested in.

Just keep in mind that prices are more volatile in PM/AH due to the reduced liquidity (less traders/shares active)."
04/02/2021,stocks,No idea.  Seems like an internal brokerage thing.  Sorry.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes, certainly! I found all that great info on Investopedia as well, but just had some misunderstandings putting it all together, which you helped me straighten out. 👍

Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2021. In total, it delivered 184,800 vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

All of the electric vehicles it produced were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, though it also delivered 2,020 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.

Tesla stock is still overvalued at current price. The delivery beats even with the chip shortage is amazing and chip shortage issue should be only temporary. With today strong job number, bond yield might raise again and Monday there might be tech stocks selloff again. Investors could buy tesla around $600 and hold for long term. Tesla should be able to mitigate the chip shortage issue.

04/02/2021,stocks,Congrat to the team..jesus..
04/02/2021,stocks,"Deliveries up 109% and production up 76% YoY. And they even beat the previous record Q4. Beats analyst estimates from Factset of 168k (ranging from 145-188k) despite major headwinds. 

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, there were rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k). This would mean Tesla could expand their BEV market share from 23% in 2020 to 23-30% in 2021 (based on projections for BEV market to grow 50-70% this year). All this despite increasing “competition”. Seems to me like the EV market is not a zero sum game and is in fact positive sum. Each new EV isn’t competition for old EVs but rather competition for ICE cars and growth for the overall EV market."

04/02/2021,stocks,Coming to China only as of now. Hopefully that changes though.
04/02/2021,stocks,At the rate their going that car will look uglier than a prius
04/02/2021,stocks,"The weird bias in this person's reporting of the news is flagrant. TSLA beat expectations, DESPITE a fire and covid, and brought new models to market during that time. This is a big win."
04/02/2021,stocks,Op is trying to twist this as negative news he must be desperate lol.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, they totally overshot that number."

04/02/2021,stocks,"There was a few leaked reports of a recent company wide call in Tesla and the management had an internal expectation of 1 million delivery this year. 

And the worst part for the shorts and naysayers...during the same call they said 2022 and 2023 would be even more amazing."
04/02/2021,stocks,"As of this year Tesla is tanking a bit in the Netherlands and VW is up big.. together with Norway one of the biggest EV markets is NL.

Reason being that NL is capping subsidies to 40k (VW pricing) and Tesla starts at 60K+"
04/02/2021,stocks,Ford produced 14k and delivered 6k Mach E’s. Not impressive haha all the cars are stuck at expensive dealerships
04/02/2021,stocks,"Here are some of the Tesla killers being mentioned here and on r/SPACs

Lucid: 0

Canoo: 0

Nikola: 0

Lordstown: 0

Fisker: 0

Rivian: 0

Of course the Chinese EVs are delivering non-zero numbers, but they are not allowed to be sold in US, so they are not real Tesla killer."
04/02/2021,stocks,Volkswagen is growing quickly. Tesla is losing market share in Europe.

04/02/2021,stocks,"What if some other company has the next tech breakthrough allowing driving down prices?

Most likely, prices will go down at a similar rate for most brands."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Very well could be the case. Although this would probably apply to most retail stocks. I just know that however much money I make with GME, roughly 50% of that is going into TSLA."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t think so. Even if GME moons, I think it’s more likely they get into things like SPACs and want to catch the next big thing. Tesla might move too slow for those folks"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Do you really think that FANBOYS are the ones driving the price in either of those?

EDIT: To clarify, I believe that rotation and other factors (yields etc) drove an amount of big money to re-opening, leaving the more ""unsafe"" bets like Tesla to fare on its own for a while.

As long as TSLA keeps doing great (with big news like this, panning out to collaborations with other tech giants, releasing the first of its kind commercial FSD, etc) the big money will come back, as their value rotation will saturate quite quickly, and big gains can only be found in innovation.

As far as GME is concerned, big money is once again who has the initiative in making the price move. The extreme volatility (which can ONLY be manipulated like that with GME, no other ticker will go down \~50% on a day, and then when it reverses people will still see it as a chance to throw in more money) is making some HFs millions."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I would rather worry about what could happen to Tesla the next time the market sees a correction.

The Nasdaq lost 7%, how much did Tesla drop in the meantime?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"If I recall correctly (which is a big leap of faith), TSLA started to fall when Elon started talking about bitcoin. Remember, correlation is not causation."
04/02/2021,stocks,Don't forget to post your loss porn after that please
04/02/2021,stocks,The only way Tesla reaches $1000 stock price again is for shorts to be squeezed
04/02/2021,stocks,I don’t think making outrageous assumptions and offering up a 3x BEAR case is substantial  “due diligence”
04/02/2021,stocks,"> compared to Arks due diligence

Fidelity's due diligence has TSLA fair value at $390, and Fidelity has a much larger research/analytics team with much more collective experience than ARK. 

ARK also is heavily invested in low-liquidity stocks trading at 500x earnings, from unprofitable companies, so buyer beware."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Lol did you read the dd? The bear case assumes 60b in revenue for human ride share and 40% margins on insurance (15% is typical). The bear case is that within 3 years they completely take over businesses they aren't currently a part of, it's rosy as hell."
04/02/2021,stocks,Refresh model S / X aren't being delivered yet.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Those are deliveries of the pre-refresh model. They haven’t produced any refresh model S/X vechicles yet, although it seems like they’re planning on doing so in Q2"
04/02/2021,stocks,If it works in China they're almost certainly going to adapt it for other markets.
04/02/2021,stocks,"And this Q is 2 days shorter. AND Fremont shut down for \~2 days with the chip shortage. 

AND 'the competition came'."
04/02/2021,stocks,"They literally grew over 100% from the previous Q1 also lol. 

Pretty amazing quarter for them."
04/02/2021,stocks,Not to mention chip shortages!  Interesting that NIO broke news of chip shortage worries but then also beat delivery expectations.
04/02/2021,stocks,The writer of the article is Lora Kolodny who is a known TSLA bear and takes every opportunity to shit on TSLA and Elon haha
04/02/2021,stocks,Must have took out a short position during the tech selloff
04/02/2021,stocks,It looks like they edited the post. Do you guys remember what he said originally?

04/02/2021,stocks,"$LOTZ where are you on this one?  Innovate, show your worth.  Offer to give these vehicles a road show when you have spare seats on those vehicle transfers!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I hold tsla, but I’m pretty sure Ford said they would only make 50000 Mach E this year. I don’t know anything about demand, but they’re clearly supply strained"
04/02/2021,stocks,the Mach E is going to do some damage i think. I've had my model 3 since 2018 and test drove a Mach E this week and was very impressed. It's going to pull in a lot of first time EV  buyers.
04/02/2021,stocks,Really? That's interesting because [the official numbers](https://eu-evs.com/bestSellersCharts/ALL_DAILY/Brands/Line-Cumulative/Quarter-by-Days/2021/1) show VW doing quite poorly this quarter while Tesla is still around 20% market share despite not even having a factory here. Let's see how that's going in a year when Berlin is up and running.
04/02/2021,stocks,tesla doesn't even have a factory in Europe yet dumbass.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Euhm he said big production miss when according to all analysts forecasts this a beat, thats misrepresenting information. He edited it away now btw so its no longer visible. He had a long line about this missed production numbers was sign it was due to fall.

Im a tesla bear myself but this is positive news and it should be presented that way."
04/02/2021,stocks,Mhm
04/02/2021,stocks,There's no tech breakthrough. There's only incremental improvement over years and ramping of production.
04/02/2021,stocks,"But tsla is the ultimate ape investment, leaving gme aside.

Thanks you for your reply"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Hahaha just don’t go all in on Tesla please.

This will hurt you so bad"
04/02/2021,stocks,The DD is backed by analysis and simulations taking into account multiple parameters and assumptions. It’s certainly more thorough than “Omg tesla is so overvalued!?!?”
04/02/2021,stocks,Fidelity has also been incorrect by lightyears with their estimates on Tesla.
04/02/2021,stocks,"They have definitely produced them, they've been spotted on many occasions. Just not delivered yet."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think it’s more of an issue of being able to make it cheaply enough in other countries to still eek out a profit. Right now it’s only possible in China (cheap materials, labor, and advanced factory). But hopefully with giga Berlin and Austin, other countries will get there eventually as well."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Although shorting Tesla is never a good idea, this quarter was a huge beat by most bulls expectations. A lot of Tesla bulls were expecting a delivery miss this quarter in the mid 160k range due to a minor Fremont fire, minor chip shortages and the model S/X refresh, so this is even more impressive for the bulls haha."
04/02/2021,stocks,He claimed they missed their production window and this is exactly why the stock is to expensive.
04/02/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/02/2021,stocks,Tbh I think that the car is decent per reviews. Just that Ford will have negative margins due to high battery prices and low volumes. No serious volume expectations.
04/02/2021,stocks,"How are they supply constrained? If they made 14k this quarter that makes sense that they are on target, if not ahead of target to produce 50k Mach E's this year. However, they only sold 6k. If that trend continues throughout the year, then they are actually demand constrained because they would only sell about 24k. Less than half of what they plan or are on track to make this year."
04/02/2021,stocks,You can't be supply constrained if there isn't enough demand for the supply
04/02/2021,stocks,"Europe is not made by 3 countries, those numbers give a very incomplete picture"
04/02/2021,stocks,They dropped from 35% market share in 2019 to  13% in 2020. Competition is unmistakably gearing up
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ok dude. They didn’t have one in the past either, and their market share is shrinking. Where did I lie"
04/02/2021,stocks,Nothing about what I said indicates my plans or me condoning going all in on Tesla.
04/02/2021,stocks,"The analysis is filled with blue sky assumptions that should be critically evaluated. A few examples:

- The growth rate is significantly higher than Tesla itself has mentioned 
- The insurance business is supposed to become one of the biggest players in that market, while also making insane margins
- Car margins are somehow going to almost double despite much more competition and lower sales prices
- Ride hail, autonomy etc which don’t currently exist 
- Insane margins on the above 

You can get to a 5T market cap for WeWork too with the right assumptions."
04/02/2021,stocks,"The DD is strictly aimed to retail traders. I linked a Financial Times article some time ago that made fun of it.

They couldn't predict proper tesla estimates even if they were looking backward in time."
04/02/2021,stocks,"LOL ok. 

The ARK-TSLA cult has spoken! debate is over!

y'all are fooling yourselves and Cathie Wood is deluded. she was on Jack Hough's podcast and predicting over 20% returns going forward. not likely. her funds are seeing massive inflows and outflows, up to and over half a billion dollars a day. these are abnormal trading patterns that distort markets.

EDIT - also it's foolish IMO to invest in single stocks on the basis of projections about where the price might go in X years under conditions Y or Z. that's the precise opposite of what most successful professional investors do, rather they invest if the price TODAY is reasonable. today, Tesla is overvalued by a factor of 2x or maybe 3x its intrinsic value. buying in hopes it will continue to appreciate above fair value is not a good strategy, because historically everything reverts to the mean."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Those are manufacturer test/prototype vehicles. At least, I think they are since they aren’t included in the quarterly results. I don’t think they count as produced vehicles otherwise Tesla would have to say how many semi or roadster prototypes they’ve produced"
04/02/2021,stocks,Jesus! Being closed today was bad enough.. you had me scared for a minute
04/02/2021,stocks,Just look 11 of the biggest markets then. Same picture.
04/02/2021,stocks,we've been hearing this for a few years now my guy
04/02/2021,stocks,"""Let me just cherry pick this number and use it in a way that proves my point.""

2020 was plagued by COVID, which made their already troublesome shipping to Europe even more difficult. Obviously they were going to choose to sell more cars near the factory at higher margins. Q1 shows how they're already back to 20%, with Berlin not even up. They're already beating everyone while the playing ground isn't even, let's see how they're doing in a year."
04/02/2021,stocks,"By misframing the argument. You’re framing it as a question of market share when the market for EV’s is growing.  Tesla’s sales in Europe dropped between 7-10% YoY in a pandemic year in Europe, so not good news but not necessarily bad news either. Hard to judge what a pandemic year means for long term trends. New car sales as a whole dropped 24% in Europe over the same time frame. 

Arguing that Tesla is doomed in Europe because there’s EV market share decline is silly though. It’s like saying Apple was doomed after Android started selling smart phones. Oh no! Their market share dropped! Sure smart phones were still a growing market segment... but market share dropped! The sky was falling!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Nice
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ok so you like the bear case, which still has Tesla valued correctly."
04/02/2021,stocks,Thats all well and good except right now she’s right and everyone else has been wrong 😂
04/02/2021,stocks,remindme! 9 years
04/02/2021,stocks,Curious what your overall account return is with this mindset? Are you beating the S&P? How about the nasdaq?

04/02/2021,stocks,"When an asset manager puts out a bear case for a company 4 years in the future that’s 3x the current price that should be a red flag to you.

04/02/2021,stocks,Which is why you’re ignoring the substance of the argument for the sarcastic histrionics. Do I really have to put “ /s” after what was obviously a rhetorical flourish? Or are you just fighting strawmen for fun?
04/02/2021,stocks,"> When an asset manager puts out a bear case for a company 4 years in the future that’s 3x the current price that should be a red flag to you.

Unless you actually researched the company yourself and came to the same conclusion.

Anyone who looked into the numbers of robotaxis wasn't surprised by ARK's price target. Of course it could be that Tesla won't get it working before 2025 and it will be a few years later, but as soon as they solve it they'll instantly be the biggest company in the world. Anyone who really took some time to research the opportunity here realizes that."
04/02/2021,stocks,Why is that a red flag? It shows high confidence in the company and leadership to atleast execute a solid portion of their master plan
04/02/2021,stocks,"It means Tesla’s PT is closest to her PT, something she put forward well before the run up, and people mocked her then. It sounds like the counter argument will be “just wait for the eventual crash!” 

Ok, ill keep waiting.

I dont even hold Tesla 😂

I swing trade options. I’m good with whatever, I love the volatility."
04/02/2021,stocks,"A “growth” stock already has significant growth priced into it. To say that there is no obstacles along the way that could hinder that growth is absurd. E.g what happens if the insurance business or ride sharing doesn’t pan out? What happens if they can’t meet growth targets? What happens if margins decline due to competition? 

A true bear case has conservative projections, not a 3x increase in market cap in 4 years."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Exactly, ARK doesn’t foresee any of that happening. They think Tesla is so far ahead that other companies won’t make to big of a dent on their future barring something unexpected like a natural disaster"
04/02/2021,stocks,ARK also foresees vehicle margins doubling to nearly 50% despite Tesla selling cheaper models and competition increasing dramatically. How is this even possible?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’m guessing it’s because of Tesla gradually improving their vehicle building process via things like casting the entire frame of the vehicle as one piece. The recent news that Tesla is collaborating with other manufacturers (like Toyota) to build cheaper vehicles could also play a part. As for the competition, they aren’t even close to range, and they still have to figure out how to get enough batteries and make their cars competitive at a similar price to Tesla’s vehicles"
2021-04-02 16:35:29,stocks,"Job growth booms in March at highest level since August https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/us-jobs-report-march-2021.html


Job growth boomed in March at the fastest pace since last summer as stronger economic growth and an aggressive vaccination effort pushed companies to step up hiring, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6%.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

The report comes amid a slew of other indicators pointing to stronger growth as the U.S. tries to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. States and municipalities across the country continue to reopen after a year of operating at reduced capacity.

Business activity has returned to close to normal levels in much of the company despite the restrictions, with a tracker by Jeffries indicating that activity is at 93.5% of its pre-pandemic level.

Data from Homebase shows that employees working and hours worked both gained sharply over the past month, with significant improvements in both hospitality and entertainment. Those have been the hardest-hit sectors, but have improved over the past two months as governments have loosened up on some of the harshest restrictions on activity.

At the same time, manufacturing is enjoying a boom, with an Institute for Supply Management gauge of activity in the sector hitting its highest level since late 1983 in March.

The pace of gains combined with the unprecedented level of government stimulus has kindled worries about inflation, though Federal Reserve officials say any increases will be temporary.

The Fed is keeping a close eye on the jobs data, but policymakers have said repeatedly that even with the recent improvements the labor market is nowhere near a point that would push the central bank into raising interest rates."
04/02/2021,stocks,My question is how was this not priced in already
04/02/2021,stocks,"Almost a million jobs for the economy this month is awesome and we've recovered 62% of jobs lost since the start of COVID (8.4 million jobs still lost / 22 million jobs lost at the start). Great momentum for stock earnings and it kind of sucked I wasn't part of the almost 1 million to get a job, but I'm excited and going to keep applying this month 😄!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Sounds like more bond yield madness is on the horizon
04/02/2021,stocks,I guess it's going to be a GREEN monday!
04/02/2021,stocks,"For 8 mega-companies, yes. Small business not so much."
04/02/2021,stocks,Maybe a rough Monday for tech
04/02/2021,stocks,Great news. I guess that means it will be a red monday lol.
04/02/2021,stocks,BUT MUH MARKET CRASH

04/02/2021,stocks,The market has been pricing in the recovery since April. That's why the market continued upward even as COVID cases were rising and job losses were increasing at the time.
04/02/2021,stocks,February and March was the absorption of the rapid rise in yields. That shockwave was absorbed. Personally don’t see tech stocks getting blown up again - think we’ve priced that pain in. In fact yields rose Wednesday and that didn’t deter Weds/Thurs gains.
04/02/2021,stocks,The stockmarkets priced in the death of the sun too

04/02/2021,stocks,Did the report mention wage growth though?
04/02/2021,stocks,Bond yields don't mean anything.  Media labeled them as the reason for this recent correction but I really doubt that
04/02/2021,stocks,Why do you say? Trying to understand how all these other things mentioned in OP's post are related to this.
04/02/2021,stocks,"In NYC at least, over the past month, there definitely has been a huge reopening surge in small businesses."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t know, I was just walking around my city a few days ago and I saw hiring signs in a lot of store windows. It’s pure conjecture of course, but these were small businesses."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Kind of doubting this, honestly. What happened in February and March was a shockwave: rates skyrocketed, putting a huge dent in growth stocks relatively consistently for 6 weeks. 

I would say we have sufficiently priced in any yield rises up to or just above 2%. Now if we blow through 2% then I think you may see more sell offs."
04/02/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/02/2021,stocks,I know right. These bearish idiots should have known the feds would print 6x the money supply.
04/02/2021,stocks,"No it hasn’t been pricing in recovery since April, it has been pricing in infite QE since April, but now it looks like we might recover faster than expected , which could put pressure on equities short term , basically doing the opposite of what was expected last year . The dollar represents the economy , not the market ."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yea but we are 30% above pre covid highs like it's already been priced in and more

04/02/2021,stocks,Wage growth is not the only kind of growth.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Bond yields rise when the economy is strong or expected to be strong. Stock market prices fall when bond yields rise. 

A few more months way over the expected amount like this and I would be shocked if the market didn’t correct."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Huge? I mean it's coming back for sure, but the numbers are coming in from Wal-Mart/Target/Lowes/HD/Amazon and they're huge. But it's not a great sign for overall economy when only the giants are flourishing."
04/02/2021,stocks,"They're hiring because they lost their employees; not adding more. I run a small business and can tell you that it's been a huge pain in the ass, as Target and Wal-Mart stayed open and barely kept their carts clean."
04/02/2021,stocks,Bond rates going up puts downward pressure on growth stocks.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I thought they would, which is why I figured precious metals would sky rocket. I've been wrong so far, unless we're on the next leg up for PMs. Printing money/adding debt has consequences."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I disagree. The market was pricing in a recovery back to where we were pre-covid, and now we're significantly higher than pre-covid because of 0% interest rates and QE.

The same thing happened in the 2008 crash. Numbers were getting worse and worse in 09, but market started recovering. This always happens in a major crash, the market starts recovering before the data shows that things are getting better."
04/02/2021,stocks,More investors. Demand has increased.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Gotcha. And you believe what has been happening over the past month is not that correction? From what everyone has been saying, the two big recent drops happened from fears of bond yields rising, so would it not already be priced in somewhat at least?"
04/02/2021,stocks,Like it just did?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, small businesses have taken the brunt of the commerce toll over the last year, no doubt. I didn’t mean to imply that they’re expanding, but rather that it hints at a larger optimism and generally correlates to an increase in business if they’re bringing people back on."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yah- how to explain that. Trillion dollar stimulus from Biden, trillion dollar infrastructure plan....and gold is crashing? WTF?"
04/02/2021,stocks,That doesn't make it rational lol
04/02/2021,stocks,Also retail basically dosnt affect the overall market. The new investors are really just institutions taking on margin ro buy more and more at all time low rates
04/02/2021,stocks,"Partially yes. But if job growth is higher than the market expected, that likely means yields are also rising further than expected. It’s the gap between results and expectations that will make the difference. 

No way of knowing exactly how much is priced in already but it’s definitely a trend to pay attention to and be prepared for."
04/02/2021,stocks,"From what I've been told, the bottom is in. I've been holding since last year. My gold stocks are down and my silver ones are at least still up."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well, it does somewhat. I could be wrong as I don't follow this stuff, but I would assume most companies didn't inject additional shares into the market, so the supply was mostly stagnant as the demand increased with the new investors. Now, I certainly don't think the run we had during the pandemic was rational in the incredibly short time frame, but I think it was **certainly** expected. Thats why we're seeing the pull back now."
04/02/2021,stocks,Good info. Thanks
04/02/2021,stocks,"First the higher the stock market goes the more money it takes to push it higher. Retail really dosnt affect t the overall market at all, they can affect small stocks like gme but not the market as a whole. Also what I men is that istatutions and hedge funds are borrowing money to buy shares that is called leverage. So this is what is pushing the market up."
04/02/2021,stocks,">First the higher the stock market goes the more money it takes to push it higher.

So demand increased"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Wrong on the rise. A recent example example look at the jump in premarket on Wed and Thurs. That increase of whole INDEXes of was done with very little money.

On the other hand if you have a stock that opens at what it closed the previous day, rises gradually throughout the day and has a massive volume increase... that's rsi. Anything else is a fugazi."
04/02/2021,stocks,"No as I explained what I'd happening is people are taking out loans at incredibly low rates and this is pushing the market higher, this has been the fundamental problem with every stock bubble dating back to 1929"
2021-04-02 16:20:58,stocks,"drdgold is a growth gold mine and this is the best time to buy it disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview :  founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its  reserves with the   acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid  future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent 

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020, 

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure  .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed,  they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't  functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

&#x200B;

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater  third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations 

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by  those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and  optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful."
04/02/2021,stocks,Your position?
04/02/2021,stocks,"at a glance, the stock is decent. listed on the NYSE which has pretty strict requirements. the stock appears to be overvalued, but the company seems very profitable and has a large cash cushion. South Africa is considered an emerging market, but they have some good companies. 

I don't invest based on long-term projections, I invest if it's a good buy TODAY. and it's not a bad option IMO, but I haven't done a deep dive into quarterly statements or anything."

04/02/2021,stocks,Six monthly report in their case

2021-04-02 15:17:14,stocks,"Does buying same mutual fund mean distinct purchases? Finally paid off student loans and now I have money available to invest. Rather than picking individual stocks, I'm starting with mutual funds. In particular a total stock market fund. I am planning to invest in SWTSX every paycheck.


I bought SWTSX a few weeks ago and then more yesterday. Can anyone explain why it shows up as two different items here rather than one? This list will get super long if I am making the same purchase every two weeks.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Mutual funds are non marginable for 30 days. So, one lot is your marginable funds, the other is your nonmarginable ones."
04/02/2021,stocks,Not 100% certain but I think because mutual funds are priced once daily. They don’t necessarily trade in real-time like stocks/ETF’s. You need to be buying ETF’s rather a mutual fund imo.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I have the same mutual fund, along with two others from Schwab. When you make the initial purchase of a mutual fund you buy in with whatever amount you would like. On my broker interface, when I want to contribute more to each mutual fund, there is an option for doing so. Of course there is also the option to buy the same mutual fund but I believe that would be purchasing a duplicate and not making a contribution to the original fund. This could be what happened with you."
04/02/2021,stocks,Thanks! So it’ll all eventually get combined?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don't see how this is relevant.

It appears to be an issue with how his broker displays things. Nothing about a MF would necessitate this."
04/02/2021,stocks,"> You need to be buying ETF’s rather a mutual fund imo.

ETFs can have some advantages from a capital gains perspective, particularly in a taxable brokerage. but mutual funds are not intrinsically bad, and sometimes can be preferable to an ETF. for active, I'd be inclined to take an experienced fund manager over a new ETF manager. E.g., Will Danoff > anyone at ARK"
04/02/2021,stocks,Thanks! Can you direct me to where you see the option to contribute more to a mutual fund you already have? I’m not seeing it on my end. Thanks!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes. On/about day 31 you will see 2 journal entries in your account history. One to remove them for the non-margin, and one to add them to the marginable."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t know anything about your broker so I’m not sure where to tell you to look. Are use E*TRADE and I can click on the ticker symbol in my portfolio and it will open up the window where I can either buy or sell. When I click by, there is a text box next to the ticker symbol that says contribute to existing fund, or something to that effect. I type in the ticker symbol for the mutual fund I already own in that box and it becomes a contribution instead of a purchase.  I would suggest you talk to someone in customer service with your broker in order to find out exactly how to do the same."
2021-04-02 13:38:59,stocks,"PSA: [Long story] Be aware of Discord channels that discuss ""stocks tips"" based on ""technical analysis"". So I have joined a Discord channel from roughly November to March, after receiving an invitiation in my Reddit inbox.

The channel was original for free, from November to December. Then it had subscription plans starting from January.

Between November to early February, there was a huge Bull market, so of course most of the guy's stocks tips are correct (he primarily bought bitcoin (GBTC), a few Cathie Woods stocks, SPCE, and also apparently a hugh believer of the SPAC PSTH). Everyone started to kind of ""idolizing"" him, without really realizing the performance was mainly based on a strong market.

His advice was mainly based on ""technical analysis"", drawing channels, support lines, resistance lines, etc. So far so good, as I am also a believer of TA. What got real sketchy was, the two terms he often mentioned are ""chair pattern"" and ""U shape pattern"" which, as far as I know, isn't really a thing from the TA point of view.

Anyway here comes mid Feb and late March where NASDAQ was crashing. A lot of his trade ideas werent working, and what he said was merely ""because the market isn't strong enough"". But quite a few of his trades were really headscratching e.g., he added his position in TLRY when the stock was dropping from $80s to $60s within an hour, asked everyone to buy AQB despite it is not fundamentally strong enough, just ""because Cathie buys it"", and also hard selling PSTH and asked people to buy on dips even when it dropped from $32 to $24 within a few weeks just ""because of Bill Ackman"". None of these actions are, in my view, what a technical trader should have done.

And during the majority of days between Feb and Mar, his trade ideas have gone radio silence. He resurfaced again these few days, posting the +% of certain individual stocks to imply that his trade ideas are really good.

He claimed to have achieve a 400% return in the past twelve months, which is a great one. But last time I checked, SOXL and TQQQ have achieved far better return.

Hindsight is 20/20, but IMO a worthy channel should have asked you to do at least these two things in late January:

1. Ask you to rotate out of tech stocks into ""old economy"" stocks.

2. Recommend you to invest in certain inverse bond ETF (TTT was a great one from late Jan to mid March).

TLRY: Moral of the story: Always be skeptical of paid Discord channels. Good performance may only be a result of a strong Bull market. As good as the guy's result is, his performance may be still far behind certain 3x ETFs."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Be skeptical of everyone. Free, paid, whatever. Everyone has a motive"
04/02/2021,stocks,"FWIW - I'm of the opinion that technical analysis cannot be used as the sole reason for investing in any stock.  Technical analysis may very well identify a stock you wish to investigate or confirm 
 your due diligence.

Essentially, an investments needs to be based on fundamental analysis.  Good luck."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is a question the skeptic in my always asks...

If someone is making so much money, then why is he slumming a chat room to scrounge a few bucks? 

These people are clowns, sounds like you are more qualified to have your own room"
04/02/2021,stocks,"beware technical analysis, generally."
04/02/2021,stocks,I got an invitation to Discord page of Lizard King Trading. A lot of noise and hate it. Some other pages of the app might be much better . The fact that MSFT wants to buy Discord makes me think so
04/02/2021,stocks,"I agree, and would add it really takes a combination of FA and TA, along with what I guess you'd call the ""narrative analysis,"" like what can be explained about the stock in plain language, and what your personal beliefs are in the security's future. 

The narrative stuff seems to be all a lot of folks focus on, which is understandable, because FA/TA takes work to understand. I've been really reading up on it over the past few months and it's been revealing just how much Dunning-Krueger effect I had going on. Even just applying basic analysis to stocks I'd bought when I first started trading based on someone's very convincing DD or other narrative stuff showed how unwise the investment was, and how I wished I'd known more about the technical stuff before I really started investing. However, the narrative stuff is still important, because it helps you understand the underlying company (or whatever the stock represents) on a deeper level and helps build long-term confidence.

Overall, the main takeaway is that, whatever kind of research you do, do it yourself, and don't trust someone else to make your decisions for you. And just as you would want to confirm anything with multiple sources, you want to also confirm your investments that way."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Hey guys, I'm new to all this like many others. Recently I've been putting my money into ""safe"" (REITs, blue chip, ETFs) stocks but when I first started I made some pretty dumb penny stock and small biotech purchases (industry I work in - thought it'd be fun) which are currently my worst performing. I bought in early-mid Feb on the way up before the market started turning red.

I'm wondering now if I should cut my losses on these stocks, hold them until they become profitable, or double down on some of the dips.

I am currently down over 25% on VKTX, FLGT, MBIO, ATOS, AZRX and GRCL. Anyone have any opinions on what I should do with these? And for the sake of future decisions, how should one do DD on small biotech stocks that are not yet profitable? Are they just inherently a gamble?"

But I feel extremely lucky to have gotten out of ATOS for a 2% gain after FOMOing in on the back of a Reddit post and learned a bit in the process. Overall, it was a lesson in what Peter Lynch says - ""Invest in what you know"".

In general, what I've learned about the FDA approval process is that it means many hurdles and potentially many years before turning a profit. At any point in that process, if it fails one trial the product, the company's investment all go back to the drawing board. Even beyond the risk of failing the FDA approvals is the risk that, even if it gets approved, whatever product doesn't get used much or another product comes out at the same time that does the same job with fewer side effects or more cost effective or whatever. In other words, it's tons of risk that you have to stick with potentially for years before it might pay off.

It's an industry I know very little about to begin with (you may have a bigger edge there tbf), and with such high amounts of risk I am staying away from that world. If you have the ability to evaluate each company's products and the viability of each product, can keep an eye on other companies and what they are bringing to market, have a good knowledge of how the drug/product/whatever will work, and have a feel for how profitable that drug might be, can estimate how widely used/prescribed it could be, then you might stand a good chance at making a lot of money. You just have to sit and wait and be patient that eventually your confidence and faith will be rewarded. But I can't do any of that nor do I have interest in learning about any of that so I'm staying far away from that world."

My point being: don't base yourself off of what other people are boasting about. Turn your $500 into $1k next time, then into $1,500 and eventually you'll be working in the tens of thousands too.

I'm also very concerned that Hiden Biden and his handlers are going to screw up the utility pools' (Independent System Operator's) financial systems.  The TLDR is that they give regular payments to power plants to exist.  That is the main incentive to drive clean energy to come onto the grid.  They don't need more money on top of that.  They already have PHDs figuring out how much power plants need to get paid to spur more plants coming online.  What Biden is going to do is mess this up.  Imagine hiring an employee for $40K and then training them over time and giving them incremental raises, and then 5 years later they earn $70K.  Then all of a sudden Biden takes some money from your paycheck and some from a loan and hands the employee $20K for no reason.  That is what the Biden plan is to clean energy IMO.  It makes no sense and distorts incentives/existing systems.  Also, people are talking like green energy is new.  There have been solar panel rebate programs for 20 years though, and battery power is happening whether Biden prints money or not."

04/02/2021,stocks,Losses offset your gains. You only pay taxes when you have a net gain in a year. Net loss gives you a credit (technically it just reduces your overall taxable income).

04/02/2021,stocks,Your broker will release a tax form for you at the end of the year. You should only have to pay taxes on a stock sale if you made a profit on that stock sale.
04/02/2021,stocks,The tax rate you pay will depend on how long you've held the stock. if you've held it for under a year you will pay the tax rate for whatever your income bracket is. If you have held the stock for over a year you will pay the capital gains rate which is 15% across the board.

04/02/2021,stocks,Incorrect the 10 year was shifting between dropping and raising  during the days and the nasdaq did not react to it at all. Someone even posted a complete analysis on it here and proved that the correlation in the last 2 weeks was actually a positive correlation instead of the expected negative one albeit very slightly.
04/02/2021,stocks,"So you mean JP bought treasuries, and threw Japan under the bus? You mean he lied to us? bwahaha."

2021-04-02 13:00:56,stocks,Why do inverse ETF’s exist? I get that the purpose of them is solely for shorting/put reasons..? But seriously why do they even exist? Who decided that the stock market should just work in both directions at all times? Why does it seem like there are infinite rabbit holes in the stock market at this point?!?! Lol
04/02/2021,stocks,I mean why would you not want to have that option to play the downward trend. Inverse etfs are great for hedging and if you feel a downturn is coming for securing a short position. I just don't get why not
04/02/2021,stocks,"If a market exists for a product, that product will be offered, in capitalism."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Here's one way to think. Company has some real value apart from stock price. Any stock price deviation from real value is bad. If price is too low, it's unfair to seller. If price is too high, it's unfair to buyer. If you think like that, no market mechanism is bad or good just based on the direction it pushes markets to. Up and down are equally legit directions."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you subscribe to Efficient Market Hypothesis, shorting or opposing a price is a necessary corrective force.  Without it, the market simply relies on selling momentum which isn't exactly efficient."
04/02/2021,stocks,You use them to temporarily hedge 5-10% of your Portfolio (as a retail trader)
04/02/2021,stocks,The market decided the market works both ways. Stocks don't only go up.
04/02/2021,stocks,Especially with the wild and dangerous speculation we see. Lots of super duper overvalued stocks. I jumped out too early and missed some gains but the disconnect from what I see in the economy is growing. Still have money to invest..... just hoping to ride the wave down..... now if someone could just tell me when this bubble will pop.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Looks like someone's mad that people can short their beloved GME stock, what a shame..."
04/02/2021,stocks,Im just so confused on how or why we designed so many different securities that are all purposed for opposing reasons.
04/02/2021,stocks,Makes more sense
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah it can be like insurance.. but what do you mean by temporary? Isnt the point to be holding a large position *well before* a market dip?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Buying an inverse ETF is not the same as shorting. And the main inverse ETfs are for SPY and QQQ, neither of which contain GME."
04/02/2021,stocks,I ask about how ETF’s work and first thing you do is hate on GME. Lol who is the butt hurt one here again?
04/02/2021,stocks,Btw how toxic of you
04/02/2021,stocks,"People like to bet both ways, and in multiple ways. It's not that much different than being able to bet and two different teams in sports, and also being able to bet on more specifics like point spread, particular players doing particular things. It's designed because people want different options, and there's a market for those options."
04/02/2021,stocks,*We* didn't do anything. The powers-that-be found another way to extract money from people. So they did it.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Most inverse-ETF have an insane decay.. so if your expected Fall of let us say $SPY won't happen during the next week, your $UVXY Shares will be loosing a lot."
04/02/2021,stocks,If you look at OPs other comments and posts it becomes quite clear that that is the main point of their question though.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Very true but now this gets into how far the purpose of the stock market itself has come. At one time it was about investing into and supporting a company for its longterm growth. Now its just about finding every possible way to take advantage of the movement of the market, be that up or down."
04/02/2021,stocks,So thats the conclusion I am getting to as well. The elites have come up with more and more creative ways to complicate and skew the market in their favor with all of these endless facets of the market.
04/02/2021,stocks,I just wonder how you time things like that so good that its worth the risk
04/02/2021,stocks,"Very true. Somewhat of an aside, from a personal standpoint I think the markets, both stock and real estate to a degree, have become ""meta"" and far enough from their original purpose and driven by sentiment and expectation of growth and profits, and how those come about, are somewhat devoid of their original purpose. Of course the aspect of helping companies grow is still there, but the expectations and psychology of profits and perception around a company feels like its driving a lot more of these markets than previously because people are trying to game them, and the other people buying into or out of them. I find this especially true of the housing market where I am, where people are buying houses at ever higher and higher prices. Part of this is due to low interest rates and pandemic savings due to having nothing else to spend money on, but part of it is has become so ingrained that housing is only going to go up, that people feel like they need to buy at any cost because ""it must go up further""."
04/02/2021,stocks,$SPY Analysis or you use another hedge
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah so true. The asset market has become a self fulfilling prophecy in a way.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’ve been thinking about this since I bought a house.  The appraisers are paid by the mortgage banks and insurance companies, unless you hire one yourself before purchase.  

The mortgage co. wants a high appraisal to justify the large loan and interest is a percentage of that principal of course.  So the higher the price the better in their eyes.

The insurance company charges premium based on perceived value of the asset, so they want a high appraisal as well.  This became obvious to me when I was paying a huge premium to insure my 10’x15’ plastic shed with about $400 worth of yard equipment inside.  The insurance company had it valued around $20k."
2021-04-02 12:54:00,stocks,"Anybody else betting large on mid-cap tech? Ever since the correction I've been buying large amounts of mid-cap tech that has been heavily beaten down since the correction. Examples are 

- LendingTree ($TREE)
- Overstock ($OSTK)
- Switch Datacenters ($SWCH)
- Shift Technologies ($SFT) 

I feel like these (with the exception of Shift which is more speculative) have been beaten down more than they deserve to and are tried-and-true examples of companies that are likely to do great in 2021 and beyond. 

However, I have no illusions of what will happen if the tech selloff continues for months, which has been reason for me to hedge a bit. With the S&P roaring ever-higher, I'm not feeling particularly comfortable holding these types of stocks right now. 

Anyone else in a similar situation?

04/02/2021,stocks,"I am mostly in small and mid cap stocks. I also took the opportunity to pick up a few more recently. 

There is more volatility in mid and smaller cap names but there is also more potential for outsized returns. There is always a risk in general of market uncertainty or downturns."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. 

First let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.

Disclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.

Apple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.

Disney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.

By the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.

The bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.

FAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.

My favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.

Square, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.

Then you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.

People are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? 

Software companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.

I don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.

Happy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well."

04/02/2021,stocks,"mid cap, yes. I'm overweight or skew towards small and mid cap. they tend to outperform large cap, over time. investors tend to ignore small and especially mid cap funds. 

tech? no. tech tends to get trendy, overbought and overpriced."

I do like shift though, don’t own it yet but could start building a position after their next earnings report."
04/02/2021,stocks,I was holding Overstock until they sold (not really sold but kind of) their block chain and crypto assets holding company. Now it's just home furnishings retailer. Still good company but I would rather put that money somewhere else.

04/02/2021,stocks,"They outsourced them to Pelion ventures, who have had great success with comparable entities in the past. Overstock still holds all the cards with regards to ownership and pays them (if my memory is correct) close to the sum of $50m, which represents less than 10% of the cash they currently have on hand. Outsourcing their blockchain tech was imo a good move and only strengthened my trust in their company's success personally as they can now focus on their core business. Thanks for the feedback!"

2021-04-02 11:35:27,stocks,"Question regarding hedging with an inverse ETF A friend of my mine recently suggested an idea which I thought was very compelling and is something I’m thinking a lot about implementing in my portfolio.

Essentially, it’s that some of the most worthwhile gains in the market are found during bear markets and that by holding approx. 5% of your portfolio in an inverse ETF you will have the opportunity to exit that position for a good gain and scoop up all the bargain bin stocks with your newfound cash.

I’ve been looking at various inverse ETFs, but thought it would be worth getting some more varied perspectives on how to best implement this strategy. Has anyone here executed this before and have advice/feedback on the process?

Something that is of particular concern to me is the prospect on an inverse ETF slowly wearing down to close to zero as a bull market continues. Is this an invalid concern due to the fact that the rest of my portfolio will be performing so well, and I should be willing to view this as a cost of doing business and eat the loss?

Hoping this can spark a discussion below. Very interested in hearing your views.

Thanks in advance."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It sounds good on paper, but it's very hard to execute. Hedging is basically insurance, and like any insurance, it comes at a cost. 

I'd rather take that extra 5% and on a red day either add to my long positions, or try to find something undervalued."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Buy us treasury bond ETF. If everything goes down, it's price will go up. It pays yield every year, and you can hodl forever."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Personally, like US treasuries as a “hedge”.

A lot of inverse/bearish ETF’s are leveraged...sometimes 3x. Just something to be aware of when you’re shopping around. Good luck!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Write puts on UVXY when it reaches new lows (like It's at now). Get assigned on the puts. Write calls on UVXY after assignment on the puts. All the while you're either buying more shares, or writing more puts, of UVXY as it's going down.

Market tanks, you get assigned on the UVXY call(s), and the shares you bought at the lowest lows increase. There, you've just hedged for free."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's tough to ""time the market"" as they say, but things are very frothy lately and I think we are overdue for a major correction at least in some sectors. Some sort of hedging right now is not a bad idea especially if you've been long for a while and already have a lot of profit this year.. The difficulty with hedging using inverse etfs and things like that is you're losing money until you don't. But that don't might be a while off. What you might want to look into is options strategies that would insulate you against loss rather than just a completely bearish play."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it does seem really hard to wield the tool precisely enough."

04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m liking the sound of treasuries as an option too. Am going to keep doing some research on UVXY and consider wheeling that like another commenter here suggested.

2021-04-02 10:49:19,stocks,"How to pick which part of position to sell? When mixing cash and margin Say for example I bought abc stock with CASH at $30 a share for 100 quantity, and also 100 shares with CASH for $32.. but also bought 200 shares  at 32$ on margin.. how do I sell/reduce position where only the 200 margin position sells?

Thanks, I use Td ameritrade"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Margin is used last and sold first.

If you buy 10 shares for 100 bucks each (1k total), and the stock goes to 1000 dollars, you would still only owe 1k + fees.

Don't use margin. There is actually very little reason to use it for the average trader."
04/02/2021,stocks,So I would make 10000 and pay a 1000.. 10% .. seems decent to me actually
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s nice to have margin active just in case you want to make a quick buy but your deposit is not in from your bank. It’s sort of a reserve tank to get you to the gas station. Some (most) brokers let you trade funds immediately as soon as the withdrawal is made, but you have to pull double the amount."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but it could go the other way, too. 

Let's say you bought 100 shares in stock X @ 100. 50 of those shares were on margin. The stock drops to 50, you get margin called and are forced to sell. You have now lost 100%

Potentially you can lose more than 50%, and owe the brokerage money on top. If you can't cover they can liquidate your other positions to cover your loss.

Meanwhile, if you invested in cash you'd be down 50% and have no chance at a margin call. You can therefore just wait if you wanted to, in hope the stock goes back up."
2021-04-02 10:23:09,stocks,"P/E and P/S Ratios Hi everyone, currently trying to FA some companies for myself to invest in. Had some questions regarding PE and PS.

How do I know which to use? If it is a loss making company, do I still bother with the negative PE ratio? 

Still a beginner so hope simpler terms can be used. Thanks!"
04/02/2021,stocks,">How do I know which to use?

both. and more. 

P/S and P/E are useful, but only in comparison to other companies of the same type and as part of an overall analysis process. for example, utilities and financials (banks, insurance) typically have much lower PE ratios than tech companies. but financials operate very differently from a cloud-storage company, so it's not an apples to apples comparison. 

you want to look also at price to book, price to free cashflow, and many other ways to analyze a company. you want to look at insider ownership -- if the executives at a company are selling more company stock than buying, that can be a huge red flag because it shows they don't have confidence in the company (not all insider selling is bad, they often get paid partly in stock and might need to cash out occasionally just for normal expenses). or Joel Greenblat's famous formula involves prioritizing return on capital, and earnings yield. see his book The Little Book that Beats the Market. keep reading, and you'll learn all sorts of ways to look at a company's data.

> If it is a loss making company, do I still bother with the negative PE ratio?

personally, I dislike unprofitable companies. it depends on the industry, so that's not an absolute statement. some companies like oil go through stretches where they lose money every few years. but overall, I dislike companies that are consistently unprofitable for years and years and years. I want to invest with people who are earning money, not losing money and promising to turn a profit sometime in the distant future."
04/02/2021,stocks,I’ve got a couple of videos on topic on YouTube you can check out. This is AMZN for example:[AMZN Valuation](https://youtu.be/wCs1wL0R8SA)
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well, P/S & P/E are quite short sighted ways of looking at a company.

A P/E, so price to earnings, ratio can give a small insight as to whether a company is over or undervalued... but it’s more of a snapshot.

See, as investors, we should look ahead. 5-10 years ahead, and if we can calculate future revenue, we can slap on ‘fair’ p/s ratio’s

Or even better, if u can calculate future earnings, you can slap on ‘fair’ p/e ratio’s

Hope this helps"
04/02/2021,stocks,Thanks for the input! Is there any way I can estimate future revenue/earnings?
04/02/2021,stocks,"To add to this: accounting earnings can be and almost always are very skewed. See how earnings relate to FCFE (free cash flow to equity), that way accountants' depreciation scemes (used to reduce taxes) don't get in the way."
04/02/2021,stocks,The CNN Finance page shows the revenue and earnings estimates for stocks.
04/02/2021,stocks,"To get an estimate of valuation for a company you have to estimate its future free cash flows and build a DCF model. You can start here:

Notice that this is mostly educated guesswork when it comes to companies which are not profitable yet or don't have much history of earnings. Which is why valuations of young companies are very uncertain."
04/02/2021,stocks,Would strongly encourage checking out Aswath Damodaran’s YouTube videos.  He is great and has put out a lot content if you are looking to learn.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes. There’s books, articles, videos ,apps, and websites for it."
2021-04-02 08:38:56,stocks,is it illegal to interview at a startup just because i want to get better info on investing in them? really like this one company. applied to them and they granted me a phone interview. I can probably get an offer pretty easily but i don't actuallly want to work there. I just want to evaluate their operation lol
04/02/2021,stocks,Lmao what even is this level of investing 😂😂😂
04/02/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t invest in a company that would hire me
04/02/2021,stocks,"Its called Mosiac theory. Its legal to gather non-public information and to use it so long as its not price sensitive material. So you can stitch several pieces of non price sensitive material to come to a price-sensitive conclusion (mosaic theory).
Also if they are dropping price sensitive info on people randomly in the first place then they are being pretty reckless tbh."
04/02/2021,stocks,[removed]
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes, you can and is the reason investor relations departments exist at big companies. Peter Lynch used to visit companies all the time."
04/02/2021,stocks,I think it’s a great idea! Ask them about future projects and timelines 👌
04/02/2021,stocks,Even if it's illegal how would anyone find out? Feels like a lot of work for a very minor advantage though
04/02/2021,stocks,Why not just call and tell them you are considering investing in their company and ask if they would do any sort of tour/info meet up
04/02/2021,stocks,"Anytime I've visited a reasonably established company or interviewed with them, I've typically had to sign an NDA about not sharing or profiting off of any information that I might come across but they haven't made available to the general public. That includes stuff we discuss in the interview, anything I might see on someone else's screen, the interview questions, etc.

Are they actually going to enforce it for a stock purchase though? Probably not. It would also be tough for you to figure out anything important or useful, especially if you only make a single visit or only talk to people from a single department."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’ve thought about doing this before, I interviewed at a company that I’ve thought about investing in. You can ask about how fast their team is growing, how good their product is, how they are looking to expand, at the end of the day every company is going to respond positively to those questions. Personally, looking at the company’s financials will tell you more."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If it’s a startup, what edge is it going to give you if they don’t go public for another 5 years? Their whole model can change in that time. They’re a startup so taking the interview would be a waste of their resources, but you do you."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Unless you are interviewing for high profile positions very unlikely you get to know something big.

If you just want to see how they operate and you happen to like the company (stocks) that is okay i guess (not a legal advice) but then very unlikely you get to know some information that is useful for short or mid term trading."
04/02/2021,stocks,The low level HR rep you will talk to will probably have tons of inside info on the inner workings of the company.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Just get on linkedin and find people who don't work there anymore. In an interview you get the positive, sunny side. Ask former employees and they'll be happy to tell you about the disfunction and the dirt."
04/02/2021,stocks,"As long as you don't admit to it online or anything, I think you should be good."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's really funny you posted this question.
A month or so ago I applied to a small start up company in my town that deals with algorithm trading and traders who trade on emerging markets and earn a wage through the profits they make.

Now I was really interested in this company so sent them a lovely email stating how much I would love to work for them. I never heard anything back for about a month then suddenly out of the blue I received an email offering a telephone interview.

I was over the moon.
I also should mention that during this covid pandemic I have really been studying the stock market and algorithm trading and I really learned a lot and managed to get some good insights.

I also have a friend that works at the company. (This will become important later on.)

So I have the telephone interview and things are a little bit strange. He doesn't really tell me much about the company while I am telling him so many things that I have learned and some really profitable trades I have made. He seems really interested so I think that I could be in with a shot at a job.

On Monday the guy that interviewed me goes into the office to tell all his fellow coworkers he was up all weekend studying new trading plans he has discovered.

They were all my ideas. Apparently my friend told me he was close to losing his job due to previous bad trades.

So my advice to you is, don't be so desperate to work for or find out about another company.
One of the greatest things about the stock market is that you really don't need anyone else to help you.
Read a few good books and create a journal of your trades to keep you on the straight and narrow.

I was so pissed off he had stolen all my ideas and was seen as the golden boy and profiting from it."
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, It's fairly reasonable to assume you will not receive any tangible ""insider information"". What you are doing is called first-party research. Take any opportunity you can to do first-party research. A few weeks back there was a huge snap-on truck on my street delivering equipment. I took a couple of beers over the next day to find out what was going on. He was a long-time employee and the company was giving him a bunch of tools since he works on some old cars as a hobby. Got him talking about all kinds of stories from his years at the company and why they are his favourite tools. Everything from when he started in customer services to now being in manufacturing. No insider information about secret upcoming products. But I got to hear firsthand how the company treats its employees and how they ensure the customer is happy with retention at the forefront of their goals. Anytime you have those opportunities take them, it's a classic lynch mindset.

Edit: a lot of comments are saying it's a waste of time. I disagree entirely. Doing your own research, visiting the location, speaking with employees is all extremely valuable. I'd argue that outside of financial statements it's some of the most useful information."
04/02/2021,stocks,lol there isn’t anything illegal about doing this but it will be a massive waist of time. My friend is pretty high up in Palantir and knows jack shit about future prospects until it’s already risen the price.
04/02/2021,stocks,If they give away trade secrets in an interview they deserve to go out of business.
04/02/2021,stocks,"You’re not going to learn anything confidential, no insider info. But if it helps your DD then go ahead."
04/02/2021,stocks,Sounds like a huge waste of time. This is the definition of outsmarting yourself
04/02/2021,stocks,It's only unethical if you don't share your DD with us
04/02/2021,stocks,Why should that be illegal? If I could sue every person stealing my time My lawyer would be happier then ever.
04/02/2021,stocks,Shit bro if you work there you’d even have a better dd
04/02/2021,stocks,"You’re looking for legal advice on something you could potentially go to prison for, and you decided to consult a bunch of internet strangers LOL ask a lawyer"
04/02/2021,stocks,"You won’t discover anything in an Interview, why should they discuss it within one?"
04/02/2021,stocks,How are you planning to invest in a _startup_?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Honestly from experience working in startups the interview won’t teach you shit. 

Even once you start there it takes a couple of weeks to get the lay of the land and understand how fucked up the company culture is and how unlikely it is that they will actually make any money. 

Oh and to save you some money on drug tests, yes there will be coke everywhere."
04/02/2021,stocks,"at the end of the interview when they ask : ""do you have any questions for us?""

ask if it is legal or not"
04/02/2021,stocks,Why tf ask if u think so?
04/02/2021,stocks,"“I can probably get a job there pretty easily”

Maybe

But I have to ask...you’re looking at a *publicly traded* startup? How much of a startup can it be if they’re already going public and don’t need private capital anymore?"
04/02/2021,stocks,I know a person who worked at a corporate office of a chain sandwich restaurant. After a year of seeing how things worked she surprised all by purchasing  a franchise and quitting.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Galaxy brain - short a company, get a job there, sabotage...profit."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's an asshole move with dubious payoff. I doubt you will learn much but you will have put a number of people out and wasted their time. Also, potentially knocking someone else out of the running or the company not finding that perfect person for them cause you intervened."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If they leak confidential information during an interview, well they shouldn’t be conducting the interview and I’d say that’s on them."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It might not be ethical but it’s not illegal. I “know a guy” who had a fake profile on LinkedIn with a hot female as his picture in order to get details on companies being targeted for recruiting/staffing. It worked for years, he got lots of bonuses and brought in a lot of new clients for the staffing firm."
04/02/2021,stocks,Even if its illegal i think youll be fine hahaha great idea
04/02/2021,stocks,I would simply call this doing your due diligence.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not illegal, maybe a little unethical but I actually have more respect for you for taking your due diligence that seriously"
04/02/2021,stocks,The final word in any case is “burden of proof” 🤑
04/02/2021,stocks,"What if it is trap :). You go there and they share plans , drawings... etc , you come back and post good DD on WSB . ... aka Nikola"
04/02/2021,stocks,lmao and like noone that works there can invest in the company...oh wait yes they can. you can learn more by doing 10 minutes of work
04/02/2021,stocks,"Watch china hustle, you would love it, honestly i think its fair and square"
04/02/2021,stocks,They might ask to sign NDA
04/02/2021,stocks,"If I ask a Nike shoe seller what kind of brand he likes what is he gonna say?

If your incentive is to invest in the company they like that, it helps to keep them afloat, so they are going to make sure to bring up the best of their best aspects of the company and hide the bad stuff so you get onto the bandwagon/hype you up. 

Its nothing new. They have departments specifically for these kinds of investors who are looking around.

You have to actually spy on the company to gather objective information so your observation is unaffacted. 

That's real DD."
04/02/2021,stocks,Money down the drain
04/02/2021,stocks,I have no idea if that is legal but can you share with us how it went anyway? :D
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you trade on material nonpublic information, both you and the person who gave it to you would be in trouble.

The interviewer would have to be a real idiot to share info like that in an interview, but there are some real idiots out there.

But yes, you’d theoretically go to jail too.

But good fucking luck to the sec to prove that you traded on that info."
04/02/2021,stocks,A startup that is trading publicly? What kind of startup is this lol
04/02/2021,stocks,"Even better, you could accept the job, work really hard so they trust you enough to give you all of their secrets, and then eventually become CEO and know everything there is to know. The best part? They'll just *give* you money the whole time! Just for spying on them!"
04/02/2021,stocks,“Would you say you do a moderate amount of pumping here?”
04/02/2021,stocks,Why would you even think you would be on anyone's radar?    Well you are now
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you get any useful, non public information, yes, it’s illegal"
04/02/2021,stocks,This right here my friend! 💪🏾💪🏾
04/02/2021,stocks,And then be buys 1 share on Robinhood
04/02/2021,stocks,Do you all have buttons or zippers on the drapes?
04/02/2021,stocks,I call this: Deep diligence
04/02/2021,stocks,I do it all the time. This is how I was able to invest In Shopify at 25 bucks
04/02/2021,stocks,Is it illegal to pretend to have an interview? No...
04/02/2021,stocks,You could get more information just by saying you’re an investor and would like to take a tour to see how things work ...
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’m an industrial refrigeration contractor who works in a lot of factories of publicly owned businesses. I always look at the caliber of their management team members, their willingness and speed they will get repairs done and the rumours among the facilities members whether the company is worth investing in. I will tell you that without a shadow of a doubt, every company that checks all the boxes is privately owned. I haven’t yet worked at a publicly owned company that I would invest in.

In my experience, companies who are worrying about investors and profits never look at things in the long term. The management gets huge bonuses to save money, and often they put off paying for repairs, upgrades and safety hazards. It’s all short term for them. But that’s just the places I’ve worked, I’m sure others have different experiences"
04/02/2021,stocks,This is hilarious!! Love it! No such thing as too much DD.
04/02/2021,stocks,Got toooooooooo much time in your hands ! 🤣🤣🤣how about you come apply at my company and tell me how I can improve lol
04/02/2021,stocks,You are beyond stupid
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you enter employment with the motivation of taking and/or selling the companies internal or confidential information or operational knowledge then that is industrial/commercial espionage (yes it really is a crime).

However, if your intent is only for your own informational purposes: It is likely not a criminal matter.

However, there could be civil matters at play. They could civilly sue you for cost if your motivation was only to collect information and you take the job offer and sign an employment agreement in bad faith.

If you just do an interview and don't accept the job (or sign any NDA/waivers/employment agreements) you should be 100% fine.

If you accept the job, sign the employment agreement, and your only purpose was to collect information they could sue you for your approximate hiring and training costs (depending on the employment agreement and state laws) and the cost of any information ""leaked"" by you that may have harmed the company or its interests.

It seems HIGHLY unlikely they would waste time on any of that if you just took a job then quit after you have checked out their operations and such. 

I am not an attorney and this is not legal advice. I am an a\*\*hole and this is a random statement on the internet. You should never listen to a\*\*holes on the internet for ANY advice, much less legal and/or financial advice."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Illegal? No
Unethical? Yes"
04/02/2021,stocks,This is just top tier DD imo
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is something old, some big companies open job positions only to interview and get information about their competitors. You’ve applied to know better the company, however, they always sell a nice picture of the company when they’re recruiting be careful it could be only marketing to make you join the company."
04/02/2021,stocks,Ok Tinker Trader Soldier Spy. This is genius btw lol
04/02/2021,stocks,Unethical. So is the common practice of startups posting jobs that don’t actually exist to evaluate the candidates from other startups that will arrive. Silicon Valley.
04/02/2021,stocks,"**Every** interview at a startup is to get a better info on **investing** in them, because startups don't have the ability to pay a cash salary like larger based companies, and will compensate with shares or options instead. So if you'll go work there, you'll become an investor by definition (both directly by gaining from options that mature over some years, and indirectly by getting a lower salary than you could elsewhere).

Note though, that if you pass the phone interview and continue to more in-depth interviews (where you may be exposed to more internals of the company), you might be required to sign an NDA, and *then* it may be illegal to use that information for investing."
04/02/2021,stocks,If you think you’re getting real info about their operations from an interview then you’re probably not smart enough to even get the job
04/02/2021,stocks,The problem you’ll probably run into is the person that’s interviewing you will not have any worthwhile investing information off hand for you
04/02/2021,stocks,I like the way you think
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, if they’re a startup then they’re not publicly traded and even if they were it would only matter if they disclosed information that was not public knowledge. Honestly, seems like more work than is necessary if you’re planning on investing. Just call and tell them you want to invest and ask to take a tour of the facilities to see how they operate, I’m assuming you’re doing this to get an understanding of their culture and not their financials/services."
04/02/2021,stocks,No one would have a clue if you kept it to yourself .
04/02/2021,stocks,Why do you think they are going to give you enough internal info in a job interview? Are you VP level or something?
04/02/2021,stocks,"What do you imagine they're going to tell you that you couldn't find in their filings? You did say ""startup"", so if they're not public, how do you imagine you're going to invest in them to begin with?"
04/02/2021,stocks,Of course it's not illegal.  But you MIGHT be burning bridges if you ever think you might want to work there if they offer you a job and you turn it down.  Be careful and respectful..
04/02/2021,stocks,"Catchy title, but you’re really not going to gain any valuable operational information from an interview."
04/02/2021,stocks,I don't think it's illegal but I don't think it's a good idea. They're not going to reveal anything to you during an interview that wouldn't be publicly available information already.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Its just a huge waste of time as youre highly confused if you think its going to give you any sort of advantage in buying the stock.

What possible information do yoi think you could learn in an interview?

Interviewer ""Hi welcome to the interview, just wanted to let you know right off the bat we are back engineering technology from area 51, and when we have sales in a year were going to be maing 2 trillion dollars."""
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you gain information that is not public and act on it, yeah that would be illegal"
04/02/2021,stocks,"You'de be an asshole for wasting everyone's time, but nothing illegal."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s only illegal if you get caught. Probably not the best idea to post it onto the internet either. It’s too late now. It has become one with the matrix. 

It’s only going to matter if you happen to make millions and create a cluster-fuck in which you have to testify before Congress. This hasn’t happened recently, right?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is like going to a 10 mile radius grocery store hunt to see what people are buying.

Getting home, doing some spreadsheet shit and bam you got best DD 

Campbells soup.


During the pandemic I I dunno now."
04/02/2021,stocks,Sounds pretty unethical and could probably make a case that it can be insider trading. Why not just talk them about the company directly?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm surprised at people thinking this is a waste of time. During my career, I interviewed at many places and I could just get the feeling that the place was dead ending. It's not going to get you the single necessary information to make a killing, but I'd bet it could help avoid a disaster."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Fuck it go for it. Brainstorm selective questions up until then to gain as much inside intel without raising alarms. Why not. 

This is not whatever the SEC doesn’t like or whatever.  I am not a legal expert. I also am not a cat."
04/02/2021,stocks,The question you want to be asking yourself is whether it's illegal to trade based on nonpublic info you learn at the interview. But certainly no law against interviewing
04/02/2021,stocks,"I doubt you would get any considerable information for investing purposes from an interview. Plus, most of the interview is going to be focused on you."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Lmao man this is next, next-level shit."
04/02/2021,stocks,This is next level DD investing.
04/02/2021,stocks,"If they are public I belive that would count as Insider information, don't take the risk dude"
04/02/2021,stocks,Sounds pretty shabby. I’ve done a lot of interviewing and it is really tiring and a pain in the ass. At best you’re wasting an hour of one or more peoples’ time that there could probably invest much better in running the business.
04/02/2021,stocks,I mean you’re not going to get any information that isn’t already publicly available if they are a public company. If for some reason you did and traded based off that you would be insider trading.
04/02/2021,stocks,This is that out of the box thinking that you need. Our hedgefund will be contacting you shortly.
04/02/2021,stocks,In anthropology this is called “participant observation” - awesome idea for investing
04/02/2021,stocks,"Unethical? Yes. Illegal? Probably not.

Anybody in an interview sharing material non-public information about the company with a non-employee is going to get fired."
04/02/2021,stocks,"As a software engineer currently having to spend time interviewing new engineers, I can tell you that even if it’s not illegal, I would go out of my way to ruin your life if I found out."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Shitty grape.  .. yup. .. username checks out ✅

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that while standing neck deep in shit you don't smell anything.. .🙄

Keep your day job and use that excess energy/time to figure out a different way to learn (or find) the info you think you want.

Better yet.  .. instead of being a shitty grape.. .if you're genuinely interested in investing in a startup. .. be fking honest and let them know that you're a potential investor and would like to learn more about their operations."
04/02/2021,stocks,"at minimum immoral. the people whose lives you are wasting have better things to do. you're a dick if you do this, regardless of legality. I'm assuming you're a child, because anyone who has ever been on the interviewing side of the equation knows this."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Boss move, SIKE. Go back to the drawing board"
04/02/2021,stocks,"From my understanding... if you were associated with an institutional investor, or you have the net worth that would classify you as one, then yes that would be insider trading. But of you’re just a retail investor then heck, brokerages don’t even go after you for blowing up small accounts on margin. Who’s gonna bother you if you cash in on a few hundred grand without hurting anybody."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Probably something Not to be posted to the internet After you’ve “maybe” broken some random rule that would likely never have been enforced and almost impossible to prove-except now you’ve posted it to the internet that you didn’t ever intend to take the job. 

Remove the post, sleep better. 

Keep it up...and you’re literally begging for some low level government hack to stumble over it and start some sort of investigation."
04/02/2021,stocks,wtf are you gonna learn in a few hours of interviews? That's pseudo DD at best
04/02/2021,stocks,Depends. If you are rich already it’s probably legal but if you are poor it’s probably illegal and comes with a hefty jail sentence.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I actually really like the question. First I highly doubt it’s illegal anywhere to do this. However who knows maybe where you live it is. 

Personally if it gives you the mental edge you need to go do your thing do it. 

Is it a waste of time or could you be more productive just doing you and creating instead of copying probably. But really if it gives you that mental edge do it. Hope this helps."
04/02/2021,stocks,"F 'm 

HR are the worst people around so troll them a little for your info.

Do it!"
04/02/2021,stocks,They usually make u sign NDA before inteeview
04/02/2021,stocks,This that Dirty DD. I like it.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Why would it be illegal? You're interviewing for a job. They have to sell you on the job just as much as you have to sell them on your employability. Who knows, maybe the offer will make you change your mind? Maybe they offer you an equity stake for the job during the interview?

You don't know, neither do they. I can't come up with how that could possibly be illegal."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I can’t speak on the legality of it (I have zero idea) but I’ve heard of this level of DD for hyper focused, industry specific investors (Mining industry, penny stock companies, etc)."
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s called ballsdeep DD.
04/02/2021,stocks,do it and then post your DD here
04/02/2021,stocks,nah. just you playing 3-D chess while we're all playing checkers.
04/02/2021,stocks,I think it’s pretentious of you to assume you can get the job easily but good luck and let us know how it goes.
04/02/2021,stocks,Pretty sure it’s only illegal if you don’t share your findings with me.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not illegal, but unethical.

Also really not sure what sort of info you expect to gain from HR. Those people are pretty removed from information that would he helpful to investors: “To the Moon because they have great Dental insurance!”"
04/02/2021,stocks,Startups aren’t publicly traded
04/02/2021,stocks,Well this is just brilliant.
04/02/2021,stocks,Nah you’re fine
04/02/2021,stocks,Most vicious wins
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, but you have to accept if they make a job offer :)"
04/02/2021,stocks,I'm interested in what are you planning to ask them? To get a picture of where company is going with few questions at job interview is a tough task. Of course you get an impression of what kind of people are working there.
04/02/2021,stocks,I love it.
04/02/2021,stocks,My friend couldn't pass the interview for palantir as a data scientist so proceeded to all in his money into palantir.
04/02/2021,stocks,What company?
04/02/2021,stocks,Illegal or unethical?
04/02/2021,stocks,"There was a documentary that showed a recruiter who was hired by a competitor to interview people for a new job that didn't exist. His goal was to get inside info on the company they currently worked at.

I think the documentary was ""I.O.U. USA"""
04/02/2021,stocks,I would invest just because of your interest. Sounds like a solid DD.
04/02/2021,stocks,"If it is truly a startup just to approach the owner, tell them you're interested in investing and you want to talk to them."
04/02/2021,stocks,Do you think they are gonna give you some top level business scoop in an interview.  Might get as much from just looking at what positions they are hiring for. Unless they are interviewing you for c level position but still wouldnt expect much before a non compete type clause
04/02/2021,stocks,Only if they are publicly traded and they share info with you that isn’t public.
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s too late I already told the SEC about you sorry man hope you have some serious bail money
04/02/2021,stocks,"Obviously this is bad at best on the moral axis. However, if any, the information you gain will have been them releasing it. If it works out, it's great r/UnethicalLifeProTips"
04/02/2021,stocks,You should ask the SEC.
04/02/2021,stocks,if its a startup probably its not listed? If its listed already probably it has grown out of a startup?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I had a friend that was starting a company - VC-backed. He interviewed with all competitors before the company financing was announced publicly. 

Def not illegal. A bit sneaky. But all is fair IMO."
04/02/2021,stocks,"When I was studying law, I remember reading something about good faith in negotiations, i.e. you should not engage in negotations without any purpose to engage in a deal. This is actually a thing in the states (I assume you're from there), but less so in Europe."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This might answer your question 

Insiders are legally permitted to buy and sell shares of the firm and any subsidiaries that employ them. ... Legal insider trading happens often, such as when a CEO buys back shares of their company, or when other employees purchase stock in the company in which they work. https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-exactly-is-insider-trading/"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Fake business, I like it"
04/02/2021,stocks,Social engineering level DD.
04/02/2021,stocks,Unless you sign a NDA idk why not. Also not a lawyer. Or any professional
04/02/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/02/2021,stocks,You like the company
04/02/2021,stocks,Nope but it isn't nice.
04/02/2021,stocks,Will venmo you $20 if you dm me with insider info about them after
04/02/2021,stocks,Why not get employed and do some insider trading
04/02/2021,stocks,What's the company?
04/02/2021,stocks,If you get any information that isn’t public from the interview then that is insider trading.
04/02/2021,stocks,Now THIS is DD
04/02/2021,stocks,How can you “evaluate their operation” on a fucking phone interview?
04/02/2021,stocks,Investment-zoned
04/02/2021,stocks,Only illegal if you don't share what you find about them in this thread.
04/02/2021,stocks,If they will hire me don’t invest
04/02/2021,stocks,Um yikes?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Most startups wil meet with investors. However, you need to seem capable of a minimum investment of 50K usually for them to bother."
04/02/2021,stocks,"What info do you think will come out of a job interview that will give you any kind of edge on investing in the company? They are vetting you to see if they want to invest in you, not the other way around."
04/02/2021,stocks,I doubt the SEC will take the time to investigate the activities surrounding your $1400 investment.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Should follow through and work for a bit. 

When I was financially independent at a young age I always thought how fun it would be to get a random job just to fuck around like office space or whatever. Just see what I could get away with, maybe just swagger my way into a c suite 😂"
04/02/2021,stocks,Not sure interviewer would give you much dirt. Think most people are pretty PC and dolled up to sell for potential recruits.
04/02/2021,stocks,"What are they gonna tell you lol? 

“Yeah we use Salesforce”"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I can't imagine you learning enough from the interview process to be valuable.

Please report back."
04/02/2021,stocks,"if it is a non pubic start up, and you might invest, they theoretically would open up more information to you as a potential investor"
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, you're just wasting their time. It could be considered unethical."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s not illegal, it’s smart"
04/02/2021,stocks,I don’t mind. Let me know what you find out.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think if you get hired then do it. It would be insider trading. But if you buy solely on the info in the interview, they are making that public knowledge by giving you the info in the interview. So it should be legal?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"that might be considered unethical, the FINRA and SEC rules get pretty complex on this stuff. 

call investor relations if you want investing info."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not a lawyer, I'd be careful that seems borderline insider depending on what exactly is asked and said."
04/02/2021,stocks,Nope.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don't really know how much information you're going to get. I know some pretty high up people at my company and while they're forced to listen to the investor presentations, etc., a large portion of what they know about the company is public record or not really relevant. If you're going to get behind the doors of the Emerald Castle, you're probably going to have to get hired."
04/02/2021,stocks,/r/unethicallifeprotips
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not legal advice, just saying, afaik it's only illegal insider trading if you're investing in (or divesting from) a company based upon knowledge that isn't readily available to the public. So, to answer your question, probably not but it depends. Most likely, a half competent interviewor is not going to divulge info that could be useful to an investor."
04/02/2021,stocks,Of course it’s not illegal to interview.
04/02/2021,stocks,I've wondered this too! Please let us know how it goes!
04/02/2021,stocks,What’s the company name? At least give us a hint.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm a recruiter and if I worked for or interviewed somebody who worked at a company it impacts whether I will invest in them quite heavily. 

I hear stories from candidates about how certain companies have no direction or vision, terrible culture etc. 

Also looking at job posts gives you a good indication of strategy, and if they have lots of turnover etc"
04/02/2021,stocks,"No. Not illegal. They gave you the interview. You don’t have to take a job. 

How exactly do you plan to give them money? Startups don’t typically have stock so the founders would probably have to meet you. Won’t that be awkward?"
04/02/2021,stocks,Why would this be illegal? Just wanted something silly to ask on Reddit.
04/02/2021,stocks,"As a former hiring manager, I don’t think that’s illegal, just kinda rude. 

You could probably just call and ask to speak with someone"
04/02/2021,stocks,Most startups are private...is this a public company?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Illegal no but it may get you blackballed from working there.

Normally you would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement ahead of the interview, so that information shouldn't be discussed with anyone.   Further, you likely won't gain any information that would give you a competetive advantage because that would be insider information.

The entire premise is a waste of everyone's time."
04/02/2021,stocks,Say your intrested in investing and they will give you all the access you need anyway.
04/02/2021,stocks,"In all seriousness, there will be several regulations and companies policy preventing you from trading on insider information. And if you happen to be in top level, the regulations will become stricter. So yes, it is illegal if you cross the line."
04/02/2021,stocks,"In the past, I worked in a well known financial company where over experienced people would apply (and get the job) to low paid positions (answer calls from customers). In reality they only wanted access to the system to get sensitive data and use it for scams.

I know your proposed scenario is different, but we could agree there’s a connection. Where do we draw the line?"
04/02/2021,stocks,Informational interview?
04/02/2021,stocks,That’s called proper due diligence bro 😎
04/02/2021,stocks,Sly ape 😎🦍
04/02/2021,stocks,Priced in.
04/02/2021,stocks,I mean they will happily take money so if it helps your decision why not.
04/02/2021,stocks,Not at all lol
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think this is totally fine, just so long as you don't post about it in any kind of public forum."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Totally legal, google Tim Dillon doing fake business. Its not illegal to waste peoples time. All business is fake until you close a deal"
04/02/2021,stocks,You probably could get more insight if you accepted the job.
04/02/2021,stocks,Not a terrible idea. Better than reading about them in here.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Nope! 

They would not share any information they are obligated to keep private by law with anyone during an interview. My experience has been that 100% of companies give you a very inaccurate, very rosy picture of what actually goes on behind closed doors. You'll also likely interview with a limited number of managers and won't necessarily learn much about them or their competence other than their ability to interview you."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Nope!

04/02/2021,stocks,How would you invest in a start up without an ipo?
04/02/2021,stocks,So when do we find out who the company is and whether they are worth YOLO’ing on??
04/02/2021,stocks,At the interview make sure you ask them “when stock moon?”
04/02/2021,stocks,Not illegal but probably a dick move for wasting their time .
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah it can be used as a good excuse. If you didn’t get the job at a company. You can always say that you went there to evaluate the company lol.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Interviewer: So do you have any questions for us?


OP: Yes what are your top 5 secrets nobody else knows about."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah it’s pretty immoral, stop wasting their time."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think this is legal and makes sense. If anything, your reasoning could be to ""maintain interview skills""."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Assuming the interviewer is dumb enough to give you any useful information about the company without an NDA then I'd say you deserve the tip. Long before information security was all about what could be stolen digitally, the biggest concern was morons sharing non public info with people who don't need to know it."
04/02/2021,stocks,"my interviews at various late-stage startups or recently public companies are one of my most valuable investing tools. i didn't do the interviews just to figure out if they're worth investing in, but the interviews taught me a lot about their business which would let me know if they were worth sinking money into"
04/02/2021,stocks,Lmao nah man you’re just playing the game
04/02/2021,stocks,Whose going to know
04/02/2021,stocks,"not unless they were to disclose to you some sort of ""actionable"" information during the interview (for example, ""yeah, we are really going to blow out our earnings estimates this quarter.. you should come and work here)... that would be ""non-public"" material info that if you acted on it, you could theoretically get in trouble

in reality, however.. they aren't going to share that sort of information with a phone interviewee, and if they did, and you made money off it who would ever know, unless you're some huge hedge fund and leave a footprint through massive options buys or something."
04/02/2021,stocks,They’re going to lie to you anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
04/02/2021,stocks,The Espionage Method
04/02/2021,stocks,This is a DD lol
04/02/2021,stocks,"What are you hoping to find out? I interview people all the time, there's very little information you can get from this tactic, especially a screening interview like this. 

If you want to evaluate their operation look at their finances."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Can't you just... You know, tell them that? Most companies will happily give a tour to a potential investor!"
04/02/2021,stocks,Fuck no lol
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you want to invest in them, why not just call an have a meeting? Start ups like getting money. Be transparent and just go in."
04/02/2021,stocks,This guy doesn’t go deep. He fucking drills. That’s how you do it boys and girls. I commend you! But you can also get really good info from those interviews if you’re asking the right questions which I assume you are based on your willingness to go in that hard. They like to show off. Especially startups. Get them to give you the 2-3 yr and 5-10 yr goals and milestones. Then come back and share ;) Maybe DM me so you don’t get arrested 🤣
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not at all lol. Play your game and win it bubba. Ask them if there's anything they're excited about in the coming months / years for the company, their response will be an accurate picture of how they feel about the company's future"
04/02/2021,stocks,So it and post the DD here
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes, the interview police will arrest you."
04/02/2021,stocks,Who hasn’t worked for a company that they now wouldn’t invest a stolen nickel in?
04/02/2021,stocks,"...no, just no..have some ethics. ..This and all the other shady shit people do to get a one up is pretty shitty. And it's fucked that you are wasting their time as well. 🤔🤷‍♀️😳🆘"
04/02/2021,stocks,Everyone here seems to be just making jokes but the answer to your question is yes. If they give you any information that is not common public knowledge during the interview and then you trade their stocks it is arguably insider trading.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes, that would clearly fall into ... how is this real jurisdiction"
04/02/2021,stocks,Illegal? No but the best way to research a company? Heck NO!!!!! Would you give someone you might higher true inside info? Heck would you even give an applicant real upside of downside of the company? Would the people who do an interview even be the people who know how the company is doing? Unless it is for the assistant to the CEO or other top person they should not even be in the interview.
04/02/2021,stocks,Based.
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, when I worked at a fund years ago (it went under lol, boss man was doing shady shit on the low), we would be customers if we could just to see how it went. Call customer service, etc. 

Just to see how consumers would react."
04/02/2021,stocks,This is the kind of post I’m here for.
04/02/2021,stocks,Illegal? No. Incredibly shitty? Yes.
04/02/2021,stocks,"How would you invest with them? If it’s publicly traded then there is lot of information already available. This seems like waste of time for everyone involved, including me with this comment."
04/02/2021,stocks,"How do you plan to invest in this startup? I find it hard to believe that you might be an accredited investor that is able to participate in a funding round as an individual (since you fucking posted this). Is this like a wefunder situation? Or is this like a biotech that needed capital to get their R&D kicked off and went to the public markets for that $?

Can you share what startup this is?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you get material non-public information and trade in that information, yes, it is illegal."
04/02/2021,stocks,Assuming they shouldn't legally be giving you information that isn't public domain anyway
04/02/2021,stocks,Many CEOs join the board of emerging companies to see what they're doing and if they need to compete or buy them out.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Absolutely legal, ethical and encouraged.  Get every advantage you legally can, and this is gold, EVEN better, take the job and learn from the inside for 3-6 months"
04/02/2021,stocks,Publicly available information so 🤷‍♂️
04/02/2021,stocks,"The impracticality makes it not illegal. The rule is *material*, non-public information.

""I know a guy that works there that's kind of a dick; he works in HR"" isn't material information on share price."
04/02/2021,stocks,Omg stealth
04/02/2021,stocks,Well if you’re not actually hired and you don’t sign a NDA than I don’t see how it could be insider trading.
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is where you go from scuttlebutt to scuttleass. 

&#x200B;

LOVE IT."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Why would it be?

You can invest in places where you work, and there is no reason to believe you weren't seriously looking for a job.

I mean, if you're *really* committed to a business's cause, wouldn't that be exactly what the average Joe would do? Go all in, financially and physically?

So, let's say youre halfway committed. You went for an interview, realized you weren't qualified for employment (or had another reason to decline), still invested anyway.

Whose going to either know any better, or complain? The owner? About what, you investing in *their* dream?

Morally questionable, maybe. Depends on the purpose. It sounds like you're trying to help build people up, not tear them down. I give folks like that ""free passes"" in the morally grey areas as long as nobody's being hurt."
04/02/2021,stocks,Please record this interview and report back
04/02/2021,stocks,"Technically if you have information that’s not available to the public and you make trades based on it, it’s insider trading. I work in biotech and at our company they will purchase the stock for you at specific intervals through the year to avoid that. I also buy the stock of all of our clients. In the words of Chamath, invest in your sphere of concern."
04/02/2021,stocks,How do you plan on investing in a startup? Are you an accredited investor?
04/02/2021,stocks,"You’re playing a deep game, OP"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Bigger balls play wpuld be to tell them at the end about the old switcheroo.  ""Actually, I've been interviewing YOU this whole time"".

You're wild."
04/02/2021,stocks,Uh I would just keep your motives a secret so you don't get jail time. You're kidding right?
04/02/2021,stocks,No.. It’s not illegal
04/02/2021,stocks,If it is not specifically forbidden then it must be allowed.
04/02/2021,stocks,Ninja status my dude
04/02/2021,stocks,Do it why not
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s not like you’re going to get privileged information...
04/02/2021,stocks,Most of the time the employees of a company are the last ones to know how good or bad a company is doing.
04/02/2021,stocks,No. It’s not illegal. But I hope you’ve got hella money to invest otherwise you’re doing hella overtime on just this company.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Just read the financial statements ffs

It has way more info?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Go for it.  Here's a good read to motivate you : Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy: The Secret World of Corporate Espionage"
04/02/2021,stocks,Only if you ask it on Reddit.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Better yet, prepare for interview. Accept the job. Work for 5 years, move into management. Now you have some idea of project timelines. Work for 20 years, climb the ladder, become CEO. Then and only then you can safely invest in stock."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If it is you now have digital proof of crime

Would have been something nice to be able to plead ignorance but now... 
bummer"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Spitballing off the top of my head...things to consider: (a) whether NDA was signed, (b) in a world where you did trade this stock based on insider information, how easily it would be to reverse engineer the timing of the trade/interview, (c) openly posting this question on an internet forum that could be traced back to you.

This is not legal advice, but if it were, I'd say stop asking for legal advice on reddit."
04/02/2021,stocks,Buy puts after wasting their time. Genius.
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you actually took the job and then invested based on what you saw that \*could\* be viewed as insider trading, although generally those kind of charges are only filed against upper-management types. Usual disclaimer, I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal or financial advice."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I once applied, interviewed, then worked at a company for 15 years as a form of DD for investment purposes.  It’s not unheard of."
04/02/2021,stocks,Just wear glasses and a fake mustache and no one will never know.
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah do it
04/02/2021,stocks,"You wouldn't get any advantage. Any beneficial info, they wouldn't tell some bloke off the street just like that (assuming low level HR reps would have this info to begin with). Any info that they would tell you, rumours would be out and available already."
04/02/2021,stocks,Interview. Assume everything they tell you is a lie ( how else can they recruit new slaves?) then do the opposite. Do you really believe they’re gonna admit to a potential slave how f’kd the company really is?
04/02/2021,stocks,Woooow
04/02/2021,stocks,You should just use job interviews to rack up frequent flyer miles.
04/02/2021,stocks,Naw
04/02/2021,stocks,To answer a question with another question: How would they know unless you tell them?
04/02/2021,stocks,They might give you a tour if you just ask.
04/02/2021,stocks,why would it be?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I would enter the company and see if the turnover is high. If it is the job is shit, and most likely is cause they are on their knees and are pushing people."
04/02/2021,stocks,DD
04/02/2021,stocks,I love this. Go for it!
04/02/2021,stocks,"I've been doing this recently, but not for investing purposes, rather for practicing interview skills in preparation for interviewing at the companies I actually want to work at"
04/02/2021,stocks,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not typically, unless you signed an NDA."
04/02/2021,stocks,In all seriousness you should join them if they are good. You may be a billionaire before you know.
04/02/2021,stocks,"no,but you proably arent going to gain that much info"
04/02/2021,stocks,"That is one way of learning about a prospective company. I used to work at an investment management firm, not that I had any intention of investing when I interviewed, later on after working there, I bought the company stock."
04/02/2021,stocks,No
04/02/2021,stocks,What could you possibly learn in the interview process that would make this illegal?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Actually, you can just call and ask for information or just check their financials. Less hassle. Though who knows? Maybe they offer a ton of money and you actually take the job :)"
04/02/2021,stocks,"You won't get better info on investing in them from an interview, unless you are interviewing for CEO."
04/02/2021,stocks,"You're going to actively hurt a company you want to invest in? Startups are typically running pretty lean, and any time they waste interviewing you is time that they could be spending hiring actual applicants (that are looking for a real job themselves). Seems like a weird approach."
04/02/2021,stocks,It's illegal if you get insider information as part of that call and use it to trade the stock. Stop wasting their time in an interview for a job you don't want.  Unless you're interviewing for a senior management role the people you talk to may not have a clear view of the big picture so the information is of limited value. Reading the company press releases and social media will take a fraction of the time and be more useful.
04/02/2021,stocks,"As someone who struggle to get even an interview, not to mention a job, I wholeheartedly hate you"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I would say there's risk to your approach from both the employer and the government.

1. It's not uncommon to have to sign a NDA to interview at places such as you're thinking about.  So if you use any of the information gleaned during the interview process for personal use, you're violating that NDA.
2. If you use non-public information (which you gathered by gaining foot into the org via the interview which is not otherwise attainable), that's insider training.

Finally, as a director at a tech firm, if I found out you were wasting my time and resources like this, I would do my level best to make things very difficult for you in return.  lol as you say."
04/02/2021,stocks,Who would know
04/02/2021,stocks,I think I saw this on Billions. Worked as a janitor to get inside information
04/02/2021,stocks,"Why is everyone saying this is strictly legal? Let’s say you go in and talk to the CEO and he drops they are being acquired tomorrow. That sounds like material non-public information and you might have a duty to protect it since you received the information as a potential employee of the organization. Yes, mostly things you see / hear will be non-material, but don’t just blanket assume the legal advice here."
04/02/2021,stocks,Nothing's illegal if the government never finds out.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I mean, you could apply to a job and decide it's not a good fit for any number of reasons but still choose to invest in them.  I think it might be a bit unethical to do the interview if you know there's 0 chance of taking the job, but probably not illegal.  Of course, I am not a Lawyer"
04/02/2021,stocks,"i'm sure it's not explicitly illegal. more a question of whether they find out and sue you, would it all be worth it in the end."
04/02/2021,stocks,Doesn't being a startup mean they haven't had an IPO
04/02/2021,stocks,Nope
04/02/2021,stocks,Why would that be illegal?
04/02/2021,stocks,There’s much easier ways to do your dd lol
04/02/2021,stocks,Sounds like a good company to invest in puts on.
04/02/2021,stocks,I don't think you're entering a contract during an interview where you're specially permitted information that's only available to employees.
04/02/2021,stocks,Gen Z the next level investors!
04/02/2021,stocks,Have you conducted or been in a job interview before? What could you possibly hope to learn?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Unless the interviewer is dumb enough to divulge true insider information such as costs and earnings, I'm not so sure you will be able to gain that much more insight than what could be found in the public domain. 

Unless this startup is super under the radar. But then if they already have publicly traded stocks, even if OTC, then there should be some information about how they operate out in the wild."
04/02/2021,stocks,...CIA knocks on your door...
04/02/2021,stocks,"Totally not illegal. It’s taking due diligence to the next level, that’s for sure! 🤪🤪🤪"
04/02/2021,stocks,I would say just keep it as such. I want to know more about your company. I want to get a good feel for the direction you are taking your company and what your bigger plans and goals are. Then just sit back and observe.

04/02/2021,stocks,For all I know you have more money then god and you don’t need it. And for all I know you may actually like the company and want to work for them. And investment is an investment and treat it as such. I’m not an investment advisor so what do I know.

04/02/2021,stocks,"As long as you don’t sign an NDA, there should be no issue."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Illegal? Probably not, although if during the interview, for some bizarre reason, they told you information that isn't publicly available about a future business transaction that you then used to make stock trades, that would be illegal. It's called in(terview)sider trading.

But it seems like a waste of time to me."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If it's a startup it's probably not publicly traded. If it isn't publicly traded you can only invest through private equity, for which you probably do not have any contacts."
04/02/2021,stocks,Go for it. Some companies interview employees from competitors or former competitors just go get info on them with no intention of hiring them.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well maybe now that you’ve announced this as your intent, in order to solicit attention. How the fuck could someone ever prove such a thing short of you voluntarily announcing it as you just have done."
04/02/2021,stocks,No. It’s not illegal to research before investing even if it is that involved. Well provided your not paying money for said information anyways cause I think that might be illegal
04/02/2021,stocks,Who is going to be able to prove your intention?

04/02/2021,stocks,"""Non price sensitive"" would just mean as long as there is no dollar amount tied to it?

So if they said ""we are about to launch with an international customer"" but they don't tie a dollar amount that's acceptable info to go off? But if they say ""we have a $2 million deal in the pipeline for an international customer"" you're committing insider trading?

Many startups I've interviewed at are not quick to give out too many details."
04/02/2021,stocks,What if you interview for a pricing role?
04/02/2021,stocks,All this is true; unless you sign an NDA anywhere along the interview path.
04/02/2021,stocks,Thank you for providing an actual answer to the question. Man this thread has WSB leaking.
04/02/2021,stocks,What if you sign an NDA before the interview?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I thought the definition of non public is info ypu get as an employee or channel partner (suppliers or contractors) that otherwise is inaccessible. 

If you built a software tool to scrape job postings to see what types of talent a company is hiring and its predictive of earnings, then that is fair game. Let's say I find start ups that begin hiring a substantial number of sales staff are moving to monetization, then I could trade on that.

Other investors have access to that information, they just havent utilized it. If the company signed a big contract with a key customer, if I worked at the customer and knew of the deal, then that is insider trading."
04/02/2021,stocks,">Mosiac theory

Except the OP already violated that by saying I want to interview at this company to be a better investor.  

With that said, gathering the non-public information and then investing in that company is the very definition of insider trading."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ah, the old “coke and choke”. A classic!"
04/02/2021,stocks,This is good advice. Don’t invest if the ceo doesn’t do coke in the bathroom

04/02/2021,stocks,"If does, then is a good investment right?"
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah I don’t think the HR person will take you to the C-level floor during an interview. Let alone allow you to take a shit there.
04/02/2021,stocks,"But what if it’s just my leftover coke and cum? Sorry, the exec bathroom has better TP than the others and I have a sensitive bum bum"
04/02/2021,stocks,But how many times does he jerk off in there? You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.

04/02/2021,stocks,"If he does, invest. He is going to be a go getter. While being very relaxed about it"

04/02/2021,stocks,Actual financial advice*
04/02/2021,stocks,"And if he does, invest?"
04/02/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t invest in a company if their CEO didn’t do those things
04/02/2021,stocks,So if the coke and stroke tests positive. Does that mean its 100% Yolo?
04/02/2021,stocks,"He’s asking if he can pretend to apply for a job so that he goes through the interview process and gets info that way.  Not sure if you were interpreting the same way.

How much time would he spend, that he could have spent researching something useful?

Just seems underhanded, mean spirited, and likea waste of everyone's time- he doesn't want the job, so he's wasting recruiters and others time trying to snoop for things they won't tell anyone on interviews."

04/02/2021,stocks,If you’re heavily invested this is well worth it!

04/02/2021,stocks,"Their hiring practices could be a big indicator of their potential future success, though.  A company that can't hire the right people can't grow.  That said, plenty of startups manage to hire all the right people and then still squander all their funding because the core idea of their business was just never scalable, so I guess it only says so much."
04/02/2021,stocks,There is also the human factor of figuring out if the interviewers are even competent.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Maybe not the first round interview with talent/hr or whatever but a final round interview or a walk through of the office (pre-covid) and a chance to talk to fellow co-workers? Could probably glean some interesting stuff there. Anything I've toured a large operation tho even as an interviewee, I had to sign an NDA though, not sure how that would affect your DD."
04/02/2021,stocks,And if they do they're probably not worth investing in.
04/02/2021,stocks,I disagree. I can get a great feel for the path a company is on when I interview with them. Being an expert in my field I am often recruited so in my interviews I tend to ask very invasive questions about a companies current state and what they are wanting to do in the future. They have to be open and honest with me as they need my expertise and I make it very clear with them that I can only assist them if I have a clear understanding of what their needs are. Being dishonest with me could be bad for them financially.
04/02/2021,stocks,What if the position has stock options? Then you're literally investing in the company with time instead of money. I'd wanna know if investing my time is worth it.
04/02/2021,stocks,"How much they are hiring and which positions might be a good thing to note as it can be a good sign. Startups do not hire just for kicks. I work for one. We just decided to hire 6 more engineers on top of the 12 we have. You can probably guess why. And no, we are not publicly traded so don't ask for names."
04/02/2021,stocks,OP is also taking about startups. Most startups aren't offering stocks to the public.
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, it isn’t, so long as its not price-sensitive. This has been in and out of court before, its legal. Insider trading is using material information (price sensitive), not non-material information.

If the world worked the way you have suggested, then virtually every analyst could be charged with securities fraud for investigating a stock. This is because there is also a lot of information that is considered “non-public” mostly because it isn’t freely available (like online in financial staements) but rather simply difficult to obtain. 

Example- i could measure the shelfspace of a retail product in 10 different shops to track how successful a particular product is doing from Company X, and I notice the shelf space has been decreasing on average across these ten shops. This is non-public because its not easily accesible or declared online for the world to know, but this information is still available to people doing the work. I also saw the CEO of company X at lunch the other day and he looked very drunk so he could be an irresponsible person- again info that is not public knowledge but not price material by itself. I take this info and short company X because i think their products are failing, and next quarter there is a big earnings downgrade- i used 2 pieces of non-public information to come to a price sensitive conclusion and it was correct. Its legal."

I think my manager was intentionally being vague, and companies are probably very good at hiding information from outsiders, including pre-hiring staff. And if OP resigns soon after joining the company, that's very suspicious as well."

Exactly. Even when I'm interviewing someone, I try to wrap it up as soon as I know we're not interested. I don't want to waste anymore of their time (or mine) -- it's the ethical thing to do.

On the other hand, accepting an interview with no good faith intention of ever taking the job is completely unethical."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don't see what's wrong with wasting the interviewers time, interviewers waste applicants time... All the time.
Mainly by offering insultingly low compensation packages. 
I honestly think more people should apply for jobs they have no interest or intention of taking, so that when it comes time to talk compensation they can *laugh at* and *disparage* HR for offering *insulting* compensation. 
Shame is a powerful tool, and more people should wield it to attempt to pressure firms to offer fair and competitive compensation to new hires.

04/02/2021,stocks,"I recently got to round 4 of an interview for a director of sales role and during each round there more elaborate sales strategy questions. I basically gave them the nuts and bolts of running a cold calling sales department and how I have been successful finding qualified leads out of the blue. Round 4 I got ghosted by the svp doing the interview. I logged in for the video call and 20 minutes later, while waiting (he was late and never showed), the recruiter emailed me that he had an emergency and couldn't make it. Fair enough. I emailed my ability to reschedule and never heard back.

What I got from several rounds of interviewing is that they have a small sales department that had a shitty, unsuccessful strategy and needed an infusion of ideas. I was a ""top"" candidate and never heard back. It's been a month. I'm thinking that they were interviewing for strategy ideas because they had none. Oh well. Hope they figure it out."

Plus it's a start up company so not sure how professional they all are.

Also the Market is very volatile right now.
Yes there has been a bull run in some industries but a lot of companies and hedge funds are still fearful due to the fact we are not out of the woods yet due to Covid-19.

Just look at Archegos Capital. They lost over 10 billion and some people are speculating 20 billion. This has also caused considerable damage to Credit Suisse and Normura.

You are talking as though hedge funds are superior to the common man.

I'm certainly not a great trader but I have made some observations over the past few months that has made me profitable.

 There has been significant shifts in the market and an effect of retail traders/platforms combined with social media has certainly had an significant impact on the market.
Also Covid-19 while it is awful what has happened to so many families world wide. It has provided a great buying opportunity for stocks that are on the cheap.

>**Illegal Insider Trading**

>The more infamous form of insider trading is the illegal use of non-public material information for profit. It's important to remember this can be done by anyone including company executives, their friends, and relatives, or just a regular person on the street, as long as the information is not publicly known.

>For example, suppose the CEO of a publicly traded firm inadvertently discloses their company's quarterly earnings while getting a haircut. If the hairdresser takes this information and trades on it, that is considered illegal insider trading, and the SEC may take action."

However if that info is not available to the public then it dosnt matter where you get it from whether that is an anonymous tip or from an interview that would be insider info. Unless that information is publicly available. But again I'm not 100% sure

04/02/2021,stocks,"It is definitely unethical.

You are wasting others' time under the false pretense of seeking employment. Not only are you wasting their own time, you are preventing the company from getting a good candidate hired quickly.

But also - why is there even a run-up to earnings then?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Idk where you get your info from but AMD ttm diluted EPS is $2.04. You’re also mixing up revenue growth and earnings growth. The general idea behind fast growing companies is that economies of scale will cause their revenue to increase faster than costs at a certain point. So if they were barely breaking even last year, but this year added $X in revenue with no increase in costs then earnings goes up the full $X - which in some cases can be orders of magnitude higher than previous EPS numbers.

You can see this happen with AMD in the past 4 posted quarters, revenue growth ranged from 26% to 55% increases YoY, eps growth meanwhile was increased in a range from 190% to 1,300%, albeit off of very low YoY numbers."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Huh. I don't see any detail in the OP at all.

As someone who has worked in HR, doing interviews, the standard is clear: if HR shares info with a non employee, without an NDA in place with that person, it immediately becomes classified as public info. The act of doing so means that the business no longer has the right to contain it. And HR owns the interview process, so any employee doing interviews is acting on behalf of HR when doing so. Case law is pretty clear on all that. Most of it was formed in discrimination suits, where any employee doing an interview is said to be under HR supervision and representing the company."

In other posts, OP specifically says they want to go for an on-site visit to a manufacturing facility. I suspect they would sign an NDA before being let in the building.

Let me put it this way: assume OP gets the information they seek, and make a $10 Million profit. They then disclose their exact process to the SEC tip line under sworn affidavit. I believe prosecution would be extremely likely.

The most likely outcome of the process OP envisions is that they do not receive any information, and it does not substantially inform their trading strategy. However, if they somehow discover “jackpot” information, it is probably illegal to capitalize on that"

Earnings calls rarely cause that need. It's the options prices that change due to the volatility of the stock not vice versa

In other words, options are a *derivative* of the stock. By definition the price of the option can't move the stock. Only the action of the stock can move the stock. Even when options *cause* a change in price of the stock, it's because different strike prices are being met (due to movement in the underlying) at unexpected rates and therefore MMs buy/sell stock to account for the hedging thereof. It still requires buy/sell of the actual stock to move the price or cause a gamma squeeze."

2021-04-02 06:03:40,stocks,"Stock market VS real estate There seems to always be a big debate as to whether real estate or stock market is overall the better investment strategy. I’m young so this is me wanting to speak discussion on this topic since I’m interested in it.

How exactly is real estate investing much better than stock market investing? For example, if I were to put 50K down on a property and take out a mortgage, I might be cash flowing couple hundred bucks after everything is paid each month but if I were to simply invest in a dividend company like O Realty, I would get roughly the same in dividends each month without the hassle. They both have the potential for appreciation too so that argument is a wash.

Also, the mortgage would be paying itself but it would take years to get it fully paid unless you put extra down right? Also what if a tenant doesn’t want to pay or moves out? What happens?

Would love to hear the thoughts of your real estate investors."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Stocks are low entry. Land- well, they ain’t makin any more of it."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Personally I think it’s difficult to compare the two but I’ll try as I invest in both. 

In real estate you are purchasing an asset that in theory should increase in value (given that you purchased in the right area at the right time) so the risk is relatively low. You can take steps to increase the value of this asset by means of renovations and upgrades. And finally you can sell this asset after 2yrs and not pay capital gains taxes. My wife and I do slow “flips” in trendy neighborhoods that we know well and I think it’s both safe and quite profitable. We also put down large down payment and then take out a HELOC to pay for renovations as the interest is tax deductible. The only downside is you need some solid cash in hand to get started.  

On the stock side of things there are of course way more variables. If you are all blue chips with dividends that’s great but a more diversified portfolio likely has some more risk built in. I do my own form “day-ish trading” so my risk is greater but so are my returns (usually and hopefully haha).  The good thing is I find it more fun and I started with a lot less money. The down side is the taxes such and if you miss a move it can quickly cost you money. 

Not sure if any of that made sense or was helpful at all but hopefully it was at least moderately helpful!!  Happy investing!!"

The income from the rent should in theory pay for the mortgage/prop tax and income generating.  Stock you can start with as little as a few bucks.  Also if you play options you can strike it big like DFV but you also need to have the balls to lose it all.   Depends on your risk appetite.  Both are good."

04/02/2021,stocks,"The fact that real estate has been growing over the last 20 years or so in most places isn't exactly normal. It was a great investment then. At this point many markets (like Canada at the moment) are in massive bubbles, disconnected from their original purpose (shelter) or what a small concrete box is supposed to cost (not life savings of multiple generations/ half of all future salaries). Every trick has been already played to inflate their prices as means to artificially maintain economic growth.

If you take a prime example of one of the biggest time bomb bubbles now that span out of control - look at Vancouver. Wealth being transfered over multiple generations is what it costs many millennials to buy their own home at this point, and that's to buy a 600sqft condo built not to last for more than 40-50 years. Soon you will run out of people with that capital who are still willing to do this, or those who don't already have a mortgage that they have to pay for life. At the same time it's not like Canada is running out of land anytime soon, to say the least, and new construction will be happening for as long as they can sell those units for more than it costs to build them, which is a tiny fraction of what they are going for now. The sky-high prices are hanging on a thin thread of new immigration and foreign fortunes disappearing into the market faster than new construction can generate supply. Run out of these, or make these people realize that you can buy a beach mansion for the price of a studio in a fairly average cloudy city that's also overdue for a massive earthquake, and it all crashes down. And we are way overdue for a big crash there.

While this is an extreme example, many other housing markets are getting there too, they are just still behind. This situation won't last and we are likely to see either big bursts like where Canada is going, or towards a logical status quo akin to Japan where property values are steadily decreasing YoY as properties age. I think it's a good idea to look at Vancouver and Toronto as they are the biggest bubbles we've ever seen in real estate, and if they burst in isolation it might allow you enough time to sell property owned in cooler markets before these get there too. 

There are still places where real estate could be a good investment though, nice places that are still cheap in areas with big potential for economic growth. Remote areas that are bound to urbanize etc. Perhaps prime land may be a good bet, but not things like condos in 50-story towers."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Real estate is the best passive investment for nearly every country in the world, it could be this way for US too now that tax hike and regulations are coming. People generally see real estate as safe haven from changing government policies. From what I know people in Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada they will always go for real estate as their long term investment. To them stocks is just a way for them to possibly get the down payment a bit sooner."
04/02/2021,stocks,"These shouldn't be an either/or, but I do have the discussion with myself regularly about where the next incremental investment dollars should be going.  So I'll play along.

An advantage you have with real estate that you don't have with stocks is the power of leverage at a very low risk.  You can buy a house with as little as 3% down owner occupied, or 10% down with aggressive ""2nd home"" programs.  Figure standard is 20% down, so even then you're getting 5:1 leverage.

Ask Bill Hwang what 5:1 leverage can do to you (and your family office) in the stock market if things turn against you, even briefly.  With most mortgages, as long as you pay your note, they don't call your loan if the value of the property dips.

So in an aggressive market, your house may go up 10% per year in value. (This year many markets not in urban city centers or CA are doing much better, but times are unique).  If you put down 20%, you just made 50% ROI on your investment in the first year.

There are also tax benefits.  If it's a true investment property, you get to deduct all of your expenses plus depreciation against your income.  Depreciation is a set schedule of the home value (land excluded), so while it is likely appreciating, the government lets you take deductions as if it were doing the opposite.

The downside is you either have to actively manage the property and the tenants (unless you're the occupant, then ignore that tax stuff aside from interest/property taxes up to SALT limits) or pay someone to do so.  There are also huge transaction costs to get in/out, so for most people these aren't short term investments.

Pick the one that's right for you - maybe both are.  Each will have advantages and disadvantages."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Real estate vs stocks:

I do both, stocks and 13 rental units (all section 8).

Real estate - 5 pillars of wealth creation:

1.) Cash Flow - income exceeds expenses each month and you profit from the difference.

2.) Appreciation - buy property low, and later sell it for higher.

3.) Amortization - tenants' rent used to pay down the mortgage of the building you own.

4.) Tax Benefits - real estate provides an excellent tax shelter.

5.) Leverage - you can lever your money to use only a little money % of your money (down payment) to control a lot more equity. Once you have equity, you can borrow against it for more property, or other uses such as kids college education, etc. Stocks can be levered too, but not as much. 

Stocks - unfortunately only has 2 pillars of wealth creation (sans options): 

1.) Appreciation - buy low, sell high. 

2.) Dividends - sometimes are unpredictable because they can be cut at any time, or, the underlying stock might go down in value for more than the % of the dividend paid. 

Cons: 

Real estate - usually more time intensive and requires higher capital requirements to get into the game. More illiquid. Liability - and the resulting emotional toll it takes. I had a low end condo unit as a section 8 rental and my tenant left her coffeemaker on empty overnight and burned my unit and attached  neighbor's unit down to ground. Elderly neighbor had to be intubated (survived) and experienced mental anguish and guess who got slapped with worrying about a personal injury suit? Fun times. 

Stocks - more liquid and more suspect to panic selling and valuation emotional roller-coasters."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Focus on the one you’re better at, understand more, and have the resources for."
04/02/2021,stocks,"In my opinion it's about leverage. If you make 10% gains on both stocks and real estate you'll make way more money with whatever you can leverage more debt with, which is real estate. $50k on a down payment for a house now takes your $50k buying power and gives you 10% gains on a $500k house that is solid and always holds value. A house doesn't go bankrupt. A house doesn't have some shit CEO take over and tank the company's stock price. And that 10% gain on $500k is so much more than 10% on $100k assuming you used that $50k for margin. As long as you can afford the payments, taking on debt is a better idea because you turn $50k into a 10x investment when you use it towards a down payment."
04/02/2021,stocks,"One reason real estate is better than stocks is that it’s mostly impervious to the types of drops seen in stocks where their values can plummet by a lot on seemingly no reason.  

Another, and the principle benefit, is that real estate utilizes leverage in a big way.  No one will loan you 80% of the cost of a stock investment, but that’s exactly what will happen if you buy a rental property; you’ll put down 20% and use the bank’s low-interest-rate money to pay the other 80%, then you’ll rent the place out, covering all of your PITI (if you’re doing it right).  You’ll gain 100% of the value appreciation of the property while it’s being paid for by renters (at least mostly - maintenance/repairs and vacancies can eat into that).  Benefitting from the full appreciation means you could have put down 20% on a $200K house (or 40K) and, when the house rises in value by 40K over the next 5-7 years, you’ve doubled your money already (cash-on-cash return).  And that’s not even counting any paydown on the mortgage either.

A third benefit is that real estate carries with it a significant tax benefit.  You’ll be required to pay taxes on rental income, but prior to that you’ll be depreciating the value of the house each year - you divide the value of the house at purchase by 27.5 and that’s the amount you can write off each year, so that amount is subtracted from your rental income and can negate all or most of it, so the end result is you won’t pay much at all in taxes based on that rental income."
04/02/2021,stocks,"They both have their advantages and disadvantages over the other. The biggest advantages that real estate has over stocks is the great tax benefits and the ability to use leverage in a low-risk way to purchase more of an asset than the amount of money that you currently have. If you put 50K down in stocks then you bought 50K worth of assets, but if you put 50K down in real estate then you could buy a 250K asset which your renters will pay off for you.

I think the best option is to diversify and do both. My goal is to ultimately build a million dollar stock portfolio and own 4-5 rental properties before I retire."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Real estate has been the standard supposedly since the dawn of times. That said, the current housing market in America and appreciation of homes is a big ole house of cards. 

Value of homes is driven up by artificial means. Restrictive zoning and other Us policies make housing artificially scarce, which drives home value up. Other practices drive values of homes up making home unaffordable to a big part of the population. 

Some day we are going to tear down these bigoted, sometimes racist policies, and the benefit will be increased home access for all. Unlike 2008, it won’t be from scummy sub prime mortgaging. It’ll be the natural, long over due correction in the supply of homes but that will inevitably see home prices decline. The government will have to navigate this somehow - maybe they can grandfather existing homeowners by paying off/down their mortgage or something. 

So to answer your question, until that correction is made and these policies erased, I side with stocks. I’m very very hesitant to buy a home (in my 20s) because inevitably this is going to happen and probably within the next 20 years."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Think of rental income as a ridiculously high dividend payment on a stock that still has the potential to grow a few percent every year.

A small town house in a small southern town will cost you approximately $120 thousand to purchase outright. 

Over the course of seven years, assume you draw rental income for 90% of the time (76 months out of 84) at $1100/month, or $83,600. 

In that time, you also spend $10K on maintenance and property management. That brings your income to $73,600 for 7 years. 

Assume 3% appreciation per year for those 7 years. You sell your property for $147,600. After closing costs (approx 5%), that’s a nut hair over $140K. 

That’s around $94K you made on your initial investment of $120K. That’s for an asset that provided you with constant monthly income, in a situation where you had a handle on the cash flow and inner workings of the product and business the entire time. 

Total mismanagement of your investment, combined with asshole tenants who trash the place and cost you tons of extra money, still likely yields you profit at the end of that.

If seven years of stock ownership where the downside is that a garbage company with garbage fundamentals still turns a profit at the end of seven years, then you buy that shit."
04/02/2021,stocks,"In short words, stock market has a higher potential for higher returns, but riskier than real estate. Real estate like buying a house sort of guarantees a steady growth and can bring a high return if purchased at a right time in a right place."

The stock market is ""invest it and forget it,"" I always have a good laugh at my friends who got into investment properties and flipping houses when they tell me their horror stories compared to starting in the stock market 25 years ago and holding through a crash or three. It's as hands on or hands off as you want it to be, you can dodge some taxes in the long run and get out of it at any time - other people are just slaves their own property without realizing it."
04/02/2021,stocks,I spent a few months debating this on my own before investing. I ended up going the stocks route. I chose stocks mainly because I work a job that could move across the country on fairly short notice and have no intention of owning long distance real estate. I am also uncomfortable holding excess amounts of debt. I think real estate is better for people who sell their stocks the minute they dip into the red because it is a much less liquid asset. I do plan on owning real estate but not until I can pay cash for it and stay mostly into stocks.
04/02/2021,stocks,"So you are talking about buying a rental property - not the property you live in? IMHO, One should own their own home before any major investment in equities or other rental real estates.

So let's just assume you own your own home( Maybe is not possible in some areas), then you want to deploy your capital to either stocks or rental properties. When I was young I bought rental properties instead of stocks - I liked having others pay down my mortgage. I did make money - but I could not handle the stress of managing rentals - so I sold and moved into stocks - much less maintenance.

I had a tenant who let her ex-boyfriend move in without my consent or knowledge. Turns out he was a crack head and threatened her and the other tenant I had. She left, but now the dude is using an ax on my walls for laughs, gets into a fight with my remaining tenant - police are called, find handguns, etc...I pay to have my ""good"" tenant moved out, but could not get the crazy dude out. Called the police but they said I would have to go thru the eviction process to remove him! So he leaves 1 day before eviction, but takes the ax to my furnace and destroys it as a parting gift!

04/02/2021,stocks,"I've experimented with both, in the older days, probably real estate, in this era and in most situations, stock market. 

If you live in a place with relative high costs of living, there is significantly more money to be made in the stock market in this era, at significantly more controlled risk, and certainly less work imo. Real estate, however, can be a lot more exciting and enjoyable more for experiential reasons. 

With stocks, you can buy/sell almost at will, from the comfort of your laptop computer, the barrier to entry is much lower, letting you start with as little as $100, up to some very high infinite amount of money. There is also much more variability in controlling risk, you can either pursue a stable mutual fund, comfortably make about 7-8% per year, or go for very high risk/high reward micro-cap stocks, potentially increasing your investments by several folds, something that's essentially almost impossible in real estate, certainly with most working with average capital. 

With real estate, you essentially have to put down a massive several $10,000s in down payment, sometimes even $100,000s, continue to finance the home, while having many risks. For instance, in a down market, you can end up holding onto property that might be worth $10 million, but because of lack of buyers, essentially now bag holding it, no one to sell or rent too. You also run the risks of bad tenants, homes could get destroyed in natural disasters, location market changes. For instance, some people left larger cities during covid, to move to smaller cities, with lower costs of living. If markets change in stocks, you can just sell and buy whatever's the next blooming trend. Real estate, you're pretty much holding onto whatever you have. All this for potentially at best maybe increasing your investments by 2-3 folds after many years, something many are more likely to achieve in the stock market, at much less work and risk, at potentially half the amount of available time. 

The only few advantages to real estate, are tax advantages, certain ways to leverage, and I'll also admit experiential and life necessity. Buying real estate can be more fun and enjoyable in some cases, esp if you're buying your 1st home, since you sort of need a place to live end of day. You can learn to upgrade homes, decorate them, live, rent, sell, and it's cool sometimes to sort of have something physical you can look at and pass on for hopefully many more years to come."

In my experience first with my moms small condos in NYC UWS 20 years ago. The increase in value × cash flow was unmatched by even the best funds at the time .
12 years ago I was able to invest in real estate with 2M. .
Remodeled a 4-unit that had to sell because of celebrity crook contractors + hurricane Sandy .

I also turned a 5800sf townhouse in Washington DC into a 4-unit . Also turned a smaller Townhouse into a 2-unit. In each I had 50% of the property with long-term tenants to pay mortgage and taxes + other expenses. 
In the other 3 apts had Airbnbs. Guests non-stop because of our location. 

It felt like the roaring 20s. We spent 560K paying for college 3 kids during 10 years.  The last 4 before the pandemic visited Asia 5x + Australia/NZ 2x. Plus a few more trips . No stocks can match that level of spending without depleting the principal.

In my view it's not either or. I agree with you on the financial elements of property, but prefer stocks because I don't have to deal with people. On a stock subreddit I understand how talking down stocks warrants a downvote, but the financial of property is solid and I think most people who come here are interested in money first and foremost - stocks are a means to an end(no?). Are you getting downvoted for shitting on stocks, or because they disagree with the financial reasoning?"

04/02/2021,stocks,"Calling the stock market a Ponzi scheme is the silliest thing I ever heard. It’s literal and legal ownership in a company where there is something called the SEC to make sure fishy stuff isn’t going on. If a company continues to grow and increase earnings, stock price (ownership price) should go up because it means the company is more valuable right? Stock price going up is justified. Don’t forget about dividends either.

Also what do you mean by stocks being invisible? It is backed by income statement, balance sheets, and FCF statements. Real hard numbers. Educate yourself before saying things like this.

Reddit user comment about this topic:

“By that logic, any market in the world subject to the laws of supply and demand is a ponzi scheme.

You realise these tickers have companies behind them right? They are not random alphabet letters on a screen. And the value of the stock over the long term tracks the performance of said companies since you are literally buying a portion of that company.

A ponzi scheme has nothing backing it. It's a facade. There is no underlying asset. So sooner or later, it will come crashing down without recovery.

Look at a stock market chart for the last 100 years. There were times in history when it crashed by as much as 30%, 50%, even 90% (during great depression times) but it eventually recovered back and made newer gains. Why? Because it's not an empty vessel. There is an underlying asset.”"

04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes but you’re renting it out for the best time periods/ weather, and enjoying it during the less than favorable weather periods."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Also, finding the right network of contractors to do those repairs is a challenge in of itself, as you have to ensure they’re trustworthy, dependable, and timely. And if you’re managing rental properties, the other big challenge is managing tenants. A bad tenant can make life a living hell and cause many sleepless nights. Of course you can hire a property manager, but you still have to adequately screen and ensure their fees don’t kill your returns. There’s a panoply of things that can tank your deal but if you do it right, real estate is a great investment."

https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/refinance-cash-out"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not to debate the rental aspect but that’s why I’ll only do vacation rentals. Profits higher, you get a whole years worth of mortgage payments in about 2-3 months depending on location and time of year. For example you purchase a condo in fort Myers (tourism high here) 150k your mortgage on 3.5% conventional or investment property status would between 900-1500 if the interest was say 7-10% for investment grade loan. Let’s take 1500. You rent the condo our for 100 bucks nightly (conservative IMO) in 15 days you made your mortgage insurance etc payments and now only have internet utilities bills left. They also pay cleaning fees. If you have full occupancy it’s 3k monthly with 1000+ profit after expenses paid. Not bad for probably 30k investment down payment."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It depends a lot on location and how long you have owned the property for. Some real estate markets are better for cash flow than others. And the rising inflation rate should allow you to charge higher and higher rental rates over time yet your mortgage payments are going to stay the same, so the cash flow should probably continue to increase the longer that you own the property for and once the mortgage is completely paid off, your cash flow will increase a lot since you don't have to make those mortgage payments anymore yet are still receiving the rental income.

Rental income is taxed as ordinary income. However, the United States tax code is very kind to people that own rental property and lets you take deductions for many things that help you to lower your overall tax burden. This is why some very rich real estate owners pay little to no taxes at all. I'd encourage you to Google ""rental tax deductions"" to read more about the many deductions that you can take."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well, as more diverse and liberal groups make it into the mix, I think this is definitely going to become a focal point. 

And it screws over some, but the end result is the benefit of so, so many more. It would be an overall positive and not even come close."
04/02/2021,stocks,That is subjective. The core problem in housing is that it is propped up by artificial scarcity.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Interest rates won’t impact any of my real estate because I’ll be paying cash. If you can’t buy properties cash, I think the stock market makes more sense."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not to worried about interest rates as long as there is room in the budget.

Way back when there was a 14% interest on mortgage (not american btw). This happened rather fast, and a whole generation of first time buyers were scared as fudge. Of course, as they should be, but when they tell their story they forget to mention the 10-20% annual wage increase, the tax breaks etc. 

You don't buy property as an investment without some margin. Say you rent it out and are looking at 20% annual return on investment, your biggest risk is not that interest goes from 2% to 14% over a short timespan (which to me seems unlikely), but that you're loosing tenants. If 1/5 of your tenants move out, you're down to a zero sum game or perhaps looking at property value increase alone. If interest spikes you can write some of it off of your taxes (i dunno, maybe 20% of it? Depends on where you live), and you'll most likely be able to increase rent."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Don't sweat the downvotes. There's certainly a herd mentality in play if you're pushing the bounds of groupthink. 

You can't click a few buttons to invest in real estate, and it's a much messier and more complicated endeavor without any potential for tendies on the moon. Maintenance cost, months of vacancy, tenants who trash the place - lots to be afraid of."

From a depreciation standpoint, we will never sell and we will pass it down to our children.  When considering a vacation rental, it’s important to purchase a place that you eventually will want to live in for a period of time.  If you live in it for a couple years, depreciation goes away.  We plan to retire there."

Pros and cons with both.

I imagine a real estate sub would have a much larger percentage of people who are also in the stock market than most stock subs have of people in real estate. 

I'll be sticking to the stock market until I can fund my real estate in all cash.

2021-04-02 05:42:55,stocks,"Seeking advice: sensible strategy? So, I'm fairly new to swing trading and investing in general and recent news of market movements got me interested in stocks and things. Having an account that was sitting as liquid cash but dying to inflation I figured I should do something with it, it's sizeable but also losing it won't effect my life.

Anyway, I YOLOed a portion on a certain meme stock, it went down, kept hearing it was only going to get worse, sold out, and it's been volatile since. I kept learning, thought I had a good position, bought back in (getting hit with a wash sale, learned that the hard way) and haven't been able to sell out to a break even point.

At this point, I'm actually comfortable going Long in this stock, but would also like to exit the position. I averaged my price down to something that still relatively high, but also in the realm of possibility, and managed to acquire the magic 100 shares.

The question is, would selling Covered Calls be sensible? I'd be happy walking away with a smaller win and recovering the loss at this point, I'm not really looking to get rich quick or break the bank any more, I'd be happy to just recover the loss and exit the position (wouldn't be sad to make some extra cash too, but mostly want off the rollercoaster)

Forgive me if this isn't a good place to ask this, and delete if inappropriate but I think it complies with stated guidelines.  

Thanks in advance."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I would sell your GME for something with actual substance behind it. If you legit have 100 shares of it then you’re nuts. Lots of much less risky ways to make great returns.

My two Schwab accounts are one for aggressive trading, flipping, and options plays, and one for buying ETFs and ignoring them for years.

I'm only a few months in. So far, the ETF account is way ahead of the others. My RH account hasn't grown much beyond the fréë stõçks, and my aggressive account needs to recover another $400 before I can take out what I put in."

Right now you have $19k on the line. Only you know what that’s worth to you. The danger is GME announces a secondary stock offering which, to be fair, completely makes sense for them to do. That will dilute the stock and depending on the size of the offering, the stock could be chopped by 2/3 in a heartbeat. 

I have some shares that I’m holding but I don’t have nearly as much on the line as you do. For what it’s worth, I don’t see how this gets back up to the highs of the early squeeze, especially if more shares coming on the market are imminent. I think there’s limited upside and it’s a pretty big gamble."

So this week we saw DISCB$ made a huge upward spike soaring to a high of 150$. This move was on super low volume and many believe it was a short squeeze, but I see something that makes me suspicious of this

I took a look at a 1 year chart of DISCB$ and I see that around last year this happened too. This stock soared to 103$ from 32$. So what are the chances this happened twice? Well....I don't quite know yet.

2.  Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (LTRPB)

This one is so much more bizarre then Discovery because this upward spike happened to this stock not once or twice, but SIX times in the last year. This stock literally goes from penny status to 100s in the matter of days. The first spike happened in April of last year and it soared to a high of 134$. In June of 2020 it jumped from the 20s to 82$ and in July from 47$ to 74$ dollars. Then then in August of 2020 it soared from 46$ to 69$ dollars and then last month it soared from 31$ to 59$.

I don't have any conclusions to make, but I will keep an eye on these two stocks in case this happens again. Free money? Who knows....

Edit: I should have added the short % on Liberty B is less than 1%......

Edit 2: [this might be the solution to the mystery](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/statistical-arbitrage.asp)"
04/02/2021,stocks,2. I am pretty sure it is stock buybacks.
04/02/2021,stocks,Now that you've posted it will never happen again. sorry
04/02/2021,stocks,TDLR: the market has stumped me yet again ... 😒😞 sigh
04/02/2021,stocks,"I've seen this one doing that, too. Have zero knowledge of why it's doing that lol

EDIT: Found this article, in which Discovery and Trip Advisor are both mentioned

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/discovery-class-b-stock-surges-185813683.html"
04/02/2021,stocks,"This has been happening because some fund out there has pair trades on between the different stock issues betting the spread will converge (e.g. between DISCB and DISCKA/DISCK), and then it doesn’t happen and the spread gets wider, then they puke the position for risk management only to find out DISCB is illiquid as fuck and they’re fighting themselves to get out of the position."
04/02/2021,stocks,Not super low volume.  Literally almost 50x average daily volume.  These are both extremely thinly traded stocks.
04/02/2021,stocks,I've noticed this on a few stocks when I look at the yearly charts especially in the OTC markets. A pump and dump is one thing but like you're saying they will shoot up thousands of % in one move and then shoot right back down and it makes no sense. Check google for news correlating to the dates and I get nada.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I just heard about this happening today to another class B stock. I forgot which one though but it probably has to do with it being the ""B"".

Edit: I remember the stock.  It was KELYB."
04/02/2021,stocks,Dammit! Bought the wrong Discovery. Should’ve got B!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Up vote, very strange sir very strange."
04/02/2021,stocks,I mean... maybe money laundering?
04/02/2021,stocks,Liberty is very interesting. Alert set :)
04/02/2021,stocks,Adding to alerts.  This is definitely something worth monitoring.  Who knows?  Maybe we can cash in somehow?
04/02/2021,stocks,"The common thread?: All of the stocks are low float, super voting shares tied to billionaire John Malone’s empire.-yhoo"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Honestly the key indicator is volume if it’s exceedingly low volume it doesn’t matter because it’s an anomaly that doesn’t describe the actual market perception of the underlying. 

Low volume price spikes can happen from someone fat fingering a limit order with an extra 0."
04/02/2021,stocks,Hmm... interesting 🤔
04/02/2021,stocks,"Supposedly one person owns 95% of DISCB...cnbc published that anyway and i think seekingalpha too. Probably just pure manipulation idk, once get it on the top gainers it wouldnt be hard to cause a mass buy in with only short amount of stock to offer and just step ladder the sells to try to get it price up"
04/02/2021,stocks,You guys on r/stocks ever think it was a big HEDGE FUND liquidating or?
04/02/2021,stocks,Very curious indeed..
04/02/2021,stocks,It happens in foreign exchange too I remember December of 2018 the yen moved 200 pips in less than 2 minutes(a fucking lot for a whole currency) but it eats itself back and goes right back to where it was and it never saw those lows until covid hit.
04/02/2021,stocks,And ltrpa owner sold a ton of stock
04/02/2021,stocks,Isn't the volume pretty low. I've known of these two stocks since April of last year surges and kept an eye on them. I think one of those stocks only had like 150k shares daily volume when it started going up.
04/02/2021,stocks,Why did discA go down but discb go up?
04/02/2021,stocks,Might be revwrse stock splits
04/02/2021,stocks,Jesus this sub is such trash. Missing the biggest event of financial markets in the past weeks
04/02/2021,stocks,This makes sense because they repurchased shares from Certares two or three weeks ago.
04/02/2021,stocks,Which were illegal until Reagan became president
04/02/2021,stocks,No. Buyback traders aren't blind fools.
04/02/2021,stocks,"It shouldn’t have that much impact or shouldn’t be allowed to have that much impact. Otherwise companies and insiders with similar financials could just rinse and repeat and make a killing .

Edit: should for shouldn’t"
04/02/2021,stocks,Or the seasonality is a coincidence and it's just two separate instances of someone googling the name and not noticing they're buying the wrong ticker.
04/02/2021,stocks,Wouldn't they have to be pretty incompetent though to try stat arb with such a low float on one side of the pair ?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not to that extreme but I've seen a few pop 30-300% for no apparent reason then usually settle back down over hours or days.  

A sure way to prevent that seems to be buying low and setting an open sell for significant pops, or just planning to do that which prevents the stock from settling down."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, by the time I learned DISCB was super voting and realized it should trade at a premium to DISCA it was too late"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I wondered if he was buying up the remaining super vote shares"
04/02/2021,stocks,What are the chances that happens 6 times.
04/02/2021,stocks,"John Malone. Dude used to own a communications empire, now owns a real-estate empire."
04/02/2021,stocks,I mean they did liquidate all their positions and in DISC it was a big position.
04/02/2021,stocks,That’s an interesting theory for sure.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Banks were liquidating, which drove the price down. Then buyer(s) drove DISCB up. It’s highly illiquid as John Malone owns 94%."
04/02/2021,stocks,LTRPB has no history of splits.
04/02/2021,stocks,Is that the company that made the offer to Hertz?
04/02/2021,stocks,"And this would be important why?  They claimed it was manipulation, but in reality isn't much different than a stock split or in this case a reverse split.  If you can issue more shares than a company should be able to buy shares back.  How would share issues be any different in the realm of stock manipulation?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Filing my company to SEC on Monday.
Ticker: GMEB"
04/02/2021,stocks,Nope. Remember there’s no urgency in being a normal buyer in this scenario (no catalyst specific to DISCB). They could just sit there accumulating slowly without pushing up the price like that. This kind of buying aggression comes from short sellers.
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes. Why are we assuming fund competence though when Archegos just blew up last week from pushing up VIAC and DISCA/DISCK with 5X leverage?
04/02/2021,stocks,"0 effect this is basic stuff if the broad market isn’t there to offer the liquidity to move it consistently at that level it doesn’t matter.

Independent events have no correlation.

Honestly I feel like you are trying to shill with qanon non correlated metrics to manipulate.

The average volume is 25k shares any stats you are trying to apply are worthless.

For consideration discb trades at an 80 PE as of close today, Amazon is 75...."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Idk then, good find. Any news articles that came out around that time?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Do your research, Stock Buybacks were illegal in the United States until Reagan became president"
04/02/2021,stocks,This already happened to GMEC.
04/02/2021,stocks,"DISCA was severely cheaper because of the unwinding of Archegos' holding. That's an artificial oversupply and can be expected to be temporary. The urgency is to get a long position before it retraces.

All it takes then is punching in a big enough share count and hitting the buy button. Then shitting your pants when you look at the ticker symbol and the prices going parabolic in the fill notices.

If someone was already short DISCB, why would they suddenly cover like that? They know there's no actual issue with their shares. And they probably know exactly which ticker they were shorting. That would be a really odd ticker to short anyway. Are they just parked on it hoping that John Malone will have a seizure and sell out his holding on the public book?

If it was a short, it could be a DISCA short who somehow entered a buy-to-open on DISCB instead of a buy-to-close on DISCA. Still way less likely than the original premise of a buyer making the obvious mistake."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Maybe we shouldn't. It just looks like a rookie mistake or terrible risk management if you are right. But yeah, everything is possible."
04/02/2021,stocks,I was just asking what are the chances it happens 6 times i didn’t mean to sound cheeky. I’m not trying to shill at all. However the answer seems to have been found. Apparently Liberty itself has been repurchasing shares.
04/02/2021,stocks,Nope. Only articles talking about it soaring 3000% percent in a day.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Again, and what is the importance of your statement?  I clarified why they are no longer illegal.  Which party wrote the law?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t think we will see any major DISCA retrace. Those high prices from weeks ago were from Archegos in the first place.

But fine, let’s go with it being a mistake. I don’t see why the actual reason for the buying actually matters here. In either case, not really a tradeable phenomenon is it? If you buy into DISCB under the assumption that someone with deep pockets is going to eventually fat finger a buy order in the name, there’s no real guarantee that would happen right?"
04/02/2021,stocks,It was the law before any of us were born
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think two incidents in two years says yes, there's a chance of a 100% ROI in the next two years."
04/02/2021,stocks,"they are asking you to explain WHY they are ""bad"". Not when they were made legal."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Again, who cares.  It was determined that there was no reason to keep it illegal as the reasoning was flawed.  Many things once deemed illegal are no longer deemed illegal.  Did you know that it was illegal for Banks to provide investment banking and retail banking together until Bill Clinton repealed it."
2021-04-02 05:08:00,stocks,"Stock trade taxes question I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding the taxes related to sells at profit/losses.

Let's say, I sell Apple shares at a profit of $1000, but I also sell shares of Microsoft at a loss of $900.

Do I get taxed on the Apple shares of $1000? or am I taxed just $100?

If I didn't sell Microsoft at a loss, I'm pretty sure I'm taxed on the $1000, but I was told I could cover my losses with my gains. Is this right? Sorry for the dumb question."
04/02/2021,stocks,"In simplest terms you would report a $1,000 gain and $900 loss and pay either short or long term capital gains on the $100 difference.

Gains are not capped, however the amount of losses you can claim in any one year is capped. You may ve able to carry over losses depending on current tax laws at the time.  The currently losses are capped at $3k.  

Consult you tax advisor, this is a simple explanation, but there are differnet caveats that may apply based upon the timing of sales, you tax filing status, etc..."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’ll tell you when I file taxes next year 😂

04/02/2021,stocks,"Depends on the timing. If you bought and sold both on the same day then you would add them together and only pay taxes on $100 gain.

04/02/2021,stocks,I find it strange and horrifying that so many people are jumping into stocks and have zero clue about it. I literally minored in business so that I would have an understanding of finance and investments.
04/02/2021,stocks,This is not true.  Capital losses are first used to offset a capital gain of the same type.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Unless he sold a stock for a loss. Which in this case, he would pay tax on the $100 total gain from the 2 transactions."
04/02/2021,stocks,Or you ask questions and do some research.  You don’t need a tax professional to find the answer to a basic question like this.

04/02/2021,stocks,I'm sure the Reddit defense will go over a treat in the audit. No offense but if this is their primary source instead of reading and being able to comprehend the tax code they're asking for problems down the line. Enhanced tax assistance is $80 ffs
2021-04-02 04:58:35,stocks,"AMZN vs GOOG - and what formulas do you guys like to use when comparing two companies Just a simple and fun question: if you had to choose one to invest your money in for the long haul, would you choose Amazon or Google?

Also, when comparing two companies and trying to figure out which is the better investment, what do you like to use to compare the two. I’m familiar with some, just was wondering what your guys favorites are. Thanks!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t compare them, I buy both. I’m a poor lil bitch so I only own 1 share each like a clown but I love them both equally. If I had a gun to my head and had to choose one, I’d choose google."
04/02/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/02/2021,stocks,"You can't really compare them, but I'll just go ahead and say that I love GOOG. Why? They have a monopoly on web traffic with Google search, a monopoly on video sharing with YouTube, and a duopoly in the mobile OS market. The weakest components of their business are their cloud services and advertising, solely because of the competition Amazon and Facebook pose respectively. Let that sink in. The FLOOR for Google is its cloud services (growing 47% YOY) and advertising.

From a fundamentals perspective, GOOG is trading at the same P/E as AAPL but is growing its revenue exponentially faster. When I say ""exponentially"" faster I mean that literally. Seriously, look at their respective YOY revenue growth charts on macrotrends. You could argue AAPL is simply overpriced, but so is everything else. In this overpriced market, GOOG is trading at a discount.

Disclosure: Not financial advice. I own shares of GOOG and options in GOOGL"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Worked at both for quite sometime. If you put a gun to my head and made me pick where I put all my money, it would go to AMZN 7 days a week and twice on Sundays - I’d sleep like a baby.

AMZN culture is basically designed to grow and grow. GOOG is a grad student’s fever dream. 

AMZN has consistently shown an ability to enter and succeed in new segments (started as an online bookstore, now run the internet... somehow?). GOOG had a great search engine, monetized it with ads and... that’s mostly it for the last couple of decades, I guess?

GOOG has a golden goose, AMZN is a goose factory."
04/02/2021,stocks,"AMZN

They are not easily comparable businesses though. In a more traditional sense AMZN is a retail business and Alphabet is essentially an advertising platform."
04/02/2021,stocks,"My guess is as good as others, but i would say Amazon if <3-4yrs perspective and Google if time perspective is longer."
04/02/2021,stocks,Lotta people making compelling arguments for both companies so I decided to buy MSFT.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Holding AMZN, GOOG, NFLX and MSFT long term but moving into semiconductors for diversification and potential short/mid upside due to the shortage (TSM i'm looking at you!) 😂

Gotta play all sectors to prevail in the new normal. 

In any case, if it had to be one it would be Amazon over the long term. Aggressive retail expansion and proven strategies in confronting new growth sectors, coupled with a growing work-from-home segment in the wake of the pandemic.

YMMV but i'm adamant about the aftermath of all this being a ""hybrid"" work environment - naturally favourable towards Amazon."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I lazily check Amazons Price/FCF ratio and make sure there is steady growth ahead. Google I just look at PE and how it compares to historical and PEG values. Right now I view Amazon as a better deal and own it, it is trading in the bottom half of its historical price to FCF. I do not own Google and see it as overvalued. You can also do a DCF on the two.

Finally on the qualitative front I see Amazon as the more durable and innovative company with much more runway to growth and it isn’t even close. 

Edit: Saw a lot on here saying you can’t compare these stocks. That’s nonsense. Of course you can compare them (DCF, financial metrics, comps, qual analysis) and one is a better purchase than the other."
04/02/2021,stocks,"In this case, I have shares and calls in Amazon and Facebook.  Google just sat around like a dead fish for so long that I gave up on it.  FB has all kinds of headline risk, but it's printing money with a low PE relative to growth rate, and has yet to really monetize Whatsapp.  Amazon is just one of those companies that is growing and they keep reinvesting in that growth.  The profits are starting to show, but if they were focused on profits they would be making more and have a better PE.

So...I don't have Google because FB is in the same space (ad revenue primary driver).  Amazon is really in a category all its own.  If you really must choose between the two...what's your holding period?  If you're trading, FB has violent ups and downs (Google may start to behave a bit more erratic as well).  Amazon tends to build a base and then explode like a coiled spring.  I honestly expect them both to have a great April.  I'm more likely to sell FB when the next move up is done, however.  AMZN more of a long term hold."
04/02/2021,stocks,Like comparing two unlike companies?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think one can make money on both.

But between AMZN and Google I like AMZN. Google is considered a pseudo reopening play as travel and entertainment related search revenue will go up.
But I feel YouTube which had a blowout year in 2020 will not be as profitable when people are not looking at their phones 8 hours a day. Google also has a anti trust lawsuit, which I feel they will get away with but there might be some repercussions and also the ongoing hearings haven't given them any good PR.

AMZN also has made money from all the deliveries but that is more habit forming. Some people will go back to stores but overall getting things delivered is easier regardless of pandemic. AMZN also is getting into sports broadcasting. AWS continuous to grow and the new CEO is coming from AWS. Amazon has been fighting against Senators on Twitter but honestly they can. They already pay the $15 min wage. So if a law to that effect gets into effect they don't really lose anything.

Corporate tax increase will hurt both equally at a high level. AMZN might suffer more but overall I feel AMZN will rise more.

Some factors I consider while choosing among similar companies - P/E ratio and/or PSR. Plans for future. Possible market share growth, management team, short/long term government impacts (this may not be restricted to US government). Potential meaningful lawsuits etc.

04/02/2021,stocks,What do you think would cause Amazon stock to crash and never recover?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Agree with GOOG. I don’t have technical reasons, but I watch YouTube every day for news and music (and I’d say many of my friends and family do as well). Just today they added the Netflix feature where the video starts playing when you just scroll over it. I try to keep my paid subscriptions to a minimum but YouTube premium will happen eventually"

2021-04-02 04:45:24,stocks,"ESOP and it’s effects on stock price I’ve been following a company that I’m very interested in. It’s a small cap company with cool products and a visionary CEO. My concern currently is the amount of shares they have (2.5 billion outstanding). The CEO has said he will not pursue a reverse split or a buyback. He did mention the possibility of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) however. 

My question is how does an ESOP affect the amount of outstanding shares or float? Could they effectively cut the current share pool in half by declaring half of them for employees only? I have no idea how it works and googling has not been super helpful."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Usually the esop just means the employees get some benefit to purchase the stock.   Often it’s either subsidized by the company or offered at a fixed price to the employee based on some schedule, and comes with some type of limitations around selling the stock.   Often esop stock is not supposed to be sold for the duration of employment, so it’s a way for the company to reduce the effective float at a discount without doing a buyback or reverse split or something.   These esop programs can vary widely but most often they have some requirement for officers of the company to hold some amount of stock, with x years to accomplish it.   So if they set the requirement at 1x salary for all directors and up, a large company with many director level roles could possibly set back from a few million dollars in a year up to tens of millions.   Other esop structures can offer stock as part of salary or as a performance bonus, or offer ITM options that have a requirement to be exercised, it can really be set up any number of ways to varying degrees.

Tldr; it won’t reduce the total number of shares in circulation, or technically reduce the float, but it will have a dampening effect to the circulating shares by constraining some of them in long term holds by employees.  To calculate the impact you’d need to read the terms of the esop and do a bit of math."
04/02/2021,stocks,Whats the company 👀🤔  I would love to do some research on it also
04/02/2021,stocks,Hey thanks this was really helpful. I guess my follow up question is do shares used for esop also factor into the market capitalization of the company?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Definitely $AITX. 

This company is setting up the right way and going to be massive."
04/02/2021,stocks,I’m 90% sure he’s talking about $AITX
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yea they’re just normal shares owned by employees, with some conditions placed around when they can be bought or sold.

For example, if there’s 100 director level positions at a large company who are all required to hold 1x their salary within 5 years, and that salary is $100k on average, with a stock price of $10, then the company may offer the stock to them for $5 in exchange for them not selling it for 5 years.

In this case the company would have the employees somehow acquire 1/5 of their salary each year in stock from the regular float, then somehow either pay them back through payroll or bonus, or match the shares or whatever mechanism is selected for the cost sharing.  There’s typically no new shares created for this.   The company may subsidize this purchase and typically does, so the employees have incentive to participate in the program.   For the company it’s cheaper than an outright buy back, and the employee gets some benefit and ownership stake in the company, which can be a good motivation for them to help increase the stock price.

When esop blackout periods are lifted you’ll often see some buying pressure on the stock as all 100 directors of the company start making their buys and demand goes up, particularly in the first few years it’s offered.   depending on specifics and how many are participating in a given year it may not be that noticeable, and as the employees meet their ownership targets the buying pressure will taper off some.

In the case above with 100 directors all buying $20k of stock for 5 years, you’d be getting about $2m worth of purchasing (200k shares) happening on the open market each year.   If the float is 1 billion shares at $10/share it will hardly be noticeable if it’s just 200k shares a year (0.01% of float).   On the other hand if there’s 100m shares float and the stock price is $1 then it could be a significant driver at 2% of float each year ending up with 10% of the shares employee owned after 5 years.

All in all this is a nice thing but I don’t see it as a significant driver of stock price in most cases.   If it’s a very widespread esop where many employees are participating it can give it a nice bump, but the esop is most often limited to leadership roles within the company or at least people who are most able to influence the financial decisions."

04/02/2021,stocks,How much are you willing to pay for a milkshake that someone spilled on the floor?
04/02/2021,stocks,"If there are ten billion shares, a 1-cent company is still worth $100 million. So 1 cent isn't even close to as low as things can go.

Shares have four prices: last, bid, ask, and par value.

The last is the ""current price,"" but it is already in the past.

The bid is the highest buy offer quoted in the book.

The ask is the lowest sell offer quoted in the book.

The par value is a pre-set intrinsic value quoted by the company when it issues the shares. It isnt simply 0 because there are jurisdictions where it's illegal for a company to sell securities below the stated par value and the company has to state that value to comply. But there are exceptions, so there can be securities with 0 par value. $0.001 is a fairly common par value. And while the company couldn't sell the shares below that, the public can trade at any price it wants.

As for how a company gets there, it isn't easy. Nobody issues stock that low, so they all started out way higher and somehow lost the market's trust. But there's a noise floor. Even companies in reorganization that have declared their intent to cancel their common shares still have quotes and trades in those shares at nonzero prices."

Of course, this company was never trading at $100,000 a share. They just keep doing reverse splits and keep doing offerings. So in essence they are $0.0000001."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Well, this is more or less purely an academic question. 

A stock price can be anything, really. There's really no reason why a share couldn't have a negative price, as in: ""I'm so desperate to get rid of my stock that I would pay you to take it off my hands.""

A company isn't bankrupt because it's stock price is zero, though. A company that has gone bankrupt may have a zero, or close to zero, stock price. 

There is only one mechanism by which a company goes bankrupt, and that is that if it has debt that it's unable to pay its creditors. If the company has zero debt and it's stock price is zero or negative, it is not bankrupt and it cannot go bankrupt until it has debt that it's unable to pay off.

The price of a stock is just whatever the last transaction on it was. If you're selling it for 0.01, that's just the sell price. If someone's buying it for $100, then that's what someone's buying it for and the difference is the spread."

2021-04-02 04:15:03,stocks,"PLTR is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is my bullish thesis. First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more ""abstract"" and less known factors.

&#x200B;

 

First of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public

04/02/2021,stocks,"So we should invest in PLTR because the CEO  does Tai Chi regularly? I saw couple of his interviews and he seems to be all over the places and gave no logical reason to believe in the stock. Of course the stock price gonna increase (may be 3,4,5 times) in 3/5/10 years like many other stocks but will it go to the moon? No. They work is niche market, and assuming they are super innovative is wrong."
04/02/2021,stocks,Great company but insanely overvalued. Probably see it in the mid teens soon
04/02/2021,stocks,20 year harvest
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think PLTR is a 10 year hold. Didn’t it just IPO this year? If you already bought in at $35+, I would think you would love buying more now."
04/02/2021,stocks,I don't care about this stupid stock anymore. I am looking to get out once I make even.
04/02/2021,stocks,"PLTR was pumped (I guess I should use this word carefully, but you know what I mean) up by Reddit and far exceeded its valuation within a few short months. Folks are bullish on the stock, not because it has some massive potential as another multi billion dollar company, but because it is a meme stock and we are familiar with it, and folks think it can gain for a few hundred percent in a couple months"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I just met someone at work who was with palantir very very early when they were just a newborn start up, and let me tell you....it’s amazing they are in still in business"
04/02/2021,stocks,Double Click Day April 14th. I believe.
04/02/2021,stocks,Low bottom? Wouldn’t you want a high bottom company

04/02/2021,stocks,"I would trust Peter Thiel and his Founders Fund with all my money. They've backed some of the coolest companies I can think of. I've watched a lot of interviews of Peter, and I agree 100% with his investment thesis and general views on business. I think he picked a winner with PLTR."
04/02/2021,stocks,I got my 100 shares locked in this week. 🤞🏽
04/02/2021,stocks,"So, you’re telling me my $26 call expiring on 4/23 is shit?"
04/02/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’m not currently holding PLTR, but fwiw I do believe they’re going to be absolutely huge one day. 
I also believe I have plenty of time to buy shares."
04/02/2021,stocks,I own PLTR too and am sticking to it for the longterm. 5-10 year window for me and expect it to creep back up into earnings.
04/02/2021,stocks,"It might not fail, but there is still a very little chance that it outpaces the market anytime soon. Zero point in investing in a company that won't outgain the market."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm just gonna say that I don't buy any sort of notion that PLTR is too big to fail. Most people don't invest in PLTR, have any idea what it is or what it does, and I'd hazard a guess that most people around the world when asked, ""So what is your opinion on Palantir?"", and who don't just say, ""What's that?"", would wonder if you're referring to Sarumon from Lord of the Rings.

That's not to say anything about its potential future success, though. I'm just saying if things goes downhill, the only thing that can save it is itself."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Boy, I hope to Christ PLTR never gets access to classified info."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's possibly the most overhyped stock on this sub. The company has likely peaked, and that's mostly on the backs of the fact that the person behind it happened to hit the jackpot with Paypal, and his management skill's contribution to that success was likely very limited. But his name was a brand, and even with it Palantir isn't making that much either. Yet everyone here seems to own it. The most likely good case for them is that they will remain as a niche software company scoring occasional contracts here or there."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Random stupid prediction: whenever (and if) the GME craze will die down, PLTR will be flocked with all those sweet ape money, and the stock will rise again +X0%. Maybe by summer? Who really knows."
04/02/2021,stocks,WTF! Really!!
04/02/2021,stocks,"To be fair, they've posted this multiple times but it's been on different subreddits."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this type of investment thesis is pretty superficial. We get that the company is well poised to grow and increase revenues in the future. Nobody is expecting Palantir to go out of business. 

But if you don't cough up the hard numbers, give a realistic prediction of revenue and cash flow based on reasonable assumptions, and show that the stock price does not reflect the future growth of the company as of right now, the thesis means very little. Which targets does the company need to surpass to achieve growth beyond what is already priced in as of right now?

I like the company, but at the current valuation the growth that it will surely experience is not enough for me to expect profits on the stock anytime soon."
04/02/2021,stocks,LOGIC?!?! IN THIS SUB?! WELL ILL BE DAMNED!
04/02/2021,stocks,Amen
04/02/2021,stocks,I'm gonna add to this that nearly all Reddit Hyped Stocks (with maybe the exception of GS) are always Bad Investments.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Dude I hate this stock and will continue to hold puts on it until it's under 20. During the peak hype they'd get like an 8 million dollar contract and the market cap would go up a few billion.

Also my private sector company I work for is using in house teams to clean up our data systems."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This one is a patience stock, tis not gonna shoot up till it gets a large private vendor. while i like the Idea of getting involved with Governments i'm increasing thinking that Governments are going to be unable to fully move on from IBM and ORACLE systems in the short or medium term, and while PLTR can work with those systems I just don't see the full platform integration happing, which is what you need for those 22.00 to become 220.00 a share.   


I own PLTR and i'm down roughly 15%"
04/02/2021,stocks,"“Hopefully soon” is unlikely for PLTR. The nature of their profit model is contract growth, meaning layered, residual streams. Good for sustained health, but will require a ramp period. Because of the current state of valuation vs market sentiment, I struggle to understand how/why anyone might think of them as a near term growth play. 

I fully expect them to have a lot of red days and mostly trade sideways or slightly down for the next 2-6 months before beginning a slow climb which accelerates over time."
04/02/2021,stocks,"this is how..... long term investing works. lol

shocking r/stocks doesn't realize this. it IPO'd like what 6 months ago? lol"
04/02/2021,stocks,Are you sure we can't hype this position up?
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is boomer thinking. We’ve now had several years where sales don’t matter, only growth. Tesla is the best example."
04/02/2021,stocks,Cough cough Tesla
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yep; I used to own PLTR and now I’m out.  I don’t get the love for this stock either.  It’s too overpriced for what it is.  How can a 20 year old software company make 1B yet loses 1.1B?  Software has the highest margins around.  It’s growth is already slowing down.

I don’t see it ever reaching its potential if it hasn’t done it in 20 years.  People love to compare it to Amazon but after 20 years; Amazon was dominating e-commerce and cloud and became extremely profitable.  The constant insider selling, the low institutional ownership, the lack of Wall Street analysts and the ridiculous amount of shares are all headwinds for the stock."
04/02/2021,stocks,Tenuous might not be the word you’re looking for
04/02/2021,stocks,"Clarify your use of “at some point”? What are the necessary time frame and price growth required to justify a stock buy, in your mind?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"First of all, PLTR is not a meme stock like GME. It was just insanely hyped on wsb for a short period of time. Second of all, of course that at some point they will need to grow their profits and eventually start being profitable.This does not dissprove my point, that is why they are called growth stocks. Furthermore, what do you consider analysys? I should have uploaded an excel table to show you a PLTR valuation using Gordon growth model or DCF or price multiples? Also traditional valuation models do not work that well, when used to value growth stocks that are just starting to capture market share. Seeing the bigger picture is more important."
04/02/2021,stocks,This is so true
04/02/2021,stocks,Cathie likes teradyne. Nobody watching that
04/02/2021,stocks,More pictures please. Can't read.
04/02/2021,stocks,PLTR is a pump. For sure.
04/02/2021,stocks,Which is why I always down vote when I see a PLTR post. It's been pumped way too much around here.
04/02/2021,stocks,Why😄?

04/02/2021,stocks,"Cognizant is an easy one bc it's a consultancy, as in they don't have a software to sell. Splunk focuses mostly on IT operations, whereas Palantir built a software platform that can handle any type of data-driven operations, hence allowing it to replicate Splunk, ERPs, supply chain operations, healthcare, etc. That said, there is some tradeoffs (larger learning curve than Splunk/others, steeper pricing, etc.).

The stock is definitely carrying a premium and by no means cheap at all, but I'm not worried about holding shares of a company with great outlook. And most of its peers (who have worse business/products) are at a higher valuation/premium. If anything, comments like these give me confidence that this stock will be a money maker as it means there is a huge knowledge gap between what the public thinks it does vs. what it actually does."
04/02/2021,stocks,"He sold 10 mil in stock for tax purposes, cuz he was able ot exercise stock options worth 1.6 billion."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah.  I don't think and of those companies failed ether.  They were too big too fail.
04/02/2021,stocks,Hope your right
04/02/2021,stocks,I agree and disagree.18.5 to 16 incoming. Insanely undervalued stock. $100-200 coming in 6 years.
04/02/2021,stocks,Agreed.
04/02/2021,stocks,I heard the same. You can tell a lot about the company by their talent hiring and retention. Internally its a shitshow. Top talent devs and PMs jumping ship.
04/02/2021,stocks,Fuck whoever downvoted you.
04/02/2021,stocks,"That's more or less universal, though. The entire market and especially tech will face valuation headwinds."
04/02/2021,stocks,So you think PLTR with all of these government contracts is a scam?  Sounds like we have bigger issues with our government that I thought.
04/02/2021,stocks,Well written.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Just because the stock price doesn't match the intrinsic value it doesn't mean it will actually go down. It could easily go sideways or even up in the future, so be careful. :)"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Absolutely agree. I have a handful of individual stocks of which Palantir is one. It's 3% of my portfolio which may not sound like a lot, but I've fed that allocation over the last month or so to keep it at 3%. It'll be incubated and not touched for years to come. Best thing I can do is give it the room to grow at it's own pace and stay out of my own way. 

Bottom line, it's a set it and forget it position that I'll continue to keep at 3%+ as long as the thesis for owning doesn't change."
04/02/2021,stocks,Just throw 5% of the portfolio into 2023 LEAPS and call it a day
04/02/2021,stocks,"> mostly trade sideways or slightly down for the next 2-6 months before beginning a slow climb which accelerates over time.

A 6 month wait is nothing at this point. Been slowly building equity with PLTR not long after it IPOed.

But I agree, anyone looking for a quick buck is going to be disappointed. It's going to take a while -- probably even longer than your prediction. I do think the potentially disruptiveness and usefulness of the product is worth the risk, though."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yea. It is also up 100% in those 6 months. But it seems all people remember is the run up to $40. And fall to 20. When it was trading at $9-10 in November.
04/02/2021,stocks,It has been hyped for 8 months.
04/02/2021,stocks,Of course we use tesla as the example. They did it so every company will.  Who cares what you pay for a company anymore as an investor.  They only go up. Why bother with fundamentals of anything?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not good comparison. Tesla sells to general population, Palantir sells to governments, armies, and big organizations."
04/02/2021,stocks,More like inktomi
04/02/2021,stocks,My love for it is comments like yours. I love controversial stocks. Especially when Wall St doesn’t know what box to put it in or what analysts should cover it. Is it a consulting firm? Defense contractor? Software company? You got Goldman Sachs slapping a 44x multiple on and Morgan Stanley saying underweight.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Like you said, what is this company?  A combo of consulting, defense, and AI software? Seems too unfocused.  Defense and consulting stocks have historically underperform and defense is highly dependent on who’s in office.

They talked big with AI and best software company in the world but their margins are underwhelming for a software company.  They can’t scale enormously because their business model caters to individual companies needs.  I believe they only have 120 customers while being in business for 20 years.  So another 20 years to get to 240?  One company generates 20% of the revenue too."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I hope not but I think you’re right. Maybe we shouldn’t treat PLTR as a growth stock, but as a value. It’s not a meme stock like GME but it was and valuation still has a sing of it."
04/02/2021,stocks,"You ever hear of a growth trap,  or the analogy of an ipo being a burning match? The lack of skepticism from their investors is like none I've ever seen"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Lol, PLTR was a meme stock before GME became famous.
The again so was TSLA."
04/02/2021,stocks,It is still one of the top three most posted stocks on reddit.

04/02/2021,stocks,It is without a doubt a meme stock. No reason folks are balls deep in the stock except for the memes they see and the terrible DD.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Its literally a meme stock.

Most investors are not even really sure what does Palantir do to make a living."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I thought that until IBM, which has their own AI they've been putting $10s of millions / year into pushing, said they're going to start integrating Palantir solutions for their data cloud customers.

Why would they do that unless the product itself did things Watson couldn't?

The tech is there, but getting people to essentially change ERPs is a slog. PLTR will eat ""dumb"" ERPs like SAP for breakfast."
04/02/2021,stocks,It was beautiful mang
04/02/2021,stocks,The whole IPO was designed for insiders to dump stock.
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s a $23 stock after 18 years, but it’ll be a $100 stock in 24 years.  Uh, probably not."
04/02/2021,stocks,"If this gets to $16, count me in."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I honestly thought it was going to break the 21-22 support line and retrace well under 20, but it seems to be holding up.

Anything below $20 will be a huge buying opportunity and I'll be loading up. My long-term price target is also $100. 6 years sounds about right, although I'd be fine with 10."
04/02/2021,stocks,That would be dope as I hold lots
04/02/2021,stocks,"Is that unreasonable? I'm all for seeing all points, but that comment was next-level ambiguous."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yep. 99% of my money is in bullish long positions. Not betting too much on those puts. I mean premiums were high anyways it's a gamble for sure.
04/02/2021,stocks,Lol what? Their IPO was less than 6 months ago.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I agree that PLTR is worth it. Though I’ve acknowledged that it should ramp slowly, I believe it will beat the indices by 3/1/2023."
04/02/2021,stocks,whats ur average?
04/02/2021,stocks,"If it goes under 20 I may pick up a few, but I think it's going to continue to trade sideways for a long time and I rather have my money growing in that time."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Currently at a 50b eval. A $100 PT would put it at 250b... I’d park my money somewhere else tbh.

Also I hate how the stock trades. Good news is most definitely bad for the stock, and it’s broken a lot of moving averages..."
04/02/2021,stocks,"And as someone who has been forced to use their product...

I fucking hated it.  It's well made and is probably perfect for many, but it's being forced down the throats of some"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Rationally I agree with you. It’s just that with this rational kind of thinking, you missed out on so many gains over the past years. I know I have. Your thesis can be right, but in the end it’s all about what the market as a whole thinks. It’s like the saying: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don’t like to for the following reasons:  low institutional ownership, gigantic float, P/S is high, constant stream of insiders selling but no buying."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It’s still a growth stock but one that’s already priced in.  They are projected to do 4B in revenue by 2024.  That’s priced in at today’s price.

To get to the 100B market cap; they’ll need ~10B in revenue; where and when is the 10B coming from?  It seems like 2027 or later for 10B.  I think it’s possible to get there by 2027 just not EOY like the bulls are expecting."
04/02/2021,stocks,"something being a meme stock doesn't indicate anything.

contrary to popular opinion -- retail investors  don't move stocks."
04/02/2021,stocks,"That’s a bit of positive news for the stock. (I don’t own it and really dislike the company, but that’s probably good for stockholders)."
04/02/2021,stocks,I platentold you!!!
04/02/2021,stocks,except they still hold a decent amount of stock right now..

04/02/2021,stocks,"lol right, its a textbook downvotable comment. and i never downvote anyone."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Whoops. I'm an idiot. It must've just seemed that long because it's one of the first solid conviction positions I've taken and have been building for a while without selling. I got in in late October, on further inspection. Will edit my previous message ASAP, thank you.

My belief about the company and the stock remains the same, though!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"yea but look at microsoft for example. Traded down/sideways for what, 17 years? Then it just mooned. Patience is key, you never know what can happen and in the case of pltr, when it gets too important and integrated, thats when it'll really rocket. It'll be a long time but i fully believe it will"
04/02/2021,stocks,The PLTRGOD is gonna park his money somewhere else ?
04/02/2021,stocks,Could you elaborate pls? Also I am interested in what kind of organization are you working and why do you find value in using their software.
04/02/2021,stocks,"My issue is that using the outlier as an example when there's hundreds of tech companies that ipo and trade on hype and never recover when they don't ever generate the expected sales.  Use the dot com bubble as an example, it was the same mindset. I'm sure everyone said look at yahoo. Inktomi was a great parallel to exactly this. Traded on hype to 30b about 240$/share on very little sales, then crashed to like .25/share before getting bought. 


I wouldn't say I missed out on gains in tsla thinking that way,  because I just made gains elsewhere. I think everyone is buying companies like pltr more on the fomo than rationale thinking."
04/02/2021,stocks,DPO explains everything except the high P/S. Also ridiculous float is abit troublesum but you gotta pay for primo engineering talent.
04/02/2021,stocks,Low institutional ownership is making me scared. Do you have any idea why has Cathie Wood been buying PLTR?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is my take on it, and I agree with those who project it trading sideways for several years. I think it’ll bounce through the range it’s at ($20-$40) for a long time before they turn the corner. Once that corner is turned though, and they release a wild earnings report, they could very well see a rather sudden spike upwards. I plan on adding a little of this company on dips around the low $20s for the forseeable future and holding for 10 years or trading the bounced and selling at $40 and waiting for the inevitable drop to $20 to re-enter."
04/02/2021,stocks,Ok.  But it’s a meme stock.
04/02/2021,stocks,The company is 18 years old.  They went public 6 months ago.
04/02/2021,stocks,I hope you hit them both.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Patience is key?

I have a different strategy because if I put money into Palantir and it doesnt make me money in several months, I just lost potential gains I could have gotten by putting that money into other stocks.

A better strategy in my opinion is to put money into currently gaining stocks, make money there and watch Palantir. When Palantir looks to get an upwards trend, put money into Palantir.

The way I see it, money in stocks that are not gaining is the same as losing money, because you are losing money you could have gained by simply putting it in an upwards trending stock.

Time goes by constantly. If your money is not gaining and simply sitting there, it's not a good place for them to be at this moment."

04/02/2021,stocks,[removed]
04/02/2021,stocks,It’s not the only factor but it’s currently #26 in ARKK which means they think it will double in 5 years. They have said that’s one of their main criteria’s for investment. Palantir has issued guidance for 4b in revenue in 2025 and I think by conservative standards that would justify an 80b market cap if they deliver.
04/02/2021,stocks,Which means....... Nothing.
04/02/2021,stocks,We’re at tech all time highs. We have a way down to go right now.
04/02/2021,stocks,We have a way up to go too though :)
04/02/2021,stocks,So you would've put money into PLTR while it was in the 30s and rising?  What would you be doing now while it's in the 20s?
04/02/2021,stocks,down 90% on your biggest account? Hardd pass on trading advice. :) Hope you recover and then some.. ! cheers

Thanks"
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's actually quite stupid to label the company as a successful 30b company that deserves the valuation and to act like they can't fail.  In fact valuation to sales and growth wise,   It's EXACTLY what happened to inktomi. They were growing and killing it year over year,  but not turning profit while wall street valued them at almost EXACTLY where they have PLTR valued. Then the stock caught up with them and burned them down to valued less than Sales.  Shareholders went from 200$ to 1$ a share.  The company was not a failure,  in fact they were fine.  The investors were the ones that got burnt. The Company got so cheap yahoo bought them."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Semi-educated guess: Palantir’s software might be most useful for analyzing large quantities of bulk data (system/traffic logs, firewall alerts, user behavior, logon data, etc) and helping cybersecurity analysts to isolate trends/events that warn of a potential threat... or possibly act as forensic evidence for one that has already made its way into the network. For example, on X day there was a sudden surge of Y traffic to port 123. Or user John Doe has suddenly started sending large volumes of encrypted outside of ordinary business hours. For someone overseeing the security of a major enterprise network, Palantir’s could be a lifesaver. 

However, the cyber intel guy above could be working at a smaller scale. He could be using Yara rules or something to track/analyze malware on a small office network. In that case, the Palantir software could be like using a chainsaw to scratch your nose— just total overkill and a capabilities mismatch."

NOBL is also good for outperforming S&P

Smaller Individual targets I recommend:

KT

BGFV

VZ or T (maybe both?)


Full disclosure, I have stakes in all these except VZ and the first three are all position I plan to hold until retirement.

Addendum: yield and risk are incommensurable. If you can appreciate that, you will get smaller results than the aggressive 50%+ returns YoY people magically claim to make, but you can achieve above market results.

For it to keep growing it will need to hold what Walmart dose in the US, in the whole world but all online consumer markets within the next 20-30 years.

Apple and Microsoft are tech giants. It you think they’ll not meet any competition in the next 30 years sure it might be good. But I also doubt that they have that large of a growth margin, compared to their turnover. Even if for example Xbox becomes the biggest consol and kills Sony. It won’t affect the company’s turnover all that much. 

A lot of the hype around these stocks are based the markets trust in them not actual growth prospects. Not that trust can’t increase a stocks value, but just as seen with GME it might not be all that stable.

I'm really psyched about these shifting landscapes we now find ourselves on. Ark invests has great funds but i dislike being in second place companies and ""diversifying"" for the sake of being safe. We're young. Let's take risks and change the world!

If I understood the value of investing (or even knew what it was) and how quickly it could lead to passive income so you can just retire and live on your terms, I probably would've done it way different. 

15-20k invested is gonna get you way more than the 0-5k that most people get to do. I hope I see a post from you in 5 years saying how you turned that 10k (plus the 15-20k you'll be adding to each year) into 2.5 million and are now retired.

2021-04-02 03:37:07,stocks,"Not a bull, not a bear. How I see things right now. *\[This was a response to another commenter that I felt like could generate some good discussion. As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\]*

So - I don't really love the bull case ""Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!"", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.

I'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.

The problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)

But again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.

But everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.

That raises a couple of questions for me:

1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.
2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.

So, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.

Basically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.

If things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.

I'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high)."
04/02/2021,stocks,"My response to this is plain and simple: the nature of inflation means that stocks should increase by a MINIMUM equal to inflation each year. If you're scared, invest in dividend stocks and HODL like all the long-term investors tell you to."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I had to go into manual mode with my US investments and be very specific about the stocks I buy, historically I went with ETFs but don’t in the US right now. My risk-on portion for the most part is outside of the US in ETFs."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Of your time horizon is long enough, there is never a bad time to invest in a diversified index fund."
04/02/2021,stocks,"The market will crash, it always does, sooner or later and you’re a bear even if you don’t think so. You’re basing your strategy on a coming crash or correction, that is bear by definition. 

Anyway, during a crash all stocks devalue pretty much the same across the board, whether it’s PayPal or Coke or Crispr.

So I guess you could handicap yourself by investing in lower return “safe” stocks and hope that you have foreseen a crash in the short term. 

What if the crash is seven years away though? 

Or five? 

Will the lesser gains offset what? 

The same crash? 

The market tends to tank once in about 6-9 years on average. Keep that in mind. 

I’m guessing your young, so volatility is not really a problem for you - just hold until you’re old.

Regarding your P/E ratios what frightens me the most is not the tech and growth multipliers. It’s the manufacturing and traditional value stocks’ multipliers - the DJI is trading well above 30 PE now while Nasdaq is at 37-ish."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Also I disagree with the assessment that we are not as detached from reality as back in dot com. The mistake many people make is they look at Amazon or apples p/es back then and compare now, what you should be doing is looking at small cap companies mainly tech and look at those and the fundamentals or lack thereof will blow you away. Also another thing that we are facing in this bubble is real Estate soaring due to low rates as well as the most overvalued bond market in history that makes me very nervous for the burst because we will be getting hit on all sides."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ah so you are one of those enlightened centrists, eh? Think you're just above it all? :P

Though I mostly agree with your viewpoint, I see myself as a cautious bull. I think if the market does go down soonish then it should recover quickly, if it continues to become more expensive then I'll try to be pullback and be more defensive. But I think the bullrun most likely has a ways to go."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This sub is weird man, why does everyone try to give investing advice? everyone has different risk tolerance. No one really knows what is going to happen."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Charts don’t lie. I don’t know what anything means in terms of higher interest, green bill, etc. I suppose I will understand as I watch price action unfold."
04/02/2021,stocks,"""crash-proof"" stocks don't exist. Some will fall less, but all will fall.

Equity is properly a hedge against inflation, since a falling dollar means more dollars to buy equity.

But the fight against inflation will hit the other component of the market's value: margin debt.  Increased rates will start to unwind that, and if it's not done cautiously enough, it could snowball."
04/02/2021,stocks,what is even the point of this?
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don't follow the logic. You said MSFT at 32 P/E makes sense. You said it wouldn't make sense at 40, 50, 60 P/E. I think everyone would agree with you. But it's not at 60, it's at 32 -- so, what's the problem? There's no reason to expect MSFT to double anytime soon. 

If valuations are stretched, it's quite likely that we'll trade flat (probably with large swings) until earnings catch up."

04/02/2021,stocks,Opinions stink??
04/02/2021,stocks,It's not about inflation it's about the cost of borrowing money becoming higher which makes the companies less valuable.  Higher rates also reduces inflation so it's double edged sword.
04/02/2021,stocks,If you aren’t specifically referring to U.S index funds that isn’t always the case.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I disagree.  1999 was not the best time.  2007 was not the best time.  But yes, time in the market beats timing the market.  The target retirement fund I'm in is a collection of diversified index funds.  I'm just not in 100% index funds."

04/02/2021,stocks,I enjoy sharing my point of view.
04/02/2021,stocks,So what's your recommendation then?  Should I hand over my money to somebody else?  Who? How do I decide who is the best option?
04/02/2021,stocks,Look out lol

MSFT has seen some correction and flat trade, as most tech has, yes.  But the S+P 500 is at an ATH, and is in the middle of an insanely high bull run.  My question is, in general, how long can this keep going?

MSFT may not have been the best example in that sense.  But at the same time I used MSFT because it's a company that most likely *can* justify that sort of valuation.  I'm not sure if every company in the S+P 500 can justify the current levels, and most certainly not the higher they go.  And them going higher, given the Fed's easy money policy and the current trends, it is certainly one possible scenario.

> If valuations are stretched, it's quite likely that we'll trade flat (probably with large swings) until earnings catch up.

Unless we're in a bubble.  Japan's market reached a PE of 60 just before their crash in the late 80s.  This is the concern."

04/02/2021,stocks,Then your time horizon isn't long enough.
04/02/2021,stocks,Bonds are not only their yields they have a price attached to them. The bond market right now is actually the most expensive it's ever been in history not the cheapest.
04/02/2021,stocks,"We are in a bond bubble, because the Fed has been buying billions in bonds, therefore bidding up the price. That's why yields are at historical lows, or at least why the yields have been supressed."

04/02/2021,stocks,"No, you could only buy about half as many assets in 2007 as you could in 2009 given the same amount of funds.  You could effectively double your money with a long-term time horizon by not investing at the top of the bubble."

04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm doing both.  I think a lot of people miss the fact that with higher upside potential from index funds, you also have higher downside potential.

04/02/2021,stocks,"No it isn't. 
Its cognitive dissonance. 
When a person can't use his knowledge of economics and finance to understand what's going on, the only logical response is to reduce one's risk level.
That's putting your economics knowledge to use."
04/02/2021,stocks,"That's a great point.  Let me say that my target retirement fund (index funds) has been DCA'd over the course of a few years.  The individual stocks were a recent thing since I did pretty good this year with less spending due to Covid, stimulus checks, etc. 

I did not feel comfortable putting all that money into index funds all at once this February which is when I decided to invest beyond what I normally do.  However, I have continued to DCA into the target retirement fund.

I see the benefits of both and am applying both at the moment."

This is just the strategy I'm choosing.  I'm not even 100% cash.  I'm 50% ""time in the market"", I'm 50% timing the market (to some extent), because the situation we have right now is uncertain and unprecedented.  I am happy having moderate upside with moderate downside protection.  This is also due to my risk tolerance, which is low.

I would be interested to actually do some research, would there be an optimal strategy in which you set stop losses for ETFs which are low enough to not drop out on normal activity but will prevent crash losses. DCA up, stop loss out if things get heavy, like 10% down.

Normal activity is pretty bad to do that as you get realized gains taxes but not in TFSA."

Could you explain what you disagree about exactly?

No, my economics degree doesn't lend me credibility.  That's why I left a few disclaimers saying to take this all with a grain of salt.  But I did feel like it was worth mentioning because inevitably people would say, as you did, that ""he's only been investing for 2 months"".  My degree is certainly nothing major (no pun intended), but hey, it's something.  If I didn't feel like it gave me any insight I wouldn't have mentioned it.

> I've seen you elsewhere claiming that you wrote this to ""help noobs"" but what's helpful is clarity, transparency, and depth. /My2cents

No.  I encourage you to dig deeper into that exchange.  At the end of the day I wrote this for my own enjoyment.  That was the only end goal.  There was no altruistic motive here.  That said, I do think what I posted was insightful for, say, some 18 year old kid who bought GME last month and has no clue what a stock is.  Those people are around here; I've interacted with a few of them.

But no, this was not meant to be game changing or super insightful or anything.  I just felt like sharing and felt that a disclaimer was a good idea because I'm *aware* that it's not very detailed or anything.  If you'd like to argue with any of my points, I'm all ears."
04/02/2021,stocks,That's a very interesting strategy that I had never heard of.  I hadn't heard of TFSA either.  How do you apply for that / who is eligible?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Thank you!  In this particular comment exchange nobody was too mean.  But some other users were though, lol.

I think it's supremely dumb to rely totally on one's own judgement when investing (or in anything).  ""I like Tesla, Tesla go up"".  Dumb.  But I also think it's supremely dumb to not rely on one's own judgement *at all*.  Only you as an individual know your risk tolerance, goals, particular areas where you might be more knowledgeable, etc.  Hate to bring up Michael Burry because it makes me look like a bear idiot, but he didn't predict the housing market crash by listening to what everybody else said.

There's got to be a middle ground there.

And I'm new to this, yeah.  But you learn by making mistakes.  It fascinates me that people criticize people for... learning?

I appreciate the support, man."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I understand all of this, but you're missing one thing.  If my judgement goes sideways, what do I lose out on?  It's not that I would actually lose any money.  It just means I would lose out on some returns.  Yet at the same time, by opening myself up to higher upside, I'm also opening myself up to lower downside.  So we're talking about potentially losing out on returns, vs. potentially losing real wealth that I already hold.

Given my financial situation and resulting risk tolerance, I'm OK with losing potential upside.  I'm not OK with losing a lot on the downswings."
04/02/2021,stocks,"That sounds good to me.  My idea is pretty much the same but I'm taking a slightly different approach.   About 50% in a target retirement fund (index funds), and another 50% in defensive investments."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I don't know exactly as I was born into it, but as far as I'm aware Canadian Citizens get access as soon as they're of age.

You just walk up to any broker/bank and open one like a normal account.

The rules are:

You can only deposit X amount based on your age and government allowance. It's currently 6K or so a year and roughly similar for every year since you turned 18. (Starting from 2009)
If you were 18+ in 09 you have roughly 75k max.
There's some other convoluted rules about withdrawals and account maximums so asterisk here.

Any gains and dividends are completely tax free,  as long as you aren't day trading with it. When you make a gain OR loss, your TFSA cap increases or decreases to the new value. There's people with 1M+ TFSA cap because of GME for example.

The catch? It's tax deduction free too, so follow Buffet rule #1. Don't lose money.

Not a financial advisor, so take with a grain of salt, but that's the general outline."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Opportunity cost is a real thing. But regardless if you're more comfortable hedging your bets but still stay exposed, that's proper risk management in investing so it sounds like you know what you're doing.

> Personally, I think cash is trash today and in the future, not all my money is in stocks, but they are not in cash either. By not exposing my money to growth, I'll just be devaluing it.
 
I agree.  I'm not in cash!  I'm just in more conservative investments.  Plus 50% in index funds!  I'm just not 100%."
04/02/2021,stocks,You speak in certainties.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Indeed. I'd have to figure out what level of stop loss would prevent day to day movement drops.
At any given moment of any year, the worst drops without a crash and put it higher. I imagine it'd land around ~15% and just adjust it every couple months perhaps.
Having an algo system monitor it too might be an interesting addition. If you do get stopped, re-enter at X piecemeal to try and soft time a bottom in a crash.

Definitely an experiment to backtest a few times."
04/02/2021,stocks,"What's your point?

Facts:
You choose to hold cash. For you it is apparently logical and comfortable.

Here's another:
There is, of course, no method or formula known to effectively ""time"" the market that enhances returns."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah.  Algos would help.  And if you do sell erroneously you can always just buy back in manually... you'd lose a bit there every now and then I reckon but long-run I think it would be negligible.
04/02/2021,stocks,"You're mistaken and haven't read my post.  I'm not holding cash.  I'm holding defensive investments that are not index funds.

This is a well-established method that may protect an investor from a total market correction, albeit while forgoing enhanced returns on upswings.  It's all about risk tolerance.  I'm not trying to beat the market. I'm buffering myself from being crushed by it.  There are ways to do this that don't involve holding cash."
04/02/2021,stocks,"For sure, it's not everyday that a 15% dip happens. It's the whole reason for choosing a drop like that, but it hedges the risk of a 50%+ crash with the risk of error losing 1-2% when buying back in after there's a huge unexpected pullback."

2021-04-02 02:47:51,stocks,"Amazon exploring opening outlets selling home goods, electronics https://fortune.com/2021/04/01/amazon-outlets-discount-home-goods-electronics/

Amazon.com Inc. has explored opening discount retail stores selling a mix of home goods and electronics, a potentially significant expansion of the company’s growing portfolio of brick-and-mortar locations.

The outlets would carry unsold inventory sitting in Amazon’s warehouses at steep discounts, according to two people familiar with the plans. The company has considered opening permanent stores, as well as pop-up locations in malls or parking lots, said the people. The plans were preliminary and under discussion last year, but the pandemic and new Fresh grocery chain forced many employees to focus on day-to-day operations.

This is a very good idea. Unsold inventory occupy the space and will cost company time and money. By opening the discount retail stores, it will be able to sell all the unsold inventory at a fast pace and save more warehouse space for useful inventory. This is also a good reopening strategy trend, which open physical stores to attract more customers to buy amazon products and invite them to become prime member. Many retail stocks are currently near 52 week high, so amazon could this the discount retail stores strategy to compete with them and increase retail market share. Investors will like any idea that amazon could increase revenue and the stock will be more attractive."
04/02/2021,stocks,Maybe Amazon would use the retail space for returned goods. It is too costly to inspect and put items back in inventory so sell them at a mark down from retail and add some better products to the stores so the stores look legit.
04/02/2021,stocks,I don’t think this is a move to make money.  I think it’s a move to mitigate losses on old product and free up warehouse space for the money making items.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Amazon should just buy Rite Aid.  They would get 2,450+ drug stores plus a Prescription Benefits Management business that would fit nicely with the Amazon Pharmacy strategy.  As well, Amazon already uses Rite Aid stores as pick up locations, so they could also be an ideal location from which to sell home goods and electronics.  Today RAD has a market cap barely above a billion and a bit over $3 billion debt, so the whole business could easily be picked off for under $10 billion.  It would be a real steal."
04/02/2021,stocks,So it destroyed retail business to take over retail business......
04/02/2021,stocks,There has been talk of this for a long time now. A year ago I was absolutely convinced we were going to buy Kohls just for this purpose but it looks like management has turned the chain around. Amazon has been looking at failed malls for a while now too. I'm picturing a fulfillment center with a store front.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Do you guys not have anything like Argos in America?

You walk into a smallish shop storefront with some things on display, but behind the cashiers is effectively a warehouse full of stock.

I wonder if Amazon would consider something similar."

They refer to the technology as ""liquid biopsy.""  Because it has the potential to prevent large-scale death, suffering, and expense, the nobility of Grail's mission has been financially supported by Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and others.

In 2020, Illumina announced that it would acquire the separate company that it founded years prior.  For months, nobody seemed to object to that plan.  A few days ago, however, the FTC announced that it will seek to stop the merger.

My question for the group is two-fold:  (1) do you think the FTC will succeed in preventing the Illumina/Grail merger, and (2) if so, how/when do you see Grail going public?

As somebody who lost a brother to cancer, I would love to invest in advancements that can help people avoid this deadly disease.  Therefore, I am wondering when you might think Grail will be an available investment option in this space?

Thanks for the input."
04/02/2021,stocks,"From what I understand, it would be very difficult for the FTC to block the acquisition since they are two non competing entities-its considered a vertical merger and one hasn’t ever been successfully blocked [before](https://www.pbwt.com/antitrust-update-blog/the-last-time-doj-sued-to-block-a-vertical-merger-was-over-forty-years-ago-and-it-lost).

It would probably be a couple of years before Grail goes public if Illumina ends up not being able to go through with the acquisition.

There are other public companies that do liquid biopsy and are a similar technology to Grail if you were interested in investing with those."
04/02/2021,stocks,"That is very helpful information!  Thank you for sharing.

2021-04-02 00:32:28,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 1, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 1, 2021**

Stocks rose today, extending gains in another record-setting session. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed above $400 for the first time ever, starting the new quarter with a bang after President Biden announced a new $2 trillion infrastructure proposal.

Today marks the first session of Quarter 2, hopefully putting to rest the volatility that dominated the market last quarter. Historically, the month of April has been good for equity markets, with the SPY gaining an average of 1.51% since 1980.

Heading into Q2, we expect cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks, whose performance is strongly tethered to the health of the broader economy, to continue driving the market higher. The last quarter saw the rotation out of tech and growth stocks as the US economy continues to gradually reopen due to the increased pace in vaccinations. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco agrees, saying “ I think we’re going to see more of the same in terms of market leadership. This is an environment in which the economy is likely to accelerate. And I think that means that we’ll see continued outperformance of areas like energy, like financials, like consumer discretionary, material, industrials — those areas of the stock market that are most sensitive to the economy.”

On Wednesday, President Biden introduced a new proposal called American Jobs Plan. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan includes spending to repair aging roads and bridges, jump-start transit projects, and rebuild school buildings and hospitals. It would also expand electric vehicles, replace all lead pipes and overhaul the nation’s water systems. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

&#x200B;

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities were higher in Thursday trading, finishing near best levels. Major indices all posted gains in the holiday-shortened week as S&P 500 and Dow finished at record closes. Energy led the market on stronger crude. Tech, communication services beat the tape (FANMAG complex broadly higher). Consumer staples, healthcare, utilities the only sectors lower. Treasuries mostly firmer with some notable strength at the long end of the curve. Dollar weaker on the major crosses. Gold finished up 0.7%. WTI crude settled up 3.9% despite OPEC and its allies agreeing increase output by \~2M bpd through July.
   * **Infrastructure continued to dominate the headlines with a lot of moving pieces** after White House detailed plans to spend $2.25T+ over next eight years. Fiscal stimulus still a key piece of the bullish narrative for stocks though plans for another big spending also fit with pickup in concerns about inflation/economic overheating. Higher taxes another potential headwind for risk sentiment. Also some focus on how difficult it will be to get infrastructure stimulus passed given the lack of Republican support, competing preferences among Democrats and their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate.
   * Busy on the data front ahead of nonfarm payrolls tomorrow. **ISM manufacturing gauge surged in March** with new orders strong, though growing backlogs and supplier delivery times reinforcing broader themes of supply chain pressures and rising input costs. Press has been picking up this theme, noting some consumer-products firms raising prices. Elsewhere, weekly **US initial jobless claims missed**, seeing a larger-than-expected uptick. On the global front, **US-China tensions** another area of focus with more concerns about Chinese incursions into Taiwan.
   * **TSM** to spend $100B on capex over next three years. **MU** beat and guided above with focus on favorable DRAM dynamics. Company and **WDC** both exploring an acquisition of Japan's Kioxia for approx. $30B. **KMX** comp sales weaker than expected, though March sales commentary upbeat. **F** announced more shutdowns due to semi shortages. **QS** up big after meeting technical milestone for additional $100M investment from Volkswagen. **CCK** in talks to sell its cans unit for more than $2B. **ANGI** acquired additional 20% interest in its MyBuilder business. **WING** comps better. **EBS** lab errors resulted in 15M ruined **JNJ** vaccine doses (but not expected to impact US supply targets). **PLAY** beat and guidance ahead on better reopening pace but stock already a big ytd gainer. **GES** EPS well ahead of consensus and guidance better with digital a bright spot.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Most sectors higher with growth ahead of value:**
      * Growth generally led cyclical/value on first day of Q2. **Energy** the standout, following WTI higher with E&Ps particularly strong. **Tech** a big gainer with help from semis and software (MSFT also had a good day). Internets and entertainment the leaders in **communication services**. **Financials** ahead on upside across credit cards and insurance, while banks mostly brushed off Treasury yields move lower down today. **Consumer discretionary** trailed with some weakness among retailers offsetting support from AMZN and homebuilders. **Materials** saw some drag from industrial metals, with steel the weak spot. **Industrials** a bit of an underperformer with select machinery and multis down. **Healthcare** mixed with some weakness in managed care, distributors, and large-cap pharma (JNJ). **Consumer staples** worst performer with HPCs, tobacco, and grocers some of the weights.
   * **ISM Manufacturing highest in over 37 years, initial jobless claims and continuing claims miss:**
      * **March ISM Manufacturing** PMI up 3.9 points m/m to 64.7, ahead of 61.5 estimate, for highest print since Dec-1983. New Orders, production indexes highest since Jan-04, employment index highest since Feb-18. Supplier deliveries continued to slow, up to highest reading since Apr-1974. Prices also elevated, holding near highest since Jul-08. **Initial jobless claims** of 719K were up 61K w/w, and missed consensus estimates for 690K. However, prior week revised down 26K to 658K from 684K, which was lowest since the pandemic surge in claims began in Mar-20. **Continuing claims** fell to 3.794M from 3.870M, though also missed estimates for 3.775M. While this week's claims will not flow through to tomorrow's March jobs report (2-Apr, 8:30 ET), labor market data in focus given reopening and vaccine-driven economic momentum. **March nonfarm payrolls** expected to increase by 285K m/m to 614K, which would be the highest since Oct-20.
   * **OPEC+ agrees to gradual output increases of 1M bpd over the coming months:**
      * [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/opec-agrees-to-gradually-increase-oil-output-in-coming-months?srnd=premium&sref=J9GPLx1B) reported that OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually boost oil output from May to July. The group will add more than 1M bpd over the coming months, incluidng a 350K bpd increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia in May, and an additional 450K bpd in July. Saudi Arabia may also roll back some of its voluntary 1M bpd cuts. While market had expected group to roll over existing limits, article cited analysts who say product demand is expected rise by 3M bpd over the next three months, so increase isn't bearish. Comes against a lot of recent talk of caution from the group, with OPEC Secretary General Barkindo yesterday saying the oil market faces many uncertainties, particularly regarding a Covid upsurge in Europe and elsewhere ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/opec-focuses-on-fragile-demand-before-talks-on-keeping-oil-cuts?sref=J9GPLx1B)), while OPEC+ technical committee this week cut 2021 global demand forecast by 300K bpd.

04/02/2021,stocks,Nice work man.   Feel like they should give you a analyst job at CNBC lol.
04/02/2021,stocks,Great recap! I'm going to follow you for future ones
2021-04-02 00:17:04,stocks,"CRSP vs EDIT vs BEAM -- which would you choose for a 5-year high risk investment? Would really appreciate any ideas you have about these 3 companies. 

That's

- Crispr Therapeutics 
- Editas Medicine 
- Beam Therapeutics 

I currently have 3% of my account in CRSP. Bummed today when it went down while EDIT and BEAM soared. 

I realize that ETFs might be great but they don't offer the type of high risk / high reward play I'm going for. I just want to try to find the next Amazon -- something that has a ~10% chance at being 100 billion in 5 years."
04/02/2021,stocks,DTIL
04/02/2021,stocks,One of these DD’s said BEAM could replace antibiotics. Kinda felt like I missed the boat with CRSPR so I bought BEAM instead. Good day.
04/02/2021,stocks,"What about Precision Biosciences?

They have their own platform and work in the food/produce field as well."
04/02/2021,stocks,"There’s an active dispute on who owns crispr NTLA, Edit and Crsp are battling for ownership.  I own all three"
04/02/2021,stocks,Is it too late on BEAM? It's already up over 300% in the last year.
04/02/2021,stocks,"You can hold 1/3 as much of each just as easily, or a biotechnology fund."
04/02/2021,stocks,Are there any other genomic ETFs besides ARKG?
04/02/2021,stocks,dtil
04/02/2021,stocks,CRSP
04/02/2021,stocks,"> BEAM seems to possibly have the best technology.

I took a quick look and it looks like Beam's base editing is based on CAR-T.  If that's true, then Beam is gonna blow any CRISPR-CasX method out of the water.  I've been waiting for a gene therapy developer to go into CAR-T and not just have it on the product roadmap.

I was gonna take a break from gene therapies but now might be time to load up on calls."
04/02/2021,stocks,Then why are you investing in an ETF specially for genomics?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Even though I know about the technology (work as a biomedical scientist) I still choose ARKG over any individual stocks. Sure, CRSP might seem promising (a bit overhyped but still promising) but once their technology becomes viable, the large biotech/pharma companies will swoop in and make more money off of it. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are effectively the same. Moderna specializes in mRNA (like CRSP with crispr) but I bet Pfizer sells more vaccines in the end. Luckily, and ETF like ARKG gives exposure to larger and smaller biotech companies. Not to mention all the other companies in the “background” of biomedical R&D - I, and all of my fellow researchers, buy pretty much all of our research supplies from Thermo Fisher, for instance."
04/02/2021,stocks,Same!
04/02/2021,stocks,"It depends.
I’m in beam and prepared for short term pain. You could see as much as a 50% pullback in the next 6 months. Or more.
But if you believe in their tech and their therapeutics then it really doesn’t matter, it’ll pay off when they go stage 3 or full approval."
04/02/2021,stocks,But it's French.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not sure I think he would share a lot of my perspective. I think CRSP and beam should be at the top of peoples lists because CRSP is the “safer” bet, while BEAM has the potentially higher payoff. Of course they’re all risky. You could do arkg but I’m personally way more interested in gene editing than a lot of the stuff in there."

2021-04-01 23:37:15,stocks,"Compounding trades OK, So I have been trading/Investing for a little over a year, and I have figured out what kind of retail investor I am. No options, CFD'S and margins for me. I am on Trading 212, and the prices they give on CFD's are horrendous. I also figured out I like owning the stock, and I am much more comfortable swing and trend trading along with a healthy Long term investment portfolio.

So, to the point. While I am building my long term portfolio, I like the idea of additionally buying and selling stocks over a few days/week, and don't like paying interest on CFD's overnight. With that in mind, I want to see if it is possible to gain 1% profit per day. The idea is to trade 3-5 stocks on alternating days compounding the gains.

1. Commission free trades
2. 1% seems doable
3. hold a floating reserve in order to sell and reinvest in the same or other stock on the same day without getting into difficulties with the brokers
4. Compound it.
5. Yes the market will sometimes go down, but there are always stocks in a downturn that go up, unless we have a 1929, 1986 etc, but even if there is a hiatus, then sit back and wait until it turns.
6. once the compounding really affects the balance then I can see the potential necessity to switch brokers/platforms as the daily trading amount is getting quite high - year 3 theoretically 700k.
7. Even if the market turns, you lose value but not the asset, as opposed to cfd's.

Have I missed anything? It seems that I am overlooking something. At the moment I am starting Month 2, but I only started with $300, so the sums are small, but I am currently ahead.

EDIT: currently I have a 23% proven return in 22 trading days. I am not including taxes etc in my calculations for this experiment."

As for the long therm part, I read that. I just wonder if you should want to swing trade on the side. In order for that to work you need to consistently pick winners out of volitile stock. Which is very time consuming on top of just impossible, there are going to be bad trades as well. I'm not saying it's stupid what you want to do, it's just probably not worth it.

2021-04-01 23:23:39,stocks,"ATT vs Verizon vs T mobile I have owned ATT for some time and although I am very happy with the dividend, I realize that the company seems to be in a tough spot. Compared to Verizon, it seems that ATT is almost stagnant as a company and is having a hard time investing in future growth. It also did not raise it's dividend recently and I feel as if they face risk of having to cut the dividend In the future if they don't start becoming more profitable. 

Verizon seems to be in a better overall position especially when it comes to 5G exposure and quality. They pay less of a dividend though, which I am okay with because that frees capital for investments in their business. and while I do like the slight exposure to HBO max through ATT, I feel as if it is a small niche and the overall company isn't going to benefit greatly even if it grows well. I also own disney, so I do have other streaming services in my portfolio.

T mobile seems to be the aggressive approach as the share price seems to reflect them doing well already, which worries me. I know they are in the 5G game, but my big gripe with them is the lack of a dividend. I don't think the share valuation with no dividend justifies the valuation, so I almost just included it to see if there's something I'm not really seeing. It probably has better growth prospects than Verizon or ATT, but if I'm cutting ATTs sweet dividends, I think Verizon will be my pick. 

I'm wondering if anybody here holds shares in any of these companies and can shine some light on why they chose them. I'm obviously leaning towards cutting my entire ATT position and entering into Verizon. T mobile seems to be a bit aggressive and expensive, especially since I'd be losing dividend payments if I were to transition to that stock. Any insight is appreciated."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Owning T for a long time, attracted by its dividend like you guys. I am going to sell the rest of my T after the dividend day (around 4/10, I guess based on the last year). But T is dividend trap, as SP500 has about 8% annual index increase since 2003, comparing T almost no price appreciation. 6% dividend for T is simply not enough. Buying DirectTV is a mistake as everyone is going to do streaming. T’s landline is losing value as individual and business are moving away with landline.  T is more or less like a bond, holding T in short term is fine when not seeing a good stock to buy. I prefer TMobile as its international plan is better than T.  If home internet would be going wireless with 5G, TMobile would gain home internet biz from T and Comcast. I think VZ is better than T as well(never used VZ)."
04/02/2021,stocks,Yes definately T-Mobile for growth.  They are killing both Verizon and att.   Took so many costumers from then with the aggressive pricing.

Everyone has different needs, I can buy a dividend paying utility with very low volatility and low risk and while that may not outperform the market - it suits someone’s needs. 

It isn’t a game, it’s wealth management and the accumulation of wealth - beating the market is not a metric anyone should care about. 

You should have your plan, your needs defined, your timeline, and know what your goal is and what you can risk. This has nothing to do with beating the market."

You have $100 to invest. First you put it into the 401. It’s untaxed so all of it goes in. The first year you make 10%. That’s $110. The next year you make 10%, that’s $121. The third year is 133. Then you retire and pull it out. But you owe 20% tax so you end up with $117.

Or you put it into a Roth but you pay 20% taxes up front. That’s $80. The first year earns $8... $88. The second year you have $97 and the third you have $107. You retire and have $107 tax free.

In this case, and just maybe yours, the first case is better. Sorry if the math is off I’m not in a place where I can check it. And I have performance anxiety when teachers are involved.

TSM is one of the best 3-year plays out there right now.  To me, in my valuation of it, it's not a tech stock, it's not a growth stock, it's not a value stock - it's its own thing.  It's a company doing a really good job making alot of stuff that virtually no one else can or will make well.

I recently was well overallocated to and got hit hard in a recent downturn that was much sharper than I imagined. It was painful. Sold low, then the holding popped up hugely the next few days. So then I bought back higher, at half my original allocation, only to see it bleed down once again. On the sale, I made a 20% cap gain, and I'm happy to have an allocation I am comfortable with now. But it was an interesting experience and some valuable lessons learned: 

1. set limits on allocation

2. don't get (too) greedy

3. don't listen to redditors deriding you for your decision. and certainly don't let them influence any decision going forward. In the end, you may be right, they may be wrong. they don't know you or your portfolio. better yet, don't post your investment decisions on reddit in the heat of the moment!

4. have conviction in your decision. know the current (negative) environment and why you made your decision. base it on hard numbers. selling in a downturn isn't bad in and of itself. set conditions at which you would reconsider buying back in the future. if you don't have conviction, then do nothing.

5. remember why you entered into the position in the first place. has anything fundamentally changed?

6. it's just paper money until you sell.

7. FOMO is a b#%ch. don't let it control you. if the holding pops back up you really really need #4. plus downturns are sawtoothed, not straight down. if the negative environment hasn't changed, snap backs are common, before a further downturn takes place."

* Letting emotion rule your trades is another lesson. The psychological impact of investing and trading, the emotions involved, are ultimately what drives volatility and the market. I have noticed recently a lot of people saying things like ""X was already priced in"" but emotions are usually not priced in to how stock price reacts.

04/02/2021,stocks,I made a video around this and I think it goes over similar points. Let me know what you guys think :) [Five investing principles based on mistakes in the market](https://youtu.be/RReSQzs6J_0)
04/02/2021,stocks,"Buying too many overvalued tech stocks.
Managed to leave chewy this week after few red weeks at 89, bought at 86.
Still have many others to go lol"
04/02/2021,stocks,"I didn't realize I could sell on the way up. I legit held 10 shares of let's say a VERY risky company. I sold none after being up 50% in a day. The next day I sold all 10 being down 50%.

Had I just sold most of my shares on the way up I would have had a free 2 or 3 shares... AND negated the potential damage. Oh well you live and you learn!"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Biggest mistake was listening to analysts about TSLA in 2014. I truly believed in the company and everyone was saying how they were destined to fail. Because analysts are “experts”, I listened.  

Similar story with FB, my friend who’s been investing for years compared it to MySpace and how they’re going to disappear in a few years. 

On the contrary, I held BABA from 2014 till about November of last year. Had many people tell me not to invest in Chinese companies, but for some reason this was the stock I followed through with. 

In short, I should’ve trusted my own guts. I currently hold TSLA since March last year and adding to my position."
04/02/2021,stocks,It took me awhile to learn that everyone is loud in announcing their wins but rarely do you hear about their losses. Once I figured out that no one has a crystal ball I stopped listening to others “next Tesla” and bought stocks/ETFs that I had full conviction in myself
04/02/2021,stocks,Hylion and GME 20k total that I could have gained. Don't be greedy.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Buying calls, and that i should buy calls at the right time"
04/02/2021,stocks,Lost a few thousand on some calls that were up at close - slept like a baby then wept like a baby. Stick to a solid gain - don’t get too greedy.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Options lol, even the safest ones can fail"
04/02/2021,stocks,Options and not taking profits
04/02/2021,stocks,"I lost 10k dollars on a trade with a stock I barely knew just because of fomo.
Fortunately I managed to recover and now my portfolio is all green but I will never forget that lesson."
04/02/2021,stocks,CFD on options 🤦‍♀️
04/02/2021,stocks,Put a lot of money on Nokia while working there when Elop became CEO and held forever but never averaged down even with the dividends. Learned that holding for emotional reasons is the stupidest thing. Should have exited or averaged down systematically over years. Will never get emotional over losses again. Plus Elops a cunt!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Spent a while chasing massive pumps and meme stocks without having a swift exit planned and got burned bad. When something has spiked or run for several days, best be safe than sorry and just stay away. Seriously always check the price action for the past week or month to gauge the upside potential. Even something that’s fused gradually risen only a bit per day over several days can be risky to hop in on (happened to me with Genius Brds. last week. Guess things don’t need to spike to be badly timed). Have discipline and only a plunge when it looks safe. You’ll have more money avoiding bagholding many times than constantly getting burned and lucking out that 1 time.

Also don’t buy stocks seriously just because. Always know why you’re buying it. This way you can better decide to bail if things get dicey to be more confident in holding."
04/02/2021,stocks,Don’t catch a Falling Knife... jump into a Value Trap by just looking at the numbers.
04/02/2021,stocks,Passing on $Game $Stop @ $6.
04/02/2021,stocks,My mistake was investing using fiat currency. Never again.
04/02/2021,stocks,Day trading with weeklies. HUGE NO-NO.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Going against my idea of wanting companies I could hold long term, despite the the possible short term downside. 

Gme is when my portfolio went to crap, although I had awesome returns. It wasn’t something I believed in long term, even though the short term thesis was good. And chasing that led to throwing away most of my gains and taking on even more risk.

Now I’ve just tried to learn from that, and getting back to my more usual routine and way of going about things. My rule for going on short term plays is usually keeping it small, and staying out like not buying more when everyone is talking about it. Both of which I broke and makes for a good lesson. 

And while I’m generally opposed to broad market index’s as I’m okay with the risk and attempts to be forward looking, despite wanting to be aggressive, I do think some preservation of wealth is important. The mitigation of risk is what separates it from a gamble like roulette, to something more akin to poker and while I did account for downsides within my holdings, I didn’t account for it being all at once. So I’m going to increase my broad market exposure a bit while remaining within my other rules. 

I’m sure there will be dozens of more lessons over time. I’m all about being adaptive and wanting to learn from my mistakes. There won’t be money to be made otherwise. Everyone stumbles, it’s how you pick yourself up that matters most."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I have traded too much in the past. I just really enjoy the act of selling and buying. Even when my portfolio was doing well, I wanted to buy more. When it slid, I wanted to sell and move to something else. It pays to be patient."
04/02/2021,stocks,Never leverage your life savings on gourd futures
04/02/2021,stocks,"I think #3 is the most important lesson

Catch 22"
04/02/2021,stocks,"My mistake recently was looking at stocks from a technical perspective. You do this because that what institutions do. So many boomers tend to make sure they are aligned with institutions. I’m sure profits will always be made using this strategy. 


But this can miss HUGE opportunities. With massive volumes from retail company in I have learned how to make quick bucks. I shifted my thinking. You are now infesting in a stock because you think the retail investors may “like the stock”."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Really like the first hour rule, I learned that recently. 7:30 PST  is time to evaluate. I also added a dont make week long decisions based on Monday. I try to not buy on Mondays"
04/02/2021,stocks,do you have any advice for hedging? Your last point would have saved me a lot of money these past few weeks
04/02/2021,stocks,"> If you trade expecting a perma-bullish market you're losing roughly 50% of the total gains you can make. If you have short positions a red market is your friend and if you hedge well your portfolio you'll reap benefits whichever direction the market goes.

More money has been lost anticipating a market crash/downturn than has been made. Not saying hedging is necessarily bad nor am I a permabull but but it's something to consider."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I've realized stocks dont typically move more than 5% in one direction. I see a stock I want dropping and I would jump on it just to watch it fall more and take 2 weeks to recover. I now wait a minimum of 1 hour before pulling the trigger, so what if I miss out on a 1% discount, better than losing a other 3%."
04/02/2021,stocks,Any gain is a good trade. Don’t stray away from your process(if it’s working or you have the leverage to do it) over what could’ve been.
04/02/2021,stocks,"This is why I never invest in a stock before closely monitoring it for a couple of weeks. If my decision to invest changes because of one or two weeks' movement, it probably wasn't a good idea to invest anyway.

This has cost me some potential profits when waiting on good stocks but I'm certain it's kept me from jumping on bad stocks many times as well."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Great advice.  Also, anyone not 100% index funds should be benchmarking themselves to that."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This. I never bothered splurging on Oil companies cause by the time everyone was saying oil and value and other crud was the move, everything was already gassed up and there was no room for upside.

Instead I opted to diversify by finding things I was lacking in that was actually at a discount like Target for retail and I am actually seeing gains now. 

I had the unfortunate timing of getting my big start right before the correction so I am definitely going to look to DCA carefully and try to find things with visible. Now things like XOM have actually dipped a bit and might consider adding now."
04/02/2021,stocks,I feel this one. Took me waaaaaaay too long to use stop loss orders for profit.
04/02/2021,stocks,I’m down 20ish% on S uNny D l. In was a FOMO idiot and bought at the peak. I’ve averaged down 4 times to 1.27 and it’s still keeps dropping lower and lower. 1.12 now. I feel like almost giving up or going one huge ass average down and trying to get out at a penny up.
04/02/2021,stocks,Some stocks you get into have safe floors. I bought stocks last week that haven't been that price for 5 months. So now I rebalanced my portfolio and am holding stocks that theoretically shouldnt drop much below my buy point. Now this is the boring part because all I can do is add new money or trim profits to reinvest
04/02/2021,stocks,RIP BABA
04/02/2021,stocks,Idk I’ve done pretty well with VWO which is pretty heavily China weighted. I think investing in China and most emerging markets is a patience game
04/02/2021,stocks,"Honestly, biggest thing new investors can do is look at the wiki page for the stock they want to buy. Obviously you need to know financials but at least start by understanding what it is they exactly do and who they do it with."

04/02/2021,stocks,Any tech stocks / options. Their time was 2020. Just leave them da f alone!
04/02/2021,stocks,Coursera has been on the market for like 8 years and no profit? Do you think one day they will just make money? If they couldn't make money for 8 years they won't make money unless they charge double which won't happen.
04/02/2021,stocks,Hah. Elop ruined Nokia. Like everything Microsoft does -- it ruins things.
04/02/2021,stocks,Best book i ever read. The analysis is spot on.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Several ways but you'll need to study a bit. One can be to buy a put option when you open your stock position, the downside is that it is preferable to have stocks in multiple of 100 which might be a pretty high entrance barrier, buying power wise.

The other consists in buying put and call options in a 1:4 (or 1:3) ratio (reverse if you're bearish), that way the initial cost is not so much and you get to be covered (or make a small profit) if your prediction was wrong. downside is that you have to study the greeks, and you better know what to do or with options you'll lose money without a collateral to show for it. I usually apply a variant to this which is to buy the first leg (call if bullish, put if bearish) and buy the other leg (the hedge) when the ticker is going the direction I want so it is a little less costly, this also has downsides meaning that if you're wrong you're not hedged at all and you might need to close your position earlier or pay more for your hedge due to the risk of not being hedged.

Or (very hard to pull off), you can buy VXX calls/stocks (never ever ever UVXY, I don't think it's even possible to make money with UVXY). VXX tends to rise when the market goes to shit so if your position is collapsing due to the market on the whole going down you'll have some compensation on your VXX position. The downside is that if your position is not going down due to market instability but rather from your own prediction being wrong you now have two positions that are losing money.

Usually gold is the commodity people goes towards in periods of high volatility or bearish market, imo unless you're holding long and the market has a long red period you'll hardly make a profit but you do you, I trade shorter cycles."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Hedging does not mean that your short and long positions are exactly equal nor that you need to expect a downturn or the bubble popping every week, it means limiting your exposition to risk in a way that does not hurt too much your gains. (or even grab a small gain, if you manage)

Of course if we are talking about any major ticker protecting yourself from said ticker collapsing 20% does not make any sense, but if your sole source of gains is the ticker going up for the totality of your portfolio and your exposition to the risk of any product of your portfolio going the wrong way is 100% you either have a very limited exposure on each of them, so that one of your trades going the wrong way means risking the 1% of your capital, or you come from WSB where the idea of safe bet is 40% of the portfolio on QQQ with zero hedge, and that means we have a very different idea of limiting risk."
04/02/2021,stocks,I feel you brother. I’m makes you feel you got stuck doesn’t it
04/02/2021,stocks,"Right, because Tesla made its first profit in 18 years just last year.

Crowdstrike has been around since 2011 and I don’t believe has turned a profit.

ABNB has been around since 2008 - no profit

DropBox - hasn’t made a profit

Others:
Lyft
Wayfair
Uber

04/02/2021,stocks,If you missed 10 best gain days you'd highly likely miss the worst days too. Either way it's better to just not miss anything if you're in it for the long run.
04/02/2021,stocks,VIX calls are not hard to pull off in this market IMO.
04/02/2021,stocks,Yeah. Stuck making money
04/02/2021,stocks,"Big market cap doesn't mean the company is worth investing. Would you buy a bakery that didn't turn profit for 10 years?

I guess you'll learn when u get burned on next correction."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Oh I know that dude. I was helping my dad with his finances the other day and we found the forgotten ebay account my dad gave my older brother with $1k back when the internet was young. He hadn't made a trade since 2003 when he just put the $6k he had into DIA, ONEQ, SPY and (unfortunately) EFA and forgot about it. The $4.5k that went into DIA SPY and ONEQ is now $24k 18 years later. He didn't have DRIP so 3k of it is in cash. 

That's not an awful day. He said I can keep the indexes, sell the EFA, add it to the cash, and make stupid silly options bets I believe in with what we now designate ""the high risk slush fund"""
04/02/2021,stocks,"If you are waiting for a sure downturn, like last week, sure. Not that hard.

If you're in a bull market and you're trying to hedge a position using VXX, chances are you're blowing it imo. You need to keep averaging down while the market is still bullish, and hope that when your position goes the wrong way it's because of a red market or you are virtually doubling your losses."
04/02/2021,stocks,This has been a hard mindset for me to adopt. Some of my strongest conviction picks have dropped 40% despite nothing materially changing in the company.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I didn’t say anything about market cap. I didn’t bring up market cap once in my post above. Stop with the straw-men

You brought up profit, and I listed all the companies who either haven’t turned a profit yet, or took years to turn a profit. In 2020 Coursera had $293.5 million in revenue, and a net loss of 66.8 million.

Between 2003-2009, TSLA had 108 million in revenue and 236 million in deficit. $82 million net loss in 2008 and they didn’t turn a profit until last year. In comparison Coursera has a head start!

 “I guess you’ll get burned on the next correction” 
Will it go down at times? Yea
Will it go up at times? Yea

Corrections happen, I’ve seen them. Hell, I saw the dotcom and the Great Recession. As far as I can tell, it’s an investment and providing trainings in 25% of Fortune 500 companies, over 100 government agencies, the company has growth in a sector worth hundreds of billions. COVID hit education hard, so the fact Coursera held its own is actually impressive. Corrections happen, I’m not quite sure what you mean by that...

Does this mean I don’t see risks? Sure. EdX, stigma of online school, legislation against for-profit colleges. 

Some companies go up. Some go down. I have a little more money on this than I intended, but its not even close to the majority of my portfolio. I’m trying to figure out if you’re actually someone who knows anything about what you’re talking about, or just a troll..."
04/02/2021,stocks,"> and we found the forgotten ebay account

I know you meant E-Trade but I find the idea of an ebay account being a place to put your wealth to be very amusing"

04/02/2021,stocks,"That's the funny thing. Stocks that are already cheap can become cheaper. Sometimes this even increases my conviction, simply because it's further proof of mispricing by the market.

I remember when tesla dropped below 200$ pre split in 2019. With all they had going on at the time the pricing was insane IMO. Immidiatly bought a few shares. Still regret not buying a few calls."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Loved IPOs myself. Recently learned about the importance of considering lock up expiry into my buying decisions. IPOs could be great opportunities (exit strategy) for employees/investment banks to offload their shares to retail. There’s more parts of the equation (direct listing vs traditional, price at IPO vs at lock up, etc) for a fully informed decision. Only learned about all this after getting burned/holding some bags. Encourage you to read up on this as well! Here’s where I got started: [Why you need to know IPO lock up period expirations ](https://youtu.be/lqgSJhI-nwU)"

Of all the ""That's what they said about Tesla"" comparisons I've read, this is probably the worst."
04/02/2021,stocks,Cool except I own none of those. It’s Appian and Crowdstrike.
04/02/2021,stocks,"I’m not saying this is Tesla. It’s just the most well-known example, and I was just refuting the above comment about short-term profitability in growth companies is not so cut and dry. My last sentence is meant to be more tongue-in-cheek.

I’m not expecting this to be Tesla, but if cherry-picking and trolling without additional information or support is how you get off then who am I to tell you not to? 

Then again, trolling is what trolls do best."
04/02/2021,stocks,both 3x - 4xed this year. overvalued. may be a solid company but you bought in at the wrong time.
2021-04-01 22:15:59,stocks,"ELI5 wash sales affecting cost basis For all intents and purposes should I use the number TDA gives me as my cost/share that has the wash sales rule factored in, or should I use my actual cost/share that when I calculate it using just the hard numbers? How does it play a factor in taxes?

I Googled around but I just cant wrap my head around it. If I took a 1k loss in trading stock ABC but buy it again within the time limit, I understand my brokerage raises the cost basis to reflect the wash, but if I end up making money from stock ABC, why does the wash sale still affect the price/share, since I am no longer able to use it to write off my taxes since I no longer took a loss?"
2021-04-01 21:51:43,stocks,Tlry/apha opinions with merger on the horizon Anyone have opinions on if tlry will have a push before the merger? I’m thinking it does but haven’t seen any movement yet. Would like some more experienced assessments as I’m still new to this. Thanks in advance.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Hi, sorry according to Reddit America is a third world country. So your portfolio is worthless, sorry."
04/02/2021,stocks,That's because poor people aren't doing so hot. Rich people have money to spend on stocks while poor people can't afford to eat. This pushes the market to all time highs while inflation struggles to even make 2%.

04/02/2021,stocks,"And it isn't just created and thrown out the door. The FED trades every dollar for an IOU that has to be paid back or an asset that can be sold, and be only does those when the liquidity is needed to prevent deflation. That's enough demand pressure to counter the inflationary effect. If inflation does recur anyway, they sell assets and soak up dollars.

It's like the controls on any machine. If you just crank them up without regard to any need, and don't pay attention to feedback about what they're causing, you'll blow something up. But if you operate them to keep the machine within it's safe and efficient operating range, you can maximize the value it produces."
04/02/2021,stocks,It doesn’t matter until it does
04/02/2021,stocks,"People are discounting stock splits and the naivety of this tsunami of new (2020+) retail traders in the markets.  Take Tesla or Apple’s 2020 stock splits for instance.  Both saw major stock price increases after the splits because retail traders don’t understand market cap divided by outstanding shares = stock price.  They just see the stock’s price.  I had multiple friends post on Instagram the day Tesla split with screenshots saying “damn that’s crazy” because they thought it fell 80% in a day.  That’s the kind of money that’s in the markets right now.  With fractional shares available on most brokerages, stock splits are just a way to get retail traders to buy 1 (post split) share of Tesla or Apple who wouldn’t have bought pre-split, and that’s a worrying scenario as the underlying investment cost remains the same but the “growth narrative” somehow changes.  I’m interested in your thoughts on this.  Cheers."
04/02/2021,stocks,No it'll close at 405.21 Monday and continue that the whole year
04/02/2021,stocks,It started going up when he took office. It hasn't only gone up (were you in a coma last year?) but it's up since then.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Nope, this makes sense that higher taxes on business class and higher min wage, + things like free college would all add big to the market. Obama and Biden policies do probably correlate with our bull run since the 2008 crash."

04/02/2021,stocks,"It's common to include international funds in portfolios to provide stability, not for gains in equity. Investing in the global bond market is not chasing gains, but rather lower volatility."

04/02/2021,stocks,VTI and VOO are two of my largest holdings. Great stuff

04/02/2021,stocks,"I know, just wondering if one is significantly better than the other or if it doesn’t matter that much."
04/02/2021,stocks,This is likely IMO. All time highs with so much of the nasdaq way off its highs is bullish AF.

04/02/2021,stocks,"That and wealth inequality was already a problem after 2008.  I think so thing like 37% of equities are owned by 0.01% then the next 1% own 50% total.  Then the FED came in and printed trillion that directly went to equities. 

That and technology is a natural deflationary force that should be bringing prices down.  But the Fed sets a 2% inflation target so all the gains of technology flow to equities holders aka the 1%."
04/02/2021,stocks,Just gotta say something about how prices are too high every single day until it finally happens.  The key is to never miss a day.

04/02/2021,stocks,"21% of VTI is in Google, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Berkshire, JP Morgan, and Facebook.

If you want to cover lower market cap companies, get VB. Their top 10 holdings makeup 4% of their portfolio, none of which are in the SP500, and its expense ratio is only .05%.

I go 70% in VOO, and 30% in VB and call it a day lol. VTI is good, but it really doesn't diversify much with VOO."
04/02/2021,stocks,"voo slightly outperformed vti since 2008. but both nearly identical. vti is after all, like 80% voo anyways"
04/02/2021,stocks,"That's because the only time we TELL someone to go into a stock is because they're like ""hey guyz I don't know what EPS stands for what stocks should I invest in??"" The answer is VTI/VOO.

But literally nobody is going around crusading that everyone should liquidate their stocks to dump it in VOO."
04/02/2021,stocks,Well the best strategy isn't to just VOO. It's to spread out across multiple indexes to gain as much exposures to the factors as possible. VOO is not that diverse actually. Only 500 companies out of the roughly 3000-4000 companies in the US>

04/02/2021,stocks,let me know how they perform over the next 30 years.
04/02/2021,stocks,"VTI is roughly 70% large cap and 30% small/mid so in my opinion it's close enough to your VOO/VB 70/30 split that I'd just call it a day. 

Granted yours is more of a barbell approach wherein you're getting zero exposure to mid cap stocks but higher small cap. You wouldn't for example have tracked the entire growth of Tesla with a VOO/VB approach but you would with VTI. 

I'd personally go with VTI/VB if you want to tilt towards small cap. Throw in international and EM for good measure. I personally use VTI/FTIHX as my portfolio stabilizers and mix in individual stocks. There's a lot of ways to create a personalized pizza. 🙂"
04/02/2021,stocks,These $200+ ETFs are just too high to get into for my poor bank account. Would it be better to hold just one share of these $200+ ETFs or hold multiple shares of something like VTWAX?
04/02/2021,stocks,"Sure big cap tech has rallied pretty well this week, led by Google and Facebook, but Apple is still a bit off and there's plenty on carnage in the growth names. I'm just saying it's not like everything is at all time highs."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Your missing the entire point. Sure the plebs like us with a few hundred K in equities are getting some crumbs, but the vast majority of equities are owned by a small group of people.  1% is getting almost all the gains instead of the 99%.  Everyone would be much better off without this money printing and inflation taking away technical gains."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I lived through the 80s energy crisis, again in the 90s, dot-com, and 2009 housing bubbles. There’s a difference in a short-lived momentary dip and an actual monumental burst of an overinflated market."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not really, it took years for a recovery in the 2000 and 2007-2009 cases (and in the 2000 case, it was over a decade before the Nasdaq recovered, the other indices were quicker, but then the GFC happened). 

I don't think this world exists anymore though. Any future crashes are likely to be taken care of within a couple months, while in the case of 2008-2009 (when it really got started), it took 10 months. Scary to think about, but I actually wound up weathering March okay last year after initially being scared and for some reason what happened early in the fall had me close to puking."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Considering that treasury rates are basically [at all time lows and were near 0%](https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart), I'd say BND really has only one direction to go... down. Similar for BNDX because it's US hedged, but international monetary policy is more complicated so hard to say.

Of course this is just speculation. Bonds could just trade sideways for the next 30 years. However I have a hard time believing yields will go negative... and they were damn close to zero just a few months ago.... so nowhere else to go."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Ya I actually reevaluated and will probably rebalance to 50:50 VOO/VTI, to get the midcap, small cap, and highcap all at .03% maintainence fee, while maintaining my heavy high market cap weight..

Do you happen to know offhand what weight VOO has in small and midcap individually?

Edit: I Googled.. it's closer to 87% 9% and 3%... Jesus I did not know VTI was THAT heavy in the large cap companies."
04/02/2021,stocks,The risk is negatively correlated to the weighting.
04/02/2021,stocks,"There's SPYV, SPYG, or other similar very low-price funds to give you some exposure to the S&P, even if it's only in some sectors."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Positive news: We have always, eventually, recovered. 👍🏼"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yes, 2000 and 2008 were remarkable."
04/02/2021,stocks,Interesting!  Thanks for sharing.  I'll keep holding bonds but good to read others insight!
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah VTI is basically three quarters (slightly less) large cap and the rest mid and small. It gives slightly better long term performance than a SP500 fund (VOO) but you'll have slightly more volatility, which relatively speaking is still low. 

It's why I recommend it to anyone who either is new to investing or wants a set it and forget it allocation to equities. You and I can get deeper in the weeds with allocations and exposure but that's because we enjoy this stuff.

EDIT: Yeah I wouldn't do both VOO/VTI, they're for all purposes similar funds. In fact many use them as substitutes for tax loss harvesting to avoid a wash sale, which is kind of surprising since they are 70%+ identical."
04/02/2021,stocks,Negatively correlated literally means correlated.
04/02/2021,stocks,"Well that’s more a problem with the strategy than the stock. The information is there long in advance, it’s just a matter of acting correctly on it.

That’s why I’m saying he’d likely have made more if he just held. It’s weird how people are afraid to risk it before they see price action confirming the rise, yet will gobble risk like crack hits once the ceiling is closer with a much further way down. 

The possibility of gmes squeeze was known for months before for instance. Yet anyone thinking so was just being ridiculous. Or nio, who continued to show great growth ever since they were near going under. They were exceeding goals yet 20 was too much last fall for them, but at 55 is a great buy. It’s no wonder people are being hosed."
04/02/2021,stocks,"No, they don't really stand out as being anomalies, in the case of most major drawdowns in history, they aren't fixed that quickly. But I think that is no longer going to be the case going forward.

I think the best analog for what happened last year is probably a much faster version of 1987-1989 to be honest."
04/02/2021,stocks,"April only has 30 days, this is now more of a dilemma than you originally thought."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It doesn't, literally. It's one of a trichotomy of kinds of correlation and when someone who isn't taking a statistics class says just ""correlated"" it literally means ""positively correlated"" (though often they want to imply ""causally related"" even when they're wrong about that). In a statistics class it only means they've calculated the correlation coefficient. Nobody said it in an unqualified form here. I said ""negatively correlated"" and no ambiguity of any kind was left by that to be questioned.

Anyway.

Spreading risk is a strategy to reduce risk.

Reallocating from low-risk items to high-risk items subverts that.

Buying the index fund weighted by market cap is less risky than buying the same shares using equal-weighting.

It used to be worse though. Large-cap stocks used to split to keep their share prices in a 50-200 range. So you would have been closer to equal dollar-weighted when you were equal share-weighted. Now you'd have more dollars in the mega-cap stocks, which is closer to cap-weighted than that, but still pretty far from it, and still the more risky choice."
04/02/2021,stocks,Plot twist: You’ve been bamboozled by a sneaky April fools joke.

04/02/2021,stocks,"You don't seem knowledgeable in stocks at all, so just buy market ETF."
04/02/2021,stocks,"Yeah if your expectation is 20% or better then you're in for a rude awakening. 

Go 100% in one of these or allocate to multiple VTI/VOO/VUG.

If you're not satisfied with the results you see from those ETFs compared to others over time (which would be hard to believe) then try to higher your risk/return tolerance by finding a fiduciary financial advisor that'll go in on options. 

I'd personally highly recommend VTI n chill."

04/02/2021,stocks,"VTI/VTSAX are passively managed funds that try to track a US stock market benchmark.

04/02/2021,stocks,Can’t tell if accounts commenting are AI or human.
04/02/2021,stocks,"The biggest problem here is the stock market is not just economics - but human psychology and emotions.
Even the smartest AI in the world can only base decisions based on logic and historical data. So what historical data/logic would have shown that with a global pandemic that killed millions and shut down many economies around the world and completely wiped out air travel, that the S&P would be at a record high a year later?? The answer is none.

The biggest challenge for AI is it will always struggle to deal with new events that haven’t occurred before historically (eg Covid pandemic) especially when you factor in human investors not acting rationally. I think Elon Musk said something similar when he said you can train an AI robot to hold a spoon perfectly with enough time, but if you suddenly give it a fork (which it hasn’t seen before) it won’t have a clue how to handle it without training/knowledge.

As others have said, there are a lot of extremely successful quant/AI funds out there (Renaissance etc) but it’s just they’re not infallible - 2020 was an awful year for most of them (for the reasons I outlined above)"
04/02/2021,stocks,Give the AI an enormous amount of cash to trade with and watch what happens...
04/02/2021,stocks,"And enough for one catalyst to cause shift in economy or how it acts/reacts, the AI starts messing things up. It needs to evolve all the time, and even then, it will make errors."

Whatever behavior the animal was doing at the precise moment the animal got food gets reinforced. And so over time, the animal's behavior becomes very weird because there is no functional relationship between it's behavior and the food. But behavior gets reinforced every time food is delivered. So the animal 'learns' to do very elaborate things because each element of that elaborate routine was reinforced earlier. But it's all nonsense behavior and has nothing to do with the delivery of food.

Edit: That is to say that you, OP, are both the hungry caged animal and the person giving yourself food. It is actually impressive."

A lot of market players just get a little smaller in this environment because it’ll shift so fast like, down all day last Friday and then turn on a dime and rally to close on the highs of the day by the time the bell hit. I agree that the market can be predicted to an extent. I mean look at the guys that solely trade the SPX and SPY daily. They live and die by market direction only and in turn they never have to deal with individual stock news as the trade off. Right now it’s more of a technical market but even with the technicals it’s -as always - only a guide that could help you decide whether to be bullish or bearish and what areas you should consider lightening up your positions or doubling down. They’re a huge help and they’re correct a majority of the time but even some weeks they’re unexplainably off."

I think you can too but most people's political biases and preconceptions and emotions will make it impossible for them to do effectively.

So they shouldn't even try, because most people are even worse at qualitative analysis than quantitative. Case in point all the people who believe that there's ""too many people"" Malthusian fearmongering -- it matters where the people are, what they do and how they act not just how many people and but almost everyone thinks there's too many people around because the number overrides every other fact. Biden's obviously a socialist tax politician, so business will obviously be bad around him and beliefs like that (or the other way around)."

If I can consistently get over 60% odds to win on a preflop all in shove from another player I do it. I might lose but then I just have to buy back in again in a standard cash game.

Obviously you prefer 80%+ but anything over 55% is a go.

With proper bankroll management this leads to eventual gains unless you run bad for too long. In theory your ability to predict the results that often should inspire you not disuade you.

But this is from the poker player in me."

Following for more."
04/02/2021,stocks,"It's kind of a contradiction though. If there is some regression model that accurately predicts the behavior of the market, prices wouldn't change because the ability to predict behavior would prevent anyone from making the wrong decision. 

The model could exist and be known and useable by only a select few (for example, due to absurd computational requirements), but as soon as it became available to everyone, market volatility would approach 0. If everyone knew a price was going to increase, why would anyone sell? If everyone knew a price would decline, why would anyone buy? The only potential sellers would be people that needed money elsewhere, but then you would need a method of predicting when people need to remove money from the market, which means you aren't just modeling the market, but human behavior as well. 

There are certainly *trends* that can be predicted on longer time scales, but everyone is already using those things strategically, and those predictions do reduce volatility. For example, it's pretty obvious that a super-long moving average of the market is going to increase, which is why people buy and hold index funds. However, quantifying the timing and amount of increase is much more difficult due to potentially millions of variables, which is why most people lose money day trading."

04/02/2021,stocks,"> Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned 

How do you know the speech was the cause of the big green day? There weren't really any surprises in the speech. The only reason I could see if is there was some widespread assumption about his plan that created a potential bearish sentiment, but everything bearish that people were assuming (e.g. increase in taxes) was included.

So, I think this huge green day was more likely a coincidence, especially since infrastructure ETFs barely moved."

04/02/2021,stocks,Good job mate
04/02/2021,stocks,"Mathematically speaking, 65% is a very good prediction, lets do the math:-

1. Assume 21 trading days on average per month
2. Place $1 daily bet, either you lose $1 or gain $1 
3. End of 21 trading days, we have 14 wins and 7 losses
4. Resulting in $7 gain from $21 dollars worth of bets.

That is 33% gain, from $21 -> $28 in 21 days. 

In reality, the gains is much much less as #2 doesn't happen (ie: Index doesn't go down to zero or double the next day). Still it is a net positive gain for being 65% correct."

04/02/2021,stocks,"My personal opinion is that it can be predicted to a certain extend. As a retail investor you can buy/sell whenever at the market price. For big funds, they can move the price (depending on their size and stock), but they would have to find the liquidity, people who are willing to buy or sell the security. The price action gives a clue of what those people are trying to accomplish. And understanding the underlying psychology of support/resistances is also important"

where can i see your predictions for april if you are going to do it?"
04/02/2021,stocks,"A very little known fact is that PV = (1+inflation)^T / (1+interest)^T. If inflation is rising faster than interest rates, then you actually have cumulative gains to the present value. Interest rates are still below 2% while we expect an inflation rate higher than 2%, thus, the PV of stocks should be higher. I am in the camp that the high PE multiples reflect both this as well as the fact that globally, countries are being put back into lockdown while the US stays open making it a more appealing market than other countries. On top of that, the US just pumped $1.9T into the market and is trying to invest another $2T in infrastructure. From a supply and demand standpoint, US equities have been and will continue to be in high demand for the foreseeable future for the aforementioned reasons."

We have end of quarter rebalancing, 1 year anniversary of Covid shutdowns (so some ETFs and funds rebalanced based on expiring 1-yr windows of drastic price actions), unexpected bond yield movements (not so much the direction but the hissy fit nature of them, overnight), passing of a stimulus bill, rise in oil prices, selling for paying taxes after a profitable year, and other broad-stroked and/or automatic money movements that drive sector pricing more than individual stock pricing.  I am thinking that the independent movements of individual stocks will increase again in April."
04/02/2021,stocks,"imo the bizarre volatile months are actually where the most predictable patterns appear due to things trading largely on predictable human emotions rather than unpredictable ever-shifting fundamentals. It's the straight up bull runs like from Nov 2020 till February 2021 that are hard to predict since you can never quite tell when things are going to end.

This isn't exactly a huge sample size, but every 10% correction in the Nasdaq since March 2020 crash has followed the pattern below:

1. Nasdaq makes a short-term peak (Sept 2 2020, Nov 13 2020, Feb 16 2021)

2. Nasdaq drops for 2-3 trading days then bounces (bounce dates were Sept 10, Nov 16, Feb 19)

3. We get about a week of choppy trading

4. Nasdaq drops again to form a bottom, usually 3-4 weeks after the short term top appears. (Sept 21, Nov 2, March 5)

5. Markets bounce up partially for another week or two of choppy trading

6. Bears/sellers finally exhaust and the Nasdaq makes an engulfing bullish move up

---

With that said, this only applies to the last 3 corrections we've seen which have been surprisingly uniform. The October 2018 almost-bear-market took 2 and a half months for the Nasdaq to fully bottom, but nevertheless the same pattern of Drop -> Bounce -> Choppiness -> Drop -> Bounce -> Choppiness was still there."
04/02/2021,stocks,"This just means that he was right whether the market closed green or red. The market could fluctuate a lot intraday and taking the 1% trades would make him sell prematurely (for a profit or a loss) nearly always.    
Now, if he stayed in from 9:30 until the closing bell, he would make money 65% of the time. However, one bad prediction could wipe out a lot of gains. Let’s say he’s right two days and he makes 0.8% gains. Then he’s wrong once when the market moves 1.5% and he’s already behind square one.

For reference, apples net income from continuing operations for its fiscal year ended 9/30/2020 was $57.4billion.  Caterpillar had just shy of $3 billion (vs $6bn in 2019, if you’re wanting pre covid numbers). 

Home Depot earned $12.8 billion it’s own most recently ended fiscal year. Yet all for all those companies a $1 change in share price moves the DJIA the exact same amount. Crazy, right?"

Machine learning is still pretty horrible at most complex regression problems and likely will remain that way for a long time. Also, considering there are literally an infinite number of models, I'm not sure it can be proven that *anything* can be predicted. Actually, it's pretty easy to prove that random functions can not be predicted, but even if you limit yourself to non-random functions, there is still an infinite solution space.

Any continuous function can be approximated with existing machine-learning techniques (see the universal approximation theorem), but there is no guarantee that approximation is accurate enough for prediction without an absurd amount of training data, computation, or time to train the model. Also, we would have to know all of the parameters that affect the prediction in the first place, which we generally don't for any complex system."

04/02/2021,stocks,"Because Alphabet investors don't really give any value to the idea of voting. Probably because even if you owned all of the class A shares (and all of the votes that go along with that) you still wouldn't have any control over the company because the founders have retained over 50% of the voting rights for themselves. Which means your vote is more like a suggestion, or proof of participation. That's all.

In theory, the right to vote should be worth something. But often times the non voting shares cost more than voting shares, probably because people see those shares as ""more liquid"" meaning they can close the position sooner if they choose to do so."

04/02/2021,stocks,I believe you are overly-narrowing Ops thesis
04/02/2021,stocks,"Not a dumb question. The core issue with this is the part where you ""ignore how it opens"". You cannot ignore more recent data and still expect your endpoint to reflect what the probabilities were back when your older data *was* the most recent data. A simple example: I tell you that given that it rained yesterday there's a 40% chance based on historical data that it rains tomorrow. You go to sleep planning on not bringing an umbrella tomorrow. In the morning before you leave for work, you look outside and see it's overcast and gray outside. You cannot simply ignore that fact or say ""That's not a part of my predictive model"" because fundamentally, the chance of it raining today is now >40% (and this would be true even if your model ignored it by not looking outside).

Applied to stonks, if I gave you nothing but the open and current price and asked you to predict a close, I guarantee your guesses would be more accurate later in the day. This is obvious because as time until close approaches 0, current price approaches close price -- my prediction 5 milliseconds before close will almost always be right, and that effect cannot be ignored.

Okay now translate this into how you'd place orders. If you want to realize that 74% close>open probability, the ONLY way to do this is if the stock is green premarket, you place a buy order at 0930. You must do this every time its green premarket (no matter by how much) and not sell until 1559 in the afternoon, no exceptions. Doing anything else pulls you away from 74%, because now you're just refusing to look outside in the morning.

To capitalize on the intraday day dips, at 0930 you might send a trail stop for say, 0.25% above a dip. Here's the issue: every time this order executes, what it actually represents (in terms of whether it's a profitable) is the chance of a up close as a function of (1) the amount below open at which it executes (if NASDAQ is 10% down at execution, there is no longer a 74% percent chance it closes above open), (2) the time at which it executes (the probability of close > open was 74% at 0930, but if your order executes at 1400, it's no longer 74%), (3) a bunch of other factors inducing noise into the model that you'd probably want to account for. You can easily imagine cases where this loses you money over the guy that sent the market order at 0930:

1. The price trends up all day long, your order never executes, while the 0930 market order shows a strong daily profit.

2. The market hits an early high of +1.50%, then a dip down to +1.0% and your trail stop executes at +1.10%. The market then dips some and closes at +0.75%. You book a loss while the 0930 market order books a profit.

There would also be times when you come out ahead of the market order, but at the end of the day that's factored into part of the 26% of losing days. Meanwhile, those two examples I gave are part of the market order's 74% of winner days, that you missed out on. Fundamentally, what you're doing is making a buy/no-buy decision bases on many factors beyond what went into that 74% number, but acting like that 74% still represents your decision to buy or not. As soon as you deviate from the conditions under which that 74% was calculated, the probability that your buy/no-buy decision will realize deviates from 74% too.

There's so many factors that can potentially affect this decision that it's easy to see why many firms choose to go the machine learning route: it can intake hundreds of different variables and return you a buy/no-buy decision that's profitable without needing to ""look under the hood"" of what it's using to predict. Even this is fallible because you don't know the computer's reasoning, so humans may distrust it. Maybe one day in Fall 2007 the computer starts screaming at you to sell, and DJIA is still rising, do you actually sell? If not, you've acted based on factors beyond your model, and you'll lose big very soon and never realize the gains the model was supposed to net you."

You could wait until a big correction and time it perfectly or you could formulate a strategy now, average into your position and experience the market through the ups and downs.

For me the experience is extremely valuable, a lot of people invested for the first time in Oct/Nov 2020 and March would have been their first pull back. The experience of staying invested during that time, seeing how the market works and all the various micro events that impact it will appreciate over time.

04/02/2021,stocks,"Bear case: Price/Sales and Book value are very low because they have low profit margins and low growth expectations in comparison to others in their industry group. 

CoF's current Price/Sales is 1.8x what the 5 year figure is, so it's already valued above it's historical expectations.  (for Reference, Visa and mastercard's current P/S is about 1.4-1.5x the 5 year number and they have much stronger margins and growth). I think if there is a sector pullback, CoF is one of the more likely companies to be hit hardest because it's farther away from it's 'normal' ratios.

My price target on it would be around 95-100, at which point in time I would take a closer look at the company itself to see if I thought they'd achieve the growth they're projecting.

04/02/2021,stocks,Tesla is currently producing and stockpiling their in house batteries from the Kato road facility for use in the Berlin Model Y. Once Tesla's Berlin battery lines are up and running I assume their Kato road batteries will then be used for the Plaid+ Model S/X and Roadster.

Tesla's first production vehicle with cell to pack with 4680s and single casting front and rear."
04/02/2021,stocks,I was asking for proof that they are currently manufacturing and stockpiling batteries. My understanding is that pilot line is not complete as of early February.
04/02/2021,stocks,"During battery day they stated they had already made thousands of 4680s on the pilot line, what they've been working on over the past half year is improving the process to increase their yield rate of batteries they're making. The pilot line has been ""complete"" in the sense that they can create cells and this has been the case for at least the past half year, it's not ""complete"" in the sense that it's not at full running capacity with the highest rate of yield."
04/02/2021,stocks,"I'm familiar with manufacturing scale up, I'm an engineer that's worked in new product introduction for the past decade. I'm asking you where you heard that they are currently manufacturing at a scale suitable for stockpiling batteries in anticipation of a commercial launch. The link that you sent literally is just ""yes, we will be able to support Berlin manufacturing from Fremont."
04/02/2021,stocks,"You stated ""Tesla doesn't make batteries yet"" which simply isn't true. We don't know their current rate of production, but I'd assume it's further along than what we learned about on battery day, since they were already producing to some extent at that point. There's been rumors that the 4680s are already in test vehicles, but Tesla prefers to be silent on this as to not Osborne their current product. With Model Y production just around the corner in Berlin, estimates are starting production July/August range, maybe sooner? and with Tesla stating they're going to support Model Y Berlin with Fremont 4680s I think it's reasonably safe to assume they're not tossing all the cells that are being produced in Fremont. We'll know for sure soon enough, if deductive reasoning isn't enough."
04/02/2021,stocks,"okay so when I said that I meant that they don't offer any commercial products made with batteries they produced. If you want to debate whether or not that Tesla has any manufacturing capacity, full stop, then I think I'm done here."

I record the values in each account and have a total column which calculates my current net worth. Some months it’s up, on some it’s gone sideways and on occasion it’s dropped, I occasionally invest more if the market has dropped 20% but most of the time I ‘do nothing’. This method helps avoid the noise of the daily markets which can be volatile and takes out all the drama. Maybe you could consider starting by doing this daily, drop to weekly and eventually go monthly."

My biggest advice is only one thing: Make sure if you're buying and selling, you're putting aside money for the taxman. If you're constantly reinvesting your tax burden and pushing it to a later date, you're taking on a risk level where if the market tanks, you'll be forced to liquidate at a lower level in order to pay the tax man.

I believe there is a higher game being played. It is not just DFV that figured out something and is taking all his buddies to the moon - it could be but unlikely. It's too organized, too much obfuscation, etc.  It may be that retail is just being used as bait, a safety net, fodder, etc.

The data tells a story... but that story is not well defined. It could be anything from Retail getting screwed(not losing everything but, say, losing 50%-75% of their investment) to retail making thousands per stock. The truth is somewhere in the middle.

It looks like that the shorters/HF's have shorted GME past 60% of float. That is significant. It could be much higher. But how can retail know this? The data that says this is ""stale"" and retail can't actually get valid data to make valid decisions. This is why it is all a gamble. No matter how many people or posts that say GME is going to moon, it means squat. I really hope it does, but people need to learn that just because they say something doesn't mean it becomes true and the exact opposite can happen.

If the DD that DFV has done and some others is significantly accurate then there is a really good chance that GME will go up in value significantly(how much and when no one can predict)."

04/02/2021,stocks,"> And what’s stopping any publisher with a large catalog, like EA or Ubisoft, or deep pockets like Epic, or a large user base like Steam, to eventually start their own games subscription service?

Ubisoft and EA already have their own subscription services. EA has already been added to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate because it just makes more sense economically and publicity wise to side with the company offering the consoles on which to play rather than just try to offer a service on their own.

There has been rumors that Ubisoft's service is next to be acquired for Game Pass and if that happens, it'll likely start a domino effect for other companies as well. If that happens, Microsoft will have exclusive Bethesda as well as easy access to EA and Ubisoft's entire catalog -- the latter could go exclusive as well.

You bring up some good points but Microsoft has been stacking its cards behind Game Pass for quite a while now and they are ahead of the curve in that regard over all the other gaming companies. That, combined with their fuck you money leads me to believe that they're well poised to set up a dominant service in Game Pass."

I've been mainly reading about whether the US is in a bubble at the moment and if so why etc and better places to invest.

However, this comment of yours intrigued me:

> A favorite play of institutional investors for quite a while has been to sell GME calls to the WSB crowd in order to take advantage of the high IV created by their out of touch echo-chamber.

I don't quite understand how this works. If I am an institutional investor looking to take advantage of the optimism in WSB, what steps could I take? I _think_ you're saying that an ii could sell a GME call to someone, that would, say, give that person the option of buying, say, 100 GME at $100. I guess that person would pay something for that, say $1000. But then if that person exercises the option, doesn't the ii then have to come up with 100 GME and sell it to the WSB person at $100? What if the price of GME is $150 at that point? Isn't the ii basically gambling that the price will come down, just like the WSB person is betting it will stay high? Apologies if I'm being slow.

Many thanks"
04/02/2021,stocks,"Of course it is a bet that the price of GME won't grow above the strike price of the option at expiry. One can compute a theoretical fair price of options through various methods, which allows one to see that GME short and medium term call options were hugely overpriced at various points in time due to the attempts of WSB to engineer a gamma squeeze by buying far OTM calls. So one could sell such calls for an unreasonably high premium to WSB people who were buying them for that purpose. If you do so but you are wrong about the price of GME at the strike date then you'll have to buy GME shares at whatever higher price they reach at the market close on that date and give them to the person or institution who exercises the call (in which case you as the call seller loose money). But given that the theory of a second squeeze was provably wrong and that GME far OTM call options were massively overpriced you could at various points in time sell call options with very good risk/return potential for the seller. Some institutional investors did that and in fact some even mentioned it publicly. The risk they took is that WSB could have been right about being able to engineer a gamma squeeze, in which case the price of shares would shoot far above the strike price of the option they chose.

You can learn more about this kind of strategy at /r/thetagang

Note that in my opinion the ethics of taking advantage of WSB mania in this manner is questionable, because those institutions were trying to make a profit off the naivete of new and inexperienced investors. Hedge funds have sophisticated option pricing tools and lots of information and processing power which are not available to retail investors. Moreover they use prime brokerage services of investment banks, which offer better service and market access than most retail brokers."
