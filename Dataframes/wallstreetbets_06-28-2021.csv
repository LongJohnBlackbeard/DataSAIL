2021-06-28 18:58:01,wallstreetbets,Fuck him. Fuck his price gouging. And fuck him for disrespecting the wutang clan.

2021-06-28 18:55:14,wallstreetbets,government shouldn’t overload the market with regulations that allow monopolies to be held. that’s especially true in medicine.
2021-06-28 19:09:49,wallstreetbets,"*Daraprim* 

You do realize that the price increase only affected large corporations like Walmart and Exxon? He sold ***Daraprim*** for a $1 a pill to the Government, meaning if one was unable to afford the medication, or simply did not have health insurance or other means of coverage, he would cover the costs himself. The move was an attempt to stick it to Big Pharma, many smooth brained folk like yourself misunderstand the entire situation and paint him as this villainous mastermind out to ruin the lives of ordinary people. 

[watch the entire interview, but specifically, pay close attention at 6:00](https://youtu.be/2PCb9mnrU1g)"
2021-06-28 19:07:59,wallstreetbets,"So, fun fact. Shkreli was active on this sub way back, when it was under 100k, and made a lasting impact on its culture. You’re absolutely right but I don’t think it’ll change many peoples mind on here."

2021-06-28 19:04:31,wallstreetbets,A bunch of people got free insulin because of his antics and he was one of WSB original members and lurkers. So yea the guys a legend.
2021-06-28 19:05:12,wallstreetbets,Insulin? Wasn't it the HIV drug?

2021-06-28 19:10:40,wallstreetbets,"would it not been returned to him, since he did pay the 7 mil fines in cash?"
2021-06-28 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,This argument is disingenuous to put it mildly.  He does not sell the drugs to Exxon; the costs are for the insurance plans to absorb— who pays for the increase in health care costs — a lot of it goes to the worker.  One would have to be on Medicaid or Medicare to be eligible for the $1 program — but go ahead and hit working people.  It is delusional to think Exxon itself was just going to absorb the cost
2021-06-28 18:55:57,wallstreetbets,People having to ration insulin because the price is unaffordable is okay with you?
2021-06-28 18:54:39,wallstreetbets,Can you clarify what you mean by that?
2021-06-28 19:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I can afford to give some life saving drugs, too if I price gouged. Fuck off with your reverence. He's a shit bag who deserved prison."
2021-06-28 19:10:25,wallstreetbets,I remember that lmaoo. He was trying to get people to send him a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair haha.
2021-06-28 18:56:45,wallstreetbets,Health insurance covered the premium increase. And they openly offered to provide all medicine supplies for free to anyone who contacted them if their insurance wouldn’t comply

2021-06-28 19:10:55,wallstreetbets,"You, uh...
You know he only charged insurance companies out the ass, right? The uninsured got rebates from his drug company, and the price wasn't passed on to the insured consumers.
Man is a legend."
2021-06-28 19:07:14,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? He wasn’t the one that gave you the free insulin lol. He’s in prison to this day so idk what you mean deserves. If you can’t handle this leave WSB you all destroyed it with your over sensitivity.
2021-06-28 19:41:23,wallstreetbets,Ok wtf. Please provide a link or your own flaired explanation. Either is fine
2021-06-28 18:58:01,wallstreetbets,And everyone has health insurance…. And can afford the medicine without the insurance they have….
2021-06-28 19:35:15,wallstreetbets,Makes sense! 🙃
2021-06-28 19:33:44,wallstreetbets,He's an OG autist and legend
2021-06-28 19:46:04,wallstreetbets,Naive take. Cost always goes back to the consumer.
2021-06-28 19:40:06,wallstreetbets,And insurance companies getting gouged on drug prices doesn’t affect people who pay health insurance premiums…right? Right? Fool
2021-06-28 19:12:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because everyone has health insurance. It's not like people are rationing insulin in this country. There are literally a billion better heroes than that shit bag, and an infinite many mediocre ones. You have a super fucking low bar for legend."
2021-06-28 19:30:38,wallstreetbets,Think the insurance companies just pay that shit and don’t pass on any of the cost to their customers? Compared your insurance premiums to a decade ago lately?
2021-06-28 19:03:08,wallstreetbets,"They openly and repeatedly announced that anyone that wanted it could have contacted the company and received it for free. There was 0% risk to those who needed it. It was simply an R&D strategy to get money from insurance companies to help cash flow development of the drug in order to manufacture it cheaper for future mass, low-cost production so it could permanently be a sub $10 medicine. The guy was a hero"
2021-06-28 19:56:17,wallstreetbets,"So? Don't get health insurance of you don't want to pay the premiums. 

Also, the price and costs don't matter. Blue book and all, everything's made up and they charge what they want, regardless of circumstances."
2021-06-28 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,"So, again, if someone bought his drug without insurance, as I stated, they were given a rebate to bring the price back down to normal. And if they had insurance, they would see no change in price. It was entirely the insurance companies that bore the brunt. Are you feeling bad for multi billion dollar monopolies?"
2021-06-28 19:18:33,wallstreetbets,"It was fucking ***Daraprim***, you smooth brained imbecile"
2021-06-28 19:04:03,wallstreetbets,Insulin does not cost 10$ a vial….
2021-06-28 19:57:34,wallstreetbets,"You’re a smart one. No one wants to pay jacked up
premiums for jacked up drug prices. Shkreli is a scumbag"
2021-06-28 19:05:09,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t, because the media portrayed him as an evil guy and he was used as a scape goat to lock up and keep people satisfied. So he went to jail, the medicine improvements weren’t able to be finished, and the world became a worse place because he went to prison"
2021-06-28 19:06:24,wallstreetbets,When you manipulate the stock price that’s what happens. There was no RD. The firm had no FDA filings outside of distribution approvals.
2021-06-28 19:40:37,wallstreetbets,Do tell what clinical trials were halted by his prison sentence.
2021-06-28 19:12:30,wallstreetbets,"You don’t need to create your own version of the drug and get FDA approval to get it out on the market. What he did was buy the rights to a drug with no patent protection that was already approved by the FDA, then that gave him the ability to change the price to their needs and work on developing the drug without having to wait for FDA rulings or worry about patent protections"

2021-06-28 18:39:24,wallstreetbets,200 @ $26 here. I fully expect them to reach their previous ATH by next year if not higher.
2021-06-28 18:59:27,wallstreetbets,I’m in on isun. I believe there is more room to grow with isun. Not financial advice

2021-06-28 18:34:15,wallstreetbets,Buy the donuts not the stock
2021-06-28 19:59:55,wallstreetbets,I invested in KKD 20 years ago. Their CEO cheated the company and shareholders. It went from $42 to delisted.
2021-06-28 18:23:01,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt touch this with OPs wifes boyfirends dick
2021-06-28 19:05:27,wallstreetbets,Deez NUTS
2021-06-28 18:25:32,wallstreetbets,"All I know is my local one closed, then another popped up later in a different location, and now it’s a ramen restaurant not even many months later."
2021-06-28 18:10:04,wallstreetbets,But… donuts!
2021-06-28 18:35:07,wallstreetbets,"A warm Krispy Kreme is like $.99 disposable fleshlight that you get to eat afterwards. A little messy, but win win."
2021-06-28 18:27:14,wallstreetbets,On wsb everyone is an ivy league econ major.
2021-06-28 18:09:44,wallstreetbets,So short at ipo
2021-06-28 18:37:43,wallstreetbets,"This is one of my fav posts I’ve read on here. Great info, concise, and funny AF.

What is this, a tech company? LOLx1000. Damn right. Anyone who buys this thing on day one is going full retard. 

never go full retard, everyone knows that."
2021-06-28 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,"Year everyone comes out to have a ipo, like what's next, the local diner down the street gonna launch too"
2021-06-28 18:32:23,wallstreetbets,You sound too educated. You’re not supposed to learn at your Ivy League school!! It’s about networking!
2021-06-28 19:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Point three and the fact that KK ain’t done shit in 5 years is all you need to know. Point five is why they are doing it. They just want to have their cake and eat it too on the backs of people who don’t know any better. 

This will dump hard unless the apes lick their windows and decide this is the flavor of the month."
2021-06-28 18:36:19,wallstreetbets,"I feel like nearly all the IPO in the last 8 montha  have been sus for retail especially since they have a target share price already that's high and then it opens even higher, only to crash to the price that the last batch of private investors paid per share. 

basically anyone who buys IOPs the first day or so holds the bags for insiders"
2021-06-28 19:23:15,wallstreetbets,Dees nuts 🥜
2021-06-28 19:30:42,wallstreetbets,You heard it guys. Time for some fucking calls
2021-06-28 19:37:24,wallstreetbets,How else am I meant to join the Krispy Kreme Klub?
2021-06-28 19:06:42,wallstreetbets,They probably got lots of money for offering free dnuts to vaccinated
2021-06-28 18:20:44,wallstreetbets,This is at least as shitty as any SPAC the tv keeps yelling at clouds about
2021-06-28 19:31:49,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. The krispy kreme down the street closed last year. It was open for 1 year before that.
2021-06-28 18:14:53,wallstreetbets,Lol Ivy League econ thinks that mr market cares
2021-06-28 18:16:40,wallstreetbets,"So we yolo on calls, got it"
2021-06-28 18:12:40,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t let GME fail, you think im going to live life without Krispy kreams"
2021-06-28 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  How man ipos have they done so far?
2021-06-28 18:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I really want to play this just based on personal sentiment, but I don't think the share value at $20+ is fair for this company."
2021-06-28 18:42:42,wallstreetbets,"They couldn’t IPO until Dunkin went private because nobody wants to buy the loser. It’s like if MySpace announced an IPO tmrw after FB just broke $1T

I want my dunkin shares back!!"
2021-06-28 18:53:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks Ivy League retard will get puts on $DNUT whenever they open up options on it. Even though they are giving out free donuts for covid vaccines I like ur DD but I’m guessing it could be like the snowflake ipo and they pump and dump it
2021-06-28 18:50:27,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows America runs on Dunkin’.
2021-06-28 18:57:03,wallstreetbets,Carbs are gross. DD from California. You’re welcome.
2021-06-28 18:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Homer Simpson likes donuts, and he like my daddy, so I buy lots of dnut as a tribute to him!"
2021-06-28 19:09:07,wallstreetbets,I won’t be investing in Kripsy Kreme because the one in my city closed it’s doors indefinitely about 2 or 3 years ago. It was run out of town by local pastry/donut shops and the nearby Dunkin’ Donuts.
2021-06-28 19:33:27,wallstreetbets,DO NOT TOUCH MY DONUTS WITH THAT SHORT SHIT. I will DFV Krispy Kreme!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🙃🥳
2021-06-28 18:59:35,wallstreetbets,How does any of this tell us how many licks to get to the center of a jelly donut?
2021-06-28 18:33:15,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-28 18:15:07,wallstreetbets,But.. that ticker! D(is)NUT
2021-06-28 18:15:34,wallstreetbets,"The real play was Dunkin Donuts. Undervalued af and was delivering on its aggressive expansion plans. Sadly, the big money players noticed this and took them private."
2021-06-28 19:00:46,wallstreetbets,The perfect rebuttal. Case closed.
2021-06-28 18:36:21,wallstreetbets,Doughnuts
2021-06-28 18:36:41,wallstreetbets,I see you like your donuts double glazed
2021-06-28 19:15:25,wallstreetbets,Your genius kind of scares me.
2021-06-28 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,Mr. Econ major didn’t take into account the self pleasure donisolation market.
2021-06-28 19:31:51,wallstreetbets,I'm. I'm... Impressed 😏
2021-06-28 19:34:28,wallstreetbets,Can I lick the glaze off your fingers? I don't have .99cents to buy any
2021-06-28 19:00:18,wallstreetbets,I genuinely hate this comment
2021-06-28 18:43:35,wallstreetbets,You’ve noticed this too? We’ve run amok in undergrad econ rejects.
2021-06-28 19:39:47,wallstreetbets,Better Ivy League Econ majors than Ivy League MBAs (Source: I’m an Ivy League MBA and have observed generally MBAs are more smoothbrained than Undergrads
2021-06-28 18:24:28,wallstreetbets,Sec doesn’t allow shorting on ipo for 30 days I believe
2021-06-28 19:53:17,wallstreetbets,This thing will ipo 20-24 and eod 44 in this market.
2021-06-28 18:12:43,wallstreetbets,You can’t immediately after IPO
2021-06-28 18:40:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks fam I appreciate you
2021-06-28 18:52:56,wallstreetbets,"Yah, that sandwich shop down the street got $100m market cap. Tis the season."
2021-06-28 18:35:17,wallstreetbets,lmfao this is facts though
2021-06-28 18:45:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve made money day trading on IPO day but never hold it into the second day.
2021-06-28 18:39:38,wallstreetbets,I generally wait until a year after IPO. I was able to snag a bunch of $LYFT between $20 and $30 a share. Imagine paying $80 for that shit on day 1
2021-06-28 18:37:54,wallstreetbets,na SPAC are less shitty since they have hope of making money and typically don't make debt in payments
2021-06-28 19:34:58,wallstreetbets,Yikes
2021-06-28 18:15:35,wallstreetbets,Step one to saving a company: learn to spell its name.
2021-06-28 18:54:12,wallstreetbets,"I missed out on Dunkin, one of my biggest regrets. Good on you for getting in while you could sir"
2021-06-28 18:55:46,wallstreetbets,You're welcome!
2021-06-28 18:26:32,wallstreetbets,"I thought exactly the same!!! 😄

I’m bullish just because of the ticker."
2021-06-28 19:41:52,wallstreetbets,"…I googled this and was surprised to learn people spell donuts as doughnuts - must be a regional thing. This led me down a rabbit hole of donut fucking DD that got me into learning the first donut (I like our variation) were called olykoeks.

Read more here: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-history-of-the-doughnut-150405177/

And that is how I missed the closing bell."
2021-06-28 18:38:52,wallstreetbets,"Huh, ya learn something new every day

Edit: Looked into it.  Underwriters are not allowed to lend out shares for 30 days, however institutional and retail investors can immediately on IPO.  So it looks like you have to wait a few days for shares to start settling in accounts.  However there probably won’t be many shares available to borrow."
2021-06-28 18:42:02,wallstreetbets,"What’s the SEC gonna do? Give Shitadel a $10,000 fine for making millions on shorts? Oh wait…"
2021-06-28 18:16:25,wallstreetbets,Shorting a stock is not options
2021-06-28 18:40:02,wallstreetbets,3 days you have to wait
2021-06-28 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm mostly reminded of some dating app (not tinder) that went public targeting $40 share, Opened at $70 and just fell from the earth, all while everyone called it another ""success""

I'm in a couple of IPOs technically but you definitely have to wait for the massive dump and FOMO to happen before investing"
2021-06-28 19:56:45,wallstreetbets,I am a flexographic / gravure printer in Canada. And we print lots of Doughnut packages for hostess.
2021-06-28 19:50:14,wallstreetbets,God WSB has devolved so much in these past couple months.
2021-06-28 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,I guess if your broker will let you actually borrow and sell short
2021-06-28 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,"So, any broker that isn’t Robinhood."
2021-06-28 18:39:00,wallstreetbets,"And if you have the margin requirement, etc"
2021-06-28 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,So if you’re not poor and have a real broker. Yes.
2021-06-28 19:51:22,wallstreetbets,Go for it

2021-06-28 18:53:56,wallstreetbets,I truly believe this is possible. Their technology is insane. I bought this stock as a meme stock but it has serious long term value. Will start adding 20-40 shares/month as long as it stays this low.

2021-06-28 19:01:40,wallstreetbets,Usps... the government did not want to with the EV from what I read. I'm pretty sure I got that right unless it's vice-versa. But on of these companies is suing the government as we speak over the deal.
2021-06-28 19:05:16,wallstreetbets,That was a previous deal with USPS which was finalized months ago. Speculation now is whether or not WKHS will announce any upcoming government contracts through the new infrastructure bills being proposed by the Feds this week.
2021-06-28 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,Ok well what deals are those? The only major government contract that would have made a real impact was the usps deal. Also there is a good chance the infrastructure bill is not going to get everything they wanted when it comes to the global warming stuff. From what I understood it's going to be more a roads and bridges and some EV charging stations. Am I missing amything?

2021-06-28 17:22:12,wallstreetbets,"Not every shorted stock is candidate for a short squeeze. It’s a really rare thing. No, it’s not the next GME. It’s a shit company, and that is why it is shorted."
2021-06-28 17:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Because they suck.

They're barely profitable, though they are in the black most of the time. They're being aggressively outcompeted by CVS and Walgreens (WBA) who have actual plans for the future. I'm generally bullish on retail and think the sector has been massively undervalued since 2018, but it's still a matter of picking winners and losers. 

Drug stores these days basically use their pharmacy as a draw to shunt customers past a store full of overpriced convenience and grocery items to maintain margins. That's a failing business model, especially as pharmacy options increase. As I've said before, where do you go more often, to the pharmacy or the gas station? Not to mention there's pharmacies in actual grocery stores now. Rite Aid seems intent on living off that business model until its dying breath.

CVS is integrating its pharmacies with clinics in their stores, and they bought the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, Aetna. That integration will drive value and margins. They're likely to be the drug store leader in the future as they transform into an integrated health management company.

Walgreens has a massive footprint, and with it the clout to drive down costs and continue making money. They (and CVS) offer delivery options. They also benefit from sucking up market share from their failing competitors, which seems to be their current strategy rather than transforming to succeed in the future.

Rite Aid is that failing competitor. There's just nothing they're particularly good at, and they seem to have no plan to grow in the future. They need to invent a reason for their existence, and that involves development and execution costs they can ill afford on slim margins. They might be a good value trade if they get hit particularly bad, and $10 might be a good entry point, but I wouldn't buy it and then ride them off into the sunset. The sunset in this analogy is likely bankruptcy, even if it's ten years down the road."

It's kind of weird though cuz a lot of liberals and progressives get really really mad if a republican bombs foreign countries but whenever a Democrat does it for some reason they just say okay I'll just put my head in the sand and everything is fine.

I'm starting to not care though I say go ahead Joe bomb the hell out of them! that seems to be what people really wanted and voted for.    🌝

2021-06-28 17:18:20,wallstreetbets,"I don't get it, nio is a solid company its a smart buy especially when it was low 30s a while ago of course its gonna go back up"
2021-06-28 18:03:39,wallstreetbets,Motley fool you mean the news company owned through back door citadel companies ya I’m out

2021-06-28 19:26:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got in at $6 and rode it up to $48 and haven't really paid much attention to it since.
2021-06-28 17:29:22,wallstreetbets,NIO is the best. Will be @ 100 before year end. Buy buy! don't regret later.
2021-06-28 17:37:41,wallstreetbets,"It’s a new phenomenon, if you can’t explain why something goes up then just blame it on the apes. 🦍"
2021-06-28 18:00:54,wallstreetbets,"I got in it last year, gonna ride for a 2-3 years!"
2021-06-28 19:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Does NOT matter. Never mind the twists and turns, the LONG scenic route is enough for me. Diamond hands all the way up. NIO is a disruptive force to be reckoned with in China alone whose population is over 4x the US and they are govt backed. Ride the NIO Tsunami."
2021-06-28 17:28:46,wallstreetbets,NIO is legit. However WSB not really the place for NIO. I got in last year and exited at like 60+. It’s def a long term play. I like them but the time to buy was back in February
2021-06-28 17:17:36,wallstreetbets,If you didn’t buy nio when it was sub 30 a month ago you are a retarded ape
2021-06-28 17:28:26,wallstreetbets,"I've been hanging around more than I should be this last week and I've rarely seen it mentioned. Is NIO the new silver for financial ""news""?"
2021-06-28 19:31:40,wallstreetbets,I don’t know. I just saw a couple months ago that NIO admitted that battery and chip shortages will be an issue for deliverables this year. 🤷🏻‍♀️
2021-06-28 18:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Yea 90M volume due to increased retail,,"
2021-06-28 17:18:42,wallstreetbets,Seriously lol

2021-06-28 17:07:27,wallstreetbets,"I like Tilray over other Canadian competitors. What do you think of the smaller marijuana companies in the US? Like green thumb and trulieve. If marijuana is legalized, will US companies have an upper hand?

Also, I downloaded the Weedmaps app. I gotta say, it’s got a very clean and easy to use interface. What you think about MAPS"
2021-06-28 17:16:24,wallstreetbets,I’m holding $TLRY since 24$ and I’m not selling any. The company has a huge potencial since the merger and the revenue will increase as long as the market is opening. Should be at least a 120$ 🔥🚀

2021-06-28 17:08:47,wallstreetbets,This is why u do bare minimum research 😂
2021-06-28 17:31:04,wallstreetbets,"SPX and XSP options are cash-settled (so they would have just given you the money).

Favorable taxation too (60/40 long term / short term regardless of actual holding period)

SPX also trades at 10x the size of SPY which saves you commissions (1/10 the number of contacts) and makes the bid/ask spread a smaller percentage of your investment.

And they are European style, so no need to worry about early assignment if you have short legs.

Much better than SPY options, overall."
2021-06-28 17:07:09,wallstreetbets,"TDA did this to me on QQQ puts a month ago.  Like an idiot, i forgot Qs have inter-week options and bought wed expiration on a wed when i thought i was buying friday expiration.  Woke up thursday to a 500 Qs short position and balls deep in margin.

TDA doesn't mess around.  I wonder if it just the indices they do this with since they are less volatile"

2021-06-28 16:59:21,wallstreetbets,"As an FYI - I’ve followed SOFI and SPACs for sometime. Do your research on the company, pay attention to the technical data points, and the overall macro economics. Pay attention to volume (it’s how I know the Pipe sold 500m+ worth of shares). Build out your own DCF model (and if you don’t know what that is, look it up on YouTube and learn).

The more time you spend reading this stuff, the more you’ll realise this stuff is not that hard and retail traders have our own unique edge against institutions - they’re giant battle ships that can’t turn without letting the rest of us know."

2021-06-28 19:39:56,wallstreetbets,Risk management. I wasn’t sure if it was going lower or if it would pop today or by Wednesday - if a Thursday jobs report tanked the broader it could weigh it down through the week.

2021-06-28 16:36:05,wallstreetbets,Just what did I just read.
2021-06-28 18:23:47,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME are not the same retard. AMC has a positive beta, so has moved **with** the markets, at least since January.

GME however has moved **against** the market, with a raw beta as astounding as -30’s at some points.

GME alone is your hedge, but it’s also a great fucking stock to be long on with astounding potential.

What’s that saying…. **Buy the hype, sell the news.**

GME is all hype baby!🚀"
2021-06-28 19:50:30,wallstreetbets,I don’t know why every one keeps saying AMC is positive beta. Fidelity has it at  negative 3.61?
2021-06-28 18:56:46,wallstreetbets,Yes sir negative beta on GME. Also maybe market crash through derivatives market…just need a catalyst of some sort for suits to pull out maybe the foreclosure covid benefits ending the end of July

2. you only assumed the past 2 weeks as a performance indicator!!?"

But all the essential elements of the naked short are still there. Fake shares getting juggled from one naked call that gets exercised, Failed to Deliver, and settled by doing more naked calls to cover the last one.  
Like check kiting, except shares instead of money, and naked calls instead of bad checks, and T+21 instead of check clearing times."

I think GME/AMC are counterintuitive stocks to help diversify a portfolio. 

I sold most of AMC shares when it after the peak at 70. I recently brought back in when I noticed the price remaining stable. 

I don't foresee a market crash any time soon. If it does happen, it will because GME/AMC finally pop. That is, if, they ever pop. I honestly believe they will trade sideways until 2022."

2021-06-28 19:47:34,wallstreetbets,"AMC has not until recently. Plus the fact the CEO of AMC sold a ton of shares straight to a hedge fund, citadel and Susq are long on it, and theres over half a billion shares in float (that gets traded almost daily). 

By comparison GME hasnt traded more than half its float in a single day single… February?"
2021-06-28 17:41:08,wallstreetbets,Done. All in.
2021-06-28 19:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Why the fuck would anyone who has more than 3 fucking braincells to rub together ever buy AMC?

sounds like stiff competition. especially from
OF. hoohoo."
2021-06-28 16:13:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it helps. The coaching aspect is, as you outlined, the part where all the weird stuff comes from, and makes the company seem like a bullshit MLM if you aren't familiar with them, and the fact that they do sell legitimately popular workouts and related products."
2021-06-28 17:00:50,wallstreetbets,I love beachbody workouts especially 80 day obsession. I don’t understand the coach aspect either I think it’s to add accountability and they get a small percentage of any sales they make in the form of early release workouts or the nutritional supplements. Have never heard that story about the coach but anyone can become one so it’s not surprising. The super trainers would be the ones that would have an impact on the company if they did something like that.
2021-06-28 19:08:02,wallstreetbets,Ehh MLM doesn’t appeal to me with this company. Rather buy more SOFI or BARK.
2021-06-28 17:11:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's a total dark pattern scam where you get signed up for a subscription when you just wanted some DVDs. I'm sure they haven't changed their practices. Then there's their Shakeology MLM that only fooled some of my dumbest cousins on FB for a short while. Their $1300 exercise bike is just a rebranded Peloton knockoff that you can get on Amazon for $300. Their content is stale compared to Peloton and Aaptiv and Tony Horton isn't getting any younger (even though he looks like he hasn't aged a day). They did get me 8-pack abs though, so I guess I can't hate on them too much."
2021-06-28 16:12:37,wallstreetbets,Peloton has actual workout instructors to promote their products. I’m talking about the Beachbody coaching network which is an mlm. These are the folks really promoting beach body.

“We see a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval). Pressure from early investors taking profits (and short-selling ahead of the lock-up expiration) are likely to weigh on the stock in the near term. However, we expect SOFI's bank charter approval process to conclude before year-end (adding >25% upside to our EBITDA estimates). Net/net, our base-case PT of $30 and downside case of $17 reflects asymmetrical risk/reward to the upside."

All in all a damned fine day and June has realised gainz of 68 777.54 so far. Mmm luvverly.

Went back into PSFE though and now bagholding 10k at 12.52. Bit worried as I know this thing could go pear at any moment...also reopened a short position on MVIS, -3300 at 17.91 (for a time my broker, Tiger, had no MVIS available to short).

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

They might not be able to turn the deal around and secure it themselves, but they are definitely making a good play by highlighting that the 8 billion dollars allocated for the task ended up going to a company that seems to have been barely vetted.  Said company does not focus on electric vehicles, but rather converting engines (which is not the end goal, our fleet is ancient and dilapidated).  Said company also stated themselves recently that they don’t have the designs, the technology, or the expertise to even accomplish the goal of an electric fleet."

2021-06-28 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm a long term WISH investor too. First bought in around 28 and have been buying down ever sense. Average share price is now 13.15 and I have 12,000 of them. I have no idea how you're exiting your position when we took that beating for months and now have this much momentum with a ton of positively around the brand going forward. I understand the sentiment with the EU but as expressed on this page, some of your logic is flawed and WISH has a global marketplace that just received an unparalleled marketing injection due to WSB. Just seems off to exit when clearly it's going up and you had an above average change of at least breaking even. Hope the best for you though! 👊🏻"
2021-06-28 16:33:00,wallstreetbets,So you’re going to sell for a loss now that it’s getting all this attention?
2021-06-28 19:14:47,wallstreetbets,WISH to $20 tomorrow confirmed fellas
2021-06-28 16:49:08,wallstreetbets,I just went in today :my position 300 shares- average price 14.30
2021-06-28 16:31:12,wallstreetbets,You’re off the team
2021-06-28 16:44:32,wallstreetbets,Watch it moon tomorrow.
2021-06-28 16:38:46,wallstreetbets,"One of the main predictions is factually incorrect.Depending on Member States of the EU,there are varying level of VAT rates from as low as 0% to 27%,Idk where the 21% comes from…Payment of this would certainly increase prices on the platform but this would equally impact competitors,both internationals and locals,as there are not many locally produced similar goods,even the local webshops buy from China mostly.This would definitely not put Wish into any disadvantage."

2021-06-28 16:36:08,wallstreetbets,"As regards product safety issues in Europe I would like to say that this is a general problem from all online platforms and market places, including Amazon, eBay etc. and not to forget Alibaba and it’s AliExpress which is shipping 100% from China. All these businesses are to big extent connecting Chinese vendors to EU consumers (just check Amazon marketplace for example and you will notice how much Chinese products are sold) Thus not Wish specific. Also, the same accounts for new VAT import rules. It affects all e-commerce businesses trading goods produced from outside Europe into the EU. Not Wish specific. It is true that Amazon shifted quite a portion of its retail model to local suppliers, and Wish is strengthening local suppliers networks as well, also with recent partnership with the French market place platform linking 300k vendors. Just saying, that situation is not as bleak as described here. I would assume that Wish will work / already works on localisation of suppliers also within the US market.."
2021-06-28 16:47:15,wallstreetbets,All this man had to do was post positions. LOL
2021-06-28 16:10:44,wallstreetbets,"Seems pretty balanced to me and it appears people don't like to hear something which goes against their hopes. All very good reasons, I'll be holding a little longer. good luck."

I was expecting it to make significant gains once it hit $15. I'm still holding though"

2021-06-28 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Understand why you closed your position in wish .... (By your post breakdown)

It's a personal risk ratio .....

Seeing the losses down in the 7s must have been difficult to endure.

Though I believe that we will see the 20's by July end ..

Good luck with your next investment"
2021-06-28 15:57:01,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares that you sold
2021-06-28 16:15:35,wallstreetbets,"If you think Amazon doesn’t get their stuff from China too, then idk what to tell ya.  If $WISH fails from the postal agreement, so will Amazon.  But we will see how it plays out.  Anything can happen. Hopefully it all works out.   

I think Wish has a bright future.  As they grow, marketing expenses will drop drastically.   I only found out abt Wish through Reddit, downloaded the app and bought some stuff.  Waiting to see how the quality is before I make more purchases.  A pump and dump is possible in the short term, but in the long run, I think this has great potential to compete with Amazon."
2021-06-28 16:59:37,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-06-28 16:11:41,wallstreetbets,"I definitely agree with OP. The institutional shares is 48.68%(source: fintel) or 68.48%(source: nasdaq). We can safely assume that the institutional shares is around 50%. If the stock rises, they will start selling off some of their position to get profit.

$WISH is a long term investment. Fundamentals are great(they have shit ton of money), but they can't go to the moon short term. Whereas for AMC has a very low institutional share percentage of around 12%(source: fidelity). Not saying it is a bad stock, it's just not a stock for the short term.

*Not a financial advice.*"

I can't actually see anything special or even good about what they are doing except that the app acts like its Amazon but with microtransactions (I kid but the app is super gamified)."
2021-06-28 16:32:58,wallstreetbets,Is this where come to tell everyone when we sell?
2021-06-28 16:10:28,wallstreetbets,POSISTIONS?
2021-06-28 17:23:15,wallstreetbets,I’m confused are we pumping or dumping?
2021-06-28 17:35:19,wallstreetbets,I did the same on the forbidden stock. Holding bags too long was making me getting out when i had a chanse. If its not fun its not fun.

2021-06-28 19:53:30,wallstreetbets,This sub has become teenagers complaining and alienating people who chose to do whatever the fuck they want with their own money
2021-06-28 17:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Good post OP! If there were more posts like this people would MAKE MONEY. Gotta understand the whole story, not just your favorite parts."
2021-06-28 19:21:41,wallstreetbets,Investing in a Chinese Amazon just seems really dumb!

Proof of sale would suffice."

2021-06-28 16:44:09,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down a long way, only took a minor loss, however, with current market conditions its more like a game of roulette , regarding the short term movements, I personally don’t like casino type of trading , nobody can really say if it will go up or down short term, the stock is moving regardless of company related news and regardless of macro economics, with this post I’m just pointing out some mid to long term risks that weigh on the stock from my personal vision, again I could be wrong, or context logic could address the issues and rocket higher. Make u’re own assessment and decision."

2021-06-28 19:51:05,wallstreetbets,When it moons half of the sub won’t sell and it’ll go back to normal like with RKT. Gme/AMC are the only plays which have continued to reach new heights
2021-06-28 16:52:47,wallstreetbets,How do u do that ?
2021-06-28 16:16:05,wallstreetbets,How do I add proof to this post? I’m not an expert with Reddit.
2021-06-28 16:14:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m just making an argument, a discussion, I could be wrong, in the end u have to follow u’re own vision, if context makes the right moves , they could become huge, however they currently sit on some massive risks , risks im currently not willing to take. This forum is to talk and discuss to each other positive and negatives , not only has to be pump and dump narratives. looking at u’re aggressive and defensive posting I know for a fact u wil sell way before 69 if wish would really keep going up short term. U’re to invested emotionally"
2021-06-28 18:07:55,wallstreetbets,Same here. Was in at 9.55 them more at 10.52 and a third time at 11.16. And one last purchase at 13.9. That’s 4 separate purchases in 2 different trading accounts.  Had limit sells at 15$ and 18$. Canceled both 6/25. Holding till 20+.
2021-06-28 17:32:06,wallstreetbets,"Karl lemme ask you something. Did you do any 1.3 million dollar trades today? OP did. Glad that dude’s posting.

2021-06-28 16:34:58,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t knew WSB was only for meme investors ? as I told u, I was an early investor in wish, before WSB attention, due to it all of the sudden catching the attention of WSB I checked it out. I have no idea how the meme plays eventually play out, I don’t have any prediction about that, however I’m just making a discussion , stating some points about the fundamental
Risks hanging around the company, making people thinks twice before adding positions at current SP, to be vigilant and know all facts before taking action."

2021-06-28 16:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Hm. Yeah. Thats what everyone does. They promote the stocks they invest in. Most people don't say anything when they sell because they want to be able to do it again. Typically people who try to pump things. This guy was probably a value investor and yall shook up his investment.

Edit: spelling"

2021-06-28 16:18:15,wallstreetbets,It’s called pump and dump

2021-06-28 17:24:59,wallstreetbets,"I did the entire ride, was a lot of manipulation going on with this stock, Reddit saved this stock, brought it back to fair values. Even tough I currently think 12-14USD is a correct price for context logic, I don’t trust the pump and dump that happens with most meme stocks, I doubt that many of the self proclaimed diamond hand investors will really be long term holders, they are new often young and impatient investors , could create a possible sell off regardless of even company related news , add the listed risks to the equation for professional investors and I sadly from my perspective don’t see the short term upside outweigh the potential crash."
2021-06-28 16:30:06,wallstreetbets,"But it's fine when everyone posts that they bought?

2021-06-28 16:27:52,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is a distributor.

Unless you're talking about Amazon Basics... Amazon has no real product line. They're like Kirkland Signature for Costco."
2021-06-28 17:35:45,wallstreetbets,"I also noticed the same, they have a for the eye pleasing app, and at first glance cheap deals, but never ends up being really interesting when continuing to purchase, expensive shipping costs, counterfeit products , sometimes absurdly expensive products , most of the times the exact same product can be found cheaper on other platforms. Have to be said it’s a growth company, they could improve on this, but like I stated, looks like they still have a lot to prove. It also depends from where u are using the wish shopping app, certain areas are better then others."

2. edit post and upload screenshot."
2021-06-28 16:24:04,wallstreetbets,"I think posting proof would go a long way to ameliorating people. If you edit the post there is an option to attach a photo. If you've got a screenshot showing the receipts that would be best. Make sure you blur out any personal details like account numbers or your name.

I'm not sure proof or ban is expressly necessary, but I would encourage you to do that since it will put people's minds at ease."

2021-06-28 16:32:16,wallstreetbets,Did that with my ex girlfriend 😂
2021-06-28 17:37:20,wallstreetbets,"I got caught up at this price range when it was going down 🥺
Managed to average down  and caught a few at the bottom.

So it's made me good profit 

I'm going to try and trade in and out ...
But who knows if that's the right strategy"
2021-06-28 17:50:37,wallstreetbets,"Amazon sells AWS services, ads, and kindles/other electronics.

On top of that they own other businesses like publishing and prime video. 

Wish or GME are not going to magically become Amazon. It takes a lot of work, talented people, and systems to build an Amazon, and odds are against GME or Wish, especially since recent history suggests both are garbage bins.

I’d rather bet on a company like Twilio or Shopify building off their success and proven management/human capital to build the next Google.

Hell even Williams and Sonoma is blowing both out of the water in E-commerce.

If you trade GME or Wish because of momentum and sentiment, or GME for the underlying short positions, then fine. I have some GME myself.

But they are both really poor companies that are extreme odds to actually dent Amazon. I don’t like Amazon and welcome more competition, but J wouldn’t bet much money on Wish being that. 

They would be better off starting with small niches first the way WS has (high quality, curated hardware and kitchen stuff) than going against Amazon as an everything shop.

Amazon started with books, diapers (after an acquisition), CDs, and other categories, hired expert merchants, and slowly built the logistics, operations, project management, and underlying IT systems that support its shop now."
2021-06-28 17:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Almost seems like its predatory don't it?  
A bit of a scam even."

2021-06-28 17:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro. No need to blast me with knowledge and facts. Lol.

I do agree that Wish is not Amazon, but all those items you listed like AWS and ads are not China based. That's all I'm getting at. The Kindle is something I definitely didn't think about, along with their entire smart electronic line, but i took your comment as they get all their stuff from China. Amazon's biggest money maker currently is the e-marketplace platform. 

Either way. We're on the same page."
2021-06-28 17:57:57,wallstreetbets,"Exactly , it’s due to the sellers, there can be possible scammers using the platform, context logic doesn’t scan all of its sellers, there are some algorithms and detection programs in play however it currently fails addressing a lot of the counterfeit and product quality complaints.

A lot of the Chinese merchants put there product on Alibaba as main e-commerce platform but then they also put it on other platforms including wish , where then they put an higher price or end up with a higher price after taking into account the product boost costs that are quite considerable on the wish shopping app."

2021-06-28 17:39:43,wallstreetbets,I think WSB MODS should create a Supreme Court. Whenever we have a disagreement with a MOD about something we have the ability to go before a WSB court where 9 MOD justices decided on our case and makes a determination on whether to ban or not

2021-06-28 16:55:21,wallstreetbets,"OK, here's what I would recommend. If you don't have access to desktop, make an Imgur album with the proof and post it to your profile. Then you can edit the link to the post into your submission here. It's kinda roundabout but we're having trouble with Imgur at the moment so there's a chance the post will get removed if you add the link directly.

And in case anyone is wondering, these are the same instructions I give everyone who needs/wants to include images in their post and can't just add them directly."

2021-06-28 19:19:08,wallstreetbets,"WKHS is the second most I’ve bet on a single stock, I started buying at $13 two weeks ago and I was one of the few that believed in it at first but I’m really glad more apes are seeing it now. I think this stock will crush all the short squeezes in performance."
2021-06-28 19:23:19,wallstreetbets,Nice dd. WKHS had a really strong showing today. I like that its not moving parabolic yet. These gains will sustain and create an epic squeeze. Love that it’s both a meme stock and has great potential to claim a decent piece of the future economy. I’m all in with 11262 shares @ 16.65 and I’ve held it down to 12.5 and over 18 twice. This is how we win.
2021-06-28 19:34:42,wallstreetbets,1000 shares at $15.48 🚀🐎 WKHS

2021-06-28 16:36:32,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! This is a well done dd.
Very healthy volume today. Been sitting on wkhs shares for about a week and definatley gunna buy more. I recommend new people looking to invest please buy about 30 minutes after the market opens tomorrow. Shorts ladder attack and price drops for a short amount of time. You can see it on the charts."
2021-06-28 16:58:04,wallstreetbets,Wkhs finally getting the attention it has deserved
2021-06-28 19:54:40,wallstreetbets,I like this one
2021-06-28 16:34:41,wallstreetbets,Keep up voting while on vacation this week and next. Summer squeeze time and Apes are good at making lemonade. 🦍🚀
2021-06-28 17:58:20,wallstreetbets,"Wow, that filing is damning! I suspected it was bad, but not ""Oshkosh literally doesn't have manufacturing in place and the concept doesn't match the actual vehicle they proposed at all..."""
2021-06-28 18:55:06,wallstreetbets,"i am so glad that the management at Workhorse group WKHS, Has decided to challenge the contract award to OSK I believe every including myself that there was something wrong with that decision and that mysterious late night stock trade in OSK is probably where the answer lies...!

It is truly amazing how these political hacks spend our tax payer dollars and then we are told the post office is in tremendous debt and cant compete with the private sector... When the answer is probably that the incompetent people who are put in charge and make decisions make those decisions only to enrich themselves while all of the taxpayers pay for their riches...! This must stop... NOW...!"
2021-06-28 16:32:59,wallstreetbets,Nice DD $WKHS to the moon!
2021-06-28 19:09:49,wallstreetbets,"May the horse be with you.

WKHS"
2021-06-28 16:49:41,wallstreetbets,Wkhs to the moon.. Take a look at SOFI also.. Short float is higher than WKHS… at 46%… Let’s get both to the moon..
2021-06-28 19:54:44,wallstreetbets,The four horsemen rise this week. Time to go full retard. Not financial advice
2021-06-28 18:52:43,wallstreetbets,I like this fraud once again “sniffs the air” smells like money.
2021-06-28 17:45:25,wallstreetbets,That’s a heavy accusation
2021-06-28 19:42:40,wallstreetbets,"A few highlights from the lawsuit:

- USPS claimed a “parking brake failure” was a serious reason for rejection. But it was actually caused by a USPS driver leaving the vehicle while still in Drive! Try that with your car next time you’re at a stoplight. 

- Oshkosh can’t even get its photoshop imaginary NGDV right. The doors as shown couldn’t slide past each other. (Workhorse has a protruding exterior track.) 

- USPS tries to claim OSK has a lower overall cost. But whoops, it forgot to factor in the extra $6 Billion DeJoy said he’d need to go EV."
2021-06-28 19:10:58,wallstreetbets,"I think it's fair to point out here that this comparison to GME and AMC is a fair one. The GME run up in January and the AMC run up recently were not due to short squeezes but gamma squeezes.

WKHS doesn't have all strikes expiring ITM for 3 weeks in a row, there's no chance so don't expect what happened to GME and AMC to be realistic. Could things get intense and a bullish reversal triggers a true short squeeze, yes but that would take a massive catalyst and buying pressure which there isn't unless they win their injunctions and receive lots of media attention as well."
2021-06-28 19:57:48,wallstreetbets,"This is incredibly common in government contracting. The loser always sues, claiming the government did something unfair or illegal. It usually doesn't work."
2021-06-28 17:31:32,wallstreetbets,The contract is staying with osk and microvast where it belongs
2021-06-28 19:05:07,wallstreetbets,"Do you know why WKHS is heavily Shorted? Because SPACs are the first to get drained in a bearish market. When AMC/GME go boom, the SPACs fall hard and fast. 
You're obviously a hedgecuck....gtfo"
2021-06-28 16:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Let me get this straight... WKHS is suing the government because they lost a contract they had no business winning in the first place, and you think that's bullish?

This is some real smoothbrain DD right here."
2021-06-28 19:39:35,wallstreetbets,Some hedge just wrote this article to play us;)
2021-06-28 18:06:07,wallstreetbets,buy more WKHS
2021-06-28 15:52:23,wallstreetbets,It’s literally included in my post…

2021-06-28 18:19:41,wallstreetbets,On a technical level we've been seeing all kinds of bullish signs lately. Can't wait to see where wkhs goes this week.
2021-06-28 16:46:13,wallstreetbets,They been deleting WKHS post heavily for the past week.  Dunno whats up with that but seems odd given the potential.
2021-06-28 18:01:58,wallstreetbets,Our time will come 🚀🚀🚀🦄🦄🚀🦄
2021-06-28 18:25:22,wallstreetbets,This is exactly my move for tomorrow - dump UWMC for a small loss and roll it into WKHS 🐎
2021-06-28 17:08:37,wallstreetbets,"WKHS is just fueling up right now, I think soon it will really lift off."
2021-06-28 16:37:27,wallstreetbets,Let's melt that glacier 🔥
2021-06-28 19:01:24,wallstreetbets,"You could tell the shorts were trying all day to keep price down, volume is picking up and crushing the shorts.  When this pops it's going to soar!"
2021-06-28 18:32:34,wallstreetbets,I almost feel bad for them.
2021-06-28 16:13:10,wallstreetbets,"Diamond hooves lol.

2021-06-28 19:53:56,wallstreetbets,Horseshit brown and you?
2021-06-28 17:12:25,wallstreetbets,Dude no one should be pumping spacs that haven't fully de-spacd. Chamath is scamming all you with clov and sofi ... Warrants will get called and dilute everyone guess who will have the bags?
2021-06-28 18:51:53,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing your bags are in THCB. Sorry to hear that🤣
2021-06-28 18:16:57,wallstreetbets,Microvast has ties with the CCP and you 100% know this. Shill.
2021-06-28 19:17:22,wallstreetbets,🐻🌈
2021-06-28 19:35:41,wallstreetbets,WKHS is not a spac you fuck
2021-06-28 18:18:10,wallstreetbets,Mr. 1 post.
2021-06-28 16:49:54,wallstreetbets,"WKHS builds EV deilvery trucks which is the perfect fit for the USPS needs.  They got done dirty but it's not over yet.   The green push and with EV the future of transportation it makes the Oshkosh deal even more suspicious.

""Oshkosh won the award in February, which could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. And while it says some of the mail trucks it builds may be electric when they hit the road in 2023, neither the company nor the USPS has offered concrete details about how many — or how a defense contractor with no history of making EVs plans to provide them to the largest federal fleet.""

Nothing funny going on with that deal, lol"
2021-06-28 17:10:34,wallstreetbets,Do you know how to read? Sounds like your DD is weak af especially if it only goes as far as this post
2021-06-28 19:44:29,wallstreetbets,The only one being played is YOU my friend 🐎
2021-06-28 17:12:19,wallstreetbets,"It’s automated.

I’ll need you to edit this post and remove all “war” and “army” related words."
2021-06-28 17:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Its visualmod, is this your first time here or something?"
2021-06-28 17:08:34,wallstreetbets,I know it seems a little fishy... I wonder where their bags are 🤣
2021-06-28 19:01:59,wallstreetbets,Its been more than a week I argued with zjz about the deleted posts and instead of addressing it he blamed the spam filter...for removing a yolo post....even tho they're the ones that made the spam filter....
2021-06-28 19:53:01,wallstreetbets,Same story. By wkhs after dump others.. 🚀🚀
2021-06-28 18:54:01,wallstreetbets,Don't feel bad for them they think they are smarter than us and put pride before common sense if they use their brain they will know it is time to cover
2021-06-28 19:03:13,wallstreetbets,Let me know when workhorse gets the contract
2021-06-28 18:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Don't cry when the contract remains with oshkosh lol

Workhose struggles to produce a handful of trucks a year and you think they're capable of manufacturing hundreds if not thousands?"
2021-06-28 18:12:14,wallstreetbets,Lol that bitch don’t know shit! Lol
2021-06-28 17:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Just edited all of the ""war"" and ""army"" words"
2021-06-28 19:05:00,wallstreetbets,Where your wrong is thinking they need that contract to succeed
2021-06-28 18:54:37,wallstreetbets,Hmmmm I wonder what 6 Billion in capital can accomplish???
2021-06-28 19:19:16,wallstreetbets,The post revolves around it though lol
2021-06-28 19:01:35,wallstreetbets,Why go with a company that needs to use funds to improve their manufacturing capabilities when you have one that already has the resources to complete the order
2021-06-28 19:04:07,wallstreetbets,Why go with a company that didn't provide a fucking EV? Let alone an actual model for production!?! HAHAHAHA

2021-06-28 15:56:17,wallstreetbets,YTD: Down 50% here. 🍻
2021-06-28 19:26:14,wallstreetbets,"Op stfu, it’s been a bloodbath most of the year"
2021-06-28 18:01:29,wallstreetbets,CLF
2021-06-28 19:47:04,wallstreetbets,"I love this bear thread but you are right to be concerned. PCE data that came out last Friday saw an increase in PCE which is the data that the fed looks at to determine how much inflation is in the economy. This very well proves that the bottlenecks are still here and may go to prove inflation isn’t transitory. CPI data comes out 7/13 and I don’t think it’ll be any better than previous months. Lock down restrictions, mask mandates and social distancing going away means the spread of the new covid variant can run rampant while there is still 50% of Americans that are not vaccinated. I’m normally bullish on markets and have always been a long term investor but I also look at data to determine my positions. People lie but data doesn’t. It’s not looking very good so I suspect those red days will be coming sooner rather than later."
2021-06-28 16:11:19,wallstreetbets,Wait till Friday.
2021-06-28 16:16:04,wallstreetbets,"Here's some bad news for you. The US is struggling to get past a 50% vaccination rate. The Delta variant is twice as deadly and spreading twice as fast, as being reported by the UK and Israel. We're fully opened and nearly everyone quit wearing a mask. The Lambda variant in South America could be as deadly as Delta but not enough information exists on Lambda to know if it is. 

>The researchers found substantial reductions in the ability of the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to inactivate the Delta variant, although the viruses weren't broadly able to escape neutralization.

I think there is a chance we go back to restrictions without a shutdown"
2021-06-28 15:58:10,wallstreetbets,Everyone’s up lately. Most stocks are doing well right now.
2021-06-28 16:06:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don't even know where to put money right now. Hands-off, save for the next dip."
2021-06-28 15:59:38,wallstreetbets,"things don't have to be red to go up, as you've just noticed"
2021-06-28 16:21:34,wallstreetbets,"I saw there were small cap indexes that were down today, so maybe that's something to look at if you must buy something down. Or just get rich watching everything keep going up forever."
2021-06-28 16:38:19,wallstreetbets,I love options too!
2021-06-28 19:09:35,wallstreetbets,Correct. That’s why we’re seeing a rotation back into tech. Reopening plays are over.
2021-06-28 17:11:36,wallstreetbets,COVID doesn’t exist
2021-06-28 18:01:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this has been my thought as well. I’m hoping for a pretty big market correction across the board but we might not see it for another year or more. The US economic growth and consumer spending at the moment is off the charts with no signs of slowing down in the short term. I originally thought the bubble would burst sometime between 12-18 months after the corona lockdown dip. 

Now I’m like… it might be more like 24 months or longer… so do I just enter some positions now because things might some how keep going up out of control as we go into earnings season."
2021-06-28 19:09:37,wallstreetbets,"“Covid doesn’t exist” 
This coming from the person who says cancer exists."
2021-06-28 17:19:11,wallstreetbets,My faith in humanity doesn't exist

Fintel is showing 105% short volume ratio today which  isn’t possible - please correct if I am wrong? 

What are you showing for SOFI FLOAT? 

Thanks for your reply - I am also long SOFI., just trying to get accurate info!"
2021-06-28 18:51:57,wallstreetbets,"When looking at different sites there never seems to be a common short % among them. I believe this is due to the difficulty in actually determining the exact amount of shorted shares as a result of naked shorting and dark pools. It’s always good to check multiple sources to get a ballpark idea in my opinion.

It actually is possible to exceed 100% of daily volume or the entire float itself. This is due to Naked Short Selling. Judging by the price action towards the end of the day I’d say its guaranteed that over 100% was shorted today. I’m almost positive those large spikes at the end were short sellers covering.

Finviz shows a float of 60.57 million. If 46% of that is short that would be around 28.28 million  shares that are being shorted. 

I too am long SOFI"

2021-06-28 14:57:41,wallstreetbets,U must really love Baba
2021-06-28 15:12:43,wallstreetbets,I’m in BIDU but they move together. God speed!
2021-06-28 15:57:16,wallstreetbets,"He bought calls, gambling that the price of BABA will reach $240 (strike price) by July 2nd. 
He paid $84 for each contract (100x$.84; each contract is the option to buy 100 shares at the $240 strike price)
Currently his contracts are worth $114 each. He has 2154 contracts so he’s gained an unrealized profit of $64,968.95"
2021-06-28 14:54:18,wallstreetbets,It's in the shot
2021-06-28 14:56:24,wallstreetbets,$240 and 7/2 lol it’s right there
2021-06-28 14:53:51,wallstreetbets,At that price I would guess two months out tops
2021-06-28 16:03:19,wallstreetbets,"What happens if it doesn't reach that amount?? And thank you for taking the time to explain, I wish I had an award to give you"
2021-06-28 16:12:14,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t necessarily have to reach that amount. He can sell those contracts anytime before the expiry. If the stock looks strong like it’s heading to that price or beyond he can sell for a profit. Some factors will determine how much profit such as volatility and time to expiry, you’ll hear the term decay and mention of the Greeks. 

So say on 7/2 the stock goes to 240.84 then he would have been better off selling today. 

If by 7/2 end of trading day the stock doesn’t reach the strike price they expire worthless. He loses his initial bet of $84 per contract x 2154 = $180,936 plus the commission."

2021-06-28 17:38:20,wallstreetbets,"WTF are you going on about?  His credit was $3,250 for starters, not $3,000.  He isn't risking $16,500 since he purchased the 12.5 puts for insurance and received a credit of $3,250 for selling the 13.0 puts.  His max loss occurs if the stock drops to $12.5 and the puts he bought expire worthless while the 13.0 puts he sold are ITM.  He then loses (13.0-12.5)(100)(325) = $16,250; however, he received the $3,250 credit for selling the 13.0 puts originally so the max loss is $16,250-$3,250= $13,000.  The only thing more retarded than your math is his trade, risking $13,000 for $3,250 on a meme stock."
2021-06-28 14:58:36,wallstreetbets, I will refer to you for any further ? I have on options trading. But only if you double up your profanity.

2021-06-28 15:11:12,wallstreetbets,The way I see it is lower risk of losing money but a possibility of losing more money in return.

2021-06-28 15:30:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe on some megacap but you're doing it on a meme stock that can die to $7 in about 15 minutes so you aren't really being safer you're just risking more for less
2021-06-28 17:04:52,wallstreetbets,Wish ain’t going below 10 for a long time imo

This is a 100% distraction post."
2021-06-28 16:07:41,wallstreetbets,You can say that about any online company.  All the shit from amazon also comes from china
2021-06-28 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,"I’m long eBay. My understanding is that it’s a good bet short term nonetheless. It’s undervalued based on the PE, sitting on a pile of cash and they just changed CEO. And as OP mentioned, stocks doubled since last year. Now it’s hard to have faith when competitors are Amazon and all the new trendy peer to peer platforms like stockx, Etsy, etc. If by any chance eBay was able to maintain growth post pandemic, people would jump on board en masse."

2021-06-28 15:18:41,wallstreetbets,Had a kitchen fire in my apartment a few years back. The firemen busted up all my furniture. Bought a LazyBoy recliner and haven’t look back. Great angle when a prostitute blows you too.

2021-06-28 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm also new to WSB. I poked around in 2020, and got more interested after the GME boom.  As a WSB rookie... why the holy hotfuck are ALL the DD posts from people who have joined WSB in the last six months?  Where are all the OGs? Did they leave?  I'm 100% a bandwagon jumper, and I'd be embarrassed to try and post my ""hot stock"" recommendation like all these posers.  But all these late arrivals are trying to jump right into the deep end with, ""What's up fellow degen retard apes!"" and ""get those tendies from your wife's boyfriend.""  Fuck off and go back to your well balanced portfolios.  I know you've got it, because I've got it too."
2021-06-28 17:04:49,wallstreetbets,My $40 calls for July 16 is still profitable now. I am hoping it goes back up in a few days. $0.42 drop is pretty massive since the DTE is so small. 😔
2021-06-28 16:23:11,wallstreetbets,"This whole LZB thing is real suspect.

It has a relatively low market cap, super low trading volume, and it’s option liquidity is non-existent. 

This is *screaming* PnD."

2021-06-28 16:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Just throwing this out there as a former furniture salesman - LZB does not use high quality materials, does not have top of the line designs, and definitely isn't built to last a lifetime."
2021-06-28 16:28:11,wallstreetbets,11 awards and 21 comments in 1hr? Sketch
2021-06-28 17:35:23,wallstreetbets,"Hmm DD with all positives and no negatives. No thanks Mr. Shill, I will look elsewhere.

Edit: Checked his account, has two DDs of which both are shill posts. Needs the ban hammer, personally"
2021-06-28 16:36:25,wallstreetbets,I sale LZB products.  They are backordered an average of 6 months now.  I'm not touching this stock. I may be retarded but I'm not stupid.  I intentionally push clients away from anything LZB because of the amount of cancelations I have had.
2021-06-28 17:32:54,wallstreetbets,"TA on this looks like crap. It broke out of an upward channel and is just starting to make lower lows. Multiple high volume rejections out of the 40s. Short term it's bouncing on horizontal support, so it's easy to say get in with a stop loss just below 35 and aim for 42. Medium term it looks really toppy though. I could see it easily breaking downward to 30 and staying there for a while.

The fundamentals look pretty average too. Nothing to write home about. EPS is low, p/e is a little higher than sector average, underlying is good. Blah. Count me out."
2021-06-28 18:21:05,wallstreetbets,"This reeks of Pump and Dump. Never seen DD on a small market cap, not heavily shorted stock receive this many awards this quickly. This ones a no for me dawg."
2021-06-28 17:27:44,wallstreetbets,"Shit is overpriced and not particularly good quality, imma pass on this one."
2021-06-28 17:19:23,wallstreetbets,Store near me is closing and costco is selling more massage chairs than ever. Buy puts.
2021-06-28 15:54:37,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-28 17:18:42,wallstreetbets,Shit. A dying chain? That’s WSB speciality! I’m sold!
2021-06-28 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,Last time I went in there I learned what quality furniture is.  I dont believe they are going anywhere. The quality is there and their clientele is willing to pay a premium so slightly higher prices dont seem like a problem to me. I dont see the 45 strike hitting on july 16th though. Itm for july16th seems the way to go.
2021-06-28 16:21:31,wallstreetbets,"Ya, but at the price of them they only need to sell 10 or so a month to be in the green lol!"
2021-06-28 18:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Theta bout to eat your lunch these next two weeks, RIP"
2021-06-28 18:10:57,wallstreetbets,"I dont see the pump and dump when this stock has consistently been in the 40 range and was well below that last week when getting into the play was at it's best. If I wasnt in already I would have been in today on the dip. This may not look as good tomorrow for an entry if ah numbers hold up.
Edit: calling this a p&d is just retarded."
2021-06-28 18:16:22,wallstreetbets,"So are all tickers with low volume, cap, and liquidity pump attempts? Doesn’t that describe a lot of growth plays?"
2021-06-28 15:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, combined with a shit ton of other accounts pushing DDs on this same ticker. I'm more than a little skeptical."
2021-06-28 19:32:05,wallstreetbets,Americans love cheap garbage. Super bullish.
2021-06-28 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"Who does?

Are they all basically the same, just different models but same crap beneath?

Is there one brand that legitimately is better?"
2021-06-28 18:17:14,wallstreetbets,They have a backlog of orders and you won't buy lmao
2021-06-28 17:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Unusually high levels of demand, production ramps not fully addressing the backlog situation, and other factors outlined here lead me to the conclusion that there's an imbalance in the risk-to-reward profile of La-Z-Boy over the short term that doesn't favor new investors."
2021-06-28 16:27:28,wallstreetbets,"There was 1 salesman alone in the store, and when I cut him short on the hard-sell spiel for extended warranties I got the impression I had ruined his numbers"
2021-06-28 17:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Smith Brothers of Bern makes excellent furniture, Southern Motion makes superior reclining furniture compared to LZB (they were created by former execs at LZB). Best Chair Company makes a good recliner at a good price."
2021-06-28 16:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Month end, dudes about to loose his job if he can’t get that hard sell closed  out..

“What do you mean you don’t want triple stain protection on this new leather sofa”?  What if you spill pen ink on it or something?"
2021-06-28 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,This guy reclines
2021-06-28 17:26:32,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I'll keep those in mind for when the cats decide furniture is no longer fun to destroy.

Started a position last week"
2021-06-28 15:45:03,wallstreetbets,"(not financial advice)

AMD has the (provisional)deadline for the EU approval for the Xilinx deal coming up on June 30th (UK july 6th), and I would assume that the recent run up in price is related to the assumption that this approval goes through. 

The biggest hurdle to this acquisition is imo China, but if they allow it I would be amazed to see AMD under 100.  This approval  is expected roughly by the end of the year ish, so if you want to play AMD safely, leaps are the way to go (imo).

Position(s): shares, 07/16 105c (that I bought in April and are currently worthless, I didn't take into account the shorting of AMD for Xilinx share value post merger like an idiot), and 06/17/2022 110c"
2021-06-28 14:34:03,wallstreetbets,Bought some today too. Good luck ape.
2021-06-28 17:48:38,wallstreetbets,I picked up 115 shares at $87.02 this afternoon. I'm debating double that. I can't find a serious analyst in the last 3 months who thinks this will go down.
2021-06-28 14:32:54,wallstreetbets,Hmmm SMH is at ATH.  God speed
2021-06-28 16:29:31,wallstreetbets,"This is going to cash hard, I have $100 calls 7/16 lol"
2021-06-28 14:36:14,wallstreetbets,"ATH 99$ and flat for 1 year while NVDA recently breaking out. 

Not a risk-free trade but could be a juicy one"

2021-06-28 19:34:17,wallstreetbets,"There have been a lot of people getting upset for dumb reasons. Paw Patrol, was one of my kids favorite shows, has a police dog, which evidently means it’s racist. Recently, there was a pride day or gay character, so, that upset the other side of the political isle. I still think it’s a good company, not sure if the current stock price is a good buy though."

2021-06-28 14:02:51,wallstreetbets,Who else would FDIC possibly choose if not PLTR?
2021-06-28 18:25:07,wallstreetbets,I want to see RSI go beyond 100 for PLTR to prove a point that RSI means nothing.
2021-06-28 13:56:21,wallstreetbets,Are you selling cover calls in the mean time with your shares?
2021-06-28 19:33:20,wallstreetbets,Just bought 30 shares today
2021-06-28 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,But does a PR come out pre-market or after market? I'd wager after market
2021-06-28 14:18:04,wallstreetbets,I'm in 7k @27.40 let's go apes!
2021-06-28 17:15:48,wallstreetbets,That’s neat. Low odds though. I would like that if they win!!
2021-06-28 17:32:25,wallstreetbets,50k deep let's gooo
2021-06-28 14:01:22,wallstreetbets,"If they get this contract, my guess is higher."
2021-06-28 15:06:46,wallstreetbets,PLTR $30 end of century
2021-06-28 14:47:01,wallstreetbets,"Name checks out. 

Holding for a long while too, but not that long. Sadly by the time I understood the value here, the first moon mission had left. I’ve been onboard ever since, lowered my cost average, and don’t plan to sell my shares for at least 5 years minimum. My other plays are meant to get me to 10k shares here. 

Until then I’m just leveraged via leaps to stretch my money."
2021-06-28 14:01:02,wallstreetbets,"No promises, just speculation. 

The math just adds up that they would announce tomorrow. 1 year after the start of the competition. They are overdue to announce anyways haha."
2021-06-28 14:14:16,wallstreetbets,"The website link here shows there are multiple contenders. In all honesty, I expect them to choose more than one vendor as they are each proposing different solutions for different problems:

https://www.fdic.gov/fditech/rpp.html"
2021-06-28 13:58:20,wallstreetbets,"No, but I should be. I’m waiting for a very serious spike, which looks like it is coming. Then I’m going to sell my weeklies, and probably sell some short term covered calls after I think it starts to consolidate but there is still a High IV."
2021-06-28 16:49:59,wallstreetbets,"In theory, they may find out during the market hours because it’s the FDIC’s announcement. Or the fdic may announce at the beginning of the day before the conference has started. Who knows!? Haha"
2021-06-28 17:43:03,wallstreetbets,I call it an educated guess haha
2021-06-28 17:43:16,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!
2021-06-28 14:45:07,wallstreetbets,"why? I have weeklies already, but am debating buying more? Does pltr move typically when contracts are announced? I thought it usually didnt"
2021-06-28 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,Thx. When I have a look at the contenders I can hardly imagine that PLTR wouldn't get a part of the contract at least.
2021-06-28 15:01:28,wallstreetbets,Oh it always moves...just not up
2021-06-28 15:03:05,wallstreetbets,I know a fellow PLTR veteran when I see one.  Thanks for your service.

2021-06-28 16:55:29,wallstreetbets,Most likely not. Fatality footage does not usually get published. Also BASE jumping canopies deploy very fast although this was a pretty risky jump since he was closely approaching that ledge but he definitely cleared it. He is actually flying forward since he is tracking (flying his body at an angle). You can also see him reach for his handle at the end of the video.

2021-06-28 16:35:31,wallstreetbets,"So, 2016 I had this same realization. All the shit I wanted to do I could do now. The only thing I really sacrifice is FUTURE SECURITY I.E. retirement. 

So I decided who the fuck cares. If I'm 69 or 70 or 80 and can't afford to live I can just fucking die. Better then working slaving away doing bullshit I hate just so I can be comfortable and extend my life runway more when I'm old and decrepit.

So 2016 I thru hiked the AT. 2018 rode a bicycle from mexico to canada and hiked the CDT through Montana Wyoming and Colorado. 

2019 and 2020 I lived in a van and worked as a wildland firefighter.

Got lucky with some business ventures this year and now have enough saved to comfortably travel for a decade.

And that's what I'm gonna do. Hike the PCT starting July. Maybe hike it and or the CDT again next year. From there goto south america or SE Asia.

Without having to maintain a house car etc it's a really cheap way to live. 15k a year is a roomy budget. Way better then paying 30k+ a year just to maintain a shitty existence so you have the privilege of working and making someone else rich.

And if I run out of money in a decade I'll figure out how to make more. 

I don't see this as a risk at all. My family says save this money and work another 10-20 years THEN retire.

Fuck that. The bigger gamble is wasting life away on frivolous bullshit and putting off what you really want. Tomorrow is not guaranteed. 

And my gut says my earning potential will be exponentially higher if I go learn several more languages and do more crazy exciting adventures. At the end I could probably write a few books and live a very comfortable existence just giving a couple talks a few months a year."
2021-06-28 15:59:24,wallstreetbets,Because this is real life and I need to make money so I can eat

Visiting the penguins in the south pole costs around $70,000. I'd love to go see Mt Everest, not climb it but visit base camp. Seeing the polar bears up north is another expensive dream that comes to about $15,000. I'd love to see the mountains of [Patagonia](https://i.imgur.com/jRXsygp.jpg) some day. New Zealand i just want to wander around that country and get lost there. Same with Iceland. Activities especially travel is expensive. I've seen a fair share of nice things in my days so far but a shit load of money would check off a lot of bucket list items that would not normally be possible. Hopefully AMC takes off and I can cash in my 500 shares and experience life's most awesome adventures."

Depending on where you live, BASE is generally done illegally. They sneak gear inside backpacks that blend in, usually jump at odd hours, and coordinate ground crew to drive them away before rangers or police can show up. 

Most of the cost is beer for your ground crew and legal expenses if you get caught. This is mostly speaking for the US, anyways. Though there are some legal places in the US, namely Moab and a bridge in Idaho."

2021-06-28 16:47:24,wallstreetbets,"u can buy ocean going sailboat for 2000$, lets say u renew gear on it maybe 5000$, then u can travel all around the world with free wind, 10k$ is all u need for any most wild stuff u wanna do"
2021-06-28 14:55:52,wallstreetbets,You can visit the south pole?! Fucking poggers! How do you set that up?
2021-06-28 16:52:30,wallstreetbets,Another perspective is that you spend the rest of your life doing it

2021-06-28 18:24:36,wallstreetbets,Lmfao best comment I’ve ever read thank you for your service patron
2021-06-28 19:48:00,wallstreetbets,Maths!
2021-06-28 17:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Untrue. Firstly, it depends massively on body posture, a persons mass to air resistance ratio, amongst other things. 

Secondly, a reasonable amount of time to reach terminal velocity for a skydiver is 10 seconds, which equates to around 500m, or 1640ft. 

Not sure where you get the 100ft figure from, but it's not even close."
2021-06-28 17:18:12,wallstreetbets,"Not in that position, it takes around 1500’ of free fall to reach terminal velocity. 

Jumping in thinner air will get you there a little faster, but BASE jumping tends to put you way down low where the air is dense. 

Source: have been paid to jump out of airplanes. Wouldn’t recommend it."
2021-06-28 18:44:01,wallstreetbets,Aaaand there it is^^
2021-06-28 19:01:46,wallstreetbets,One more time.

2021-06-28 19:44:11,wallstreetbets,Thought this was r/roastme for a sec
2021-06-28 19:45:56,wallstreetbets,Dang.
2021-06-28 16:05:41,wallstreetbets,“Never opened”
2021-06-28 17:09:53,wallstreetbets,Beer is cheaper than av fuel.
2021-06-28 15:06:54,wallstreetbets,its called a yolo not holo
2021-06-28 16:38:11,wallstreetbets,"While that’s a lot cheaper than I expected it to be you need to consider: 

A. *Florida*

B. That’s not “throw around” money for everyone. Even if the people you’re talking with are on WSB"
2021-06-28 18:55:56,wallstreetbets,Actually not that bad. Considering it will o ly be me. Wife will not go for it. Lol
2021-06-28 16:44:44,wallstreetbets,Did he though?
2021-06-28 17:04:26,wallstreetbets,"How do you responsibly live out of a van and hike for most of the year with kids?

I am trying to figure this out for myself actually, kids already exist."
2021-06-28 18:26:01,wallstreetbets,I flipped gun parts and ammo. Prices at one point were 3-5x msrp.

2021-06-28 17:31:22,wallstreetbets,"That being said, this fella just burned up a solid 1200 of that 1640... definitely a WSB"
2021-06-28 18:17:35,wallstreetbets,I'm free fall qualified. It's sick. Would highly recommend it.
2021-06-28 16:08:40,wallstreetbets,Extensively laundered.
2021-06-28 16:41:45,wallstreetbets,"I live in Minnesota and have looked into it before, found places for about $130, just not interested in flying over trees and lakes haha.

But yeah that’s for sure not throw around money for a lot of folks, my parents paid for mine as a birthday gift, but the point is if you can save $10/week, that’s 3 months of that. 3 months is a fair bit of time but if it’s a bucket list type of thing it could be worth."
2021-06-28 18:57:20,wallstreetbets,"Fair warning, I used Groupon and got a good deal. If you want the low prices use a service like that and wait for a good deal, have fun bud :)"
2021-06-28 17:08:27,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I am not doing that but my friend just had a kid a year ago and he lives in a trailer (decent one, not a run down piece of  shit) in Tennessee. He is doing just fine but he runs a trucking business so he is much more mobile that way and can make money in more than one place."
2021-06-28 17:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Christchurch born and bred :P   


So I am a poor soul wandering around Morehouse Ave ;)"
2021-06-28 18:52:47,wallstreetbets,After closer examining I am glad he is okay
2021-06-28 16:44:12,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree it’d be worth for the thrill seekers with bucket lists. If any of my stocks pop off, you bet your ass I’m jumping out of a plane. 

But I’m gonna save that for tendy day, because I’m a pussy"
2021-06-28 18:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Yea but what about school?  Friends / play-dates for your kids, consistent food to cook healthy for your kids, doctor that knows your kid, etc.  Kinda need to be settled not moving around the country."
2021-06-28 18:54:05,wallstreetbets,I feel you bro. All my chump change it going in to the market. But will def jump from a plan for 100 bucks soon. That's not bad.

2021-06-28 14:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Been holding since $489...

Wish I bought some options then when it took that dip in March instead, but I can't complain about it's awesome growth!"
2021-06-28 18:45:48,wallstreetbets,Nvda keeps runnnnninggggggggg
2021-06-28 19:05:22,wallstreetbets,Post split it will most def cross 1000
2021-06-28 13:39:45,wallstreetbets,i wanna buy a couple but i feel like it’s too late idk
2021-06-28 16:15:23,wallstreetbets,Bro why not just be happy with 164k 🤣
2021-06-28 14:32:31,wallstreetbets,06/28/21 2:33 EST:  GET.OUT.NOW
2021-06-28 15:09:11,wallstreetbets,Man... I bought that dip right after earnings. FEELS FOOKING PUMPED.
2021-06-28 15:45:49,wallstreetbets,So you're looking forward to closing 4000 contracts right?
2021-06-28 18:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Damn, nice play."
2021-06-28 14:20:03,wallstreetbets,nah fck you amd all the way
2021-06-28 15:23:34,wallstreetbets,Nice trade ape..
2021-06-28 14:35:33,wallstreetbets,Five years ago my neighbor told me to go all in on NVidia. I watched it for a while and once it hit $75 I thought I was too late. I continued watching and once it hit $300 I felt like I was really too late. Once it hit $600 I finally bought 1 share. I should have listened.
2021-06-28 13:58:04,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry it’ll be cheaper when it splits kekw.
2021-06-28 17:05:01,wallstreetbets,I know what you mean. Missed out on it when I started a month ago.
2021-06-28 18:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Because my veins are too blown out, i remember back when making that much in a day made me feel something. Now I'm just like cool."
2021-06-28 16:10:07,wallstreetbets,"How do you mean? Its just 80 of them, and they just turn into 1/4th strike price contracts controlling 400 shares instead of 100 post split."
2021-06-28 15:17:36,wallstreetbets,AMD is so weak compared to NVDA.
2021-06-28 16:07:03,wallstreetbets,"ikr, it's never too late if you hold for long term..."
2021-06-28 18:06:43,wallstreetbets,"My dad bought Nvda at $10 and sold at $15, had thousands of shares, it happens"
2021-06-28 18:44:22,wallstreetbets,"God damn I wish that was me. 

I make 100$ off a trade and I’m juiced. 🤣"
2021-06-28 16:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Is that how stock splits work with options? My understanding is that the price of the stock drops as a result, but because it's a 4:1 split, for every 1 share you own, you get 3 more in turn. Same with options, for every 1 option you own you get 3 more in turn.

So, 320 contracts not 4000. I don't know why I read it as 1k contracts."
2021-06-28 18:58:33,wallstreetbets,Definitely buying both though
2021-06-28 18:46:14,wallstreetbets,AMD at 3.79 sold at $7.20
2021-06-28 18:49:51,wallstreetbets,"Savor it, I'm serious. One day you make that trade that suddenly launches your portfolio into the next bracket. You find that GME, AMC, who cares, early, and suddenly you find yourself in a world you never thought you'd know. And it only makes you want more."
2021-06-28 17:27:23,wallstreetbets,"nah the contracts just control 400 shares instead of 100 to my knowledge, and reflect the adjusted price"
2021-06-28 18:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a gambling addiction to me 🤔 

Already have one of those so maybe I’ll just stick to fucking mutual funds and boring shit"
2021-06-28 19:42:15,wallstreetbets,I am pretty sure /u/KickBassColonyDrop is right. Your contracts will increase in quantity and the strike price will drop

2021-06-28 14:30:54,wallstreetbets,the new short interest numbers from exchanges will be reported mid-week. i'm guessing a huge pop when everyone realizes the shorts have over-extended themselves again.

Laying off the hookers and blow for this one."
2021-06-28 15:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hell, I bought in earlier (about 5k in mixed shares and FD calls) when someone had posted about the lock-up ending today, and now the share price and my calls are rocketing. Feels good to end the day this way, as I missed some serious money on NVDA lol"
2021-06-28 15:45:51,wallstreetbets,Well fuck. This looks too good to pass up on. I’m in for 5k.
2021-06-28 15:35:21,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. I'm in
2021-06-28 14:52:03,wallstreetbets,Where can you trade SoFi in UK?

I’ve been fortunate enough to be in both PLTR and TSLA before the hive-mind retard strength kicked in, and I’m telling you I have the same exact feeling about SOFI. This baby is going to fly."
2021-06-28 13:47:26,wallstreetbets,"yup, got in for 300 shares at todays dip."

2021-06-28 15:39:34,wallstreetbets,New at options. Any recommendations for calls to buy? Have had some shares for a few weeks but can't keep spending that way. Any help?

Scamath is not a pro point lmao"
2021-06-28 17:10:46,wallstreetbets,5 year hold. Easily will be a 2x return
2021-06-28 18:40:17,wallstreetbets,"I was bought off my AMC calls. Made a decent 6k. Put it all into sofi. 

1500 at $20.24 avr. My dumbass accidentally bought a covered call (500 @23.54 with 5 calls at $25 for Jan) instead of just buying a single order of 5 calls. lol"

2021-06-28 14:38:03,wallstreetbets,Potentially squeezing shorties is icing on the cake. Been eyeing SoFi for months and this price point is just too good to miss out on.

2021-06-28 16:47:11,wallstreetbets,You have the exact tickers I have. 🍻
2021-06-28 17:31:43,wallstreetbets,"if you want to dip your toes in calls conservatively, buy ONE ATM call (at the money) which means the call's strike is at or around the current price. You could buy like 5 OTM (out of the money) calls for like $30 but you'll lose money FASTER if SOFI just trades sideways."
2021-06-28 17:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Don't buy any for now. Spend several hours watching guides on YouTube from channels like In The Money. Otherwise, you'll inevitably lose hundreds or thousands on common beginner mistakes."

2021-06-28 15:13:00,wallstreetbets,yeah i have $30k of SOFI shares in my SoFi account. honestly the product is awesome. i'm a huge fan and the shorts are doing it a huge disservice.
2021-06-28 16:56:10,wallstreetbets,Good lad. 🤝
2021-06-28 16:42:45,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is like AMC, in that it just ran because of SI.  While i think AMC is a turd that is going to come back down to 5 sooner or later, it is at least a standard business run by legitimate people.  CLOV is apparently run by scammers with a long history of screwing over investors"

2021-06-28 14:53:31,wallstreetbets,"WKHS has the highes SI, though CLOV is close and a high borrow rate. Meaning it’s hurts more right now to be short on CLOV. Just have to hold on to WKHS and not FOMO into CLOV when it squeezes. Or do what I did and buy both 🍀🐎🚀"

I spend a lot of time with my daughters. It’s important to me."
2021-06-28 13:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Materialistic members of my family express frustration that I spend my day either trading, playing video games, smoking weed, and have a variety of delivery services feed me. Meanwhile, i have dollar store socks with holes in."
2021-06-28 13:38:40,wallstreetbets,"I was born very poor. Made a few million in my career, retired early, invested well. I still wear shoes until they wear out, turn off lights when not used, shop for sales, etc.  No car over 50k.  I splurge on travel, dining and entertainment.  But I live pretty modestly and don't waste money....except on grandkids.   I think true life faltering wealth where you can buy multiple expensive cars and eat caviar and drink expensive champagne and act like a Saudi Prince requires 10s of millions.    Being merely a millionaire makes things a bit more comfortable but it doesn't make you a member of the jetset."
2021-06-28 13:16:21,wallstreetbets,I continue saving money and investing. You don't get more rich by spending. But I find comfort knowing I could buy anything I wanted at anytime I wanted
2021-06-28 13:24:13,wallstreetbets,"I roll over the gains from high risk stocks into cheap ones that pay large quarterly dividends and are much safer long positions instead of blowing it all on dodge chargers and name brand clothing.  So I always have something coming in through the year. I wear flannel shirts and spend my time playing the vidya or fishing.  Most rational people don't really change.  We're just happy that worrying about the bills is no longer an issue. I hope one day to open a cafe. If you suddenly strike it big, don't go and blow it all. Just be glad you have a bit more economic mobility than when you started. Chasing opulence will make you a broke ass. If one day your yolo rises 15 percent,  don't freak out.  Live in a reasonable house.  I would say there's a good portion of really chill bros who made one big risk and now they're just living at their own speed. So do yours."
2021-06-28 14:13:01,wallstreetbets,"People think the chronological order is get rich then you’re “fake” and stop hanging out with people but it’s the other way around.

The real order goes 1. Stop hanging out with all those fucking losers and wasting your time then 2. You have more time to focus and be productive and get rich as a by-product"
2021-06-28 13:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Who pays for sex? I mean directly? Sure we pay for dinner but I have never paid someone to have sex with me. With apps like tinder, you’re firing a dynamite in the ocean."
2021-06-28 15:35:23,wallstreetbets,"I have a normal 9-5er like every other schmuck, idle hands are devils hands.I get healthcare for my time why not, I do the bare minimum to not get fired."
2021-06-28 18:00:43,wallstreetbets,"I went from 65k to 6 million this year (GME, AMC, and MATIC), and have now settled at 3 million. It literally hasn't changed my life at all. Money is very overrated I am learning."

2021-06-28 13:40:27,wallstreetbets,My life hasn’t changed at all except worried a bit less and helped with a down payment on a house. I still spend only my 9-5 income and save as I would without the extra money.

2021-06-28 16:00:55,wallstreetbets,"broke college student went from -$30k debt to +$100k saving.  
can’t say it’s a huge gain but it sure changed my attitude toward life. definitely have more confidence toward future, more optimistic bla bla bla. in short much happier.  
however, those saving is still in form of stocks, so I’d need to shift them into more stable portfolio"
2021-06-28 18:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Went from $3k to $60k in the first GME run, trying to get from $60k to $100k+ in the next one. Nothing that significant or life changing but did reduce my stress levels a bit around saving money. If anything it motivates me to keep living frugally until it is a more life changing amount, and then continue to live frugally so it stays that way."
2021-06-28 13:28:14,wallstreetbets,I have been reading up on stuff like caviar so I can fit in with other rich folks. I prolly won't eat that shit but i guess I will need to know stuff about it if I get invited onto other people's yachts. I already know ima need to hire somebody to pick up my Pitbulls poop off the grassy area I will have to have planted somewhere and throw it overboard and rescue my dog if he jumps too. Still working on that job description.  Not sure if ima include lawn maintenance with the other dog duties. I can tell you for sure that it will be Ballpark hot dogs and name brand chips over on my boat and all the Natty's we can stock.
2021-06-28 16:50:35,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr Some behaviors stayed the same, but I spend way more on things like food and hobbies.

Me at 28: My friends would throw pennies for distance, and I would pick them up for me. I would usually eat home cooked meals for lunch, and tried to keep my food costs under $.50/serving.  I liked video games, only had one console, and I'd subscribe to Gamefly instead of paying for new games, and I'd try to grind my way through PC games like World of Tanks instead of paying for premium time.  Drove a cheap car that I kept for almost 200k miles. I had a net worth of around $100k thanks to buying a home during the 2008 financial crisis.

Me at 29: My dad died suddenly, at 62, just before retirement.  I got a little less than half his wealth, which boosted my net worth to around $1.3M over night.  Not a lot of changes at first as my behaviors were pretty ingrained into my lifestyle.  Fast forward seven years, and I still pick up pennies I find on the ground.  However, I eat out pretty much every day, and don't think twice about the occasional $100 meal (I live in Vegas).  I still have my same PC, but I've bought a PS5 and will also be getting an Xbox Series X, and I buy whatever games I want.  Slightly related is that I also get whatever streaming service I want, even if I barely watch them.  Since I ""work"" from home, my wife and I downsized to just one car (No Teslas with vanity plates for us lol) so I can still be really thrifty.  We moved into a slightly larger house, but because we moved from California to Nevada, we actually paid a little less for our new home than our old home sold for."
2021-06-28 14:52:14,wallstreetbets,"If I wasn't poor, I'd donate as much as I could, invest enough to bring back 6% I could live on if I needed to, then travel and party until I get bored. Then start and run a non profit and play video games until I die"
2021-06-28 14:19:22,wallstreetbets,"I am one. After I realize my gains, I'll get back to you but so far, I have wishes to travel and stay humble. I don't have a desire for expensive things just for the sake of expensive things. I hate bill gates, but I feel like he gets it."
2021-06-28 13:21:54,wallstreetbets,"During the Kung flu it was mostly takeaways, meeting gals form dating apps, buying suits I probably won’t wear, and some random furniture shit"

2021-06-28 17:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Sorry about your dad passing so young. My bff died at 40, and another close friend at 62, my ex roommate at 61, my mom suddenly also at 75. The friends had moneys saved for retirement that never came, and in my moms case, she was always worried about money even though she had 400k when she passed. It has given me a different perspective. I am not dumb with money, conservative car, I bought a home in a better area and used some gains. But, before I was wayyyy too frugal. After seeing those closest to me dying so young, fuck it. Im careful but, living more now."

2021-06-28 14:20:13,wallstreetbets,No Reddit assigned that.  Lawyer.  Corporate.  Executive $tock Option$.
2021-06-28 17:32:41,wallstreetbets,"This one also includes u/chugajuicejuice because it is the same and I want to elaborate.  So I look for stocks that pay more than 5 percent for less than ten dollars.  So the two dividend stocks are ETRN and plains all American pipeline but etrn has the biggest yield so I hold the most of that. I sometimes take said yield and scope out the next meme stock and then reinvest those gains into my two yield stocks on the dip. So when and if I decide to sell, I will make a gain. However it just deposits money for as long as I hold it. so far the yield is 7 percent but is cheaper than at&t per share. Dividend yield for new retards is when you get a percentage of your investment back when that company generates a profit instead of cashing out on the peak so you don't have to constantly watch it.  So tl;dr, I make a huge deposit into my safety net. Wait for the payout. Yolo into the risky stocks. Wait for the peak and sell. Then rinse the new take back into my safe stock. The more I have as the yield percentage goes up, the more I make to gamble with.  And I basically just grow one stock every week until the next quarter. So, no loss porn because it's always generating income.  The more you put in, the more you get out."
2021-06-28 18:22:01,wallstreetbets,"I mean that's what I did but I wouldn't recommend it lol. I put everything in an altcoin, which was retarded but it worked out."
2021-06-28 17:54:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you can’t let your brain go to shit.   When you have lived as long as I have you see what “retiring” does to the mind.  Might as well book a road trip with the grim reaper."

2021-06-28 19:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Damn, yeah that's a lot of early passings.  But like you said, it provides perspective.  On the other hand, my grandfather lived to 92...but I joke that he would have been happier if he had died at 82.  If I have a choice between Alzheimers or a sudden heart thing, it's a pretty easy choice for me.

Hence the diet that includes tourist food in Vegas lol."

2021-06-28 13:09:56,wallstreetbets,"It's just algorithmic trading.

For instance, a lot of stocks move the same direction as the S&P500 index. Why? Cause algorithmic trading.

High frequency trading can trade back and forth up to 64 million times a minute (theoretically  but not practical for irl purposes cause of margin). Many of those algorithm style trading aren't really holding any positions long (just constantly buying and selling on repeat). It does provide liquidity to the market (hence why you can buy/sell so easily).

Enough institutions must think there can be money made if certain stocks track the performance of other similar stocks. You know... spreads and all. After all, the group of people who would buy a meme stock would tend to buy another meme stock. If one popular meme stock has 'less demand' at a given moment, then I don't think it's unreasonable to assume other meme stocks will have 'less demand' (and vice versa with 'more demand'). So you just exploit that pattern."

Blackberry has come a long way. It's making progress tremendous progress and more recently transitioned itself from hardware to software and from smart phone icon to smart car icon. 

Patent settlement is complete,  they interef into a definitive agreement which means it's done deal. This is one big reason you should not worry about anything especially the share price of today. 

When asked about patent sale. John Chen said stay tuned. He meant hold, don't sell your shares, good news is coming. 

Blackberry removed the curtains recently in Q1 FY2022 and the truth came out. They beat  revenue estimates by 3,000,000 and narrowed losses significantly from 1.14 to .11 per share YoY.  In addition, Blackberry went on a hiring spree and stepped up sales hiring and plan to increase foot on the street by 23% in this quarter. 

Blackberry is launching AWS IVY Intelligent Car Platform. They recently formed IVY Advisory Council and GEICO AWS TELUS HERE CERENCE
Are on board working together to accelerate innovation in transportation. The future is bright for Blackberry. An innovation icon."

2021-06-28 18:00:21,wallstreetbets,I'm thinking there's bots claiming they sold too. BB bagholders aren't smart enough to acknowledge when they should get off the boat
2021-06-28 19:11:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah but this one is different okay?!
2021-06-28 17:11:50,wallstreetbets,Duhr duhr TO THE MOON duhr
2021-06-28 19:08:47,wallstreetbets,Congrats you're green!
2021-06-28 19:26:57,wallstreetbets,Yup. Getting sick of this dead cat bullshit. 🌈🐻 on this cork sucker to 9
2021-06-28 19:08:33,wallstreetbets,"There was like 3 or 4 1 minute candles that were around 1 million volume, all big drops in price with it bouncing back not long after. Bearish? Bullish? Idk I'm a fucking retard"
2021-06-28 19:37:34,wallstreetbets,My only regret possibly is shorting pre earnings hard and then holding all day today. Hopefully just a dead cat bounce
2021-06-28 17:26:59,wallstreetbets,Is it because it rose without you?
2021-06-28 18:09:44,wallstreetbets,My dumbass keeps shorting more in real life. Probs gonna get burned very soon
2021-06-28 19:25:47,wallstreetbets,What you own?
2021-06-28 19:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Uhh, okay? With lube or nah?"
2021-06-28 14:54:11,wallstreetbets,I’ve been averaging down but it’s keep going down lmao. If I were to put down 1k right now @12 to bring it down then it would just dip below 10
2021-06-28 15:24:25,wallstreetbets,I'm at 10something. In USD that's about 8-9 I think.
2021-06-28 16:13:11,wallstreetbets,Well what if I told you my avg was 6.19?😅
2021-06-28 18:32:15,wallstreetbets,$16 here…
2021-06-28 18:29:46,wallstreetbets,"That’s where I was, it turned green last month and I think I made about $7. But now I don’t have to wear the helmet anymore."
2021-06-28 16:01:17,wallstreetbets,I just averaged up from $9 after it went down. I still have faith
2021-06-28 16:22:56,wallstreetbets,Buy more now
2021-06-28 17:25:40,wallstreetbets,we gonna pick u up on way to $1000!!! hold tight brother and average down!
2021-06-28 13:08:47,wallstreetbets,"Big 40, wanted to see how mad I could make myself with 1k"
2021-06-28 14:15:54,wallstreetbets,125 shares. Gonna buy more when I’m no longer poooorr
2021-06-28 13:14:23,wallstreetbets,I'm 175 deep at 18.17.... it will come back... gulp.... I hope! Come on BB!
2021-06-28 14:30:51,wallstreetbets,"260 at 15.50 :-/
Hope it's coming back lol"
2021-06-28 13:51:58,wallstreetbets,Guh!
2021-06-28 15:06:40,wallstreetbets,Well you couldn't average down so average up it was
2021-06-28 15:25:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, let me fucking celebrate my 50% loss"
2021-06-28 16:28:06,wallstreetbets,It still is
2021-06-28 17:14:01,wallstreetbets,"this is my average too. but also because i averaged up to get this, makes me extra special"
2021-06-28 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,Too retarded and fuck blackberry
2021-06-28 15:54:10,wallstreetbets,Around first gme run
2021-06-28 18:07:52,wallstreetbets,That costs money.
2021-06-28 14:49:53,wallstreetbets,I support you all the way. Stay retarded my friend.
2021-06-28 16:37:54,wallstreetbets,People being surprised they lost money by listening to reddit comments is hilarious
2021-06-28 15:25:54,wallstreetbets,My children will cherish them!
2021-06-28 17:50:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm retarded and chased something that didn't happen, same as usual"
2021-06-28 15:50:00,wallstreetbets,"""SQUEEZE IS COMING"""
2021-06-28 15:35:50,wallstreetbets,"With 4K shares, $15.51 looks good to me lol"
2021-06-28 17:22:57,wallstreetbets,"We need a new sub called “the waiting room”. It may be like Hotel California, we may never leave."
2021-06-28 15:35:09,wallstreetbets,I have lol. And then I just decided to wait it out. I have 4K shares so it’s really only a couple dollars of movement before a potentially solid green upside. We won’t discuss the other possibility…. Ha ha
2021-06-28 15:33:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah… buddies.
2021-06-28 17:21:40,wallstreetbets,Hahah I close my computer so many times to walk away and then go right back to look.
2021-06-28 19:36:24,wallstreetbets,I did when I got in at $8.90. It's not as fun as averaging down.
2021-06-28 17:23:44,wallstreetbets,And lowered overall cost basis.
2021-06-28 15:28:49,wallstreetbets,"This is the way. In at 12, out at 22, waiting til it hits 10."
2021-06-28 16:03:33,wallstreetbets,I did the same thing and that's my strategy. Its too expensive to buy in now but I'll buy back in when it gets below 10.
2021-06-28 15:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, it’s my turn to use the brain cell"
2021-06-28 16:20:20,wallstreetbets,What day do they expire? I expect the run to happen Monday following your expiration.
2021-06-28 18:30:19,wallstreetbets,"You wouldn't know her, she goes to a different school"
2021-06-28 19:20:55,wallstreetbets,Fill her up with helium so she can play hard to get.

2021-06-28 14:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I draw cyber trucks. Love the orange crayons, I think it’s the best flavor."
2021-06-28 17:05:42,wallstreetbets,Hey man atleast you have a plan.
2021-06-28 12:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I'm full on retard, not faking it so I can compete in the special olympics, man."
2021-06-28 17:53:35,wallstreetbets,no shorts have been covered yet. Squeeze will happen soon inshallah. Amc to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀💎🤚
2021-06-28 18:03:23,wallstreetbets,amc high was 73
2021-06-28 17:36:01,wallstreetbets,Or stop operating on a hive mind basis and let people invest in the companies they like
2021-06-28 13:07:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah there is huge volume in 1 minute chunks dropping the price. Lot of selling going on (likely shorters)
2021-06-28 13:25:03,wallstreetbets,"It is not to do with diamond hands or not. If I could I would, I need the money in the short run. Thought buy some, sell some, keep some. Didn't work out."
2021-06-28 17:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Diamond hands is traditionally a very very bad trading strategy. 

Not everything is a gme. If you trade everything the same as gme you will lose in the long run."
2021-06-28 13:15:16,wallstreetbets,Yo mama garbage
2021-06-28 14:42:57,wallstreetbets,Short it then genius
2021-06-28 13:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Hot garbage, over 8k patents, no change to leadership no new plan and cant turn a profit. That avgarbage company no matter how you slice it"
2021-06-28 15:47:38,wallstreetbets,Good luck on your short position
2021-06-28 19:20:24,wallstreetbets,I hope so. Im all in like an abused spouse at this point.
2021-06-28 19:44:21,wallstreetbets,"lol its been stressful, as I started pumping money into the market in feb, and got fired march first. SO FAR THOUGH so good.

I diiiiiid do a naughty and do margin trading. workhorse and fubo baby! took my average from 50 a pop on fubo, down to 35"
2021-06-28 19:56:09,wallstreetbets,Oh rip. Gotta sell right after earnings to take advantage of iv crush
2021-06-28 17:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I was in at $10.32 and rode it for about 5 months, at this point I could have put the money in to other things and come back to around the same value.

To me, BB is a more volatile NOK, with less 5G patents and potential."
2021-06-28 19:36:28,wallstreetbets,"5 calls for 18.5
5 for 19.5 
1 for 15

I never went in on a “meme” stock and said fuck it. Lost 80% of my portfolio"
2021-06-28 15:52:40,wallstreetbets,For my CSP’s I respectfully ask you to not buy more for now :)
2021-06-28 15:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Average down + CC can help. I averaged down in UWMC to 8.3, the $1 in CC on the way down helped a bunch and is effectively half the gains as of today."
2021-06-28 16:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Please do it. 

I'm waiting for it to go back to ~8 or 9 before I buy back in."
2021-06-28 16:17:38,wallstreetbets,Out of all the myriad of memestonks you chose BB. why. lmfao WHYYYYY
2021-06-28 17:22:28,wallstreetbets,Mine is 6.71
2021-06-28 18:51:14,wallstreetbets,I’d ask you not to sell until 2026
2021-06-28 15:25:14,wallstreetbets,You do realise that BB is long term right?
2021-06-28 19:58:53,wallstreetbets,Play with options in the meantime to recoup losses. If BB drops 5% buy calls and sell for AT LEAST 10-30% profit within the next hour or day
2021-06-28 15:29:07,wallstreetbets,"No one likes a tease, post your position."
2021-06-28 16:03:42,wallstreetbets,What did the Berry ever do to you?
2021-06-28 17:20:35,wallstreetbets,Always just one rocket away from the squeeze. Lol
2021-06-28 18:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Sitting in the waiting room, sitting in the waiting room, said why?.. Because it won't go up...."
2021-06-28 17:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls. It will lower your basis as well.

Just make sure you sell them at a price you are actually willing to lose the shares at."

2021-06-28 17:47:32,wallstreetbets,Your name makes me know your not a priest
2021-06-28 16:21:18,wallstreetbets,Lol you mean at Friday after hours
2021-06-28 19:07:39,wallstreetbets,Is she the one from Canada?
2021-06-28 17:02:02,wallstreetbets,Wait until you try the Mac n cheese crayola. It’s almost like the real thing.
2021-06-28 13:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Well, shit then if you as a savant like the stock, I feel much better about having bought shares. I'm buying a nice jacket now for our trip to the moon!"
2021-06-28 13:43:05,wallstreetbets,Never invest more than you are willing to lose fellow retard
2021-06-28 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,You’re gambling on meme stocks with money you need short term. Can’t see how this could possibly backfire.
2021-06-28 13:31:47,wallstreetbets,It is exactly about diamond hands.  They are taking advantage of the mentality you just described. Shorts are pinching every penny they can out of bb.  The daily swings bb makes is ridiculous and it’s all meant to scare off weak hands and take advantage people who fomo and are weak hands. I already know a few people who don’t buy a stock til it’s running then they fomo.  First sign of a pullback and they paper hands.  Shorts eat these type of people for breakfast lunch and dinner.  They know people who fomo have a range of what they are willing to lose.  So shorts cover to run up the price and catch these fomo’ers then short and tank the price to force them to sell. As simple as that. Either buy and hold long term or buy short term and expect to be playing a shitshow slot machine
2021-06-28 17:24:38,wallstreetbets,Lol long run? It’s been like 5 months…You adhd retards don’t hold stock for more than a week? Jesus Christ
2021-06-28 18:05:25,wallstreetbets,Why are you even bringing gme into this? Obviously you have to sell at some point and the point of saying diamond hands is to at least hold to a reasonable profit.  Too many people jumping in on fomo and getting their asses handed to them.
2021-06-28 13:45:43,wallstreetbets,She just told me not to invest in BB and said it’s complete garbage. Garbage can spot garbage better than anyone.
2021-06-28 14:08:36,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing, adjective-verbNumber"
2021-06-28 15:48:35,wallstreetbets,"Good luck on your long dong. My gains are already locked in, I have no problem seeing it soar up for you guys. Do love to give people shit tho"
2021-06-28 19:21:48,wallstreetbets,I will be abused if it keeps rising and I keep moving my stop loss
2021-06-28 17:29:38,wallstreetbets,"I feel that, fuck BB. Definitely something going on at that 12.70 mark, every 1 million volume sell off it bounced right back"
2021-06-28 19:36:55,wallstreetbets,Guh!
2021-06-28 16:08:24,wallstreetbets,what is it and when’s the expiry ha
2021-06-28 16:07:57,wallstreetbets,"but @ this rate, I’ll just end up bankrupting the company lol"
2021-06-28 16:22:25,wallstreetbets,You should read the dds on it
2021-06-28 17:43:59,wallstreetbets,"The average is between 5.10 and 5.50. So, well done, boys. Or should I say,>!well hung.!<"
2021-06-28 18:59:48,wallstreetbets,"This is thing is eventually going to moon...

2021-06-28 15:26:57,wallstreetbets,How long we talking here?
2021-06-28 19:54:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol, BB been long term for the past 20 years. It’s highest peak was around 2011 I think."
2021-06-28 16:06:23,wallstreetbets,I guess I can't blame them for my extra chromosomes
2021-06-28 19:53:17,wallstreetbets,Her husband is going to he pissed.
2021-06-28 17:19:50,wallstreetbets,That does sound good.
2021-06-28 14:04:04,wallstreetbets,"That's my policy as well. But sometimes things go a bit different, and all of a sudden you need that money. All of a sudden you wish you did not lose that money. You know what I mean?"
2021-06-28 14:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Turned out to be short turn. Was not suppose to be. You know life happens, you just have to roll with it."
2021-06-28 14:41:37,wallstreetbets,Jokes on the shorts because the dip is better known as a discount
2021-06-28 17:29:11,wallstreetbets,"No, in fact we think holding for even for 5 minutes is too long. 

You should be yoloing options or posting somewhere else."
2021-06-28 14:12:54,wallstreetbets,Show me another company with that many patents and still a negative on the balance sheet.
2021-06-28 16:14:11,wallstreetbets,10P 08/06. Not that I would mind owning it at a 9.45 average but I’d rather take my free 55 dollars if I hold it to expiry
2021-06-28 17:30:03,wallstreetbets,i have. thats why im not in. lmao.
2021-06-28 17:55:47,wallstreetbets,My first purchase was at 4.92....only averaged up since
2021-06-28 15:45:08,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-28 15:45:36,wallstreetbets,How long you got?
2021-06-28 16:12:58,wallstreetbets,"When I got in I was thinking 3-5 years, but hype can do weird things to a stock price earlier than you hope."
2021-06-28 15:45:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm not expecting any too big jumps until the next few years. I think something around 100-200 per share is possible.

But that's just my opinion, not financial advice.

Seriously I'm full of shit. Make your own research."
2021-06-28 16:19:53,wallstreetbets,15-20 years and it will hit $20 maybe
2021-06-28 14:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Show me any 1 day, 1 month, 3 month, 1 year, 5 year that we're red.

Your mother and I still love and support you, no matter what she says."
2021-06-28 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,It's a penis joke.
2021-06-28 16:06:54,wallstreetbets,Until I die. So give or take 50 years
2021-06-28 16:40:26,wallstreetbets,I just made some research. Can the stock go brrr now?
2021-06-28 14:26:01,wallstreetbets,Stock prices arent correlation to debt.
2021-06-28 18:03:09,wallstreetbets,The moment you realize the joke....(insert homer Simpson walking in to bush gif)

2021-06-28 12:41:24,wallstreetbets,"The fact that $WKHS is in the EV space makes it that much more interesting. I'm holding 600k worth @ $13.6 and I plan on riding this up to the moon. Besides the short squeeze and the major ape interest, the likelihood of great headlines for EVs sector can not be ignored and I think $WKHS will benefit from all of that as well."

2021-06-28 16:44:43,wallstreetbets,Doing my part with 500 @ 15.8 WKHS to the moon!
2021-06-28 12:38:18,wallstreetbets,"My own commentary, representing only my own opinion:
I won't lie, it's tempting to cash in that 13.6% gain, but not quite yet... Investing is not a team sport, and the only goal is to make a profit. I don't really care how many downvotes this post gets or if some fellow ape thinks I'm a sellout LOL - I won't lose any sleep over that.

I rode GME from $76 to $293 in January. (My spidey sense was right - an hour after I sold on 1/27, my shitty broker disabled the login page for 2 days hahaha) I rode BB from $17 down to $10 average and back up to $19.50, where I took my gains. I will ride this horsey too. :) 

In my opinion, WKHS has a lot of squeeze potential, so I won't be selling at a measly $17 a share. My sell target is $30 - a nice little double-down. If it rides higher, that's a bonus - I've got some LEAPs in my Roth mwahaha. (Hey, I never claimed to be sane.)

Make your decisions and do your own DD. Good luck, my fellow horsemen, horsewomen, and horse-nonbinaries."

2021-06-28 13:50:42,wallstreetbets,I set my sell orders at $113.00. I will watch it and see how high it can keep support. That will be my final decision. That being said I will not budge below 30. If it goes up to 29 I still will not sell. Why because this company has long term potential and I got it at fair prices. So I might add to my position but I am confident I will not lose my shirt on WKHS.
2021-06-28 13:28:29,wallstreetbets,You have a way with words mwahahahha

2021-06-28 13:50:32,wallstreetbets,"I just believe Wkhs has the most potential out of all the plays. Given its current  price , high short interest and bullishly positive news on the horizon. They totally missed last er and were really upfront about it hence why shorts kept pilling in. But overall they are EV and have 8000 + backlog of orders and located in Midwest where there’s much support. They have new partnerships to help meet demand. . In short, I like the stock. $WKHS"
2021-06-28 14:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Long-term, yup. Short-term, we'll see some delicious spikes and dips and more spikes. :)"

2021-06-28 12:07:00,wallstreetbets,I hold 372 SoFi bought them at the day of announcement. They are going to be JP Morgan of future. This is why I probably will never sell them. But your analysis has some credibility.
2021-06-28 12:10:18,wallstreetbets,Holding $10k. Never selling
2021-06-28 12:18:11,wallstreetbets,Holding $40000 +.

2021-06-28 12:49:39,wallstreetbets,1260 shares @ $18.10 LFG!
2021-06-28 12:38:40,wallstreetbets,I'm just wrapping my head around SOFI now and it'll be interesting to follow along given the confluence of factors this week.
2021-06-28 12:44:15,wallstreetbets,"25->50= 200%???

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I’m in and have been for a while; but idk if I’m gonna bet on it jumping back this week. Kind of hope it gets cheaper cause I’m a greedy piece of shit."
2021-06-28 13:18:36,wallstreetbets,"I bought a $20c leap. Yea, it was $750, but I'm pretty confident Sofi will not be below $20 for the next 1.5 years. If it dips significantly I'll buy another leap to offset."
2021-06-28 13:18:43,wallstreetbets,"Bought 15 $20c, 7/2. Let's see if it plays out."
2021-06-28 14:00:38,wallstreetbets,SOFI=>SQUARE of 2025!!
2021-06-28 14:19:28,wallstreetbets,fkit im in 500 shares at $18 today. lets goooo

2021-06-28 14:51:49,wallstreetbets,$19c 7/2 fuck it
2021-06-28 15:11:15,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip at $18.25 a share today and loving it. Gonna diamondhand this fintech stock till it’s $100 a share
2021-06-28 15:03:12,wallstreetbets,This looks like it’s about to pop. OK I’m in 🔥🔥🚀
2021-06-28 15:20:52,wallstreetbets,I’m in
2021-06-28 15:23:10,wallstreetbets,Bought this dip LFG
2021-06-28 15:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Great DD OP.

Was already balls deep in SoFi, but I went in heavy today with the dip. This thing is gonna soar."
2021-06-28 12:30:54,wallstreetbets,So when is lockup expiration?
2021-06-28 17:24:04,wallstreetbets,Bought six 7/2 18.5c for .98 each already up 27%. Tomorrow will be great... still reeling from a 15k loss on truly stupid wish and cln calls.
2021-06-28 12:10:46,wallstreetbets,i'll see you behind a wendy's
2021-06-28 16:55:01,wallstreetbets,">First Seen In WSB	1 week ago

Big oof"
2021-06-28 13:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Problem is, big banks hate SoFi (for obvious reasons) and they have so much pull on the markets that they will do anything to bury competing interests. The short interest reflects a general sense that David can't stand up to Goliath in this case because there is so much shit to wade through before Sofi can be viewed as anything other than a defiant play against big finance. 

I use SoFi and have a position that I love but am currently losing on. I don't see this as a short term play but I support the concept and love having everything under one roof, per se. With that said, I feel like the old guard of big finance/banking could very well fuck Sofi into obscurity."
2021-06-28 15:57:41,wallstreetbets,In with some warrants.
2021-06-28 16:12:10,wallstreetbets,Very excited about this company. In for shares and calls
2021-06-28 17:35:25,wallstreetbets,"Have some shares, was pretty pissed for the past week but it is looking good from here. This thing is a lifelong holder. This will be in my portfolio when I retire."
2021-06-28 12:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing... if you really believe in your DD, you could buy 19.5c contracts and sell 20c contracts, allowing you to leverage a contract for 0.08-0.10 per share. That can lead to 3-5x your money at $20 and above."
2021-06-28 12:40:20,wallstreetbets,"I would be a careful about using what happened to PLTR to predict what might happen to SOFI. I tend to agree that SOFI will jump but I believe it will due to the fact that the number of shares being freed is pretty insignificant if you consider the daily volume and float.

Lockup expirations are unpredictable and it’s basically a coin toss."
2021-06-28 19:18:21,wallstreetbets,That's great info and as good analysis as any for short term trading.

2021-06-28 16:06:56,wallstreetbets,What factors are you watching?
2021-06-28 12:53:33,wallstreetbets,">25->50= 200%???

Yes? 50 is 200% of 25. 25 bet + 50 profit = 75 total. 200% increase."
2021-06-28 15:05:31,wallstreetbets,How is it playing out?
2021-06-28 15:09:09,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck was that lmao

Gonna be an interesting next few days"
2021-06-28 12:52:11,wallstreetbets,Today (Monday)
2021-06-28 12:45:03,wallstreetbets,"OP did [call](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:fkitagn) ENKS a month ago, pretty legit"
2021-06-28 13:08:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's a call debit spread, but why would i want to limit my upside with that?"
2021-06-28 14:30:57,wallstreetbets,"So your saying I have a 50% shot at being rich, I’m in."
2021-06-28 12:45:41,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-28 17:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Good luck. Went up 60% since I posted, glad I finally got in early on something Lmao

We'll see if it's still there tomorrow at open though."
2021-06-28 16:09:53,wallstreetbets,"I was watching all of the massive sell orders (assume they were lockup shares) just get immediately gobbled up on the level 2 data. Historically, I haven't found much use in watching level 2 data but today, it painted a clear picture of a stock that was bound to pop. Guess I was right, booked a nice profit."
2021-06-28 12:54:44,wallstreetbets,So puts you say?
2021-06-28 16:00:30,wallstreetbets,Played out quite nicely.
2021-06-28 15:52:25,wallstreetbets,"It’s up a dollar , so I guess it’s playing out"
2021-06-28 15:09:39,wallstreetbets,Idk but I meant to post this in the daily thread lol
2021-06-28 14:40:33,wallstreetbets,does that mean its rocketing tomorrow
2021-06-28 13:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Cause it limits your downside.

With that being said, all my calls are naked."
2021-06-28 13:20:15,wallstreetbets,Not a bot. Just wrong thread. Sorry!!!
2021-06-28 12:57:04,wallstreetbets,I'll buy the calls if you buy the puts
2021-06-28 14:46:24,wallstreetbets,Single digits recovery is probable and a slow climb back into the $20s over the next several months. SoFi does have a lot of upside but it's not a hyper growth company.
2021-06-28 16:04:51,wallstreetbets,"They’re making a play to enter consumer banking. You don’t see that creating exponential growth potential over the next few years? 

Full disclosure I’m hype on this company. I drank the cool aid a few years ago looking for a job in this industry and have been targeting them for a while. Bought in when I read about their expansion plans…"
2021-06-28 16:07:13,wallstreetbets,I'm also bullish on them long term but there's not a lot of moat on consumer banking.
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I started with 3.7k back in April. My ROKU swing trade treated me right today. I sold too early but a dub is a dub.

2021-06-28 12:22:25,wallstreetbets,Bruh this dude is possibly the most actually retarded person I’ve seen on this sub. Looking at the rest of his posts (all super retarded) I think he’s literally lost his life savings on AMC calls. Not to mention that the market crashing would not send AMC and GME to the moon… puzzling.

2021-06-28 11:52:37,wallstreetbets,805 is my SP LETS GO!
2021-06-28 14:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Apple split —> up 

TSLA split —> up 

TTD split —> up 

Anyone got recent examples of large tech companies that split and went down? 

All things being equal a split creates more buying pressure and less selling pressure due to : 

1) large quant funds are discouraged from heavy HFT as they trades are based on shares. Eg. Trading 5 shares cost more than 1 share. (Reason Buffett didn’t want to split Brk-A) 

2) for individuals who don’t have access to partial shares and want to participate."
2021-06-28 12:42:26,wallstreetbets,FML. Sold all my NVDA when it hit 720 weeks ago. Been wanting to get back in but $800 seems like a bad play. I’m scared.
2021-06-28 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,I think it may be time to ring the register anyways.
2021-06-28 12:49:34,wallstreetbets,It's splitting 4 to 1 in the middle of next month.  You missed out on huge gains bro.
2021-06-28 14:40:36,wallstreetbets,"Yea. It’s hurts. But I got no crystal ball. Taking profit is always the smartest and hardest thing to do. 

People will say stocks usually tank historically after splits but I’m thinking Nvidia is not a normal case. Also. I’m an idiot."
2021-06-28 13:09:49,wallstreetbets,"Aka the new price will be current price/4 so it's not a huge gain, price might plummet further afterwards cause many people are buying it now just for the splits. Idk if it will go up or down after the split."
2021-06-28 14:09:04,wallstreetbets,Look at history of what happens right after splits.
2021-06-28 13:19:00,wallstreetbets,Having four times as many shares in a company like Nvida is a guaranteed winner.
2021-06-28 14:46:13,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia long term is always a winner yes, but why would the number of shares matter? It's all about the value. 1 share at $800 is exactly the same as 4 shares at $200."
2021-06-28 14:47:11,wallstreetbets,Is this something that really needs to be explained?
2021-06-28 14:49:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes? Judging from that comment tho, I'm gonna assume you don't have an explanation."
2021-06-28 14:59:01,wallstreetbets,400 x $50 > 100 x $50
2021-06-28 16:18:41,wallstreetbets,Wow. Now this is absolutely retarded.
2021-06-28 17:42:00,wallstreetbets,"What the... After your attitude THIS is your explanation?

Let me jump in with an actual explanation. First off, with the 4 to 1 split your share count will multiply by 4 but the share price will divide by 4 of course.

However, the lower share price will create new buying power from retail traders that don't have much capital and trade on platforms that don't support fractional shares. They can afford shares now and collectively this shouldn't be underestimated, look at TSLA split for reference. Secondly, getting 100 shares is easier post split so NVDA will attract more options traders now. Some retail and institutions don't buy shares until they can buy 100s so they can write covered calls against them."

2021-06-28 13:27:01,wallstreetbets,That decline was due to increased short interest across the sector. Cost to short CMPS or MNMD has increased the last few days as well. Interest on shorting CMPS is 8% while MNMD is 20%.

2021-06-28 13:42:12,wallstreetbets,"yeah, there is defiantly bot activity. I’m gonna post screenshots I got like 4 awards in 1 min with 3 upvotes like the fuck. Also when I posted this within 30 min I had 3 upvotes, now in another 30 I’m at 500+. This doesn’t add up."
2021-06-28 14:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re right. Although when I was little I did genuinely enjoy going there and playing with my friends lol. However yes, it is not the play if you’re not a gambling man"
2021-06-28 13:11:43,wallstreetbets,"lmao I'm down like $6k on TLRY but do you see me posting about how they're ""the next best play"" every day?  

Nah man.  I hold those fat bags in silence and suffer quietly like my pappy taught me.

\-edit: $6k, not $4.  Haven't looked at it in a while."
2021-06-28 14:35:47,wallstreetbets,Should I get out while I’m up?

2021-06-28 14:52:13,wallstreetbets,WHYD u give me an AWARD
2021-06-28 14:21:20,wallstreetbets,Haha I can guarantee I’m not a bot. Also I do totally admit the amount of upvotes and cheap awards I’m getting is sus. I am totally getting the pump and dumb vibe too. Hopefully we’re about to enter the pump part though. However I agree with everything you’re saying 100%
2021-06-28 13:48:33,wallstreetbets,"Hey don’t do that, I’m willing to take a risk and don’t think it can drop down that much more. In the rare case it somehow does get support from WSB I got lucky. I’m gambling. Please if you’re not in a financial position to accept losses, I beg you don’t buy this stock."

2021-06-28 13:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Complete the retard puzzle, nice."
2021-06-28 13:45:10,wallstreetbets,Still awards. The cheaper they are the more they can have the bot spam when it picks up the target ticker in the title.
2021-06-28 15:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Bro I'm not telling you to dump your position, but wow what you're saying certainly seems like a large coordinated operation.  I've seen this a bunch of times, no mention of a ticker all weekend, then bam Monday morning there's DD and 15 major yolos and awards galore with the daily pumping it non-stop.  This is not normal."
2021-06-28 14:22:09,wallstreetbets,A gambling man typically knows how to gamble. This is just throwing money away. I hope for your sake that this goes up a little so you can break even and get out.

That being said, I do believe tomorrow will be a great day for Purple and I also believe that the current price is a good entry. Everyone needs a bed, and with all the new GME and AMC millionaires on WSB there will be a ton of kids moving out of mom's basement and needing a new mattress. As always, be conservative- Shares, leaps and short puts is what I have been playing. Shares is always the play as you can hold them forever. Options are for degenerates. I am not expecting a major move tomorrow, but I do expect good upward movement from now until growth plateaus, which could be 5+ years.

The DD is pretty straightforward:

5 years ago purple did 65M in revenue, this year that number is expected to approach 900M, 2020 they did about 650M. The company has about 40M in debt, which is tiny compared to its peers. The net income shown on the graph is mostly due to warrant accruals and a whole bunch of accounting black magic that is finally being cleaned up. u/indonesian_activist please shed some light on this.

&#x200B;

PRPL expects to be the number 2 player in the indsutry within 3-5 years and in that same time frame they expect sales to approach 1.5-2B. Let me spell that out for you.  They are anticipating growing from 65M in sales in 2016 to 2B by 2026. **This represents a 40%+ CAGR**

Also, PURPLE just locked in more manufacturing capacity in Georgia???? Why lock in more capacity when the plant is barely getting started. You Don't lock in manufacturing capacity like this without very good reason to believe you will continue to grow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2021-06-28 14:15:02,wallstreetbets,"I just bought put on it,lol. It will never break $50, instead it will go back to $40

Not financial advice"
2021-06-28 12:31:30,wallstreetbets,"The fundamental reasons are solid as a LONG TERM PLAY. Playing it as an FD is really a lottery. If big news of an acquisition came up it would work, but chances are slim to none."
2021-06-28 12:33:51,wallstreetbets,"They sold shares for $85 just a few months ago and nothing has really changed since, VIAC just broke through its last resistance since the drop, and truly believe it’s a solid company. That was enough for me to yolo lol"
2021-06-28 11:27:26,wallstreetbets,"Ya I get those thoughts too, but in order to get crazy gains you have to be willing to risk it. Wish me luck!"
2021-06-28 11:35:09,wallstreetbets,"wsb culture lol, every other post you see are YOLOs 😎"
2021-06-28 12:41:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't think there will be an acquisition, but I do think we should see some decent number in Q3 & Q4 from summer movies & fall TV shows (and hopefully streaming subscribers to go along with it)."
2021-06-28 12:41:27,wallstreetbets,Is there supposed be any acquisition news?
2021-06-28 12:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, its s solid company but it went up so much because of Hwang was buying. Right? I am long too but not expecting a fireworks to be honest. I both of us make money."

2021-06-28 11:36:43,wallstreetbets,"Ik, just questioning it lmao"
2021-06-28 12:44:23,wallstreetbets,I'm of the same opinion.
2021-06-28 12:45:12,wallstreetbets,"Very unreliable rumor about COMCAST, but not really."
2021-06-28 12:07:50,wallstreetbets,My 8/20 calls are up over 100% this morning so maybe they will have a chance to sell for big gains by end of week or sometime next week
2021-06-28 13:21:14,wallstreetbets,Oh ok..thanks

2021-06-28 12:50:55,wallstreetbets,4 contracts cost $250 and are valued @ $480 now
2021-06-28 13:22:30,wallstreetbets,What else u going to play next? I am looking at wish and clov. But hbu?
2021-06-28 13:36:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm playing MU for earnings, mostly 7/9 calls. TSM 1/22 calls. WISH $14 calls that I picked up when it was trading at $10, expiring on 7/16. CRSR 8/20 calls as well."
2021-06-28 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,Should I be a retard and buy some of these?
2021-06-28 15:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Long calls on TSM sound good to me and you can still go in on MU as well. Just look at their last two earnings for an idea on price movement. In both instances it climbed steadily for the three days prior to earnings, then a slight pullback which led to a week worth of gains. Every analyst is expecting MU to beat estimates and post a great earnings report. I'm thinking the 7/9 calls just outside the money are the best bet. The recent trends make the 7/16 calls seem a bit too risky unless you're buying already ITM calls."
2021-06-28 15:25:13,wallstreetbets,Why would long dated calls on MU be risky. I do like TSM idk clov you could play the short squeeze and pick up Aug calls
2021-06-28 15:39:11,wallstreetbets,Only reason I say that is because if it does get a nice bump up I feel like a pull back will start that week prior to 7/16 expiry. I would rather go much further out than go in on 7/16. Just my thought on it
2021-06-28 16:27:34,wallstreetbets,Bought $WISH(fml) August 6th strike 14 call

2021-06-28 14:58:16,wallstreetbets,I’m seeing 12% of the float shorted.
2021-06-28 16:44:49,wallstreetbets,"Disclosure: I own WISH stock and it’s my largest single holding.

I think that 69 bucks comes from some Twitter pumping (and possibly future dumping). IMO it’s a legit $25+ stock but $69 seems optimistic."
2021-06-28 16:50:25,wallstreetbets,"$69 is the pump goal from twitter/zack morris. From the options chain I think a bit over $45 is the stretch goal in my mind, but I think 25-30 is probably more realistic. Depends on how this week plays out and if we get over $20."
2021-06-28 15:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Moron or More than likely a paid company. WSB is compromised till Citadel is liquidated. If for some reason they make it through, then I would give up on this sub forever because it is now their bitch

How to spot a shill(hard to do honestly)

1.Account age under 170 days currently

2.Top commenter is  also under 170 days High award status right out of the gate though I suppose they will fix that to seem more normal

3.Most important- check out options activity/ they like to go ahead and play the options in their favor before the post is up.

Ex CLOV, WISH, PLAY, SOFI

You can still make money off these plays if you’re lucky but they can see the activity and adjust accordingly based on options/ commons where most will be left bag holding"
2021-06-28 15:08:30,wallstreetbets,do you have a source? TD is showing 3.9% now. IDK where to look for updated float %
2021-06-28 16:46:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the same boat but my investment is far lower than most. Thanks for a legit answer, I was just curious."
2021-06-28 17:08:31,wallstreetbets,The volume per day is 1/3 the float ... if they wanted to liquidate they couldve done it in 3 days already
2021-06-28 15:26:57,wallstreetbets,I use yahoo finance
2021-06-28 17:44:10,wallstreetbets,You think they liquidate instantly lol. They do it enough to weigh the options then people change to puts them they drive the price up. They control the price
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Was -40% with my calls at some point. Let the Archegos fiasco 2.0 begin 🚀🚀🚀

Also known as the ""smartest kid on the short bus"" award. The article mentions F9 opening to $70 million in the USA. For comparison, F8 opened to $98.7 million, a 30% drop. This is also before factoring for 20/21's significant inflation. While stories of AMC's death have been greatly exaggerated, so too have those of its revival."

What about their Premium offering such as AMC Dine-In? Has AMC been able to ramp up staff to meet demand of these higher margin offerings.  Movie Theaters never make money on ticket sales, all of their profit comes from overpriced high margin food."

2021-06-28 16:23:35,wallstreetbets,"I have access to software that can track foot traffic to retail venues using cell phone locations of the visitors (it's called [Placer.ai](https://Placer.ai) if you want to read about it). Why? Because I work for a commercial real estate company and this kind of thing is necessary for the job. In short, I can see how many people visited AMC locations nationwide at a 1 hour resolution for anytime over the last 4 years.  I can tell you point blank that 2 million guests is not their biggest weekend since 2019 as the weekend of February 15th, 2020 had 2,380,000 guests. Beyond that, their overall traffic is simply anemic compared to what it was. They may have had one decent weekend (it's not really), but weekday visitors are WAY down. For the week ending June 20, their visitor count is down -65.57% compared to the same week in 2019. Oh, and it's down 75% compared to 2018. Want to see a graph of where we are currently?

The company is still drowning in debt and their only hope is to squeeze more money out of the apes who keep the price elevated.  This is going to be tough though because they can't issue any more shares until 2022, and it's unlikely the price will stay elevated that long.  

These sorts of articles get posted in an effort to make it seem like the fundamentals are sound, which they are not, but the irony is they get posted by the same people who say fundamentals don't matter.  

There are a ton of high short interest solid investment ideas floating on these boards, AMC is not one of them."

2021-06-28 17:45:44,wallstreetbets,"What's going on with this($AMC) stock, are the hedges slowly shedding there short position instead all at once in a coordinated effort to  prevent large run up in the stock in a single day or week?"

2021-06-28 14:34:47,wallstreetbets,"not really since the covid-19, the virus really fucked up alot of business and people's living so seeing people still want to spend money watching a movie in a movie theater only means those numbers to go up as more movies drop."
2021-06-28 19:07:06,wallstreetbets,Pussies. I got in at 58.
2021-06-28 19:16:38,wallstreetbets,It was. It still is. I wouldn't be caught dead long AMC--then OR now.
2021-06-28 15:01:35,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-06-28 19:26:39,wallstreetbets,That's because it is you pillock LMAO
2021-06-28 17:15:05,wallstreetbets,This the way
2021-06-28 18:19:48,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t it still? I mean a play is a play. This is WSB and I am on board for the tendies. But AMC is not worth what it is now based on the company, it’s entirely on the squeeze potential"
2021-06-28 16:31:00,wallstreetbets,It's overpriced AF
2021-06-28 11:59:03,wallstreetbets,LFG !

2021-06-28 18:55:18,wallstreetbets,Sequels coming in at the tail end of a franchise tend to do worse.  This happened before COVID.  The Transformer: The Last Knight grossed less than all the previous Transformer's movies.
2021-06-28 12:45:40,wallstreetbets,Very good insight. Thanks.
2021-06-28 17:08:50,wallstreetbets,This is fucking amazing post-pandemic
2021-06-28 12:30:47,wallstreetbets,"> We are in an amazing position. I've been here since $5

No *you* are in an amazing position, as if no matter what happens you will make $$$. Telling people to join you when they have to pay $55 is insanity.

I wish you all the best, but once the dust settles down this will drop to its fair price of 30-40."
2021-06-28 15:03:11,wallstreetbets,Yep!
2021-06-28 16:09:56,wallstreetbets,lol AMC owes $5 billion dollars. That money went to offset a tiny amount of the interest they owed for the day. :)
2021-06-28 17:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Yep, why would someone be so vicious and negative about a stock they shouldn’t care about if they don’t hold it?"

2021-06-28 11:46:03,wallstreetbets,AMC TO THE MOON 🚀
2021-06-28 11:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, not even sure about your numbers but the AMC and GME crowd are pathetic, 2 new movie theaters open for a chain with 1000 and they get hyped and say the stock is going to sore.   It's just so disconnected."
2021-06-28 17:42:58,wallstreetbets,But do those other stocks have retail investors owning 80% of the stock?
2021-06-28 17:59:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I haven't heard of AMC making any substantial changes to the company, BUT I also haven't done any  actual research so I could be mistaken"
2021-06-28 14:39:52,wallstreetbets,"man so many miss the point of a reopening play, yes 2 million isnt alot compared to 2019 but umm i wonder what happened in 2020.... like you fucks have no idea how a reopening play works lol. the fact that there able to rebound with a strong opening when not even all there theaters been open longer then a fucking month just shows you your talking out your ass. God i wish this sub would go back to the days of actual good yolos and not this ""oh amc and gme are over priced"" BS."
2021-06-28 15:04:38,wallstreetbets,You’re an idiot. Not about fundamentals at this juncture.

2021-06-28 14:49:52,wallstreetbets,11.46 here and also already covered my initial investment.  Glad I went for the shares instead of selling a put and hoping for assignment at $10.  Literally cannot lose money at this point; it's just a question of how much profit I can make on this before some other ape's YOLO calls my shares away.

2021-06-28 16:48:08,wallstreetbets,"Ok but you realize that theaters have been... 100% closed for the better part of a year and a half, right?"
2021-06-28 14:44:46,wallstreetbets,Sure but their debt kept increasing YoY even before the pandemic. All COVID-19 did was make that increase faster…
2021-06-28 17:15:34,wallstreetbets,Then short it if you dare.
2021-06-28 16:24:52,wallstreetbets,Also not a lot of good movies out right now.
2021-06-28 13:16:10,wallstreetbets,$30-40? Why do you think AMC is worth 15x more now then back when it was actually profitable 5 years ago?
2021-06-28 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,"This is partially true, but my comment was for the squeeze in general. I'm very happy with my position but I continue to add every payday. I've bought as much as I could all the way up to probably $67 (because that just happened to be the price at the time). 

As far as I'm concerned, this stock is on sale, and considering the high likelihood of synthetic shares, the stock price shown is much cheaper than it's actual worth."
2021-06-28 16:15:09,wallstreetbets,That money doesnt need to be even financed til 2025. Debt is the least of my worries right now.

What's the biggest Disney movie this summer, Black Widow? We need a Thor or Frozen or Toy Story or Avengers or some shit to get a really good feeling of how AMC is going to do fundamentally. For those that care about that sort of thing."
2021-06-28 13:20:26,wallstreetbets,"wdym 15x more? 5 years ago it was pretty much exactly that price, and i agree with the people that claim post-covid will be a great year for AMC. Social sentiment might push it a bit above their fair price point, so i dont think 30-40 is out of this world.

But you could be right and they drop even lower. Wouldnt surprise me aswell."
2021-06-28 16:19:29,wallstreetbets,"They still have to make monthly interest payments on the debt. I'm sure they can kick the debt forward as long as they need as long as the 10%+ interest payment is being made.

My point was your expenses were not money back in to your pocket. AMC stock price has nothing to do with AMC business fundamentals so why even pretend it does? lol"
2021-06-28 14:37:50,wallstreetbets,The fact that your defending a stock that is 30 times as expensive as it was pre-pandemic when 5 times the customers were going to movies shows just how pathetic and delusional you are.

2021-06-28 13:27:50,wallstreetbets,They’ve had 4-1 stock splits. They’re 3x bigger than it was 5 years ago.
2021-06-28 13:55:17,wallstreetbets,"Share price was ~30, but that does not show dilution which has been massive for AMC. Market cap is not affected by dilution, look at the market cap to see how expensive the company is compared to previous years. 

https://companiesmarketcap.com/amc-entertainment/marketcap/"
2021-06-28 16:32:22,wallstreetbets,You're right but their snacks have the biggest profit margin. If next earnings turn out well considering covid is still lingering then im all for buying up overpriced snacks. Free popcorn and soda for shareholders is still nice tho.
2021-06-28 14:42:17,wallstreetbets,OMG yea cause we are sooo buying the stock on fundamentals... lol GTFO here with that shill ass line. Everyone knows we are playing the Squeeze and we all know firms and hedge funds shorted the shit out of this American company during covid to drive it out of bossiness. Get the fuck off WSB if your looking for fundamentals.
2021-06-28 15:55:49,wallstreetbets,"I’m the ape that knows that AMC is so fkn disconnected from “biggest box office since 2019”... which also doesn’t mean ANYTHING for a company trading 10x the market cap it was in 2019. Therefore, this post is beyond useless"

2021-06-28 19:22:16,wallstreetbets,Let’s see you keep risking it cause I can tell you it hasn’t dropped below 50 and that bull pendent looking nasty you shill
2021-06-28 19:21:15,wallstreetbets,So did you do a covered call or did you do cash covered call cause unfortunately certain brokers don’t allow it cause of increased margin requirements. And I know your ass isn’t getting that lambo cause the price only been rising lol
2021-06-28 15:16:32,wallstreetbets,"True but also, as long as there is apes who wanna go watch a movie in a theatre amc will keep making profit. Also i feel this year and the next years will be really profitable for amc among others because of how thirsty is people to go watch a movie in a theatre. Even if they can watch it home they will still want to go watch it at the cinema just because they weren’t able to do so while covid and shit. People will just go to the theatre for the sake of going. Its not about the movie its about the experience. Thats how i see it at least."
2021-06-28 13:59:33,wallstreetbets,"The market cap is now 40x what it was in 2016 despite the share price only doubling as they have been printing new shares to raise money to forestall bankruptcy, brrrrrrr brrrrr."

2021-06-28 14:45:10,wallstreetbets,Then wtf are you doing in a conversation about fundamentals?
2021-06-28 16:36:47,wallstreetbets,And yet you don't understand that positive news for the theater industry as a whole will lead to more AMC fomo buying.
2021-06-28 15:58:10,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂 Sure it is. Keep using your “Fundamental” brain. 🤡
2021-06-28 19:26:52,wallstreetbets,"Nice try, I bought my AMC on April 23, 2020 at 9:57 AM for $3.11 a share. Any other guesses?

It’s still a shit company that has diluted the fuck out of their shares and the only reason it’s worth more than single digits is because it’s a meme. That’s it."
2021-06-28 19:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Okay first off pal, covered calls are not shorting a stock. They're not even in the same asset class--covered calls are a derivative, and shorted stock is an equity. I suggest you read up on what shorting a stock really is because it's obviously not what you think. And no, the price had not been ""only rising"" since $70, it's been doing the exact opposite.


Edit: wtf is a ""cash-secured call""? That's not.. that's not how any of this works"
2021-06-28 15:23:46,wallstreetbets,"I agree with most of that, but the hurdle for holders is are they going to do that enough to cover 2 years of debt and the current market cap.  I doubt they are, but the AMC crowd has done very well so far.  Best of luck to you all."

2021-06-28 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,This ape isn’t going back to a theater post covid.  Watching things at home has really made me enjoy movies so much more than I ever did in a theater pre covid
2021-06-28 14:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Sigh ok this is such a shill tactic oh boy, we’ll have fun shorting it then if your so confident it’s over priced"
2021-06-28 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah the “positive” news
2021-06-28 19:26:08,wallstreetbets,First of all you didn’t read cause I never called it shorting. Haha yo don’t even know what your talking about. I know your ass didn’t borrow any stock you shill
2021-06-28 19:26:31,wallstreetbets,Bro have you looked at the 3 month chart lol your a joke
2021-06-28 18:48:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm not shorting it you muppet, if you think everyone who has a valid opinion on your overvalued stock is a shill then maybe you need to ask yourself wtf your doing."
2021-06-28 19:31:34,wallstreetbets,">First of all you didn’t read cause I never called it shorting.



Oh ok. Let's find your quote. 


>if your so sure on this outcome of bankruptcy then short it


Oops, looks like you did say it. Huh, interesting.


>Haha yo don’t even know what your talking about. 



Oh yeah? What single thing did I say that was incorrect/not true? What's that? Nothing because your clearly don't even know the difference between an equity and a derivative? Cool, yeah, that's what I thought.


>I know your ass didn’t borrow any stock you shill



... Right because this isn't 1976. We don't find our own locates. That's what my broker is for you stupid ass ape. God damn you're dumb."

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else hedge against the market by buying puts on destructive companies that you will to fail? I bet against FB, Twitter, and Coca-Cola today. All disgusting companies. 

FB and Twitter for manipulating us, and FB likely to loose major revenue due to Apples new privacy options, making it so FB can't track people like they used to on Apple devices, but unsure how Apple changes may affect Twitter.

KO(Coca-Cola) for many years of poisoning us and manipulating us emotionally through their commercials. My put is a bet for world consciousness rising up and throwing off the chains of manipulation by these types of companies.

No significantly widely conscious person is drinking cola everyday."

2021-06-28 10:41:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t think there’s going to be a shortage of fat and stupid people anytime soon.
2021-06-28 10:47:18,wallstreetbets,"You are investing with emotion. It's a surefire way to lose money. Nobody else will notice that you bought a put, other than thetagang making money off you."
2021-06-28 10:53:04,wallstreetbets,Incredibly misplaced effort. Just donate or volunteer for causes that help benefit people effected by these companies you don’t like. Also go learn what hedging means.
2021-06-28 10:40:50,wallstreetbets,"I read:

""Anyone else stand on train tracks because they hate trains?"" 

Godspeed 😂"
2021-06-28 10:48:13,wallstreetbets,"Horrible decision. You're betting against highly successful companies with consistent growth based on emotions. Facebook has been attacked by the media and the public for years, and it hasn't put a dent in the company's revenue or earnings growth. What makes you believe that will change now?"
2021-06-28 10:46:52,wallstreetbets,Learn how to separate your money from your emotions.  And you’ve convinced yourself that the majority of people feel the way you do.  That’s how you lose money.
2021-06-28 10:41:18,wallstreetbets,Please send me your money rather than set it on fire. I will put it to better uses.
2021-06-28 10:39:29,wallstreetbets,"Betting against fb? You like losing money?

Have you seen the avg American? They definitely drink coke everyday."
2021-06-28 11:03:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah but those companies make money which shareholders care about more than any of that other stuff you mentioned
2021-06-28 11:19:03,wallstreetbets,This guy is about to find out how PC the market really is.
2021-06-28 10:57:52,wallstreetbets,"80% of Americans are fat and still drink soda.

Everyone is forced to use FB in some way. 

Apple is a cult. 

You are one brave retarded ape"
2021-06-28 10:46:13,wallstreetbets,What the fuck do you want...a cookie?
2021-06-28 10:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Never invest or bet with emotion, you're breaking rule #1"
2021-06-28 11:45:01,wallstreetbets,Puts on the human race
2021-06-28 11:16:41,wallstreetbets,My grandma who knocks back a 12 pack of Diet Coke a day would like to talk you
2021-06-28 11:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Don’t invest emotionally retard. Obviously we all want to short FB, but you can’t cuck the zucc."
2021-06-28 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,"Wow, nice job betting against huge, profitable, evil companies - let me know how your port looks in a month.

Calls on Suzie's Flowers and Johnny Mac's Hug Emporium."
2021-06-28 11:29:50,wallstreetbets,I fucking love coke cola... probably more addicted to that shit then I was heroin...
2021-06-28 11:36:45,wallstreetbets,"FB is cancer, Twitter is cancer, coke is cancer. Agreed on all of those.


But I still don't see a cure for it, anywhere!

Just manifesting their decline does not work."
2021-06-28 11:06:58,wallstreetbets,Woah buddy I love Coke. I’ll fight you over those comments
2021-06-28 10:44:55,wallstreetbets,Those are literally companies that do well In a inflation environment. Target the smaller cap companies that are fragile.
2021-06-28 10:49:19,wallstreetbets,"In order to remain objective, I leave my personal feelings at the door.   


Understanding market sentiment is important but understanding when it doesn't matter is doubly so."
2021-06-28 10:56:20,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not quite the same level of antipathy towards them but I've been buying puts on canadian theater chain Cineplex (CGX.TO). Basically AMC without the meme factor and with much stronger government controls making ongoing lockdowns more likely. Mostly just a bet that the delta variant shuts down theatres that have already reopened and keeps closed the ones that are still closed (Ontario) and the stock price tanks again.

I hate the price gouging for concessions and 25 minutes of commercials before the previews even start, but that's secondary. Buying puts out of pure spite... good luck.  Might be better off finding companies where you have a strong conviction they'll drop and a mild dislike for the company itself, rather than other way around."
2021-06-28 10:58:18,wallstreetbets,maybe finding companies surviving only by cheap financing would be a better bet. ie companies who are barely able to service their debt who would really struggle if interest rates went up
2021-06-28 11:48:50,wallstreetbets,I hedge by buying puts on nikola after it goes up for a few days. I don’t like the stock
2021-06-28 13:04:52,wallstreetbets,"I lol'ed at ""manipulating us emotionally through their commercials"".

What are you, 5?"
2021-06-28 10:55:07,wallstreetbets,I find that coca cola is the best drink to wash my crayons down with
2021-06-28 14:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Here I was expecting cigarettes, weapons manufacturers or some company dumping chemical waste in Nepal...and the best OP can find for an ""evil"" company is Coca-fucking-cola?

Disappointed."
2021-06-28 10:51:04,wallstreetbets,"I like your thought process theoretically, but the world (not Americans) are stupid as fuck. They give kids in Indonesia cigarettes, they probably think coke is a health drink in se Asia. People say Americans are dumb, wait till Americans travel the world and see how dumb some people are. Europeans are insanely stuck up and consider themselves better than Americans too, but they are generally just as dumb if not dumber (see Ali g, or average Italian)"
2021-06-28 11:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Emotions and trade don’t go well together, don’t stand on banana 🍌 skin"
2021-06-28 11:12:23,wallstreetbets,As an Ecom store owner I can confirm FB ads are a complete shitshow now … the problem is that there isn’t a better way to get customers
2021-06-28 11:44:04,wallstreetbets,Priced in already
2021-06-28 11:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Twitter IMO is going to tank sooner or later so focus on that one if you must do this, buying puts on the other two is dumb AF"
2021-06-28 12:07:14,wallstreetbets,Listen kid. I’m just here to make money.
2021-06-28 13:03:41,wallstreetbets,Currently drinking a Diet Coke and laughing
2021-06-28 13:03:44,wallstreetbets,"I bet against Nike, it is overbought with huge gap that need to refill."
2021-06-28 13:45:56,wallstreetbets,I appreciate the spirit but I don’t think this is a good money making plan
2021-06-28 13:48:09,wallstreetbets,Your entire strategy here doesn't revolve around these companies and their declining business models; it requires most people to become intelligent and healthy. Bullish on room temperature IQ and diabetes.
2021-06-28 14:15:23,wallstreetbets,"If you want to do something like this why not invest in companies that you think are more ""moral"" instead of betting against Giants?"
2021-06-28 14:17:50,wallstreetbets,Me and every other fat person drinking Diet Coke will knife fight u mate.
2021-06-28 14:24:31,wallstreetbets,"WTF even is a “significantly widely conscious person”?!  Coca-Cola has given me more joy than the vast majority of corporations, and far more than government or civil society (apart from maybe my college).  I don’t invest in companies I love but please keep losing money to those who do."
2021-06-28 14:38:24,wallstreetbets,Puts on banks
2021-06-28 14:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Coca cola sells a ton of products many of which you may not realize are coke products and an important thing to note is that those types of companies are very aware of the shoft toward ""healthy"" dietary decisions and have/are expanded in that direction."
2021-06-28 15:04:11,wallstreetbets,Tried with Twitter (I was banned for life for a very funny joke) and lost money. These corps operate they way they do because governments and such need them
2021-06-28 15:15:57,wallstreetbets,i bought puts on Seaworld because they are a shit company with an unexplained 200+% gain this year.  Fuck Seaworld.  My puts have not been doing well.
2021-06-28 15:16:32,wallstreetbets,Coca cola isn't going anywhere from $54 for a bit
2021-06-28 15:30:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean Coca-Cola is a business that sells drinks, they're hardly Enron or halliburton."
2021-06-28 15:51:49,wallstreetbets,"I also dislike all the companies you mentioned, but there's too many people out there consuming their garbage."
2021-06-28 15:56:07,wallstreetbets,"the most upvoted comment here speaks for itself, there's no shortage of fat or stupid people so these companies will keep printing cash.

It's really hard to bet against large tech because the timing is just so tough when you go short or buy put options.  I bought a ton of puts on UBER a while ago, hate the company, hate how they treat drivers, and I don't think their valuation is worth at all where its at.  I got lucky and UBER tanked and I got a quick profit, but if nothing happened or it tanked after my puts expired I would have lost 100%.  

It's a tough game, so best to focus on going long companies you like and not holding companies you don't.  If you want to bet against anything, I'd recommend learning how to read charts, in particular candle studies, and using that to time your short positions so you can get in and out without losing all your money."
2021-06-28 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,RIP in peace
2021-06-28 18:19:17,wallstreetbets,"I think FB is a great buy. I'm currently saving up to buy some of their shares. They're not going away anytime soon, and they're still growing into different industries. 

Betting against coke cola isn't a bad play. Americans want healthier choices. And I think the demand of healthier products will grow. Young generations are turning away from soda completely."
2021-06-28 18:22:50,wallstreetbets,I love coca cola. I use with moderation.
2021-06-28 11:03:29,wallstreetbets,I lost a lot on seaworld puts doing the same thing.
2021-06-28 11:23:19,wallstreetbets,😂😂Delete this bra
2021-06-28 11:41:24,wallstreetbets,I'm drinking a coke rn with your money in it.
2021-06-28 11:43:17,wallstreetbets,"You might be on to something with the $AAPL privacy update versus $FB ads thing, but all these are still not moves I would make. Maybe there are some companies that would do significantly better thanks to those you don't like doing worse? Sounds like a more likely way to make some money on either outcome, (as long as the company doesn't bet its entirely existence on your disliked companies failing) but I'm not a financial advisor, I drink Coke, and hold six shares of $KO. Puts on my teeth."
2021-06-28 11:15:32,wallstreetbets,"I support you ideologically 100%. Wish the average person was evolved enough to not be using any of those companies. Firmly believe someday they will be. Not sure that day has arrived yet. But there was that soccer player who dissed KO very publicly, causing it to lose 4 billion off its market value in one trading day, so that’s encouraging.

Still though... I think FB (and IG) in particular are too insidious as a social substitute, especially because of lockdown, how they double as dating platforms (unofficial, but doesn’t matter), and how they’ve got the big spread of boomer, millennial and zoomer demographics. Boomers aren’t going to move on from Facebook, and they’re increasingly comfortable using its marketplace, which will continue to generate revenue."
2021-06-28 11:23:29,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure if conscientious trading and making money go hand in hand.  But good luck.
2021-06-28 11:45:45,wallstreetbets,Keep fighting the good fight! You'll be doing it off ramen noodles though.
2021-06-28 12:00:57,wallstreetbets,"I have always lost money when I have tried it.  Even companies that later went bankrupt.
My tuition."
2021-06-28 12:02:53,wallstreetbets,Loosening major revenue is probably good for cash flow.
2021-06-28 12:03:48,wallstreetbets,LMAO having faith in the world to go against big tech 😂 they literally can’t make up their own minds they just have people on the internet make it for them.
2021-06-28 12:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Love the DD, going all in on PUTs"
2021-06-28 12:37:36,wallstreetbets,... investing bases upon what you hope will happen isn’t a compelling strategy if you ask me.
2021-06-28 12:55:45,wallstreetbets,"mouths, hearts, guts, groin.  

Calls on anything in those businesses."
2021-06-28 13:22:32,wallstreetbets,No. Trading on emotion is the best way to lose money…
2021-06-28 13:29:36,wallstreetbets,ok but what your puts expiration ?
2021-06-28 13:54:36,wallstreetbets,I’d happily sell you all the fb twitter and KO puts you want.
2021-06-28 16:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Do it on GEO, there is no worst company probably"
2021-06-28 18:30:56,wallstreetbets,You bought FB puts… today? RIP
2021-06-28 10:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Fuck FANGS, they rape, manipulate,  lie and steal."
2021-06-28 12:39:54,wallstreetbets,Don’t bet against Zuck. Just don’t.
2021-06-28 10:56:43,wallstreetbets,puts on healthy intelligent people
2021-06-28 10:49:45,wallstreetbets,Hahaha
2021-06-28 12:58:50,wallstreetbets,I am a fat stupid person who checked Facebook while drinking a coke just before I read this.
2021-06-28 10:55:47,wallstreetbets,Haha
2021-06-28 14:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Very true.   Even when they die early (easily preventable, hilariously whatever) humans pump out more fat and stupid people at an alarming pace."
2021-06-28 14:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Agree, a cheap and easy pleasure for some.  Not a healthy choice but that is beside the point."
2021-06-28 15:08:03,wallstreetbets,Coca Cola sells more then just Soda
2021-06-28 18:12:26,wallstreetbets,Perfect articulation on that point. NOVO a good one for that diabetes play too.
2021-06-28 11:12:20,wallstreetbets,"Monthly .20 Delta puts have a premium of 0.32 and a volume of 4. That's an roi of .6 a month. 

Even gang bangers aren't making money off that my guy."
2021-06-28 10:50:27,wallstreetbets,Right? There’s silly and then there’s just plain stupid.
2021-06-28 13:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Already gave away the freebie, but have an upvote, sir."
2021-06-28 15:50:25,wallstreetbets,Have it.
2021-06-28 18:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Facebook hides behind their incredibly misleading and intentionally informative MAU numbers. Show me the DAU trend for the last couple years, Facebook. What are you hiding?"
2021-06-28 11:44:41,wallstreetbets,"This. When I first started investing I remember only half joking when I said I was gonna invest in the most evil companies because they will always put profit above everything else. Facebook, Amazon, and various oil stocks have all done very well for me."
2021-06-28 12:45:39,wallstreetbets,Sell him the puts!
2021-06-28 10:59:03,wallstreetbets,I definintly do. Different kind of coke tho.
2021-06-28 11:26:22,wallstreetbets,Is corporate debt variable?
2021-06-28 11:07:54,wallstreetbets,"American here, can confirm we've got an abundance of fucktards too. Consider how fucking stupid the average person is, now consider that half of all people are dumber than that. Stupidity has no borders."
2021-06-28 12:18:49,wallstreetbets,What are you selling?
2021-06-28 11:04:04,wallstreetbets,"The idiocracy strategy, it'll take time but long term this one has real potential"
2021-06-28 12:05:30,wallstreetbets,Thank God I'm safe
2021-06-28 18:42:34,wallstreetbets,DAU is more important. Regular users drive most of the revenue.

2021-06-28 15:01:37,wallstreetbets,Yep waiting for onlyfans to go public too
2021-06-28 11:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Worth noting it’s just some Karens who go into local businesses in Canada and fuck around with intimidation regarding the mask rules here. The police treat them the same as when they run into “sovereign citizens”. 

Notwithstanding, I think other posters have it right when they say there is no shortage of stupid consumers who still want that coke and fb."
2021-06-28 11:56:57,wallstreetbets,"What in the actual fuck lol. I had to google that but, yeah... you've got a very valid point there"
2021-06-28 13:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Hey I gave my reasons. Sure, if enough people cancel their subscription things would change but that’s never going to happen. Losing My $150ish dollars a year isn’t going to hurt them so may as well watch their shows and own some stock."

2021-06-28 10:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Not gonna lie. Jealous of your resources.

I own 2k in it and will likely increase when salary comes in.

WISH has amazing momentum.

WISH 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-28 10:35:47,wallstreetbets,LFG!!! Best of luck! Balls deep in shares for me
2021-06-28 11:31:05,wallstreetbets,WISH looking good so far today.

2021-06-28 11:07:55,wallstreetbets,WISH will hit 17 either this Friday or next Monday.
2021-06-28 11:32:20,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand calls. I see low price, I buy."
2021-06-28 12:17:24,wallstreetbets,This right here is wishful thinking.
2021-06-28 10:41:27,wallstreetbets,$LFG 🚀🌝
2021-06-28 12:35:52,wallstreetbets,"LoL, if it's burning a hole in your pocket I'll take it.  Why give it to the HFs."
2021-06-28 12:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Let’s break that $15 wall boys. 

I wished upon 200 shares and a pair of diamond hands."
2021-06-28 14:56:53,wallstreetbets,WISH is going over $20 this week!!!
2021-06-28 11:47:14,wallstreetbets,"As of right now, he is up $14,625."
2021-06-28 13:24:51,wallstreetbets,Wish to the moon baby
2021-06-28 13:57:19,wallstreetbets,Let’s go you utter fucking retard
2021-06-28 11:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Now this is one big ball swinging silverback, $WISH i had more than one silver hair on my back"
2021-06-28 13:16:04,wallstreetbets,"this isn't a traditional retard ape yolo. it's a LEAP position. i believe OP will use these to sell covered calls at shorter expirations, in order to capitalize on the FOMO he is trying to create in the sub."
2021-06-28 13:07:20,wallstreetbets,"U belong here with the apes , and autistic degens tbh"
2021-06-28 14:13:38,wallstreetbets,"Long 1950 shares, fuck yeah!"
2021-06-28 14:41:30,wallstreetbets,A WISH is a dream your heart makes....
2021-06-28 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,Congratulations! 🍾 I’m not selling cause I only have few shares
2021-06-28 12:39:31,wallstreetbets,Just bought the dip below 15. 50 more shares
2021-06-28 13:40:12,wallstreetbets,Ugh the IV is disgusting on this stock though. Far too much risk for an options play. Makes much more sense to go for shares in this scenario.
2021-06-28 13:02:10,wallstreetbets,Pussy should have got OTM ones with expiry this week
2021-06-28 16:44:13,wallstreetbets,Buy shares to drive price up. These calls seem so expensive that you only get like 2x the share value… but you are giving no support to your stock. Buy shares IMO 80% and then buy some more aggressive calls. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-28 11:48:46,wallstreetbets,Damn you're gunna be sad when that never happens
2021-06-28 12:51:41,wallstreetbets,A soup kitchen bowl and spoon forming on the 1 month
2021-06-28 13:47:23,wallstreetbets,"I remember you from GME in Jan, any method to this madness (YOLO)?"
2021-06-28 14:10:07,wallstreetbets,"Well, I bought $1000 of actual stock.  So i got that going for me.  which is nice."
2021-06-28 14:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Wow youre almost 100x more retarded than I am good for you

I have a wish calls position too lol"
2021-06-28 14:31:21,wallstreetbets,Oh i hope this works out on the right side of things for you...
2021-06-28 15:36:34,wallstreetbets,Wish is going to be huge long term
2021-06-28 16:45:51,wallstreetbets,Sold at $15
2021-06-28 15:18:25,wallstreetbets,"What is a ""call""?"
2021-06-28 17:02:48,wallstreetbets,Sold at peak I hope..
2021-06-28 10:39:06,wallstreetbets,"You’re right! They have a delta close to 90. 

This strategy let me buy control of $480k worth of stock for about half price, though, so it seemed to be the right way to go."
2021-06-28 11:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but at least it's somewhat degenerate, mofos are out here buying stocks and not only are they not being ridiculed but we're upvoting them"
2021-06-28 12:00:47,wallstreetbets,Leveraged to the tits. I bet this dude would Bill Hwang it if they let him
2021-06-28 11:10:29,wallstreetbets,You could tell someone wasn't happy with a possible $15 break
2021-06-28 11:20:36,wallstreetbets,"RSI is high right now.  I don't think it's a good time to buy calls at this moment, even though the overall trend is up."
2021-06-28 13:05:07,wallstreetbets,Prove it
2021-06-28 17:32:35,wallstreetbets,Send the dick or ban!
2021-06-28 12:24:47,wallstreetbets,I’m proud of you simple Jack
2021-06-28 13:55:31,wallstreetbets,"It has been spoken, one must never go full retard. 

Good luck 🍀"
2021-06-28 13:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Very cool username. If this hits, you should change your name to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis because you’ve definitely graduated from cytokine storm at that point!"
2021-06-28 17:35:47,wallstreetbets,Ever did a 69 before?
2021-06-28 11:12:14,wallstreetbets,I assume markets will be closed Monday to observe the holiday right?
2021-06-28 11:33:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, we'll see where the calls take WISH.  Hopefully in that range or higher."
2021-06-28 11:37:55,wallstreetbets,Same!
2021-06-28 14:26:41,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-28 12:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Holy balls, now $24,375. Great move picking an ITM leap, my monkey meat brain would’ve chosen weeklies only."
2021-06-28 13:40:36,wallstreetbets,"It would be a good strategy! Not what I'm going to do, though. 

My plan is to exit these if we drop below $12, or if we fail to crack $17 within 2 weeks. Even if I were to write the 07/09 $20c against these, it would be more of a pain in the ass than it's worth. 

My broker is convenient for me to use, as it's connected to my back. Commissions are high, though, and opening up a calendar or diagonal spread requires a phone call, which often has a several hour hold time. 

My main reason for going for long dates and deep ITM are to mitigate losses if I have to close out at $12."
2021-06-28 14:32:22,wallstreetbets,"Going for deep ITM calls with long expiries negates much of the IV, though. It also profoundly mitigates theta costs. 

These calls have a 90 delta, so the price movement compared to shares is almost 1:1. The advantage of this play, though, is that it let me buy control of $480k worth of stock for only about half that price. 

It's kind of like buying shares at 2:1 margin, but without any of the interest."
2021-06-28 12:28:29,wallstreetbets,"You are living sad life my bruh. Get in the train before it blows up.
Wish to 100🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-28 14:34:19,wallstreetbets,This is only about 10% of my portfolio. Just to kind of keep things spicy hot.
2021-06-28 18:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Nope!!! Still in. 

Plan is to abandon ship at $12, or if we fail to crack through $17 within 2 weeks. Either outcome would suggest that this trend isn't as powerful as I believe it to be. 

If we hit $12 within 2 weeks, there will be an IV pump, meaning that I will still have $4.50 of intrinsic value, and likely $2 of extrinsic value. This limits my potential downsides to about 17%

Currently, I'm up by about 4% (roughly $10k)."
2021-06-28 12:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Do you have the capital to exercise at any point or are you all in on the option?  I guess that's one way to expose yourself to higher upside without having to shell out the bones for all 487,500 shares but won't it be difficult to dump those calls?  Or do I just misunderstand options trading of deep ITM calls?"
2021-06-28 19:01:29,wallstreetbets,"When you sell, don't you get killed on the spread since its wider the more ITM it is?"
2021-06-28 19:32:31,wallstreetbets,dont get it? its a call option with what strike price?
2021-06-28 17:33:22,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang was the motherfucking man until he wasn't.
2021-06-28 11:19:31,wallstreetbets,People don’t understand that it’s pegged at 15 right now because of gamma. People need to buy calls at a strike of like 20 or 25 then the gamma will increase at those levels and it could have a squeeze
2021-06-28 13:15:03,wallstreetbets,Or ban
2021-06-28 13:54:28,wallstreetbets,He went full retard.
2021-06-28 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,Do we fuks? Dm number. I'm embarrassed fruitski!
2021-06-28 11:15:04,wallstreetbets,"Oops, you are right, next Tuesday then based on current cycle. WISH sure is taking it slow."
2021-06-28 12:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Be patient, WISH is not a pump and dump like BB or CLOVER, it will take some time. There is nothing crazy behind it, just returning to its IPO price of 24 which is what it should be valued at."
2021-06-28 14:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention I didn't have to risk the farm to do it.  Ive more than doubled my 💰.  I long, and didn't chance losing an options premium... 😝"
2021-06-28 14:28:38,wallstreetbets,I'm up a hell of a lot more than that in GME.  You mad bro?
2021-06-28 12:51:48,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-28 14:46:27,wallstreetbets,i see! nice hedge strat. hopefully it works out.
2021-06-28 14:50:01,wallstreetbets,You misused the flair then
2021-06-28 12:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Oh I think I see, you collect the profit of 487500 shares going up instead of 325000 shares going up if you sell the calls.  That's a pretty good strategy actually as long as it doesn't go down since you would lose the value of extra shares if it went down.  I'll have to keep that in mind in case I want to lose extra money."
2021-06-28 12:20:49,wallstreetbets,not really a reason to ever exercise a leap... you can sell covered calls against the leap until you hit a profit target youre comfortable with to sell the leap itself; if you make enough premium off the PMCCs you basically gamble for free if you play it right
2021-06-28 17:13:21,wallstreetbets,"You wouldn't exercise the option, you would just resell it.  Assuming there is enough volume as an option goes further ITM. Also, the spread could widen."
2021-06-28 19:21:10,wallstreetbets,http://opcalc.com/wXZ
2021-06-28 11:31:43,wallstreetbets,People like you?  Go for it man.
2021-06-28 11:48:17,wallstreetbets,Yea exactly
2021-06-28 13:08:23,wallstreetbets,"I prefer to peg 18+. But I totally understand why you'd strike a 20-25, they're annoying..."
2021-06-28 11:55:22,wallstreetbets,I am selling July covered call between 20 - 26 strike.
2021-06-28 12:49:00,wallstreetbets,Don't you also need shares to fuel that? It always makes me wonder when I see someone buy only calls and not a single share
2021-06-28 13:09:34,wallstreetbets,15 is too young man. Where do you live- Saudi Arabia?
2021-06-28 11:20:53,wallstreetbets,Dude this glass ceiling (for lack of a better term) @ 15 is nuts
2021-06-28 12:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Oof, you should google pump and dump before you use the term."
2021-06-28 14:37:49,wallstreetbets,"Smart move deleting those comments.


Who's throwing the tantrum.  Your the one who got mad bro.  Also, someone with less than 200 post karma gonna tell me I don't belong here... LoL.  I see how you get your karma making comments.  Funny you deleted the comment i was responding to... Triggered much, much to much."
2021-06-28 14:12:12,wallstreetbets,25 is 10% of 250
2021-06-28 14:30:44,wallstreetbets,I'm at about a 10% return in the past 5 hours.
2021-06-28 15:13:44,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 thanks for the clarification
2021-06-28 14:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. You're hurting that movement. You sell it to retail then a market maker doesn't hedge the delta. You sell it to a market maker and they short the delta. Its not even a smart move; the stock is clearly trending up, which means increasing IV and a higher point to sell CCs from in the near future."
2021-06-28 16:45:40,wallstreetbets,Free loading on others buying stock…
2021-06-28 14:18:24,wallstreetbets,Daytraders scalping 5DTE 15c. People need to buy higher strikes further out. July and August monthlies at this point at 17.5 and 20.
2021-06-28 12:40:24,wallstreetbets,"I know pump and dump better than anyone after I held bags from BB, but I cut my loss and moved on, you should do the same."
2021-06-28 15:07:10,wallstreetbets,"You are right, but I need cash to survive on, because I am ALL IN.  I recognize that I am at risk for significantly capping any upside potential."
2021-06-28 14:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Or just buy and hold the stocks right? Seems like the fundamentals alone will bring the price up and the shorts keep holding it down, only to surpass the strike most calls need by the next trading day or AH. That said, I've never messed with options because I don't fully understand or appreciate the process. So if that didn't make sense its because I've been munching on the purple crayons all morning 🤣"
2021-06-28 12:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Dont assume stuff m8. The only bags i was holding dropped after GME shot up again...and i sold them for a profit.

My point is, calling BB a pump n dump is pretty stupid. Check my other comments if you think im a BBagholder. Im literally telling people to chill on that stock until its not as manipulated as it is anymore. But it absolutely will be a great stock in the future.

No idea about clov, not going to comment on that."
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $SOFI will be SOFLY - My $78,000 YOLO into $SOFI and why this company has great potential - The stock that costs short sellers 222.82% to borrow, and why I like the stock Listen up boys, the moment I heard SOFI was going public was the moment I dropped a lot of money into it, used the app for a long time and they're going to be dominating the FinTech sector. First off here's YOLO Proof: https://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - the total gains reflected is not accurate as I rolled a lot of my July contracts to October for similar pricing.
Onto the DD:

-	GALILEO, the B2B Monster - This company you probably never heard of got acquired by Sofi last year. They are a payment processing platform that financial tech companies use to process payments, issue company branded debit cards. A similar company Marqeta $MQ which powers $SQ debit cards is valued at 15 Billion ALONE. Galileo is only one subdivision of the SOFI conglomerate, as of this writing $SOFI is valued 16.83 Billion. Over 90% of all digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 Fintech companies use Galileo, it speaks for itself. https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe

-	The shorts and Goliath - This stock has been shorted with an insane borrow fee of 222.82%. Shortable stocks shows 'Zero Borrow', but still lists 45000 shares available. Fintel shows on 06/24 there are '0' SOFI short shares available. I don't see why this stock is so shorted, but it is a company that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya via IPOE. Just like CLOV and SPCE before this. - forewarning, a lockup period expires for  shareholders today. Trying to find exact number. Do research on exact number of shares being unlocked but something to be aware of. I believe a lot of people sold in anticipation of insiders selling, but I'm a firm believer in the company nonetheless.

-	SOFI is applying to become a national bank to get their cost of money down, and they have attempted to speed that process up by acquiring a small bank and infusing cash into it:
https://imgur.com/a/SEeFYKm
The one stop shop -
SOFI's goal is to become a one stop shop for consumers. Banking, lending, credit cards, trade stocks, provides insurance, everything. This is the one thing I have yet to see any FinTech attempt. Most FinTech's stick to a singular product but SOFI is seeking to service everyone's financial needs in one app. SOFI's revenue will only continue to grow as if a new member joins they'll likely use more than just the initial service they got on board with.

-	SOFI Invest - I think this is probably the most important platform for them to be working. When Robinhood Robin hooded us back in February, everyone was looking for another platform to go onto. A lot of people went to Fidelity, a lot stayed, and a few went to SOFI, this is SOFI's short fall. They do not have margin yet and no options currently, but Anthony Noto, the CEO of SOFI announced that it's on their road map: https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD

I believe they're aware of of the importance of adding options and margin and I'm hoping itll be soon as they're 100% getting my business after they do so. SOFI Hong Kong already has margin as well.
-	SOFI Stadium, come on, what a chad company flexing a stadium even though they're new to the game.   

At the end I like this company, they have great potential to become a dominating

Disclaimer: These opinions are of my own, I own $Sofi options, and SOFI Shares. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. This is my opinion and as always do your own research! 

TL;DR: A great financial tech company that has a lot of potential, earnings are around the corner August 11, 2021, BULLISH AF"

2021-06-28 13:11:25,wallstreetbets,I've been buying this since it was IPOE.  I bought more today on the dip.  At 1500 shares currently.
2021-06-28 11:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Buying SoFi at these levels is like buying $SQ at $60, the upside is so low-risk and immense. I’m increasing my position today, heavy. Absolute no-brainer."

Good luck to all"

Pretty hilarious that your trades are public on their social media platform so you get to hear people's opinions of your trades. Sell a stock they like? Get called a homophobic slur lol"

2021-06-28 13:04:55,wallstreetbets,I just looked this company up on my TD ameritrade app and it says that it is shorted 146% of the float. What does that mean and how will that affect the stock price?

2021-06-28 13:21:15,wallstreetbets,"The short borrow rate is so high because PIPE holders (who bought at $10) are allowed to box their position (short stock or buy puts to lock-in profit). They can’t sell their shares directly, but their prime brokers will allow them to short and have a covered position (won’t get margin called). There are probably some folks just shorting to short, but the large number of covered shorts means this is very unlikely to become a short squeeze. 

Otherwise, agree with you and think SOFI is a solid company to invest in. Cheers!"
2021-06-28 10:26:26,wallstreetbets,"People have no idea where this is headed. As soon as Robinhood and Stripe hit the markets, they will realize SOFI offers what both of these companies do and has crazy growth over the past year."

2021-06-28 15:04:19,wallstreetbets,"SoFi started as a student loan refinancer. All the millennials that graduated in the early 2010s are very familiar with them. They would consolidate your loans for very good rates. I didn't happen to use them but I did get a quote etc.. ultimately opted not to consolidate because I wanted to alter my payment artificially so I could by a house(took my 10 year payment out to 25 years graduated plan but kept paying double my monthly payment. Just had to hide it on paper to change my debt load to buy my first house.)  

Either way. Now SoFi is branching fulling into all things finances from loans to credit cards, stocks, and other banking needs. 

They're attempting to me millennial banking. All from one app and a one stop shop. 

So while they will eventually have some aspects of Robinhood. Full blown stock trading. They have much more. 

I don't own any shares in SoFI but I have been sitting on October calls."
2021-06-28 13:12:38,wallstreetbets,"It's more primarily a loan services provider/online bank(kinda). It does offer some trading, but no options. I think it's in the same boat as Robinhood where they don't have the cash on hand to cover the clearinghouses collateral demands."

There are 120 million PIPE shares, look at the daily volume (before today and yesterday especially) it’s easily possible that a vast majority of that shorting was coming from PIPE holders.

Yeah, if you and your parents went to Ivy league schools.  It started as a ""help the rich use the other rich to gain more advantages for the rich"" which worked pretty well, when you don't offer loans to people that aren't incredibly well connected you don't have any defaulters.  But no, 90% of millennials didn't have that level of connection so don't have anything to do with SOFI, by their own design.

I can see people heavily adopting an all in one fleshed out banking app. People use Robinhood even though it robs them blind because it looks pretty. SoFi in my opinion can do the same thing (hopefully not the robbing part.)

Basically the opposite. Didn't appear like SoFi cared. I got plastered with advertisements and so did my new hire coworkers at the time.

Maybe I should have been more specific. All the millennials that graduated from college with student loans in the early 2010s are very familiar with them by name because they got advertised to heavily because their only business at the time was student loan refinancing."
2021-06-28 13:38:59,wallstreetbets,"More like, they just added trading stocks a little while ago. They haven't built it up to be a huge hunk of the app yet.

Gene editing stocks are up because of a breakthrough phase 1 trial of CRISPR gene editing tech showing the ability to genetically edit cells inside a liver. EDIT also rose after news it has started enrollment in the first of two studies evaluating EDIT-101 for the treatment of a rare genetic illness that causes blindness.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/editas-edit-begins-enrollment-in-kids-arm-of-gene-drug-study-2021-06-24

http://nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/edit/short-interest

While Goldman is shorting the stock, Editas's CEO bought nearly $1.2 million worth of EDIT back in early March. Editas's tech has already cured a rare heart disease, and - hold on to your seat - may be able to reverse diabetes.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/26/1009817539/he-inherited-a-devastating-disease-a-crispr-gene-editing-breakthrough-stopped-it

Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis developed a way to use gene editing system CRISPR-Cas9 to edit a mutation in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then turn them into beta cells. When transplanted into mice, the cells reversed preexisting diabetes in a lasting way.

What’s more, Editas just announced that it’s enrolling the first of two planned pediatric cohorts in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of EDIT-101. This comes after getting an endorsement from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to proceed.  
  
This tells us that the EDIT-101 safety data must be very strong. And the team must be seeing signs of efficacy at lower doses as well. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense to start dosing children with the therapy."

Please understand the nuances of CRISPR technology and gene editing.  

It's a metric fuck ton easier to *silence* (aka turn-off) a gene using CRISPR than it is to actually repair a gene with a mutation.  The results from NTLA are for turning off a gene.  They haven't actually corrected any genes. Other success with CRISPR is largely relegated to ex-vivo editing ideas. 

CRISPR is very good at cutting DNA, so it doesn't matter if your repair process is bad when you want to turn something off.  In fact, you want a bad repair process when turning off something, because it ends up silencing the gene.  When you need to actually repair a gene, however, you need much better repair.  For CRISPR, that's largely mediated by the NHEJ and HDR pathways. Both of those are pretty inefficient, and very difficult to control for a myriad of reasons.  NTLA picked a very good application, because therapeutic benefits occur when you shut something off.  

There's still a long, looooong way to go though for when it comes to fixing a defective gene that you need and can't shutoff.  There will be successes....it'll highly depend on how wisely companies pick their indications.  But after the euphoria wears off, over the long run, profits will actually matter.  It'll take some time before we are all convinced that indications with very limited populations will be able to produce meaningful profits."

Good afternoon fellow autists, I will be introducing you guys to a DD so good you'll have to clear your search history when you finish reading. La-Z-Boy is the stock you'll be able to eat your tendies while reclined back on it.

&#x200B;

[The Brand](https://preview.redd.it/gerhbswfl0871.jpg?width=548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b63ec7a9b4eba5aa615b5364312b179ef515840)

La-Z-Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States. They are based out of Monroe, Michigan. They manufacture home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs, and sleeper sofas. Their furniture is sold in thousands of different retail outlets across the States and Canada. They are licensed and distributed in many other countries across the globe. They also hold more than 200 different patents for their products.

If you struggle with calculating the tip on a restaurant bill without using your phone this part may be a little hard to understand but stay with me fellow smooth brains as I navigate through LZB's financials.

La-Z-Boy posted earnings on June 14th they were as follows:

The company reported $0.87 earnings per share for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of $0.74 by $0.13. They had revenue of $519.50 million during the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $498.53 million. During the same quarter in the prior year, they posted $0.49 EPS. La-Z-Boy's quarterly revenue was up 41.4% compared to the same quarter last year. They also recently announced a quarterly dividend. Following this great earnings report the stock dropped nearly 15% due to supply chain concerns. It is now trading at about 30% below its fair value of $53.39 as per [Nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) As stated in the earnings report as of June 15th they have orders currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to demand levels never seen before.

If some of you keyboard creatures haven't been outside lately let me tell you they've been putting up houses faster then you can lose you're life savings on some 1DTE OTM calls. Guess what has to be put into these new houses furniture and lots of it. That is what is causing the record levels of demands because people like to relax comfortably. I will be pulling some quotes from a recent [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2021/06/15/la-z-boy-q4-proves-home-is-where-the-money-is/?sh=57ef2a0b4000) article to describe to you guys how big this demand is.

"" By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%. ""

"" For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability.

Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.""

Still following all this great news the stock sold off massively. And to put the cherry on top $LZB is still well below the furniture industry average. LaZBoy has a trailing-twelve-months P/E of 14.69X compared to the Furniture industry's P/E of 16.45X.

&#x200B;

$LZB has a current market cap of 1.96B. Their share price as of now is $37.85 & they have a average volume of 853k. Option IV is low priced in the 40%'s. In my opinion this is a great swing trade as I think they will bounce back from the steep drop relatively soon as they were already undervalued as is.

I'm no TA Wizard but I took the liberty of looking over $LZB' s recent chart and saw a very bullish indicator.

As you can see the 1 day chart formed a textbook recliner. One of the most bullish signs I've ever seen.

**TLDR:** Cool furniture company becomes incredibly oversold after a knee jerk reaction even when they had a outstanding earnings report. Tendies coming to the Lazy boys.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Beachbody - $BODY - Work off those tendies Beachbody is THE leader in at-home fitness and has been for a long time. Not familiar with them? Ever worked out to or heard of P90X, 21 Day Fix, Insanity, or T25? All Beachbody. How about these others? The company has been around for 20 years, pumping out some of the best workout content on the market, and many of these are still used years after they launch.

[Top 15 Beachbody Workouts](https://preview.redd.it/njnxipsjk0871.jpg?width=3070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf9393db46270220227615843d3626c789b133a0)

$BODY is a new ticker as of Monday, June 28th, and Beachbody rang the opening bell for the NYSE. By way of a SPAC merger, they’re now publicly traded. With this, they also merge with Myx Fitness. Myx is a small Peloton competitor that is more provides a more affordable price point. With the extensive reach of Beachbody, this piece of the business should accelerate rapidly, and provides Beachbody with a boost in the connected fitness segment.

Beachbody has over 3.2 million PAID subscribers as of Q1 2021. They generate revenue not just from workouts/digital subscriptions ($450M 2021E Revenue), but also from their nutrition products like Shakeology and Ladder ($560M 2021E Revenue).

They have over 400,000 “coaches” that are actively promoting their product, and are paid a commission when someone signs up for a subscription or buys a product. In addition, celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lebron James, and Shaquille O'Neal are investors and promoters.

Speaking of people involved, let’s look at some of the leadership.

Carl Daikeler – Like bad ass CEOs? He’s one. Like theater? He has two Tony Awards (producer). Are you a boomer that worked out in the 90s to 8-minute abs on VHS? That was Carl’s video before starting Beachbody. What about 7-minute abs? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE). This guy has built an empire steadily over the last 20 years. He’s loved by everyone by what I can tell and has had great instincts to pivot the business in the right direction when needed, moving out of DVDs to digital on-demand content. He knows how to leverage their marketing network and has expanded the business at a manageable rate through organic growth and small acquisitions. This is the next chapter in the company. Carl has stated multiple times that he isn’t selling a single share. He knows this company is about to be bigger than ever.

Kevin Mayer – If you read most of the bios online about Kevin, you’ll find he has an impressive Disney resume. He’s a former Disney Exec that was behind some huge acquisitions- Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox. Oh and he launched a little thing called Disney+. You may also find that he was the CEO of TikTok, and COO of the parent company ByteDance. What doesn’t always show up is that he was also the CEO of Playboy.com in 2000. Kevin understands content creation and marketing better than most. He will be on the board of directors, and it would be completely ridiculous if the people in the room didn’t listen when he speaks.

If those two aren’t enough, you’ve also got Tom Staggs, another former Disney Exec, who at one time was thought of as the heir apparent to Bob Iger as the Disney CEO. And I don’t mean to short-change the rest of the team, as they all are impressive in their own way, but let’s keep this rolling.

&#x200B;

[$BODY Today\/Tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/9tnihinmk0871.jpg?width=3070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c4d4dae83c9c447d5bea59f3079b81911d197c4)

One of the other drivers to future successful growth will be international. Today, 99% of their revenue comes from North America. They know the potential if they expand internationally, but they’ve also stated they don’t want to just dub over their videos. Dubbing doesn’t resonate as well with the audience. They’re going to do it the “right” way.

COVID shifted many workouts into the home. Some will return to a gym, some will not. Any growth chart for an in-home fitness company, whether it be Beachbody, Peloton, or something else, we should probably try to “normalize” the growth over 2020. Having said that, Beachbody was already well-positioned for the shift to in-home workouts, and their growth was 43% year over year. Smaller companies may be able to show greater growth in percentage, but Beachbody was already a well-established player in the market.

One thing I’ve seen discussed elsewhere is how the company will be branding going forward. Some of their workouts are recognized, but some may not know it is a Beachbody workout. They are looking to change that, and make sure that the brand Beachbody is well-known so that when a new workout comes out, people know it is coming from Beachbody, and want to try it because they liked a past Beachbody workout.

So that’s the company in a nutshell. So a couple other things.

I am not here to tell you there is a short squeeze coming. That’s not typically how I would evaluate my picks. Yes, there are some shorts out there. If that’s what you’re interested in, there’s probably another DD from someone else about that potential. I wish I could show you a great fancy chart with candles and lines drawn to the moon, but that’s not the case for this stock right now. Just coming out of the SPAC, it’s too soon for that. Could the stock double within the next 6 months? Yeah, it could. Might it happen sooner? Maybe. Could it drop? Possible. Ultimately, I see a stock that was beat up because it was a SPAC, and then has flown under the radar. The company, the product, and the people in this is what I’m investing in because I believe in it/them. It’s a billion-dollar company valued at 3x revenue. It could easily grow to a $2 billion-dollar revenue company over the next 3 years, and seems to be a steal at the current price point. They have no debt. They have a proven model that works, they continue to scale, and now have incredible personnel added to their leadership/board that could take Beachbody to the moon.

I don’t YOLO invest, but I did drop in about $11,000 to this, which was about 10% of my account. 1,000 shares at $9.90, and 25 8/20 $17.50c at $0.40. It’s up since those price points, but I believe it will continue to rise. They shot up 10% the day the merger was approved (that was Thursday), then another 10% Friday, and opened another 10% higher this morning. I see this at $20+ in the short term, and a great long-term stock as well that should continue to impress.

TLDR : See summary at bottom

With PSFE’s daily short volume often in the 40-65% range, many believe the share price is being tactically pinned down as 13F filings have steadily revealed more institutions taking large positions. Joining noted fund managers David Tepper, Aaron Cohen, Dan Loeb and Leon Cooperman, Wells Fargo’s various funds have picked up 12 million shares and Blackstone has increased their holdings by an additional 37 million shares.

Some have calculated that share lockup rules have reduced the true available float to as little as 80-85 million shares, causing the most recently reported short interest of 36 millions shares to have an outsized effect.  But shorts must be covered eventually.  A common theory, given the regular 700K-2M block trades we’ve seen, is that aggressive shorting enables large funds to accumulate before Q2 ER (which should beat estimates) and before PSFE is added to the Russell 3000 Index next month. Goldman Sachs also anticipates Paysafe’s Russell 1000 inclusion which, in light of their projected $100+ billion in market share, would likely be followed by other benchmark funds and ETFs, carving out yet even more of the available float.

Along with now priced-in fears of PE lockup expiration (more on that below), it’s clear that PSFE’s share price has also suffered from the Q1 report of YoY 5% quarterly revenue growth which, no doubt, disappointed the short-term expectations of many impatient traders invited in by constant Cramer and Steve Grasso pumps.  It's understandable that, over the last few months, PSFE has reportedly experienced a large demographic shift away from younger shareholders, indicating a transition to a steadier long-term investor base.

But that 5% number may have been misleading to some who didn’t bother to look under the hood.  Paysafe not only upgraded the low end of their 2021 revenue guidance to $1.53 billion, they beat analysts’ average estimate and they also noted that revenue growth would have been “mid to high teens” were it not for their strategic “market/channel exit to improve overall risk/reward profile.”  This was not a surprise as they explained: “adjusting for the actions we have discussed in our Analyst Day and continued risk reward optimization in our business model, our revenue growth would have been in the mid to high teens.” Based on valuation comps, such a growth rate would easily support a share price double the current level.

Paysafe’s quarterly revenue, gross profit and EBITDA numbers all came in at the upper range of their guidance along with a 63% gain in eCash revenue and 29% gain in free cash flow to over $108 million for Q1 alone.  On the day of their earnings report, initial headlines were favorable: “Paysafe beats on revenue, Reaffirms 2021 outlook” only to be suddenly overtaken by articles almost uniformly focused on the negative, offering oddly biased summaries like: “Sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $110M-$120M, which means it could fall below the Q1 level of $113.2M.”  (Obviously, given that range, it could just as well, if not more likely, rise above that number.)

Several outlets focused on an EPS miss of $0.02 despite the fact that Paysafe did not offer any EPS estimate to miss.  Even now, many platforms continue to wildly misreport their financial data.  For example, Yahoo Finance falsely reports a much more dramatic $0.37 miss, something that would naturally deter potential investors at first glance.

Intentional or not, analysts’ EPS estimates overlooked previously signaled temporary quarterly expenses associated with paying down $1.16 billion in debt and the transaction that took Paysafe public.  The company noted: “Results included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""

Take away these one-time non-recurring expenses which amount to roughly $90 million and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly earnings thereby significantly beating all analyst estimates.

Thanks to an improved credit rating, the company announced a refinancing of roughly a billion in debt at a 1.25%+ lower interest rate.  In all, their recent debt management measures will save them an estimated $92 million in annual operating costs.  Global Capital reports that their loan offers an additional 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, something they told analysts they intend to activate quickly.

Taken together, all of this will greatly enhance EBITDA and free cash flow (already $362 million in 2020) enabling them to better pursue their “active M&A pipeline.”

Unless the company chooses, for strategic tax purposes, to write off some discretionary impairment expense on intangibles, they should soundly beat the current analysts’ average EPS estimate of $0.00 for Q2 and $0.02 for 2021.  Those analysts have a median price target $17.67, so consistently beating their estimates over the next three quarters will likely lead to price target upgrades (and new price catalysts along the way).

&#x200B;

Note on Private Equity lockup expiration:

Blackstone bought an additional 37 million shares of Paysafe beyond their original 123 million shares.  Redditor kiedennis noted that these additional shares would theoretically secure a 50.159% controlling interest for insiders, which some think could be part of ensuring Paysafe’s M&A strategy going forward.  At the very least, it protects the company from hostile takeover.  Notably, such a large purchase on top of the initial merger deal should allay fears that they’d want to sell when lockup expires in the coming weeks.  At this point it’s evident that such fears are priced in but some are still concerned so here are some further notes on the subject:

Back in 2017, Reuters reported Blackstone/CVC initially pursued Paysafe making five separate bids to take it private, increasing their bid 32% before Paysafe finally agreed. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed, Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private for $3.9 Billion. (Around $4.2 Billion in today’s dollars)

An inside source close to those negotiations said, “There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents’ age,” adding that the private equity firms “have a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.”

Blackstone’s website says its typical investment term is “upwards of 7-10 years” which dovetails with the “decade-long thesis” noted above.

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Recently Paysafe has gone public through reverse merger, paid down $1.2 billion in debt and Blackstone/CVC received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.  Adjusted for inflation, that’s only a 33% gain on a 4 year hold which tells me they’d want to stay on and benefit from Foley’s M&A playbook which has steadily proven to generate 300-800% growth in as little as 5 years (This falls nicely within Blackstone’s remaining time horizon). As part of the deal, Paysafe’s 20F filing confirms that Blackstone rolled $1.23 billion into Paysafe, keeping 123 million shares. Foley says, this is part of what “created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

More recently, Blackstone’s 13F shows they now own 160 million shares indicating that they acquired an additional 37 million shares outside of the deal structure. That’s $436 million more at the current share price. As insiders on the Board of Directors, they wouldn’t take on that level of additional exposure if they didn’t see serious value here. Dan Loeb (Third Point)’s 13F indicates they also picked up more shares beyond their original PIPE investment. For the above reasons, along with the depressed share price, I highly doubt private equity would be seeking a near-term exit.

&#x200B;

TLDR summary:

Paysafe has put itself in a great position to beat analyst EPS estimates for Q2, Q3, Q4 and 2021 overall, leading to raised price targets and  positive price action catalysts.

Q1's one-time $90 million in expenses showed Paysafe is already poised for significant profit growth.  Recent  debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures even higher  profits going forward.

The picture gets  brighter with the introduction of fast growing revenue streams from the  US iGaming market, especially in Q3 and 4.

Fears of private  equity lockup expiry fully priced in at this point, but such fears are  unwarranted at these low levels, especially considering Blackstone’s  acquisition of another 37 million shares.

But  here's a question: Has anyone thought about cash conversion of PSFE's  outstanding warrants bringing the company as much as $600 million? The  last SEC filing says there are as many as 53.9 million warrants that  could bring the company $11.50 each upon redemption.  This would more  than double their EBITDA and go a long way towards deleveraging and/or  funding their ""active M&A pipeline.""

Such a huge cash infusion gives them meaningful incentive to eventually  promote the stock price to well above $18, a 60%+ gain from current  levels.

There’s a strategy here and Foley has repeatedly shown he knows exactly how to play his  cards. Like most good things, it takes time."
2021-06-28 09:52:29,wallstreetbets,"Listen, I've reflaired as DD because it isn't really technical analysis (rather than just taking it down), but I do feel there's a few things worth mentioning.

* Short interest numbers are almost always misinterpreted or worse than useless as trading signals.
* EPS estimates are going to vary source by source. There is no one ""golden copy"" for EPS estimates. That's not nefarious, it's just what happens when you have a ton of different analysts all with different opinions.
* Warrants turn into shares when exercised. That's dilution, and the dilution more than offsets the value of the cash received. -It's not *necessarily* a positive thing."

We dropped them not because of the undeniable language barriers, but because once bought out they required your company's tech on site before they'll allow one of their foreign techs to talk to you.  Doesn't sound like a game changer until you realize this is even if the issue is on their end.  We had multiple trips of being required to go on site, only to have to go back on site a 2nd and 3rd time.  Not because of us, but because of Paysafe.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TA's for $PRPL Gang and the $PLTR palantards First we have $PRPL, if we can look at its MA20 27.73 was resistance last week and it went as high as 27.93 where it double topped, hit resistance, and went back down to 27.23 and double bottomed immediately. The next day June 24 it immediately broke 27.93 and double topped again \~28.45 and dropped to MA20 where it was now a support. The chart is looking very healthy on its bounce from (\~25.10 range) 2 weeks ago to now using MA20 as support. The next point to watch out for is MA50 (30.41) where it will now be the next big resistance $PRPL has to overcome. IR day for $PRPL on 06/29 should be interesting to watch. $PRPL gang is rising from the dead and its rising in a very aggressive manner.

https://preview.redd.it/uw0bqxa250871.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b696d6943a22c91cbd2c77d1f732ad2b415330

Congrats to $PLTR palantards for breaking that $25.30 resistance level. I watched it chip away at it for the whole week and when it broke it was vicious. Let's look at the chart moving forward to this week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0ehu10p80871.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=07ee192ab3e8d196adc25c15078333dbe0a3246c

We can see that $PLTR has a gap to fill up to the $31 range. It is going to be looking to fill that gap while using MA20 $24.77 as a hard support. Last Friday during power hour it chipped away at the $27 resistance (13 week high and 1 month high) for nearly the whole hour and couldn't break it. We will watch if it can break it this week to fill the gap up to $31. It could be a very good week for $PLTR if it manages to plow through the resistance. I see promise for it this week and next week. Chart is very healthy. When $PLTR breaks resistance it shows that it breaks it with force and rallies very rapidly. 

&#x200B;

Good luck this week $PRPL gang and the $PLTR palantards. This is all crayons not financial advice."

**Daughter companies.**

**MYX Fitness** is the exercise bike for the 99% that is waiting for their next paycheck to blow on FDs. MYX Fitness is BeachBodys fight against Peloton. Most of us here are too poor to afford a Peloton. MYX fitness fixes that problem with a product that is reasonably priced and quality equal to its competitors. Puts on PTON, calls on BODY

**Openfit** is a fast-growing DTC platform Openfit, which launched in 2019 and features 400+ live trainer-led group fitness classes per week with real-time feedback. They recently launched “Celebrity Walks.” Celebrity Walks will enhance the existing Every Step platform and allow subscribers to participate in unique, guided walks with fitness gurus such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Xtend Barre founder Andrea Rogers and ‘The Biggest Loser’ trainer Jen Widerstrom.

**Competitors:** The biggest competitor that comes to mind is Peloton. Between their high margins, incidents of murder and bricking customers treadmills unless they pay a monthly subscription, I see no threat. With MYX Fitness joining the beach body team several thousands of Beach Body customers will easily transition onto a cheaper alternative of equal quality to Peloton.

**POSITIONS & RECEIPTS:** I'm prepared to give up my $BODY. This is a company I believe has an upside of $20-30 based on its projections, outlook, and willingness to adapt to market conditions. +1,500 7/16 12.5C with the plan to accumulate several thousand shares.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC can Repeat NFLX 20x Rally Investment Highlights


- For now I like VIAC a lot after Archegos sell down. They have relatively big spending power in content with sub-scaled subs base for now. Ultimately in streaming stocks, differentiated content matters in gross adds and that comes to real dollar spending and conversion/hit rate. And the stock is cheap as investors look at aggregate EBITDA for valuation but the breakdown of that has very different dynamics between its businesses. I see good chance that sports and new movies might help them to build a global franchise. Also Pluto TV has deep value for its global presence too.

- Mental model behind NFLX 20x rally shows derisking phase of NFLX kicked in when their content library reached critical scale and its hit rate kept rising. For VIAC, the good thing is they have already original content, such as Nickelodeon and many others, the key for them is to spend wisely content budget to increase hit ratio - they are off with a good start with Paramount+ getting traction from iCarly. Longer-term, recent streaming business reorg showed commitment from new management team in content investment and global expansion plan.

- VIAC nowadays is better off than 2019 when Viacom and CBS merged, with attractive risk reward profile combining below historical average valuations and one of the fastest growth phase ever in the company’s history.

Valuation:

- NFLX is valued at 8-9x EV/sales, while VIAC streaming business is valued at less than 2x EV/sales. On per paying subs basis, unit value of NFLX exceeds USD 800 assuming 300m subs target, while VIAC, even at 100m subs target in 3 years, implied valuation for streaming business (current EV less 5-6x EV/EBITDA for cable business) yields less than $200 unit value.

- What’s more, M&A value for VIAC has started to unlock, providing takeout support to current valuation at historical low band. NFLX/AMZN/AAPL are all powerful potential acquirers. Now that Discovery and HBO are tied together, available assets to be acquired become even more scarce."

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GIS - General Mills is going to be serving up Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast TENDIES this week. Strong contender for a 5-10 bagger. (Earnings) GIS aka General Mills, the company that has brought us classic pantry staples and beloved, sugar laced comfort food since our childhoods, such as Pillsbury, Betty Crocker, Cheerios, Natures Valley, Trix, Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, has earnings this week. (Wednesday, 6/30 BMO).

I've been following this stock for some time and I believe there is a strong chance that it will rise sharply both in the run-up to earnings and after. GIS crushed it this past year, charting record profits, and they have also implemented a new 'restructuring' program to invest in future growth.  

At the time of this posting, options are dirt cheap and IV is still low, sitting around 20%. So if this stock moves even a few percentage points, you're looking at a strong multi-bagger. GIS has also been a staple in investors portfolios for decades due to their high dividend yield and continued growth, so this is a great company to buy shares in as well.

Info on the stock and catalysts-

General Mills has been around since 1928 and went public in 1981. This company has been a beast for years in the food industry. In 2019 alone, the company had an annual revenue of 16.8 billion, a 7% increase over the previous year. In 2020, they increased yet again to 17.6 billion, a further 4.5% increase.

They've also branched out into the natural, organic food market with their Cascadian Farms brand, and in 2018 they acquired one of the best selling pet foods on the market, Blue Buffalo, which brought in over a billion dollars for them in 2020 alone.

Some bullish indicators on the stock-

Current average analyst target price for GIS is 64, with a high of 71. The price at the time of this posting is around 59.

The 'dividend channel' last week labeled GIS as oversold, indicating strong upside.

Credit Suisse group recently set an 'outperform' rating on the stock, while 6 other analysts rated the stock a 'hold' and 5 others rated it a 'buy'.

Another interesting potential catalyst is the USDA acreage report that comes out on Wednesday, which assesses corn and grain production. Analysts are predicting that it will show that corn and grain yield are up big, which should lead to a drop in commodities, and a rise in GIS share price.

One of the main drivers which I think will be positive for this week's earnings, is the news that came out last month that General Mills approved a new 'restructuring plan' for the company.

A headline last month from 'food business news'-

'General Mills reshaping organization, portfolio with an eye toward growth'

This is the shit that the market loves to hear. Especially around earnings. A lot of people are perplexed when a company's stock dips after earnings, even when the report was great. It's because a lot of what earnings is about is providing confidence in future growth through forward thinking initiatives. 

Regarding the restructuring-

'General Mills, Inc. is restructuring its business structure to capitalize on opportunities around digital, data and technology, and e-commerce, according to the company.

 “To be clear, this is not simply a cost-cutting exercise,” said Jeffrey L. Harmening, chairman and chief executive officer, on May 20 during a virtual presentation at the BMO Capital Markets Farm to Markets Conference. “The goal of this initiative is to free up resources from parts of our organization and redeploy them into more growth-facing areas, such as digital and data and technology, e-commerce and strategic revenue management and other capabilities that are critical to our future success.”   

This is the type of talk that typically gives investors/markets a massive hard on.

The restructuring plan will also include layoffs of around 1,000 employees. For reference, GIS has around 35,000 employees. People who are new to the market might think that's bad news for the share price, but in the cut throat capitalistic world of the USA, it's actually the opposite. When a profitable company like GIS announces layoffs as part of a 'restructuring' initiative, it's very bullish, as the market will see it as the company 'cutting costs' and freeing up money to invest in future growth.

Bottom line - Playing earnings is always a risk. Anyone who trades long enough will learn that the market is irrational, and that is certainly exemplified during earnings calls. A company will post a fantastic earnings report and the stock dips. A company will post a shitty earnings report and the stock rockets. However, the run up to earnings itself can be highly profitable, and if you want to minimize your risk, you could consider closing your position before the report comes out. 

However, due to the reasons listed in this DD and GIS emphasis on future growth, I think there's a strong chance this stock will shoot up both in the next couple days and also after earnings.

Cheerio, let's fucking go.

If you're looking for dividends, then maybe, but don't be surprised if this shit just keeps going sideways. Or just nose dives and all those dividend gains get eaten up by the capital losses. 

Maybe you can catch a swing trade here and there, don't expect it to reach a $100/share before you die. If we were <$40, okay, I'm might be in for a gamble.

But if I understand a GAMA squeeze it requires institutions to need more shares of a stock on hand which drives up the price. (Yes dumbed way down) but currently institutions are the primary holder of WISH. 71.9% with only 28.1% held by retail investors how can you have a GAMA squeeze when they hold most of the shares?

Also could you not see institutions divest themselves of large % of wish as they hit above their buy in which would drive the price down?

Like I said I am a tard and this is a legit question not a shit post.

1.8% institutions mutual fund

2021-06-28 09:50:16,wallstreetbets,"'Gamma squeeze' is when a market maker, or trader has to delta hedge options that they have sold. If you sell an option you immediately take on a short position essentially equivalent to the delta of the option\*100. So for a 0.3 delta option the short position is equal to 30 shares. So delta hedging (in its simplest form) is when they then buy those 30 shares so that they remain delta neutral, i.e. -0.3\*100( from selling a 0.3delta call) + 30 (the shares they bought) = 0. As the price moves up the delta moves up (due to gamma) so they have to buy more shares to cover the delta increase.

If the float is tight enough and/or the OI is large enough as they delta hedge, the price will move up faster than they can cover. As the price moves up they have to cover more, so the price moves up, so they have to cover more, etc. That's a gamma squeeze and its to do with the mechanics of market makers (or others) seeking to remain delta neutral. This typically isn't to do with institutions ownership, that's a separate thing (unless they are playing games with selling options which can happen as well)."
2021-06-28 09:23:22,wallstreetbets,"FROM CNBC 12/16/2020 - The opening trade was $22.75 per share, below its IPO pricing of $24 per share, which was at the high end of expectations.

I would expect the institutions may have gotten a better price than this, but may wait until it rises past 24 to sell, which would bring a pretty nice bit of coin my way!!"

Simply knowing that 67% of stock is held by institutions doesn’t tell you anything. You need to know what % of those instructions sold shares short and know how many naked calls were created.
2021-06-28 09:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Worry not, thou art still a tard."
2021-06-28 12:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Forget all these squeezes. They're probably nonsense.

If you are holding shares of WISH right now, you are in a great place, below fair value (conservatively 16$ a share IMRO), and way below IPO price.

All you gotta do is be an investor and let the market float your boat. The only way to fuck this up is to get cute with options and have them bleed out, because WISH needed more time..."
2021-06-28 10:03:51,wallstreetbets,"Given the limited shorting of WISH, I don't expect much of a gamma squeeze, and I think folks piling into gamma squeeze plays may potentially be dragging down the ticker in the long-term as ever round of failed gamma squeeze is handing over capital to MM.

&#x200B;

Personally, I am investing in commons only since this seems to line up more with this as a fundamental long-term play. WISH is a different beast than GME and AMC."
2021-06-28 11:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Based on Fintel, institutions currently holds 46% of the shares, down from 94%."
2021-06-28 13:17:45,wallstreetbets,I just saw the short interest float is down to 3.9% can anyone explain why??
2021-06-28 15:58:58,wallstreetbets,Calls on $GAMA
2021-06-28 10:12:37,wallstreetbets,why are we pumping up institutional stocks?
2021-06-28 10:46:28,wallstreetbets,Because uWish is a HF pump and dump scheme
2021-06-28 10:42:11,wallstreetbets,LFG 🚀🌝
2021-06-28 14:25:36,wallstreetbets,AMC
2021-06-28 10:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, that's a really good explanation. And I fear you have made me smarter. I now need to find someone lead paint for lunch or something."
2021-06-28 11:22:44,wallstreetbets,So calls should also rather be bought at slightly Out of the money strikes to give that gamma power more effect
2021-06-28 12:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation, I had doubts about how this work."
2021-06-28 09:43:43,wallstreetbets,I read somewhere but unfortunately can not find it now so please don't quote me on this. That average institution price was around $17.5 which seemed kind of low.
2021-06-28 12:27:30,wallstreetbets,It’s going to $69 🚀🚀
2021-06-28 10:26:02,wallstreetbets,Aim higher. 6969 🚀
2021-06-28 12:24:29,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this answer to the question? This sub...
2021-06-28 09:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I am not saying a $20 target is not responsible. I actually think longer term $20+ is very responsible for WISH. I am just talking about the Gama squeeze I see people repeating."
2021-06-28 10:08:30,wallstreetbets,It seems the word squeeze is no longer censored
2021-06-28 11:10:06,wallstreetbets,It seems everyone is over leveraged these days
2021-06-28 09:31:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah. There are definitely legitimate squeezes out there but everything can't be one... right? And I only think wish is 8 to 9% shorted
2021-06-28 09:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze has nothing to do with short selling. Gamma squeezes are caused by delta hedging by options sellers; every time call options are sold, the market maker buys shares as a hedge to offset the risk of the share price rising and that call option being exercised in the money. If there is a sudden rush in share price, it induces more call option demand and market makers buy up more shares to hedge the risk. If the share price moves so quickly that all of the weekly expiring calls struck at the start of the week will be expiring in the money by close on friday, this can cause a huge gamma squeeze and is what happened with Gamestop in january.   If institutions own a large percentage of shares, then this can lock down a certain pecentage if some of these institutions are not legally able to sell/have complex ownership rules that make selling difficult. This can reduce the liquidity of a stock as there is less supply, resulting in frenzied retail/hedge fund buying generating more volatility in stock price and leading to potential gamma squeezes"
2021-06-28 09:20:39,wallstreetbets,"OK that is reasonable but in the case of wish there is something like between 8 and 9% short of the float?

But I would think that knowing the % of institutional investment would have some bearing on it even if that number does not differentiate between institutions."
2021-06-28 09:24:59,wallstreetbets,"Awesome,  I do worry I may have gotten smarter every day. This is reassuring news!"
2021-06-28 10:07:53,wallstreetbets,I agree that wish is way less meme stonk and more legitimate investment opportunity. And that's surprising from here.
2021-06-28 11:13:48,wallstreetbets,I was going off of fidelity who uses Vickers for the holding %
2021-06-28 10:45:50,wallstreetbets,Shill hedge fund pump and dump to distract from the kingmaker that is GME
2021-06-28 10:51:27,wallstreetbets,I think you do have both the pump and dump crowd as well as the FOMO group pushing up the price faster. On the other hand though I would say WISH could be considered under valued currently. Though I think some of the people saying 60+ might be unreasonable. Though I am no expert.
2021-06-28 11:13:21,wallstreetbets,"BB/CLOV was a pump and dump, you can easily spot the difference here."
2021-06-28 11:44:30,wallstreetbets,"There's probably many ways of setting up a gamma squeeze but 2 simplified ones;

1. Randoms buying loads of options, brute forcing a gamma squeeze, probably what happened on something like CLNE
2. Options purchased with precision, set up probably by hedge funds. This would likely be done through buying up the far OTM calls, and then working closer to ATM so that there is a 'ramp' set up. Probably happened on AMC and GME

No.2 depends on knowing things like the float, how MMs are likely to hedge, number of options to cause an increase in price etc. I think no.2 is probably beyond retail investors to coordinate, so retail essentially work with no.1 to try to force a gamma squeeze. This is basically everyone buying what seems appropriate to them in order to make money and kind of naturally hoping to fall onto a gamma squeeze type option lay out. With enough option purchases this will likely happen anyway (although probably on the backs of a few bag holders..). 

I think the best way in general is actually to probably follow instead of lead. This is to look out for where the big players are trying to set something up and jump in early.

That doesn't really answer your question though, but I think basically, you do you. Buy the calls that will make you the most money depending on how you think the stock will play out. This will naturally feed into the delta requirements of the MMs and potentially help others."
2021-06-28 11:36:16,wallstreetbets,"I could see that figure.  Institutions tend to get a better deal right of the bat.  They could have gotten out when it hit in the $30's, but there wasn't large volume then.  I don't see institutions taking a bath on this, getting out at 7-10, when they bought at 17.5-22.75."
2021-06-28 11:13:13,wallstreetbets,Institutional investors probably got out.  If not then how can you trade 300-400 million in it?
2021-06-28 14:01:37,wallstreetbets,"That's what I saw, too, but I think over $20 is more accurate"

2021-06-28 09:59:07,wallstreetbets,"Again, a gamma squeeze has nothing to do with short interest. It is only related to market maker risk hedging strategies if they have sold calls out-of-the-money that suddenly become in-the-money, since they would have huge downside exposure if they are forced to buy $WISH at $69 a share to satisfy a call with a strike of $15 a share. They would immediately lose $5400 on every call they sold for ~$100."
2021-06-28 14:17:21,wallstreetbets,well I also lump AMC in there :)

Do you enjoy playing arcade games and hanging out with friends? Miss the good old days of watching live sporting events on the big screen while cheering along with the crowd? Would you like to be on the All-Star team of degenerates? If you answered yes to the following questions, you are in the right community and have arrived at the right place. Today we will be discussing the case of Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY). First a quick graphic so I don’t lose you:

[  “So you’re telling me I can start going to the arcade again?”](https://preview.redd.it/r027z9n3nz771.jpg?width=1430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2e322899f1c83b0548f706da52eaabe2867c626)

 **Thesis: Mr. market does not fully appreciate the intrinsic value held within the core business model of Dave & Busters ($PLAY). The combination deals offered by the company for food and gaming credits give patrons a unique experience and all but ensure that revenue will continue to increase as store count reaches its targeted levels.**  

We’re going to break down today’s presentation into the following topics:

* Introduction to Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY)
* Business model
* Current financial condition
* Growth Potential
* Catalyst for 2021

Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY) is a leading owner and operator of high-volume venues in North America that combine dining and entertainment for both adults and families. Founded in Dallas, Texas in 1982, the core concept is to offer customers the opportunity to “Eat Drink Play and Watch” all in one location. Eat and Drink are offered through a full menu of entrees and appetizers and a full selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports.

**Business model –** 

Patrons enter Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY) with a choice of four options to choose from; this is the core business model that differentiates Dave & Buster’s from its competitors. Patrons can dine in, play amusement games in the midway, have a seat at the bar or enjoy the big screen view of live sporting events. Although the company acknowledges that it is in a competitive market, it is also aware that there is no other competitor that can offer all the forms of entertainment that it provides in one single location. 

**My belief is that although customer experience from competition might be similar, it is not of the same scale that Dave & Buster’s is able to deliver. This is because of the company’s direct import program.** 

Through this program, Dave & Buster’s is able to acquire the latest amusement attractions/games from foreign suppliers at discounted rates due to the company’s size and buying power. Since the company is a large buyer of amusement games, they receive discounts that local competitors would not be eligible for. This is essential to the business model and provides for a sizeable advantage over other venues attempting to offer similar services. 

Because the company can acquire items for discounted prices, **it enjoys a whopping 89.3% gross margin in entertainment offerings**. This sector makes up 64% of the company’s overall revenue. Being that income from entertainment is the primary source of revenue for the company, Dave & Buster’s is less reliant on its food offerings. This means that during times of rising food costs, the company is less exposed than it would otherwise be. 

[  Live Feed from the Headquarters of Dave & Buster’s competitors ](https://preview.redd.it/5z6le6jtnz771.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fbc5bc19d933946b6fd926c6a3879fbb68359fc)

Their “Eat Drink Play and Watch” business model is broken down as follows:

* Eat
   * Patrons can choose from a menu that appeals to a broad spectrum of customers.  Menu items include burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, and pasta. There are also options available to diet conscious individuals such as vegetarian, low calorie and gluten friendly delights. Menu items are ever evolving reflecting the changing tastes of customers.
* Drink
   * Each location offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits.
* Play
   * The company calls this area the midway. It features a wide array of amusement and entertainment options of which some are exclusive to Dave and Buster’s on a permanent basis. This is the feature that the company feels most differentiates its brand from all others. 
* Watch
   * All locations have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports events and other immersive programming. The company believes they have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers.

**Current financial condition –** 

Business for 2020 was significantly hampered by the economic conditions that resulted from the closures of public venues due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Much reference is made in the company’s annual report of the impact that the pandemic had on its business. Based on Benjamin Graham’s principles in his book “*The Intelligent Investor,”* heavy emphasis should not be placed on a single year’s earnings for a company. If there were any year that this principle applied to most, it would be fiscal 2020 due to the unusual circumstances resulting from the pandemic. 

The real appeal for why I like the stock can be found when breaking down the numbers preceding fiscal 2020. There is a consistent pattern of growth year after year for as far back as financial statements have been released for the company. When comparing the numbers from 2020 to 2013, there is a 222% increase in revenue from just that period of time alone. This leads me to believe that **Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY) has a successful business model that is not only profitable but also expanding**. 

[  BRRRRRRRRR](https://preview.redd.it/9u15ank9oz771.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae5d0e5dafc244695629871ba06222299bdec83c)

$PLAY used proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes along with its cash on hand to repay the principal balance of its term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. This point is of particular interest because it speaks to the credibility of a company when amid a pandemic it is able to pay down its existing debt and has not forsaken its responsibilities. 

Another sign of enthusiasm for the financial outlook of the company is the opening of five new stores in the second half of 2020. We can rely on the numbers for prior years to conclude that an increase in the number of stores equals a proportionate increase in revenue and net income. As of May 2, 2021, business is getting back to usual for the company; 138 out of 141 stores are operating in some capacity. The company believes that through its financial restructuring initiatives of the past year, it has sufficient liquidity to meet estimated cash flow needs and covenant compliance obligations for the future. 

**Growth Potential –** 

Internal studies and third party research suggest that the company has significant growth opportunities. Dave & Buster’s expects to expand to over 230 stores in the future. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dx047pufoz771.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a4b7dbb4ea9c0a1f8dcfa704d7e81f1d28414f2

The company is well positioned to expand into new markets and expects that 2021 will be one of its best years. The coming end of the covid-19 restrictions will bring about enthusiasm from the general public for the company’s venues. It will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings for the year and has its vision set for long term future growth. 

A commitment to customer satisfaction weighs heavily on the company as it understands that positive experiences drive better return rates from customers. Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY) has consistently scored higher in customer satisfaction benchmarks year after year. A part of the company’s initiative to bring about additional store traffic is its loyalty/rewards program. 

**Catalyst for 2021 –** 

Dave & Buster’s has invested time and resources in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow it to digitally engage customers. Central to this effort is the company’s investment in their mobile application platform. The mobile application platform resolves to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing exclusive offers and discounts. **Dave & Buster’s intends to launch a new loyalty program in 2021 which will be integrated into the mobile application** to provide further functionality and accessibility to customers. 

**I believe this initiative will be huge for the company.** It will serve as a direct line for delivering offers & coupons to individuals who download the mobile application. Research has shown that customers are driven by discounts. The likelihood of customers returning to stores increases significantly when coupons and offers give the customer an additional incentive to visit. 

**It is for these reasons that I believe Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY) will thrive and continue to expand its presence in the years ahead.**  

TLDR: $PLAY is the one stop shop to eat, play, watch & drink. Its direct import program allows the company to cycle through the latest games and attractions for a fraction of the price given to its competitors. $PLAY is looking to expand into additional markets in the years ahead. It provides its existing customers loyalty rewards to keep them coming back.

2021-06-28 10:50:37,wallstreetbets,"I love Dave and Busters, drinks, arcades and pool tables…… but $Play is looking like a pump and dump right now, there have been posts warning people about this, people with many wrinkles in their brains trying to bring up a stock in Reddit and Twitter just to dump it by mid day Monday….. OP sounds like and article trying to sell you “prime relataste” in the middle of the desert..

Here are the reasons why I believe it’s a pump and dump..

1) It’s been trading around $40-$65 for the last 5 years

2) Its was at $42 (the highest in the last year) on Thursday and went down to $40 by today

3) The best time for $Play was from Mar 20, 2020 when the stonk was at $7.76 to October 2, 2020 when it was around $15.70 or so, you started to see green crayons up consistently after that reaching a peak around March 2021 around $49 then it’s been on the down consistently from there

4) If you do want to make a play on $Play, the trend seams to go about like this…. Hits higher peak on beginning of June (Summer vacations starts), then you see red crayons for the next 2 months…. Then endings of August and beginning of September you see a huge spike (I am guessing Summer Vacation almost over so people try to get as much playtime as possible) 

As always this is not financial advice, do your own DD"
2021-06-28 14:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Quote from $PLAY CEO on the last earnings call regarding sports betting partnerships:

Finally, we are broadening our entertainment offering through the production of high-energy interactive events. We recently brought on a new leader for our dedicated entertainment programming function and began executing our plan, starting with a very successful live music test in our Tampa store produced in partnership with the well-known dueling piano brand, Howl at the Moon.

In the coming weeks, we will begin testing national theme trivia nights in conjunction with market leaders, [indiscernible] and will continue developing a wide range of recurring events. By expanding our own entertainment lens, we look to broaden our appeal and increase visit frequency.

For the upcoming football season, we have a number of initiatives planned to establish Dave & Buster's as the ultimate tailgate destination. These include proprietary video content, live entertainment in select markets, contests designed to draw our guests into the game, and of course, compelling food and beverage promotions. We also continue to make progress in our discussions with potential sports betting partners and look forward to concluding negotiations later this year."

What are your thoughts on a target price?

I absolutely love this place, and really think it's going to continue to grow."

I figured with a place like that it would do one of two things: go bankrupt, or recover when people are desperate to go get drunk and touch each other’s joysticks.

2021-06-28 07:22:12,wallstreetbets,"i like this stock, i’m in"
2021-06-28 08:24:47,wallstreetbets,"I consider myself absolutely balls deep in D&B having gone there consistently over the last few years. I will say 2020 was definitely a shock to their system but looking at the 5 year charts $40 seems to be the usual bottom-support the stock would bounce off of. 
From a consumer standpoint, I will say their BOGO sales are noticeably less frequent, though their marketing is doing well to generate attention - they’re investing in new games and attractions, and with the return of sports on TV means people will have a reason to go their for the food and drink and sit and watch games. Their Half-Off Wednesdays still blow the doors off every location I’ve been to, and as long as people want to dump their kids off to avoid parenting them, D&B will continue to generate business. I’ve also noticed people packing out the restaurants in multiple locations more often than I did pre-rona. Seems people are very excited to be back as our wives’ boyfriends need somewhere to go and have a good time playing games while we’re at home monopolizing the Nintendo switch they bought us.
Tldr
$40 is a decent entry point IMO if planning to go long, however in WSB fashion I don’t have a price target or a known catalyst apart from earnings for any quick options plays, but I’m bullish. I’m tied up in other plays so no positions in $PLAY currently.

Edit: in an appeal to my/our weeby side if they bought out Round One and got their access to the Japanese-imported games under their roof and pricing, easy money. I go to Round One for the Anime games but they are significantly more expensive, though they also offer bowling, darts, karaoke, etc. Same concept of breadth but more niche imo, the one near me stays consistently busy."
2021-06-28 08:25:37,wallstreetbets,"See that spikey ass monthly chart? That’s every time this stock is mentioned in WSB. Quick up, quick down. Definition of pump and dump, at least in the short term.

2021-06-28 09:30:27,wallstreetbets,I broke a ski ball game back in the early 2000s at my birthday party at D&B. We were dropping balls in the top right hole bc there were no guard cages to stop us. Pretty sure we registered well over 1M points and the game just started shitting out tickets. Got almost the entire ticket roll they put in the machine until the manager came and turned the game off…

I personally feel it's a very ""experience-based"" business and you have to change your experiences a lot & often to keep it interesting for people.  I don't see them changing as much and as often as I feel they need to in order to keep things fresh and to attract new customers."
2021-06-28 11:46:45,wallstreetbets,"D&B is what the financial experts call “a self sustaining economy”. They can created unlimited supply of of their own currency therefore ensuring continuous revenue generation of their own currency.

2021-06-28 07:33:53,wallstreetbets,Good DD. Also another tidbit - this is apparently the only chain restaurant with adult arcade games / video games where the gaming revenue is higher than food/drink revenue in the US.   Other competitors exist in the kids space but in the adult “barcade” world the food and drink still beat gaming in revenue generation except at D&B.
2021-06-28 08:28:05,wallstreetbets,Nice pump and dump attempt. Dave and Buster's is not going to see any significant movement anytime soon.

In the long run they will pay for sure, but there are plenty of other stocks out there that are safer bets and have much higher returns."

2021-06-28 12:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Uh... I don't think so.  My kids and I used to regularly go to D&B's, specifically the one in Orlando on I-Drive.  This location was always packed.  We're really good at the games and have amassed over 175K in points.  


Now this is a small sample size being just one store but I gotta believe that this is one of their better performing stores due to its location in a very touristy area of town.  


The D&B prizes you used to be able to get with the points were pretty great.  You could get XBoxes, PlayStations, their games, various other cool toys and gadgets.  They had high end types of prizes.  


We were in there a month ago and all of the prizes were SHIT.  I probably couldn't have spent all of my points if I had wanted to.  When a retail location doesn't restock, that's usually a very bad sign.    


I remember being in a Fry's Electronics store about two years ago and the shelves were just bare.  It was sad because Fry's used to be one of my favorite stores.  I said to my son, this company is going out of business.  They shut down this year.  


This is the type of 'analysis' you don't see in the financial reports.  To me, this is more valuable than what the company's narrative is."

2021-06-28 08:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Why does this make it look like D&B has been around since 2016 or so when  its been around a lot longer than that. 

It was founded in the late 80's and had IPO in 2014. Been a bit of a roller coaster since. But could be worth the invest. 

As for the upside of this I think its a ways off simply because we are not done with this covid crap and it could impact again. 

Might be a good 1 to 3 year invest."

March 2020 it was 7 dollars and aprilish this year near 50 so that would of been the play. But I have spent 1000 dollars since things opened up at this money pit going three times twice taking my son and his friends and once taking my degenerate brother. So would of traded the trinkets from the gift shop for 1000 in stock at D and B instead for sure so i am on the fence.

2021-06-28 13:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Wait, yuo gyus can raed?"
2021-06-28 14:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, but nah man this is too niche for me"
2021-06-28 14:14:12,wallstreetbets,Thank you fellow autist I joined you this morning during their run down and am now profitable.
2021-06-28 14:15:21,wallstreetbets,Looks dead
2021-06-28 14:18:10,wallstreetbets,Smells like pump and dump
2021-06-28 14:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Dave, Busters and my Wife’s retard boyfriend to the moon! 🚀"
2021-06-28 14:49:46,wallstreetbets,D&B feels like a front.  How do they even keep these places open?
2021-06-28 15:09:30,wallstreetbets,"Disagree, birth rates are falling, less and less kids every year."
2021-06-28 15:19:42,wallstreetbets,How about we buy Blackrock/Vanguard and own them for once? #ThinkBigger
2021-06-28 15:23:01,wallstreetbets,This guy buy shares idk if I can trust him anymore
2021-06-28 17:21:59,wallstreetbets,Ya'll didn't buy last February in 2020 when it was like 5 bucks? It's recovered since then what am I missing here?
2021-06-28 17:56:39,wallstreetbets,they close at 10pm on sundays and i had wanted to go at midnight :/ will not be participating.
2021-06-28 17:57:35,wallstreetbets,"i bought PLAY last april or so ... was hoping for more than the 110% return i currently have, but f-it... ill paper-hand it if/when it hits 60 for sure, maybe 50 if i decide to get retarded with something else"
2021-06-28 18:06:33,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-28 18:15:52,wallstreetbets,So many shills anymore . Thinking they can use a Reddit platform to push their interest 🤔
2021-06-28 19:07:07,wallstreetbets,"This could be the worlds most accurate and best DD, but it still just feels like a major low point to see WSB pumping Dave and fucking Buster's."
2021-06-28 19:22:57,wallstreetbets,Their prizes suck right now.
2021-06-28 07:57:42,wallstreetbets,Short % of float is 18.32%!!!
2021-06-28 07:55:53,wallstreetbets,Its not AMC 🤡🥱
2021-06-28 11:46:38,wallstreetbets,"I like the Stonk, but I only like it at around 20-25$ a share, that's my guess for when it is going to rebound and likely next spring."
2021-06-28 17:44:09,wallstreetbets,"$PLAY about to take a big dump to 26ish, I will consider buying in at that level. Only 2 get rich plays on the market people. Don't hold this bag, have ya'll not learned from all the pump and dumps on r/wsb."
2021-06-28 19:34:41,wallstreetbets,May be the worst DD I've seen on reddit. Come on guys!!
2021-06-28 08:49:08,wallstreetbets,"Kids: let’s go to D&B
Me: Sorry, I put all my $ in their stock
Kids: WTF 
Me: YOU WANT LAMBO OR NO?"
2021-06-28 08:49:08,wallstreetbets,The 20m cash in their balance sheet is worrying. I would wait until it improves
2021-06-28 08:51:29,wallstreetbets,I honestly thought there was no way they made profit on a normal basis but as I get older I keep asking my wife if we can have date night here. This was some good DD.
2021-06-28 09:50:58,wallstreetbets,"Not for $40 a share; $20 a share trading and I am maybe jumping in.

But post pandemic and banking on fatty fat Americans returning to their fatty fat ways for DB’s profit?

I’m not feeling it.

DB is drilling."
2021-06-28 10:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Puts, YOLO got it 👍🏼"
2021-06-28 10:11:27,wallstreetbets,"Puts on Dave & Busters. Delta variant of covid is transmitted in 5-10 seconds of exposure compared to 15 minutes of the previous strains. Anticipated to be the dominant strain in the USA within 3 weeks.

50% of all new cases in Israel are vaccinated individuals who have contracted the Delta variant."
2021-06-28 10:19:49,wallstreetbets,So many words but did OP actually say anything?
2021-06-28 10:20:04,wallstreetbets,$Play has already peaked the time to get in was in dec-feb. This is clearly dave and busters investments team promoting thier own stock so basically a ad.
2021-06-28 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,To be real Dave and Busters has NOTHING on Game Works
2021-06-28 14:34:20,wallstreetbets,Nah I’ll stick with AMC
2021-06-28 17:47:24,wallstreetbets,I hate D&Bs. One where i live is kinda dank and unkept. Feels like a place parents let their children run wild once they out grow Chuck E Cheese. Anecdotally Bearish.
2021-06-28 19:03:05,wallstreetbets,Don’t start pumping this shit it’s ran for the last year. What more do you want smh
2021-06-28 11:02:37,wallstreetbets,"Account looks sus, a clear pump and dump scheme"
2021-06-28 10:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, OP Has numbers in his name ffs. This is a spam post"
2021-06-28 16:44:24,wallstreetbets,How can I tell if this post is legit advice or a troll/bot?
2021-06-28 12:01:12,wallstreetbets,I don't know how the US economy works let alone some self sustaining one.
2021-06-28 12:31:05,wallstreetbets,I was wondering when OP was gonna mention the self sustaining economy
2021-06-28 13:51:11,wallstreetbets,So the money just keeps going around! In a circle!
2021-06-28 15:20:47,wallstreetbets,"If you’re looking for a better steak in an arcade setting, you are shit out of luck."

2021-06-28 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,Then afterward we'll go out to Fox Chase and use the power card at the Friday's out there
2021-06-28 07:31:47,wallstreetbets,Had to read twice.
2021-06-28 07:39:54,wallstreetbets,RIP your budget
2021-06-28 08:20:09,wallstreetbets,Does your wife's boyfriend bring his boyfriend's girlfriend?
2021-06-28 08:32:24,wallstreetbets,I think my wife’s boyfriend is the same guy. He lets me wash his Lambo on up days. You?
2021-06-28 11:19:54,wallstreetbets,Unexpectedly welcome comment. Thank you for the smile kind sir.
2021-06-28 19:04:22,wallstreetbets,“But babe...you love busters”
2021-06-28 12:15:02,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand how the economy works, much less a self-sustaining one"
2021-06-28 11:27:48,wallstreetbets,Time to print wallstreetbets money……
2021-06-28 09:19:55,wallstreetbets,Could you imagine how bad it would feel to buy in now and bag hold it if it round trips back to $5?
2021-06-28 12:07:49,wallstreetbets,"Play most missed on (I sold early) is Party City. I bought in at 77c! That's right, under a dollar. Now it's $10."
2021-06-28 12:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep.  Getting kinda bored with the fake management shilling has-been stocks, just for a little more pump before they dump.  Just more evidence that wsb has been bought out."
2021-06-28 10:12:52,wallstreetbets,"to be fair, everything was on a huge discount last year"
2021-06-28 12:02:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah booze games gambling and kids don't mix
2021-06-28 17:05:35,wallstreetbets,Everything got obliterated in March 2020. How convenient for you to not acknowledge that
2021-06-28 12:07:02,wallstreetbets,"ticker price does not matter, its currently valued at $2.5 billion, its business model is worth more than that"
2021-06-28 08:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Nothing like some soft pretzels, beer and The Walking Dead shooting before i take her home 😬"
2021-06-28 09:53:09,wallstreetbets,I just awkwardly make my way to the basketball game and then don't move the rest of the night. Sorry baby I'm busy go cheat
2021-06-28 08:04:44,wallstreetbets,"You are correct! My boyfriend has taken me here before. My grandfather also took me once, errr.. now its kinda weird.  Thanks."
2021-06-28 09:20:19,wallstreetbets,"you still get dates from tinder? i go for months without anyone replying to a message then I get ""VENMO ME FOR 150$ PREMIUM SNAPCHAT"""
2021-06-28 11:17:39,wallstreetbets,"Certainly tier 1. Because if you take your date there, you’ll end up with just 1 person at the end"
2021-06-28 11:13:02,wallstreetbets,My Tinder must be broken cuz I never get any matches.
2021-06-28 14:01:02,wallstreetbets,This play is retarded but your comment is actually true.
2021-06-28 18:53:22,wallstreetbets,My gf goes there all the time with guys she meets on Tinder. I'm all in.
2021-06-28 09:34:45,wallstreetbets,Also one year late.
2021-06-28 07:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it needs way less accurate information, and way more conspiracy talk."
2021-06-28 08:38:25,wallstreetbets,Glad someone can see it and call it out
2021-06-28 09:14:18,wallstreetbets,Idk. There is a trader discord that is long $play for several weeks now and a seeking alpha article with the same DD. This stock has a 20% short position on like a 38 million share float. I freaking love D&B so I’m personally long $10k equity with some OTM calls. Although the fact that this might be a bot now has me a little worried. Also there is clearly a bot that just posted an 80k $Play yolo……
2021-06-28 12:05:43,wallstreetbets,"What is ""DD""?"
2021-06-28 07:51:01,wallstreetbets,"not everyone here is retarded, some people do in depth research"
2021-06-28 12:53:05,wallstreetbets,"not a pump nor is it a dump, $PLAY is a legitimate company, If i wanted it to be a pump I would have mentioned the 20% short interest but I did not. The company has potential and huge upside for anyone interested"
2021-06-28 09:18:00,wallstreetbets,Was worried no one was going to mention this.
2021-06-28 09:32:28,wallstreetbets,"They actually fluctuate the price of their games.  Go during the busy hours, pricey.  Go on a weekday afternoon, dirt cheap.  I love $PLAY. The one near me just needs to improve their dining area."
2021-06-28 09:42:58,wallstreetbets,Their chicken tendies have some amazing dipping sauce
2021-06-28 19:54:10,wallstreetbets,I agree but it seems that thier only bigger competitor would BDUBS and out of the 2 D&B seem like the more compreable buy. So d&b seems like a good buy
2021-06-28 13:01:26,wallstreetbets,Not to mention half of their games you can play on your phone.
2021-06-28 13:13:36,wallstreetbets,Weds is half off all games. Its amazing.
2021-06-28 14:04:26,wallstreetbets,Big if true do you have a blue line of source?
2021-06-28 11:10:48,wallstreetbets,"This stock is actually on my shorts list. 

I think business will be worse on a per store basis post pandemic and it's priced for perfection. I've been many times. The food ain't good, alcohol meh, people returning sure, but there are people who also aren't returning."
2021-06-28 08:43:54,wallstreetbets,"We just moved to a new office right next door to a D&Bs.  I haven't ventured in yet, but I don't think I've seen the parking lot ""packed"" by any means.  Then again, I'm only there during ""working hours"".  Maybe I need to stay late on Friday nights to see."
2021-06-28 07:30:43,wallstreetbets,"revenue has increased every year since it went public, the company is expanding its store count every year. perfect recipe for increased earnings and future growth IMO"
2021-06-28 07:21:58,wallstreetbets,"it’s a growing company, it should be higher than pre pandemic levels"
2021-06-28 12:34:38,wallstreetbets,"If i'm looking at the financials correctly, an increase in stores results in an increase in revenue. since they have a high gross margin for their entertainment offering it would suggest that more revenue will result in higher net income. I expect this to reflect in their earnings for the upcoming year."
2021-06-28 10:01:46,wallstreetbets,"I read the DD twice, lol.  Don't skip the captions!!"
2021-06-28 15:31:31,wallstreetbets,I did the same. It felt like the best thing ever. Now I wish I had hold.
2021-06-28 11:49:54,wallstreetbets,"Most negative sentiment for it comes from those who are loyal to their other bags.  I like the direction they are heading with expansion.  The one near me is fully outfitted with brand new games.  Except the giant claw machine, that thing kind of sucks."
2021-06-28 07:38:08,wallstreetbets,"And for 2,000 tickets you can get some laffy taffy, a few stickers, and a whoopy cushion!"
2021-06-28 08:13:26,wallstreetbets,Gimme that Pick the Lock game.
2021-06-28 11:53:04,wallstreetbets,I took leaps and bought shares. The one near me is ridiculously packed.
2021-06-28 14:44:16,wallstreetbets,Exciting sounding stuff for sure. I see them continuing their growth.
2021-06-28 13:55:46,wallstreetbets,"The one near me was super packed last week.  Crazy, just pulling in cash.  New games, too."
2021-06-28 07:55:17,wallstreetbets,"It's trading near where it was pre pandemic.

Why would their business be worth much more than that?"
2021-06-28 09:20:11,wallstreetbets,damn bruh you assuming market caps based on that one time visit you had? that's some autistic level delusions of grandeur
2021-06-28 09:25:35,wallstreetbets,"It's already near the historical target price. I'm not saying the DD is wrong, but I don't see any great reason to get invested in this particular stock *right now*. The time to invest was back when it was near 10$ a share. Now it's had this huge run up to 40+, what's the point?"
2021-06-28 09:31:20,wallstreetbets,I figured by now $PLAY would have at least been closer to $100.  But maybe my abacus is broke.
2021-06-28 15:04:33,wallstreetbets,You should buy call options next time for bigger gains  Keep in mind that they can result in bigger losses too.
2021-06-28 13:38:51,wallstreetbets,Had to scroll way too far to see someone point out the manipulative bar charts.
2021-06-28 10:00:45,wallstreetbets,"It expanded in 2020, and still doing so, it's just now reaching it's prepandemic levels, so yeah, I think $PLAY will run more."
2021-06-28 11:50:36,wallstreetbets,I am most likely going to scoop up some weeklies today. I went into a few leaps and shares.
2021-06-28 15:39:01,wallstreetbets,Proof?
2021-06-28 13:54:56,wallstreetbets,At least at Dave and Buster's you can get some cool Chinese finger traps.  here you just get a tax write off.
2021-06-28 13:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Weeklies?  They are super cheap, I might go in on some. I went with shares and a few leaps. Best of luck!"
2021-06-28 07:35:07,wallstreetbets,I'm actually shocked this isn't over a $2B mkt cap?  Has the market been waiting for the pandemic to be completely eradicated or something? $PLAY should be way higher.
2021-06-28 08:22:37,wallstreetbets,Waterfront=rat maze
2021-06-28 07:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Eat, Drink, $PLAY!"
2021-06-28 08:01:37,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the reminder post. I love how 99% of the comments are “OMG I totes love this place it’s tre-fun and video games when I was a kid!!”

We’re here to make money, not help you re-live your childhood wet dream. I miss old WSB where this shit would have been torn apart in 32 seconds."
2021-06-28 08:26:19,wallstreetbets,It's currently at $40.69! Its a sign!!!
2021-06-28 07:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Eat, Drink, $PLAY!"

2021-06-28 11:59:35,wallstreetbets,"lol, is there really any other way."
2021-06-28 11:58:45,wallstreetbets,Nice man.
2021-06-28 10:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Great company, fun spot to be for sure."
2021-06-28 11:55:16,wallstreetbets,"Expanded during the covid crisis, hard yes.  To each their own, best of luck on your plays."
2021-06-28 12:28:46,wallstreetbets,This place rakes in money.
2021-06-28 14:51:25,wallstreetbets,"And I think that's a fair point about the downsides. I often times find myself checking out a company, fall in love with it and it's products so to speak, and fail to see the bad about it.  I have a very good feeling about Dave and Buster's, but that is partly due to how much I frequent there. I've seen it when it was at it lows last fall, and I saw it at it's highs last week.  Hopefully somebody here stomping all over D&B can point me in the direction of a reasonable bearish argument."
2021-06-28 18:58:21,wallstreetbets,"It happened with PSFE.  Is it likely, IDK, but I do like Dave and Buster's."
2021-06-28 09:18:15,wallstreetbets,"That should be concerning, not a selling point."
2021-06-28 11:48:50,wallstreetbets,Down 5% today so joke's on you
2021-06-28 09:29:30,wallstreetbets,"Some people here don't understand what your comment really means. I wish you the best, brother. Eat, Drink, $PLAY"
2021-06-28 10:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Let's all Eat, Drink, $PLAY 🕹️👾🎟️"
2021-06-28 09:30:12,wallstreetbets,Shares is a good move. I have an order for some leaps.
2021-06-28 13:53:13,wallstreetbets,"But there is no pump? Is there supposed to be one or something? I liked the DD.  Bought leaps and shares.  Shares are dipped, but climbing back. Leaps are looking nice, but I went long on purpose."
2021-06-28 08:04:05,wallstreetbets,people said the same thing about AMC not too long ago
2021-06-28 07:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Eat, Drink, $PLAY!"
2021-06-28 13:50:10,wallstreetbets,What an obvious pump account
2021-06-28 09:20:12,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about, there is no work in that at all, it's practically a transcript of a TV ad."
2021-06-28 08:31:03,wallstreetbets,His pump and dump revenue thanks you.
2021-06-28 07:36:26,wallstreetbets,Why read all word when few word do trick!
2021-06-28 10:31:59,wallstreetbets,Better yolo 80k!
2021-06-28 11:53:25,wallstreetbets,go on...
2021-06-28 11:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Dave and Buster's is real place, I assure you."
2021-06-28 11:57:20,wallstreetbets,"This is the WSB way, inverse everything.  What strike and exp?"
2021-06-28 11:54:18,wallstreetbets,"I upgraded mine, but I don't think PC gaming vs. going out with friends for a good time at an arcade are conflicting.  Two different markets imo."
2021-06-28 11:51:42,wallstreetbets,Think it will get there?
2021-06-28 11:51:09,wallstreetbets,"beep boop, bots like arcade games, beep boop."
2021-06-28 12:30:48,wallstreetbets,"Go play the new Minecraft game, it is a blast!"
2021-06-28 12:29:36,wallstreetbets,I agree. I thought for sure this thing would have had a higher mkt cap.  It is bound to continue its growth.
2021-06-28 12:43:26,wallstreetbets,"I agree that they are at their pre-pandemic stock price, but they expanded throughout 2020, and are booming. I expect this to climb more. I took leaps and bought shares. Maybe I am crazy."
2021-06-28 13:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Only numbers, and this text im typing."
2021-06-28 16:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Well, Dave & Buster's is for adults...."
2021-06-28 19:51:36,wallstreetbets,Mine has an oculus rift you can win. You just need 80 billion tickets.  Some kid actually won one while I was there.
2021-06-28 08:02:21,wallstreetbets,"great point, I forgot to mention this is my DD"
2021-06-28 18:23:48,wallstreetbets,Do you think that each of their establishments is only worth $9 million dollars?
2021-06-28 12:00:28,wallstreetbets,Did you really buy them?  What strike and exp?
2021-06-28 11:52:14,wallstreetbets,I like all arcades. Is Game Works public? I'd like to read any DD posted for that.
2021-06-28 14:47:41,wallstreetbets,Big movies fan?
2021-06-28 11:09:07,wallstreetbets,It reads exactly like a pitch deck written by a dave and busters intern
2021-06-28 13:58:32,wallstreetbets,Oh I blacked out that night.

2021-06-28 07:38:59,wallstreetbets,"I read twice because of the comment you made.  Thank you good sir, I would have missed it."
2021-06-28 08:00:26,wallstreetbets,Having to pay for her dates too would be the ultimate humiliation.  Hope he at least gets a big plush bear out of it.
2021-06-28 14:01:59,wallstreetbets,I thought you were on top of this..?
2021-06-28 10:10:11,wallstreetbets,"I can say buying in at $10 was great, I was buying and selling on that rollercoaster for half of last year."

2021-06-28 16:53:11,wallstreetbets,"For some stocks, calls are actually less risky than shares (if you go for an equivalent share exposure).  This is one of them imo"

2021-06-28 14:07:33,wallstreetbets,"This is a quote from CEO Brian Jenkins from their last earnings call:

“Finally, we are broadening our entertainment offering through the production of high-energy interactive events. We recently brought on a new leader for our dedicated entertainment programming function and began executing our plan, starting with a very successful live music test in our Tampa store produced in partnership with the well-known dueling piano brand, Howl at the Moon.

In the coming weeks, we will begin testing national theme trivia nights in conjunction with market leaders, [indiscernible] and will continue developing a wide range of recurring events. By expanding our own entertainment lens, we look to broaden our appeal and increase visit frequency.

For the upcoming football season, we have a number of initiatives planned to establish Dave & Buster's as the ultimate tailgate destination. These include proprietary video content, live entertainment in select markets, contests designed to draw our guests into the game, and of course, compelling food and beverage promotions. We also continue to make progress in our discussions with potential sports betting partners and look forward to concluding negotiations later this year.”

Read the last paragraph."
2021-06-28 09:08:27,wallstreetbets,"Yea that’s what I mean. I’ve been there a bunch and have always enjoyed myself. I like the idea of it being a more adult-friendly place. Alcohol sales help profits for sure. 

That being said, I know people are eager to get back to normal and have fun again and go to places like Dave & Busters for a good time. 

However, IMO, for this stock to rise or really gain in share price from its current levels, I would need to start hearing/reading reports that there are “lines out the door” to get in the place, for days and days on end. I just don’t see that happening. 

Will they have some surges in the coming months? Absolutely, but they need to be sustained surges IMO to result in large increases in share price."
2021-06-28 13:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Some growth, sure, but the argument that it's already priced in is a solid one. The post-covid recovery is in full swing now, it's hard to imagine that many investors have not yet considered that. 

I expect it to basically perform as it was pre-covid...which was also a growth period for it.  Given similar stock prices, it feels about in line with expectations, not significantly undervalued."

2021-06-28 09:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Especially since they could barely turn 100M profit on their pre-pandemic revenues.  They ramped up spending and revenue, but actually saw decreasing earnings approaching 2020.

2021-06-28 08:00:21,wallstreetbets,"read the DD, they have a target store level in excess of 230 stores, which is 89 more than they currently have. increased store count translates into increased revenue per their history."

2021-06-28 09:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Luckily old WSB already has. If D&B dropped some news, it might be different, but they did not. Add in chip shortages, increases in building materials. The growing costs of internal hardware for games, their most profitable aspect of their business, is also coming in at an increased cost. Expanding stores now is essentially buying at the top.

2021-06-28 13:54:14,wallstreetbets,"It's...not really either. It's just a question of focus. D&B focuses on the gaming side more, other places focus on the food and drink. 

If you want to do some serious gaming, D&B is the better destination. If you want to poke at a couple of machines but mostly eat and drink, you pick one of many other options. Neither is really wrong, they're just hitting different customer niches. 

It does make them somewhat unique relative to their competitors, but not in a way that clearly spells victory or doom."

2021-06-28 08:22:12,wallstreetbets,"AMC is trading on momentum and hype.  yeah maybe D&B will pop for the same reason, but that doesn't change the underlying."
2021-06-28 08:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah memes are powerfull.  Longer term outlook isnt good. For cinemas. Only artificially keped popular by being in bed with film studios or contracts etc meaning films go to cinemas first. 

No one would go to sit in crappy sticky seat in a room with a load of other rustling, crunching and talking randos with overpriced crap food and drinks when they could get a better experiance at home on a budget home cinima setup with frends and family with any decent drinks and snacks they want.  

Even just the cost of an online streaming service vs say one cinima ticket a month or a couple every 2 months ( let slome a family)  is a no brainer really. 


Same arguments against dave and busters, with home gameing vs middle of the road super overpriced arcade games.   Maybe its better in the states or there is more audiance for thay kind of thing there.  The ones in the uk were prittu huge, served pritty bottom of the barrel crap food  and charged way to much per person per couple of minutes of a game.     Not suprisingly after a few years they all closed. Must of lost a fortune."

2021-06-28 14:13:31,wallstreetbets,That’s fair. I was just looking at their numbers vs AMC and GME. No one said the run up had to make sense. It certainly didn’t with those companies.

2021-06-28 12:40:30,wallstreetbets,I'd think so.  The machines have the electronic readers on them that show the price.  It definitely changes depending on how busy it is.
2021-06-28 13:32:50,wallstreetbets,"It isn't generally true. They have standardized pricing. Some locations do a weekend surcharge, so games are slightly higher then.

Traditionally, wednesdays are half priced game day. They have also previously run a late night promotion(pre covid, hasn't been back since) that was the same, but that's not typical.

Most of the time, save for the long standing wednesday discount, the price is the price. I'm one of those crazy people who munchkinned out how to make a profit playing arcade games, so I'm way more familiar with D&Bs pricing than is reasonable."
2021-06-28 10:41:57,wallstreetbets,100% agree.   All bullishness is currently priced the fuck in.  I don't see any play here at all unless it strongly breaks out or has a big dip.

This is totally dependent on the market in which they are placed.  I will say that the one closest to me was built over 10 years ago, but all of the games inside are 100% up to date.

They do need to replace some of the dining room furniture, but the arcade floor is awesome."
2021-06-28 08:21:37,wallstreetbets,I'll take a wild guess. Its food and games. New attractions always are clean and have fresher food for the first 6 months. So I'll say newer brings in more revenue. And older veteran stores more profit

2021-06-28 08:21:03,wallstreetbets,"It's pretty simple if you ever had any experience in business.

The newer stores will not generate as much revenue or profit per store on average than the older ones.

If you are a competent operator you choose the largest opportunities in revenue and profit to locate your stores first.

Then you move to smaller locations.

It's nice to fantasize about future growth and say that something will be better coming out of a pandemic. And then say that there is no way to know things because you don't work there or know anyone on the finance team. But the truth is that competent investors can figure that out. It isn't rocket science.

If you want to speculate on PLAY, by all means gamble. But don't pretend that there is no way to really dive deep and understand what the company could potentially do with detailed financial analysis. Because it is totally doable and it's likely that they are not going to do anywhere near as well as OP suggests because they have the 'potential' to grow their store counts."
2021-06-28 08:33:00,wallstreetbets,You open big stores first to maximize revenues and profits generally. You want to open in the best areas and markets first. Then as you open more stores you go to generally less desirable locations. (Unless you are going to a new geographic area entirely.)
2021-06-28 08:40:09,wallstreetbets,It would have been interesting if you included that in your post. It's heavy on opinion and light on data.
2021-06-28 08:29:56,wallstreetbets,yeah the Crane games are probably the money maker for them. it's something like 6 - 12 credits for 1 try I think $10 = 40 credits. people get fucking addicted to it and blow through money like crazy.

I will say that I took my girl to an AMC theater a couple weeks ago and there's definitely something to be said about the audio and visual quality which is hard to replicate at home unless you're willing to shell out some serious cash. A decent large TV and surround sound setup may look and sound nice, but a 20-speaker setup surrounding a 40ft screen is just better."

2021-06-28 15:06:30,wallstreetbets,food makes up only 7% of their revenue so they have less exposure to rising food costs. their revenue primarily comes from entertainment offerings by way of their midway section. thats a good point though.

2021-06-28 08:35:27,wallstreetbets,"I can appreciate your enthusiasm for wanting to dispel the possibility of $PLAY being a good investment opportunity.  The fact that you are here arguing your point means that you like to trump everyone with your business background.

Can you point me in the direction of some sort of financial numbers that would show me that $PLAY is a bad play?  Or are you just going to sling around words trying to look cool?"
2021-06-28 08:34:53,wallstreetbets,"Chick-fil-A would like a word. But seriously there are plenty of smaller markets that can more than support these DBs but obviously weren’t part of the initial 100 built. Think of tier 2/3 cities where one store creates supply but doesn’t have enough room to meet demand. Ultimately you are over simplifying this. Market research is much more complex than “big city, big money”."
2021-06-28 11:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Used to work for a D&B competitor. I can tell you that for us the newer locations were typically the more profitable ones, because as we expanded we were perfecting our business model, and the money would be spent on the newer centers to make sure they were state of the art, and we could then charge the customers more.  We also learned that centers in the Southern US did much better than ones in the north, so we focused our efforts more on opening locations in those areas.  Eventually there will be a point where that market is saturated and it won't be as profitable to open new centers, but I don't think you can say that it's there yet."

Yeah i guess theres something to be said for the first cinema experiance when your a kid.

Screen dosnt come close to a large oled, though they are still a bit on the pricey side.

I a live audio engineer by trade so am probably a bit more picky than nost but ifind most cinemas sound a huge let down tbh.  

Somethings like other people noises there is no getting away from but generaly find the sound quality pritty poor, even in really basic easy to fix ways. 

It does seem vary masivly from one cinema to the next even within the same chain. The last few times i went to the newest suposidly best cinema in the area it was far too loud for a movie and this is coming from someone that works with soundsystems that are best part of a Megawatt peak output. I put ear plugs in.   Super harsh too.   Surround sound immersion also is poor even if your sat right in the middle compared to even a modest home theater setup. (Nabours permitting)  The tech is avalible at least in live audio circles to blow crappy cinema surround sound out of the water,  with a sweet spot covering almost the whole space.  Basicaly atmos on steroids."

2021-06-28 14:49:19,wallstreetbets,"As you start a company, yes you figure out which locations are better over time.

But as you mature (as D&B is), your newer locations are typically not as large or big as your existing ones.

At some point you either begin to saturate your largest markets (cannibalizing your best locations) or you begin opening up in smaller markets outside of the Top 50 DMAs."

We knew we’d see strong demand for memory as major trends like 5G, artificial intelligence and machine learning took off. These new technologies require a tremendous amount of memory. 

And with Micron operating at max production, we’ll see an amazing earnings report this week. The company already said revenues would come in at or above the high end of its prior guidance. That puts revenues at $7.3 billion vs. the consensus of $7.1 billion this quarter."

2021-06-28 11:55:51,wallstreetbets,"micron is the only US manufacturer of note for DRAM. 

Its an IP moated industry. 

Infrastructure deal. 

People use computers for stuff and we need more computer stuff. Demand for computer stuff is going to rise in the future. It will continue to rise. 

DRAM market is an oligopoly. There is tacit collusion to keep supply down to keep prices and margin high. Market participants arent stupid this time around. Its in nobodys interest like Samsung or SK Hynix to rock the boat. Not only that, South Korea is a strategic ally of the US. They will do back channel pressure if they think Korea is trying to kill off Micron by flooding the market. As a result, Micron is de facto protected by the US government being in a strategically important industry.

Unless there is a massive antitrust/comp investigation or other event that causes them to need cash urgently, I forsee minor supply shortage basically forever. 

Micron also tends to dump post earnings, so be careful when trading. Forget weeklies and stuff in case you get tech issues in small timing windows. 

The revenue beat is all priced in. Including the fact that the beat will be more than what they announced already. Market knows how Sanjay likes to run into ER calls. What matters the most is guidance. 

Buy the stock or leaps. 

Forget about the stock for 6+ months.

Also, all the big players are already in the space and will crush SNDL. CocaCola already has weed infused sodas like energy drinks but 'calm' drinks and once they legalize, they will be all over the map. The biggest weed problem is that 99% of weed smokers go to their local corner boy who knows a guy who grows it in their basement. Now you are introducing the SAME weed but in a bag, for more money, in a store and asking people to buy it? Nah bruh, people still going to their weed man or corner boy because it's cheaper or better or whatever. It would be like you buying a flower company when people can just grow their own flowers. As a result, it's just sitting there til the laws pass which on a federal level, could be decades."

2021-06-28 18:26:22,wallstreetbets,"2 big catalysts in the next few days and steel prices are ATH and climbing!

CEO keynote speech june 30 and it's rumored that China will announce a steel export tax July 1 where traditionally it's been government-subsidized for the past decade, flooding the global market with cheap Chinese steel. No longer!"
2021-06-28 18:24:27,wallstreetbets,"they're gonna be shitting themselves when steel prices stay elevated into 2022...

the only steel analyst ever consulted is dead wrong. you know what doesn't just grow on trees, steel. China adding a tax to their steel exports, rumored to be happening July 1st, is going to increase the pressure even further.

Edit: the guy I wrote this huge response to deleted his comment...

right now it's speculated that they are adding this tax to keep steel for domestic use and to cut emissions, so you're right about that.

> Chinese company rarely export their steel, in the first place.

Not at all true. The entire global steel industry has been at the whim of China for the past decade+. The Chinese government would literally pay their steel mills to export it in the form of a 13% rebate. They made a fuck ton of steel using their dirty sinter plants, giving absolutely zero fucks about the environment and their air quality. That's changing. Over the past 5 years the Chinese people have been more and more vocal about the fact that they can hardly breathe in the steelmaking regions of NE China.

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/steel-share-vc.jpg

They don't just use all that steel themselves. China is largely responsible for the oversupply of steel in the past decade which has led to very little confidence in the stocks. Some are even trading below book value (MT).

> Just to illustrate how ridiculously undervalued the steel sector is compared to the bubble that is the tech/innovation space. If you add up the market caps of the largest public US steel companies and throw in MT too you get roughly a total of $100 billion. That’s comparable to the unprofitable glorified taxi company Uber at $93 billion. A single mediocre tech company is valued the same as an entire sector that will be making tens of billions in profit this year and the next."

2021-06-28 15:47:56,wallstreetbets,"We’d be betting on the same side lol. I’m not betting against CLF. I own several Oct calls. Why would no one else see this but us? It’s not an intricate thesis. I just wonder why certain events haven’t already served as catalysts to a major run like the HRC futures, and EPS adjustments."

2021-06-28 11:03:19,wallstreetbets,"We all chase that overnight payday, but if your short (stock) plays don’t work out they just become long plays. Different if you’re banking on options though, but you should, in most cases, be buying long ITM plays hoping it goes up before then so you can profit off of the premium. That’s generally how I do it anyways."
2021-06-28 11:33:56,wallstreetbets,you just sent me back to middle school with that comeback😂
2021-06-28 08:25:26,wallstreetbets,"In addition to what the other people said, last week, the ticker was T.R.C.H. which peaked at $9.97 last week. Also, with the 1:2 split it has done even less movement."

2021-06-28 08:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Annnnnnd the shorts were baited causing the stock to bleed, which CE George set perfectly, because you can’t short a ticker that doesn’t exist.

But you knew that, right?"
2021-06-28 15:49:50,wallstreetbets,I’m also buying more October’s. So the price will surely drop. Wait till I’m done for the best deal. I’ve been chasing the price down. Hopefully it works out.
2021-06-28 10:53:27,wallstreetbets,Zing! Its funny we must be living the same life cuz thats what my girlfriends boyfriend was telling me she was complaining about.

2021-06-28 13:00:05,wallstreetbets,"You probably can’t tell, but I was being sarcastic."
2021-06-28 14:19:26,wallstreetbets,"Options aren’t overly complicated, and there’s a lot of guides here and on YouTube that can break it down really well. I preferred a video tutorial because I process information better than just trying to sit down and read an essay on topics, but in either case you can get a basic information guide and understand the concept in only a few minutes, including all of the terminology. 

You should absolutely look into it, there’s very good money to be made if you understand what you are doing and things go your way, and the losses are minimal. If a call option premium is $1 ($1 x 100 shares in an option = $100 total), you can’t lose more than that $100. It can be cheaper than buying the stock itself, and if the price skyrockets you can then turn around and sell that option to someone else and pocket the premium. The most you can lose is the $100, but just like stocks the gains are theoretically unlimited.

I typically buy ATM (at the money, which are options that have a strike price around the current price of the stock), or slightly ITM (in the money, meaning it is at or below the current stock price) options, so as long as the stock price goes up and doesn’t go sideways/down before the expiry date you can turn a profit. It’s just a cheaper way to gamble your money, but I recommend not purchasing options that are close to expiring because you have less time hoping the stock moves to turn a profit."
2021-06-28 11:46:25,wallstreetbets,I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I ?!?
2021-06-28 11:44:22,wallstreetbets,wtf are you even saying? the only thing i caught today was an uber to your wife’s house and an std from her nasty ass you bitch ass dude
2021-06-28 08:23:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so that means we really won’t know what the real price is till the market opens."
2021-06-28 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,No trust me it’s good now. I am up a bunch Bc I got more MT calls at 28 so I’ll sell and get more october clf.

2021-06-28 08:24:19,wallstreetbets,It’s gonna SQUEEZE.
2021-06-28 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if I'm totally convinced, though.

If I told you I was going to invest in $CCL because cruise lines would eventually open back up, and they'd be more profitable than ever because of pent up demand, price surges, etc... you'd tell me that's already baked into the price.  That I'm too late.

$CLF has already had a steady 280% increase in share price from a year ago.  Everyone knows what we know about the macros around steel.

I'm in on the general thesis.  The question is if it's already happened.  I can see the stock steadily rising.  Not sure about mooning though.

I own only about 20 contracts and it's a small amount for me to lose, so what the hell."

You've been mindlessly opening up your stock apps on your phone all weekend, hoping to feel something, but its all emptiness. After being forced to sleep on the couch by your wife after you YOLO'd her savings on shitty TSLA calls last Friday, you see a glimmer of hope. You forgot you still have $6000 left in your retirement account. It could save you. Your blood is pumping.   


With the click of a mouse you could be a millionaire.  


You remember you're an idiot and you yolo everything on SPCE. It melts all monday, just like your mental health."

I’ve also added even more shares along the way to average down in order to keep my total position above market price. This triggered the wash rule through my broker and also added $0.30 per share to my cost basis. My question is, since I only sold for gains why would my cost basis go up after triggering a wash sale? Would this be because when I averaged down, my initial investment was currently below market price when I sold even though my total investment was above current market price?"

The reason is that I think the index funds need to sell 5m shares, and they are going to try to do it all in the MOC in order to preserve tracking. That if it shows up in MOC will tank the price 10% or more. 

If I am wrong, I just sell the puts before the close and probably don't lose money, or not much. If I'm right, I make a ton."

Sometime in Q3 (looks like next month), the Sprott physical uranium trust is going to ipo on NYSE, allowing everyone to buy physical uranium, except uranium production has been at a standstill for a long time due to few miners who can economically mine at the current price. If they buy enough, there will be a massive supply squeeze just as uranium consumers (utilities) need to start renewing their contracts. And what happens when an industry goes from losing money to making bank overnight? I am trying to front run this. Right now is the dip before the rip. Either buy now or be prepared to rush into the squeeze when it blows up. This is totally unlike the “silver squeeze” because uranium is dangerous and more tightly regulated.

In theory they both should want as many converts as possible, but one comes across as people dancing in the field at a concert, and the other as door to door missionaries selling commemorative plates.

Do the silver shills even call themselves silverbacks? If not, they're way too self-serious to consider.

2021-06-28 17:16:51,wallstreetbets,"You have a savings account? Why?

Lol my brokerage is my saving account"
2021-06-28 16:23:39,wallstreetbets,50% goes to my brokerage 80% in options 20% in stocks it’s the perfect algorithmic combination to lose money
2021-06-28 16:31:40,wallstreetbets,"Whenever I hear someone ask about savings accounts, my mind goes to a Futurama joke where some rich judge is saying ""my caddie's chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested."" With that in mind, whatever I don't spend goes into some form of investment.

I send 15% of my income to a 401K, and I try to keep $10K in my checking account at all times (I travel for work, so I often have to pay hotel bills over $3K). Anything above that goes into investments somewhere. M1 Finance is nice if you just want to set and forget a mixture of ETFs or sectors to leave your money in. Fundrise is a private REIT group that targets 10% growth per year. They're really neat and very transparent on their portfolio updated, but there are penalties for withdrawing in less than 5 years. 

I typically have a small account for gambling, between $1K - $5K depending on how well it's doing. I move between brokers on that. Currently liking TDAmeritrade, I switched from TastyWorks last year. I also have a mortgage on a house, which is an investment on its own."
2021-06-28 16:42:36,wallstreetbets,"You only need about 3 months salary in cash available. I suggest money market or some insured money management account that offers higher interest rates than a savings account. Then, you should have another 9 months (1 year in total) of salary in easily sellable investments and highly diversified... like a Boomer collecting dividends. This can be after tax income as you are only trying to float your living expenses.

The next advice depends on your age... all other money should be invested. This is where land, housing, collectable cars, art or the like. Items that hold value, appreciate, but are harder to sell quickly. Just like stocks, you have to make sure you buy land in an area where value will go up, not all cars are collectible... choose wisely. Same with Art, you have to understand what and why you are buying. 

Above this, you should use extra money to aggressively speculate on volatile stocks and options. If you are good at it, this can create an income stream the should constantly be considered against your ""1year salary"" calculations."
2021-06-28 16:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Fuck savings.  Set aside 3-6 months of salary, or whatever amount of money you might need to take care of unexpected expenses, then invest the rest.  I personally have WAY too much in savings accounts and need to get it all into the market, don't be me, I'm truly retarded sitting here for 10 years waiting on another 2007, then I was too scared to dump it all in last year."
2021-06-28 16:21:21,wallstreetbets,I know about investing but what's saving all about

Long answer: sofi is more than just a trading app. They handle loans, refinancing, credit, and banking. As such, their main competitors aren’t TDA/RH/Fidelity like you are implying. Their main competitors more likely fall into the LendingTree/RateSetter/Avant group of financial businesses.

2021-06-28 19:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Dear gardening diary,

It was 90F+ today and supposed to be for the next few days, and yard sprays really don't work well at these temps so I'm just going to hold off on the BT and skeeter/tick stuff for a few days.  I did water the garden tonight and get some bugs off the plants again too today (cucumber and harlequin beetles).  I had a few peas and a strawberry from the garden but otherwise it's waiting time for the really mid-summer stuff to get going.  I do think that pumpkin pollen took in the zucchini so hopefully it inflates to  a meatier bigger size with all the water it got tonight.  Oh and I think the passionfruits are happier now so I hope I get those gorgeous blooms soon.

So honeybees showed up.  If it's somebody's hobby hive they're gonna have a very interesting batch this year with the amount of poppies I've got going on!!

Let’s say I’m experimenting.

2021-06-28 08:09:03,wallstreetbets,"Crashes aren’t defined by the length of time the market is down. They’re defined by the magnitude of the drop. I think what you’re getting at is called a bear market. 

It’s fine if you’re a bear and all but you don’t have to be a condescending twat. lol."
2021-06-28 13:15:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah!
2021-06-28 08:15:00,wallstreetbets,"No..I'm saying it wasn't really a crash.

I understand what a bear market is and all of that.

I just disagree that a couple of weeks of a drawdown followed by a massive bubble generated by historically dumb people who cannot even do the simplest of financial analyses is not a crash.

2000 was a stock market crash

2008 was a housing market crash

2020 was just a short term blip setting up for a major rug pull in a ton of things from stocks to that digital funny money to stupid pieces of cardboard with LeBron James on them.

The crash is coming and yolo culture / leverage won't save the market."
2021-06-28 08:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Lemme guess. You held onto your puts too long (well into April/May) and couldn’t bring yourself to go long when the fed created one of the most accommodating monetary policies in history. 

People weren’t stupid. They saw the underlying conditions and positioned accordingly.

The only stupid people are the ones that lost money during one of the easiest periods in modern history to make money supported by a dovish Fed and recovering economy.

Check out the average p/e of the S&P or Nasdaq now vs 2000 if you still think this is a bubble."
2021-06-28 08:23:28,wallstreetbets,"It's not done yet.

You have to sell before a crash to lock in profits.

We are still in the middle of the baseball game.

I think we're closer to the 8th inning while others might think it's the 3rd.

I made my money and I'm happy to wait out the obvious crash coming once forbearances end, the stimulus unemployment checks dry up, and the Congressional logjam begins in earnest."
2021-06-28 08:24:40,wallstreetbets,"For sure that will trigger a correction. Will it lead to a prolonged bear market, let’s see....if it does then the fed will probably cut rates again and you’ll see more stimulus tbh."
2021-06-28 08:31:17,wallstreetbets,"Assuming that the Fed can cut rates again.

Lots of assumptions."
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BIDU technical analysis. I'm quite new to TA so don't judge. $BIDU's drop from February to March seems to represent a complete crash. Somewhat of a replica to the GFC in 2008/9 and the recent crypt0 crash. As it's undervalued according to its growing market yet low P/E of 9.44, I think it will respond to the crash in the coming months/years with a full recovery and move to all time highs as it's more related to the S&P index than a digital currency which no one really knows the true value of. 

[Baidu Chart](https://preview.redd.it/yf19jy2wgy771.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=573bc107356f617a537292a2679c7f863bca62fa)

[S&P 500 during the GFC](https://preview.redd.it/2m02men0hy771.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=09631599efc6082a7f6ccf58e07907075b8fcd17)

[Recent Crypt0 crash](https://preview.redd.it/usd13024hy771.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c0c5dbff8b16fb0a78e8316ecaf207f3ece42a9)

Similar to the crypt0 crash it failed to maintain a V shaped recovery unlike during the GFC. If it ends up playing out more similarly to the recent crypt0 crash it may continue to trade sideways. This still limits the potential downside and a stop loss just below the 173 support level would minimise the risk of experiencing any further drops as that region has been tested and been resilient multiple times. Other than that I also believe in the company long term and thing it is currently undervalued."

All I know is this company interview process is tough as shit to get into so theyre loaded with geniuses and they deal with BIG Data. Data is being more and more collected and aggregated across every single possible sector from your fridge to masturbation habits, medicine, airliners, and warfare. The amount of innovation and business its going to produce is yet imaginable. And Palantir is the head of it all, far beyond any of its competitors.

This company has projects already all over the world, with its eyes wide and deep in every industry. They have an overview of the needs of big data analysis as a whole, as well as insight into whats happening with all that has some integration with tech. They likely have domain knowledge into businesses and trends that current leading company themselves dont have.

With such a wide variety of work, its a ripe place for new ideas to come together, and for Palantir to lead itself into new ventures. They have already for example purchased Lillium, an air taxi service company. They have also bought stake into a variety of unrelated businesses they believe to succeed. So I already know its happening, that the leaders of this company are taking advantage of its unqiue power.

Long live PLTR. My other big investment is COIN which is down 50% so unneeded disclaimer of my retardation there"

2021-06-28 11:55:21,wallstreetbets,"True, but over 4 days the risk is more limited.

I went for it, but spent most of my wad for this kind of play on EXPR.  Buy-write at $7.01, paired with 6.5c 7/2 for $0.82 of premium.  My break even is $6.19, but so long as it finishes the week ITM then I pocket 32 cents per share, which works out to some fantastic annualized percentage over that short timespan.  I got 5 of those as well as a single 7c 7/2 buy write with $0.55 of premium.  That's an even higher annualized percentage on that but there's higher risk being ATM as opposed to ITM."

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What’s the right REIT play? So I’m a retard, and probably going to get in trouble by trying to think too much but here goes.

By my count (that means I didn’t really count), you’ve got a few million people in Florida and maybe even some other gulf coast states like Texas shitting bricks about living in high-rise apartments and wondering if their 40+ year old building is going to collapse, too. 

So they start looking for single family homes, duplexes, those wooden 5-on-1 things being slapped up everywhere in the last five years—basically anything else besides a high-rise to live in.

How do you play the REITs right now?

Short the REITs heavily invested in Southeast/Southern/Florida high-rises?

Or buy REITs that are concentrated on houses and smaller units?

How do you even go about finding the right kind of REIT?

And I am an asshole for even thinking about this kind of play—how people are afraid and trying to capitalize on it? Now that I write it out, it sounds terrible.

Help me out with the right REIT play here.

Thanks, retards."

OPEN. - open door technologies is providing tech to millions of new homes, like when people buy a new home. Not a REIT - but a good play since millions of people will be moving this year.

ZG - zillow group is tragically underpriced right now according to analysts. If you search analysts pricing models and charts ZG averages between 150 to 170 and its selling for....$118 - and millions of people will use zillows web products as they buy and sell homes this year.

Good REITs i own and love:
ANLY
SBRA
CTRE
ACRE

Ps. He asked for advice. So i offered it. If any of my REITs are considered below desired wsb market cap please dont delete my post. REITs dont always have $10 billion capital or whatever your rule is because that is not exactly how REITs work.

Dividends. All 4 REITs mentioned have big dividend payouts. Averaging around 6 to 8% 

Positions. I own a few shares in all the mentioned companies above and i buy a few more every week. Total invested in those 6 companies is about $4,600 and it increases each week when one of them has a bad day i buy more. And i never sell."

But the best part: you don't really have to think about it, just sit back and let those dividends trickle in.  That's the whole point of dividend plays.

I'll also recommend to you a couple financial plays that fund real estate projects: Oaktree Specialty Lending (OCSL) and Lument Finance Trust (LFT).  Both are up 8% and 14% respectively for me this year (irrelevant, little point in selling a dividend play) and they currently pay dividends in the 8-9% annual range (and higher if you've bought cheaper).

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Still Long CNHI I believe CNHI to be significantly undervalued.  Even though grain commodity prices have pulled back from recent highs (I think that selling is overdone to the downside and will snap back), agricultural equipment manufacturers are still in a bull cycle.

I recently was in the market to purchase a new/newer New Holland T7 series tractor and inventories (nationwide) are slim.  Similar experience from numerous dealerships; inventories are low, and new deliveries will be stretched out do to supply chain issues.  FYI, tractors and new farm equipment use a lot of computers and sensors and the chip shortages have impacted more than just automobiles.  In addition, precision ag guidance equipment (monitors, satellite receivers, nav controllers) are all in short supply.

When pricing out new farm equipment.  Nobody ever really plays MSPR.  If you do, you are probably not very smart or terrible at negotiating.  There are almost always cash discounts, manufacturer incentives, and low cost financing options.  Sometimes these programs even get stacked together (i.e. cash incentives plus low-rate or zero percent financing).  However, I noticed that dealerships and companies like CNHI are offering much less lucrative incentives on new equipment purchases.  Normally, they have to incentive new purchases with rebates; much less this year.  All this leads me to believe that CNHI will significantly exceed earnings expectations given their expanded margins.

Beyond this, the spinoff of their on-highway business into a separate company will unlock a lot of value.

Also, have listened to Mario Gabelli on numerous occasions on CNBC give this thoughts about CNHI on CNBC going to $25 and then to $50.

I'm long CNHI and accumulating more shares as I'm able.

2021-06-28 09:00:02,wallstreetbets,"This meme is quite funny, however we must remember that the notion of holding a winning trade is retrospective... and while in the moment you can still be cool and composed on a volatile trade, waiting for things to work out, sometimes such a wait can be your undoing.

But as any good trader knows, this market is incredibly irrational, so any violent swing in wrong direction which sustains itself in near term could hinder your account by tying up funds... indefinitely (i.e. bagholder). 

So then I guess guy in this meme will have to sit upside down strapped-in on a stalled roller coaster during prolong mechanical failure... still cool and composed with no emotion."

2021-06-28 05:43:57,wallstreetbets,And her boyfriend as da third wheel
2021-06-28 13:12:33,wallstreetbets,That looks like me when I do anything in public with your wife too.
2021-06-28 13:24:10,wallstreetbets,You sure that’s not the look your wife gives you when you’re doing the dirty without her bf around?
2021-06-28 15:48:52,wallstreetbets,You clearly are talking about security. I think how one answer this question is a tell of your age.
2021-06-28 08:45:42,wallstreetbets,More like how much the government owes him.
2021-06-28 04:24:40,wallstreetbets,What part?
2021-06-28 13:44:43,wallstreetbets,So is your wife. ZING
2021-06-28 08:56:37,wallstreetbets,Make sure you do it in a taxable account only though.
2021-06-28 08:58:08,wallstreetbets,I also have some of these since 2017 haha.
2021-06-28 07:53:39,wallstreetbets,Dude yeah and there’s always something kinda off about the managers. They got a wonky look to em

2021-06-28 06:18:53,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was CP as well, but if you look at the drop tower part, there’s a yellow and green twisted rollercoaster directly behind him. At CP it’s a lot further away and Dorney it’s right by each other"
2021-06-28 13:11:05,wallstreetbets,No this is Valley Fair in MN.  Has many of the same rides as Cedar Point but much smaller.
2021-06-28 09:54:04,wallstreetbets,This. Taking a phone out on a coaster is a dick move. My relative got hit in the shoulder once by a phone while we were sitting in the back seat and it caused a large painful bruising area.
2021-06-28 13:47:37,wallstreetbets,I'm positive this was filmed with a GoPro strapped to someone's chest or head.
2021-06-28 15:28:37,wallstreetbets,"lmao that's what went through my mind when writing ""when trading"" didn't wanna shoot shots at people who were felt drained"
2021-06-28 06:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Yea definitely has the same feel, but Magnum and Raptor are nowhere near each other."
2021-06-28 07:45:33,wallstreetbets,Wait for real? This isn’t cedar point??

2021-06-28 01:58:31,wallstreetbets,"I never said there was a history of accidents, I said it’s an accident waiting to happen. There are rides that go years with no accidents, then have one. 

Engineering a tunnel that close to someone’s arm is stupid."
2021-06-28 08:30:30,wallstreetbets,"This is a quote I found that helps sum up my concerns-

“IAAPA Q&A interview a few years back and learned that rides with near misses/headchoppers are always designed to be at least 25cm (just under 1 foot) farther than the reach of an individual at the maximum height allowed on the ride. For example, if a ride is designed for people from 52 to 84 inches, the headchoppers are designed to be a minimum of 25 centimetres past the extended arm reach of someone meeting that 84 inch height maximum.”"
2021-06-28 05:39:56,wallstreetbets,Maybe a train track with loops and spins is also just an accident waiting to happen so to prevent this they should just take it down /s
2021-06-28 07:59:55,wallstreetbets,"I mis identified the ride. My mistake, sorry internet peoples"
2021-06-28 07:55:19,wallstreetbets,I’m talking about the side walls not the top of it
2021-06-28 12:36:42,wallstreetbets,yeah but still
2021-06-28 10:05:53,wallstreetbets,Wait is this a Wendy's?

2021-06-28 07:19:57,wallstreetbets,No worries I can't wait to hit up CP too I know it has the best/most coasters.
2021-06-28 07:50:21,wallstreetbets,And Talon is clearly there lol
2021-06-28 06:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I also thought it was cedar point at first due to the Intamin Impulse in the background. But to my knowledge Cedar Point does not have a wild mouse nor do they have that many trees. 

The tunnels definitely jumped my brain right to magnum though."
2021-06-28 10:21:17,wallstreetbets,"Or, you know, the mountains in one of the shots. Not any of those in sandusky Ohio."
2021-06-28 14:20:25,wallstreetbets,"nah valley fair doesn’t have a red steel coaster , theirs is green and it’s called wild thing"
2021-06-28 13:14:18,wallstreetbets,"Free phone, though! :)"
2021-06-28 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,The selfies 100% are not.
2021-06-28 07:50:55,wallstreetbets,It's true. Definitely Dorney
2021-06-28 13:35:01,wallstreetbets,"It's all Dorney. All three parks mentioned are Cedar Fair and they all have very similar rides.

Steel Force, Wave Swinger, Possessed, Hydra, Wild Mouse, Steel Force, Dominator, and finally the flipping flat ride outside of Hydra. In that order."
2021-06-28 01:59:21,wallstreetbets,It's not an accident waiting to happen. It's got plenty of clearance. I've ridden Steel Force tons of times. That tunnel is nowhere near the riders.
2021-06-28 08:15:17,wallstreetbets,It's not as close as it seems. But yeah whenever I go through that tunnel I put my hands down
2021-06-28 09:01:21,wallstreetbets,What do you think further than the reach means? Also unless your a goddamn siamang ape you aren’t going to get close
2021-06-28 14:23:40,wallstreetbets,"It’s all Wendy’s, it’s all cake. Zoom back camera."

2021-06-28 08:56:21,wallstreetbets,I wondered why this looked like Valleyfair....
2021-06-28 08:39:40,wallstreetbets,"CP, the worlds roller coast."
2021-06-28 08:43:01,wallstreetbets,"It has the best/most lines as well.  I live 45 mins away from CP and I haven't been in almost a decade because of how overcrowded it is.   3-4 hour waits to get on anything worth riding, $20 beers, massive crowds of idiots.....plus tickets are over 100 now.  Just not worth it."
2021-06-28 11:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Its the overall quality of the collection that makes CP. There are better versions of nearly every coaster there elsewhere in the world but no park has a collection that solid. 

They have two rides which I believe are best in class for quality which are Steel Vengeance and Top Thrill Dragster. 

SteVe is my favorite coaster out of the ones I've ridden. I cannot wait for Iron Gwazi to open so I have an RMC hybrid closer to home."
2021-06-28 08:55:45,wallstreetbets,I also noticed Hydra
2021-06-28 07:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Ironic, given the park's name"
2021-06-28 10:40:58,wallstreetbets,"Cedar point used to have wildcat which was similar, though it was painted neon green and purple. They removed that one a while ago though."
2021-06-28 09:19:41,wallstreetbets,I legit thought it was cedar too damn
2021-06-28 09:38:25,wallstreetbets,I think it’s Paramount Canada’s Wonderland
2021-06-28 02:02:35,wallstreetbets,"You do know there is no rules on how far beams and tunnels can be in building rides right... 

That sounds like famous last words

That tunnel is just a few feet away max."
2021-06-28 09:20:08,wallstreetbets,It means if you put Shaq or anyone tall on that ride it’s going to past the halfway point
2021-06-28 06:50:40,wallstreetbets,"You’re welcome, it’s cum ($CUM)."

2021-06-28 09:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Same, saw steel venom"
2021-06-28 10:38:08,wallstreetbets,The one in Sandusky ohio right? THE Cedar Point? Ive only seen lines like that once in decade (during hallo-weekends) and i go there once-twice a year. Havent gone this year tho so with it opening back up and short staffed i can imagine the lines being rough. People have always complained about their lines but honestly its no different from disney. You got your big rides that are close to 45 minutes to an hour.  Smaller rides you can hop on in <15. And everywhere in between is 15-30. New rides are the only outlier. Ive waited 3 hours for gatekeeper and 2 for steel vengeance. Dragster is a roll of the dice cause it breaks down a ton. So i have no idea where people get the idea that these lines are ridiculous.
2021-06-28 09:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Fast passes, my dude. 

Restores the awesomeness to a trip there, at a cost. If you’re going to schlep there from any distance, it’s real nice to be able to ride at will. Hell, last time we had time to go back to the cabin and day drink between coaster rounds."
2021-06-28 10:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh dang...... I will definitely go one day at least, hopefully I catch a low key day."

[**$WKHS - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858754684804923412/JH73Niam.png)

➥ Absolutely cracked looking chart. Textbook bull flag with a huge gap left at 30. May encounter some resistance around 18.60, but aside from that it's clear skies. If we're lucky we've also got ourselves a front row seat to a short squeeze too, since the short interest on this ticker is at 40%. If someone wants to writeup a DD on this stock and start pumping it across subreddits so apes and algos can pick up on it, be my guest. I'll look to take a position this week. Will be grabbing calls if we break the flag (probably around 16.40), and then selling / rolling them depending what happens at 18.60 (sell if we bounce, roll if we keep flying).

&nbsp;

[**$BIDU - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858879744581304330/bidu.png)

 ➥ Another really clean chart. We're sitting right at the 203/205 resistance, so calls are valid at any point above it. Will likely make a quick trip up to 223, then 228 if it starts running. Above that it's clear skis up to 264. The only reason I even included that is cause ROKU blew me out to the upside last week, and I don't wanna get pantsed again. I know many traders are eyeing this trade and the OI on it is fucking huge, so there may be some funny gamma action and MM fuckery w/ this one. Regardless, insanely clean technical setup.

&nbsp;

[**$PLTR - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858880137840164904/pltr.png)

➥ Our favourite meme stock makes a comeback! I initially didn't even notice the runup at first until someone on my Discord pointed it out, and I'm also hesitant to play PLTR cause I'm too fuckin' dumb, but the chart on it looks cute. If we get above 27.50 we likely fly to 30, since there's literally 0 resistances. There's alot of money to be made here, and similar to WKHS, it's a meme stock, so if it starts running, it *really* starts running.

&nbsp;


[**$XLF - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858882188527403038/xlf.png)

➥ Every single fuckin' bank stock more or less has the EXACT same chart, have a look if you don't believe me. As a result, I'm just gonna play XLF instead since I can make more money trading the ETF ([See my writeup on collateral trades for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/)). We're likely gonna run straight into 37.60 by close on Monday if I had to guess, but after that it's largely up to whatever numbers the banks release (probably priced in). To those who don't know, banks will be able to disclose their planned capital distributions after close, so that's gonna be the make or break for this play. Calls are good above 37.60, but don't be surprised if we randomly gap. Overhead resistances are located at 38.10 and 38.50.

&nbsp;

Aaaand that more or less wraps up the watchlist. We should have ourselves an exciting week of trading! Let me know if you have any technical setups you personally plan on playing, or if I botched something on mine! Happy trading everyone :\^)"

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ford 2023 Long Calls I know it's not a lot, but I'm putting in around $213 for three 2023 Ford Calls with a strike price of $30. Ford is a good brand. Ford is quintessentially American and a keystone of innovation. Here is why I like ford. Tesla is expensive. German electric (VW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche) is pretty pricey, not to mention that VW uses a different charging adapter than Tesla, which creates even more confusion for the average consumer (""Why can't I charge at this Walmart?""). Ford has been undervalued ever since they decided not to take the 2008 bail-out money. That's okay since that ship has sailed and they are out from this for the most part.

Americans for the most part don't like change. Electric cars bring change. Between having to charge at home or at work, finding a new mechanic, or even learning all the new ins and outs of an electric car, this change and influx of new information is scary for the average American consumer. No matter the brand of car, new electric cars will bring this plight. Keeping with what they know (which is American-made-American brands), these consumers would opt for Ford in a heartbeat (if ford is all they have ever owned). There is brand loyalty in the car sector. Once someone finds something they like, they tend to stick with that car or brand for as long as they can, or until they feel they need a switch. 

1. Ford has brand loyalty from its current base, which can make the shift to electric more comfortable.
2. Old people aren't buying electric cars (new cars, even) en masse. The CPI-E shows a rise in their cost of living. This will affect everyone, but for someone with higher living and healthcare costs (old people), buying a car might not be a top priority (plus if you're not able to drive in a few, the opportunity of the car purchase might be too great compared to saving money for healthcare or fun things).  
3. Electric competition is not great. Cadillac is barely in the door, Toyota Electric is viewed as a luxury level, not an alternative choice for the avg consumer, Honda has a few electric cars (but they're seriously no fun--cmon, cars should be fun. Ford has fun, Ford has innovation. Ford has price, Ford has variety. 
4. Compared to other car companies, ford stock is dumb cheap. 
5. Ford's lineup is their greatest strength. A car for everyone. Electric or not. In every price range. In every industry. Electric cars being fully mainstream should be about 10 years out. We're lagging in chargers, acceptance, and price. Ford hybrid vehicles fill this void, all while not separating electric or nonelectric into higher classes of luxury features (Toyota). Electric here is not a status symbol, it is a mainstream dream, and Ford wants it to become reality.

Cyberpunk isn't our reality. Tunnels going between cities isn't coming anytime soon. The cybertruck is a luxury vehicle with a boastful design that screams (look at me, I've got money, and even if this car can tug a boat, I don't care, I'm definitely a suburbanite with a brand new toy.) Tesla's are cool. Tesla's are fun. But they catch eyes, and they make electric cars a status symbol, rather than an environmental obligation. Ford combats that, directly, fairly, and even if some of their prices (Mach-E with a starting price fo 41k-ish) is a bit high, the Mach-E is just a fun version of a mustang and is meant to catch eyes, unlike the Lightning or the Fusion.

Ford's lineup: [https://www.ford.com/](https://www.ford.com/)

Inflation is looming: Sure, probably, it might already be here. I don't care. Economies go in cycles, boo hoo. People will always need cars. Might not be able to purchase a car, but who cars, you can lease. Ford has their own leasing LLC under their ticker, and more importantly, FORD HAS AFFORDABLE VEHICLES THAT SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS THAT DONT COMPROMISE TOO MUCH QUALITY FOR THEIR PRICE OR CHANGE IN SIZE. 

Ford is a value investment. What are your thoughts?"

https://twitter.com/Tasca3/status/1409102535542124546

I think at the moment they're a tad overvalued. But I have some huge faith in the F-150 rollout. The frunk is a slick compared to a bed cover, and being able to plug your shit in without a generator is real nice. 

There's also a big govt service vehicle contract coming up, and them getting electrified now has some nice macros.

Agree with a 2022 or 2023 play or commons. Think 30$ might be a bit high though."
2021-06-28 00:04:31,wallstreetbets,"I like Ford as an EV play...especially because of the very real possibility that they'll eventually be dropping electric versions of their classic models.  Soon as they drop an electric mustang you're gonna see the suburbs full of the fucking things.  


You can always bank on a midlife crisis to pay out."
2021-06-27 23:25:33,wallstreetbets,$CLF is a better car
2021-06-28 02:09:00,wallstreetbets,"I like the idea, but I think there’s a more profitable way to play it if you’re looking that far out. Wait for the next big market correction, when someone at the Fed sneezes and the market tanks. That’s when you buy lower priced LEAPS, with the premium bled out of them. When Ford is getting ready to launch the lighting, then unload them. Don’t wait for the launch… sell the anticipation of the launch."
2021-06-27 23:31:49,wallstreetbets,Ya leaps are great
2021-06-28 00:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Ive been buying and selling 2023 calls on Ford for the last month. Seems to be printing. Im just sticking to my word this time and selling once it starts to reverse, and buying once it appears to have bottomed out. 

But realistically I think Ford is a $20 max stock. I would really be surprised if it ever went higher than that just from the number of shares they have. And if it ever reaches that 20, itll probably be around late 2022 early 2023"
2021-06-27 23:17:12,wallstreetbets,"I just watched a 30 min review of the new Ford Lightning. It really looks like a game changer for Ford. The F-150 has been the best selling truck forever already, so I’m not sure if it’s going to have a huge impact on their sales. But I also opened up a few 2023 leaps right after watching that review."
2021-06-27 23:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Great DD.  I live 3 miles from the Glass House and agree with everything you said.  However, you missed the most important reason to bet Ford; Jim Farley is total Bad Ass CEO.  I was surprised he didn't get the nod after Jim Hackett.  But the day he was announced, I started piling into Ford at about 6.30.  Bet the Jockey, not the Horse.  (Unless it's WKHS.  Lol)."

2021-06-28 02:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, with the Bronco and Maverick out, I’d be surprised if they don’t announce killer sales numbers next quarter.  

The Maverick just laughed at Hyundais joke of a truck (fugly) and is gonna still like crazy at that base price, even if it’s lacking a bit."

2021-06-28 01:59:55,wallstreetbets,Ford is never going to go anywhere near $30
2021-06-28 01:29:53,wallstreetbets,"Ford is a fucking boomer cyclical stock. The best time to buy them is when the P/E is high, not low. It’s going to drill and your leaps are going to zero"
2021-06-27 23:44:14,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you about Ford being a better stock than tsla. I think there are some wildcards in the auto industry that might shift things significantly. I think subscription models, ride hailing (Uber, etc) and self driving cars could all make for a major shift in families transportation spending. My guess is some of the giants will fail to adapt and get clobbered."
2021-06-27 23:28:33,wallstreetbets,Wasted your money if anything it’ll be around it’s current price by then or lower due to them paying dividends again.

2021-06-27 23:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Every single car company on earth 🌍 has gone bankrupt 😖 at some point in their life. Every. Single. One. (*except for two of them that is)  One is Ford 🧐the other is Tesla 😎
I’ve always had a suspicion that Elon Musk was gonna off Tesla to Ford.  I know, I know it sounds crazy but during the last financial meltdown (2008-2009ish) Tesla was going through a lot and I really felt Elon would off the company to not deal with the hassle of owning a car company. Elon’s mind is in space he really wants to make a Cowboy Bebop futuristic reality. I’m not so sure he truly even thinks he’s an actual person at all, I wouldn’t be surprised if he gets bored of Tesla during the next major downturn and sells the company to focus on making asteroid bases or some shyt. Who would he sell to? Ford. He respects Ford he feels he is similar to Henry Ford and once his electric ⚡️ car “accomplishments” are done ✔️ then Tesla is the next PayPal (sold off to finance new adventures) and Ford Fucks the Long way😎🧐P.S. I 😻 Mustangs I had a 2001 Mustang Bullitt wrecked it and almost died but that’s a story for some other Sub 

TLDR Ford Fucks in a Wunderbar way Elon Musk will dump Tesla and colonize the solar system with robot lizards🤯  Bullish Ford

EDIT: The only two American car companies to never file for bankruptcy. There’s been a couple foreign auto companies that also never went bankrupt. Bankruptcy in the auto industry is nearly a given, hard business to run."

If you don't care about being street legal, or even about actually driving the car other than to set performance records, it is not that difficult to make something crazy. The S Plaid, is awesome, because it is a luxury sedan with all sorts of cool tech and plenty of storage space that drives like a supercar. There is, AFAIK, nothing out there that comes close, especially at the price point."

Besides that, every legacy automaker is about to experience a very difficult next 15 years as their ICE divisions make less and less money and eventually go deep red, while trying to build an EV division with the massive costs of doing so and the difficulty of being profitable in the first few years.

I honestly have no idea which, if any, of the major automakers survive the transition and retain anything close to the market share they have today."

2021-06-28 17:23:08,wallstreetbets,"This is true, this is true. I really should have phrased it more along the lines of how I can see Tesla and Ford in “bed together” so to speak. I really believe getting these EV’s out there is going to be really hard and I can see a world where both Tesla and Ford come together (specifically a legacy car company joining with one of these EV companies). Not sure exactly how that would play out but I can see some mergers happening in the next decade."
2021-06-28 16:36:03,wallstreetbets,"The efocus was a failure. I drove the MK3 focus (gas), big fan of the chassis but you can tell it was designed bottom up.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bank stocks have been doing well last week, charts still look like an uptrend. I’m currently in WFC & JPM Bank stocks have lost over 400billion the past year due to covid, with restrictions being lifted on banks, the positive week they had last week, they’re looking to try and make 200billion back within the next year, but that’s next year. My calls are JPM strike 157.50 exp July 9th and my WFC is strike 47.50 and exp august 20th. I’m fairly new but I’ve been doing my studying and due diligence for 40+ hours a week for like two months. Just curious on everyone’s take on these plays (and if they’re good I hope you jump in and make some money!)

EDIT: also looking for people/groups to bounce stock ideas off of, still newish to the field haven’t found a solid group yet"

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NNDM - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Breaking Out of Two Large Patterns PT 12+ Saw a great setup here (actually two) and I know you guys love Russell stocks. 

Let's break the chart down color by color:

[$NNDM 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/bjh7el0yww771.png?width=2219&format=png&auto=webp&s=724e0aa0a6eecfe1b8961c589c4172274ca0a19a)

**(RED)**

Symmetrical triangle with a bullish bias since it's coming from upside. Solid uptick in volume on the breakout candle 6/23. The price target for this setup would be around **10.00**. It would be invalid if we dropped under **8.30.**

**(TEAL)**

Large descending wedge pattern - similar to many meme/growth/Russell stocks recently. Normally would have a bearish bias - but this time it broke to the upside. The price target for this pattern would be **12.00.** Technically it wouldn't be invalid until we lost **6.00** support - but I would cut the stock loose if we invalidate the red setup regardless.

**(YELLOW)**

These are key price levels on the chart. The most important ones to watch out for are **9.97 - 10.64**, this is a key supply zone, or a series of resistances. This is also what I would target if you were just playing the smaller setup - expect a rejection initially here. If we can clear it, it will be fantastic support going forward and propel us to our **12.00** price target. There are two more levels above at **13.30, 15.51 -** depending on momentum maybe we see these as well.

**(SUMMARY)**

NNDM is breaking out of two large setups on the daily chart. If you aren't in already - we are still near the breakout point so assuming we don't gap up huge Monday there is still a solid entry. The price targets for these setups are first this supply zone from **9.97 - 10.64,** which will be important resistance - followed by **12.00.** Levels above that final price target are **13.30, 15.51** in the event momentum blows us right through. Look for each level to become support as we clear it. The setup is invalid below **8.30** so I would cut your position loose if we get a daily close under that. Calls are super cheap - but I personally am fond of **August 10c** for this scenario.

*I do not yet hold a position but will be looking to open one assuming we don't gap up huge Monday\~*

*Not Financial Advice*"

2021-06-28 07:39:47,wallstreetbets,"Last fall, NNDM continually held stock offerings to raise money. Yoav Stern, who heads the company, knew that although the product (Dragonfly 3D printer) they offer is revolutionary, the actual function of the machine was not up to snuff for mass production, which is what they seek to make the company successful. It’s a lot of technical jargon, but it pretty much comes down to this: the Dragonfly can print circuit boards that actually do work, but they are prone to failure due to the nozzles that spit the material not being refined enough to do real detailed work. 

Think of it as operating on someone with a hatchet instead of a scalpel. Yes, you can sharpen a hatchet enough that it makes a clean cut, but DAMN would it be nice to have something a little smaller and more precise to do better work. The other problem is that it’s really fixing hard to dictate all the steps a machine like that needs to go through to consistently perform such complex tasks. If only the machine could “learn” as it makes mistakes, maybe it could teach itself to do a better job as time goes on (more on this later).

So anyways, now Yoav and his buddies have a metric shit ton of cash after all the offerings. He goes shopping for the two things he needs to make this tech really feasible: machine learning/A.I., and smaller, more accurate components to scale for precision. This is where his most recent acquisitions come in. DeepCube, Micro Mechanical, and Nano Fabrica. 

These companies are exactly what he needs to bring his newest product (Dragonfly 2.0) to market with the ability to print consistent, repeatable, quality circuit boards on a grand/mass production scale. And thanks to the stock offerings, they have $1.4B left after the acquisitions to actually do it. 

This is where we’re at."

2021-06-28 06:29:06,wallstreetbets,I WISH I could trade options contracts like this in the UK.  I can't seem to find any service to allow this kind of leverage or trading instrument.
2021-06-28 06:32:40,wallstreetbets,You forgot the comma and 420
2021-06-28 07:21:42,wallstreetbets,It’s funny because the “smart kids” go to private school and out of state school 😂. Now they’re all praying for Bernie Sanders Loan forgiveness to get them out from behind of the Wendy’s dumpster.
2021-06-28 07:33:46,wallstreetbets,What did the $260k afford you?

If you didn't see this coming your either not a science/business major. Or are as smooth brain as it gets.
Anyone who is willing to take on that amount of debt with the legal obligations of a student debt( can't write it off on a bankruptcy) is either dumb or stupid"

2021-06-27 23:16:31,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you pay $260k in college debt. Take the L & move on. You could easily 2x that if you make the right investments.
2021-06-27 23:50:23,wallstreetbets,"I would love for WISH to moon but I find it extremely hard to believe that someone with $260k in debt has $50k to their name at all, especially not $50k to chance on the stock market. I am 10 years out of of school making $90k a year, my student loans are paid off and still don’t have that much available to trade with."

2021-06-28 00:36:16,wallstreetbets,"Out of state schools, but mostly just taking out student loans for dumb shit. Some of my classmates had loans 4 to 5 times the amount i paid. Same school, same dorm, same in state tuition rates, completely different financial mentalities. You can take out a school's COA, easily, and then some, even though realistically you don't need it. Had an idiot roomate who took out student loans 2 years in a row to go on spring break vacation and just rolled interest over for years compounding the absolute shit out of it."
2021-06-28 06:35:30,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty cheap depending on how far he went and how much he needed to take out. My alma mater is now 72K a year for undergrad and masters degrees are even more (around 80). If he went to dental school he could be paying around 100 for equipment and loans to pay rent, food...etc. slightly less for medical school but still in 80-90 range for 4 years. On top of what he had to take out for undergrad. It's brutal out here."
2021-06-28 01:06:17,wallstreetbets,How the fuck does someone with a $260k education think that wish is going to $69?  Is there a refund policy?

2021-06-27 22:06:32,wallstreetbets,OP is a moron and likely went to a private school for his gender studies degree.

2021-06-28 10:51:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm not even med or anything special, just out of state engineering cuts me 60grand a year from tuition alone. Rent is about 1k a month, you gotta get food and shit, if you are lineant you get 260k after 4 years lol. So kids, community college is the way, but I will say, I learned a lot useful information at school because you get what you pay for. Although I prob shoulda took my first two year at a cheaper place because it's just math, physics, humanities and shit which is pretty much same everywhere."

2021-06-28 10:49:52,wallstreetbets,"I was going to say, even if they’re a medical doctor fresh out of med school and are now a resident physician (*not* and attending physician), they’re probably making no more than $150k to $200k a year, max. It’s not until you’re a full fledged attending physician that the big bucks really start to roll in. Sure, they could be a neurosurgeon or plastic surgeon, but it took my dad a few years to pay off his loans too for this very reason. 

Now yeah, it is true that once you’re an attending physician, unless you’re just absolutely horrible with your money, a student loan payment is a drop in the bucket, especially if you are in a relationship and your partner/spouse works and you guys help share/split the costs."

2021-06-28 00:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Regular in state public schools are approaching this with tuition plus living costs. 20-30kyear tuition + 10-15/cost of living loans add up over 4-5 years. 

And any professional school which is one of the few avenues left to even hope for a high paying career leave most students who weren’t from rich families with this level of debt (these are not private or extraneous loans)

It’s really hard to do it any other way when part time minimum wage jobs to “offset” education don’t even make a dent in what is required for basic education."
2021-06-28 07:11:18,wallstreetbets,BU is 65k a year plus fees and room and board. A bachelors in liberal arts could cost about this much without funding. Why that is legal I’ll never know.

2021-06-27 22:09:08,wallstreetbets,Well lifelong students never plan on paying back their debt. They just keep on rolling over debts and they never actually plan on paying it back lol
2021-06-28 00:46:29,wallstreetbets,How many wives you got?
2021-06-28 03:47:30,wallstreetbets,You mean going to school + not working + driving a lambo?
2021-06-28 15:07:23,wallstreetbets,What the fuck were they buying
2021-06-28 16:49:51,wallstreetbets,It's not even that it's footing the cost to go see and Impress doctors to take you in for residency it's great if you get in and can make some money my cousin has done this and had to fly to like 3/4 states only to end up working for different doctors while footing all the travel until she got placed. It's insane the hoops she has jumped through just to start.
2021-06-28 19:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Undergrad education = 135k

Med school education = 240k

Then you get a job as a resident that leaves you completely unable to make payments for anywhere from 3 to 7 years. Interest rates on your student loans typically range from something like 6.5% to 8.5%, and interest on most of it accrues from the second you get the check, so by the time you start practicing, your oldest undergrad loans have been racking up interest for maybe 11 years or more. 

And that assumes that you didn't get a master's degree in between (maybe another 50k-80k) which many physicians will. 

Thanks Obama."
2021-06-28 19:25:07,wallstreetbets,"I worked 4am as a custodian and kill myself in school to maintain a gpa of 3.95 to get full scholarship at BYUI, I did not pay a dollar for my education. It is definitely the lifestyle you decided to have. You are go. A have to learn the hard way. And that is for anyone who live paycheck by paycheck. If you cannot afford a car use a bike or a used used car. If you cannot get the latest iPhone don’t get it. If you don’t have enough money don’t eat out and budget. Wake up America stop competing and stop faking your reality with your Instagram pictures. I saved and saved as much as I could and walked in the winter and froze in the snow but that was the way to save. I saved enough money and bought 5.6k shares of SRNE (Sorrento therapeutics) this will make me a multi-millionaire in the next 1-5 years. Sacrifice yourself now by having a frugal life to enjoy a bright and wealthy future. Long and strong SRNE!"
2021-06-28 00:58:54,wallstreetbets,"So you can borrow money for ""school"" but factor in not working at all and then you don't have to work part time or full?"

2021-06-28 19:04:04,wallstreetbets,800? Yikes. You sure that’s not both physicians? I’m an er doc and mine was 400K when I finished residency. I was definitely on the high side compared to my colleagues. I doubt that was due to lifestyle choices during residency. Most live like a college freshman. Maybe there’s a mortgage included in that?
2021-06-28 19:57:10,wallstreetbets,True.  I had 2 kids and a non-working wife while in med school.  I STILL have loans out many years later.  Not that I’m in any hurry to pay them off…kek.
2021-06-28 12:25:22,wallstreetbets,"The best investment is to go to school and get all the free money(student loan) you can get to invest, not to pay for school, and when you are done with school you are already a millionaire.

2021-06-28 05:05:17,wallstreetbets,Delicious!
2021-06-28 16:20:44,wallstreetbets,Lmao residents making 150k a year. More like 65.
2021-06-28 19:02:03,wallstreetbets,Residents make ~55k
2021-06-28 18:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Residents dont make 150-200k, they make 50-80k depending on where you train (3-8 years). Most attending doctors make 150-300k their whole career, its only procedural subspecialties that make more (surgeons, cardiology, GI, derm, etc can make 500k-1M+, especially surgeons), but they also have significantly longer training and working time.

Not at all uncommon to leave med school with 200-250k debt (most are 50-60k/year), but doctors can also get cheaper loans/mortgages etc. and most pay off the loan debt in 5-10 years (or less, depending on specialty)."
2021-06-27 23:43:55,wallstreetbets,I can see for those but certainly not for Liberal Arts.
2021-06-28 05:49:41,wallstreetbets,You’re smoking crack if you think public school are 30k in tuition fees
2021-06-28 00:58:43,wallstreetbets,"Most in-state schools charge about 10k, and I don’t know a single in-state school that charges more than 16k."
2021-06-27 22:55:09,wallstreetbets,How times have changed. I remember all the downvotes that a 3 contract post would get
2021-06-27 22:10:16,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah I can’t read I’m retard. Just realized that too
2021-06-28 00:22:03,wallstreetbets,Don’t pay it 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-28 09:08:40,wallstreetbets,I agree. I’m glad my family talked me out of going to one. I still graduated from public in-state university with 65k in student loan debt…. But it’s better than 250k+.
2021-06-27 22:13:26,wallstreetbets,Atleast they can get all the crayons they want to eat.
2021-06-28 00:45:21,wallstreetbets,"I make a little over 6 figures, mid 30s. Graduated school later than most due to all the partying. I thought I was behind the curve until I talked to some friends and realized I’m doing better than most of them. I have 0 debt, 100k in retirement and a pretty damn good savings for a home. Even with all this a decent townhouse in my area will cost 500k min, hoping prices crash somewhat bc these fucking boomers won’t leave their homes making an impossible home shortage. Living at my parents like a total loser but at least I’ll be able to semi retire. I’m hoping I can make a few decent trades and make this a side gig. I’m more conservative with my investments but if we can send some of these to the moon I’d be set. Holding GME, Wish, CLNE, and Nvidia."

2021-06-28 11:58:52,wallstreetbets,The “upside” to that is they can go onto income based repayment and if it works properly (and it’s currently not) get student loan forgiveness in 10 years.

He makes plenty now but still spends it as fast as he can get it and is just paying the minimum on his loans.  Many doctors are not financially savvy, the few who are do really well the others are stressed much if the time.  The other doctor is who my wife is willing to go into business with as she is in top of her crap and is not worried about money at all."

2021-06-28 10:15:09,wallstreetbets,"That is usually a rural program in places that need doctors, if you practice there for a period they pay off some agreed upon amount of your loans.  Most doctors do not take the opportunity as smaller markets means less earnings over time."
2021-06-28 10:38:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you can do that even if it was community college (which already limits your career prospects). Their point now is that you should be smart enough to get a full scholarship, which is also stupid because if only the people who were able to get full scholarships went to college, we would have a pretty uneducated population and our economy as well would be much worse off. Germany has a large and well established apprenticeship system which is actually fantastic and can replace a lot of what colleges do in the US. It's not only manual labor either, you can be software developer or robotics engineer apprentice, get paid while learning very relevant skills and knowledge and get paid handsomely after graduating. It's also not looked down upon socially. I think the US should invest more into that and wipe student loans."

2021-06-28 01:18:35,wallstreetbets,Houses won’t go down because government has everyone on loan forbearance so no one is going to foreclosure.  That’s equivalent to a stock market that can’t be shorted.  Which means prices could only go up.  This administration is brain dead.

2021-06-28 14:19:10,wallstreetbets,it’s not “fucking boomers” not leaving their homes that’s creating a shortage. High material costs and covid slowed construction down. Plus job losses due to the country shutting down doesn’t give people disposable income to make large purchases. You do know if they sell their homes they will have to buy or rent another home….right? Trading one home for another…. So…. Still a shortage.
2021-06-28 10:25:11,wallstreetbets,prices wont crash. there is too much liquidity. if prices crash then it prob means rates are going up and your monthly mortgage payment gonna be much higher.

2021-06-28 09:22:52,wallstreetbets,That’s not true. You can take out a 800k loan in your businesses name and then have the company default on its loans through bankruptcy . You can even take out an 800k loan yourself for and have it forgiven through bankruptcy. You CANNOT have 800k in student loans forgiven through any means

Wait, your wife's doctor is bringing her in on a business deal?

You should run, because if he's making plays like this, this guy is going to encounter licensure issue because of professionalism long before any of his debts are paid back."
2021-06-28 00:52:40,wallstreetbets,Exactly you understand. Federal government only pays back interest portion on their loans to keep borrow amount in check and never the principal amount so they can borrow their way into eternity.

2021-06-28 08:06:26,wallstreetbets,Start up costs?  This was before he even started to practice and he joined a large group and practice that was already set up and ran by my wife.  All the costs were incurred going to school.
2021-06-28 10:52:59,wallstreetbets,Also Inner City hospitals.
2021-06-28 11:18:23,wallstreetbets,"In Canada, it’s the opposite. Specialists in rural areas make around 30% more than in cities since it’s tough to get the docs to go there. Was perfect for my pops as he hates cities and I liked growing up in a small town actually."

The fact that seemingly so many people aren't even aware of the most basic truths of current-day reality (that academia is liberal-leaning, that the media is liberal-leaning, etc.) makes me lose hope for the future of society.

People are offering insane amounts of money. 500k is for decent one that is about 20 years old too smh. The only upside is I held off for years on buying a new car (bc I thought I’d have a mortgage imminently) so I saved enough disposable income to buy a model 3. Ig I can live in the car for now 🤷🏽‍♂️

2021-06-28 16:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Oh there are many other reasons but yes that is a temporary one, probably highly temporary at this point, at which virtually all of those homes go into foreclosure. Government ownership of Freddy/Fannie, states need to lean on home owners property tax revenue, etc would be more permanent reasons."
2021-06-28 10:46:56,wallstreetbets,"Forbearance started last year under a different administration. On the other hand, at least this administration believes in science. I wonder what the condition of the stock market would look like today if there hadn't been a change in leadership and we were still dealing with $5k+ Covid deaths per day. 

And forbearance has almost zero to do with our housing supply and demand issues."
2021-06-28 08:38:34,wallstreetbets,"True or I could continue wasting my money on rent like I did for years. 6 figures doesn’t mean shit any more, the point I was making is hopefully the housing market crashes or prices stabilize to realistic levels. If you live in Idaho probably not such a big deal but if you live in a city or just outside a major city then it’s extremely expensive"
2021-06-28 10:42:23,wallstreetbets,"No, because six figures starts at $100,000/year. In pure theory, he could be making $100,000.01/year and that is technically making more/north of six figures. 

Or, he could also be making $999,999.99/year. 

Six figures is a wide range. The vast majority of people that make six figures income do so between $100k and $200k. I’d wager that 80% of six figure income earners are in this range. I’m thinking it probably follows a Pareto distribution, definitely some kind of right skewed Gamma distribution."
2021-06-28 14:24:57,wallstreetbets,This was occurring well before the materials shortage and yes a big factor is that older Americans aren’t selling their homes and moving because they are healthier and living longer than previous generations. Normally they would move into assisted living or downsize (or die) but they don’t need to as they did before. So before you call me a moron check the Google machine on the interweb.

2021-06-28 15:50:54,wallstreetbets,Lending institutions throw money at people going into high earning careers.  They know some of them will do stupid crap like this doctor and they will have him by the neck for years to come.  He could easily live in a normal house and drive cheap cars and pay down his debt within a relatively short time but he wants it all now.
2021-06-28 08:19:06,wallstreetbets,At the time I was doing pre-med.  The job was actually perfect for going to school.  I worked in a stauffers factory four days a week but I had a job where I could do 6-8 hours if my work in an hour and go to the lunch room to study for 4-5 hours a day.  I did not become a doctor though some life struggles got in the way that had nothing to do with the job.
2021-06-28 13:07:00,wallstreetbets,Ya it's like teachers getting money to buy houses near rough districts.

2021-06-28 01:14:15,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying, and it makes sense. But have you ever thought that the majority of the people in this country are ""liberal-leaning"" and that is why so many institutions are left centric?"
2021-06-28 00:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Well, most on Reddit live in an echo chamber.  The rest just soak up whatever the MSM tells them.  It’s a very different world from reality in either case."
2021-06-28 10:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Like most 18 year old who didn’t know what I was getting into really, no. I didn’t. Parents didn’t attend universities, didn’t have that knowledge readily available of how it all works. Asked questions when I could but it was confusing- and like many college kids I changed majors at a point. The question of what you want to spend 50 years doing when you’ve just left high school is more daunting for some than others."
2021-06-28 00:08:29,wallstreetbets,How many careers do you know that REQUIRE advanced degrees to work in the field that don’t pay well chief…
2021-06-27 23:58:41,wallstreetbets,"Well maybe if we lived in a welfare state education wouldn’t cost so much, and people wouldn’t be looking for, “bailouts”. What even are these bailouts you’re talking about? The most the people have ever been bailed out was during covid. When it’s over what the fuck do people even have to turn too? Food stamps?"
2021-06-28 11:45:44,wallstreetbets,"“Out of touch.” Kids like you are fucking retards lol. I’m in my kid 30s. Got a bachelors in nursing, then a masters in nursing to become an acute care nurse practitioner. Now getting a doctorate in nurse anesthesia to become a CRNA. I already made well over 6 figures, and will make even more when I’m done. 

I had consolidated and refinanced my original federal loans through a private company. To keep the interest low & payments easy. I’ll do the same with my new ones.

I’m also in a field I love and actually help people. Meanwhile losers like you think everyone who goes to college is a whiny zoomer spending a 100k on a liberal arts degree. Newsflash: there’s a lot of careers that require a lot of education, and society wouldn’t be functioning without them.

And nobody “has” to skip college because of the debt, that’s literally why there’s a student debt problem. Guaranteed loans to anyone. Go to college, just go for something that requires the education."
2021-06-28 00:10:13,wallstreetbets,"No retard. I don’t advocate for student loan forgiveness nor do I need it. But I’ll ask again, name me some careers that REQUIRE advanced degrees that don’t pay well."
2021-06-28 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,For certain people and degrees that’s a good option. For others like myself who are married with small children the cost to do that would be a wash. On top of that for my job to sit for boards the school has to be accredited by the accreditation council which only does schools in the US. Part of the racket
2021-06-27 23:39:24,wallstreetbets,At least they’re flavoured
2021-06-28 14:01:36,wallstreetbets,That is great to hear but also sucks we’ve built a priority system where donations can be a necessity and many go without

2021-06-28 12:25:52,wallstreetbets,Your down doesn’t drop by half if prices drop 20%.
2021-06-28 10:17:32,wallstreetbets,How does a bankruptcy not clear the debt? That doesn't sound right. What did your paperwork say?
2021-06-28 10:57:23,wallstreetbets,"Normally when an LLC doesn't pay its debts, creditors can only go after the companies assets. If you're looking for much larger loans, you can ""personally guarantee"" the debt, so then it would go into your name. Thats not always the case. Of course, if you're just starting out and want exactly $800k right away, yeah, they're gonna expect that. Even then, student loans are the ONLY kind of loans which cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy. You could still personally go bankrupt to deal with your debt if you personally guaranteed a loan"
2021-06-28 12:11:51,wallstreetbets,"again, even if you're co-signing, it is SIGNIFICANTLY better then student loans, because student loans are the only kind of loans that cant be forgiven in bankruptcy"
2021-06-28 08:14:28,wallstreetbets,"Lol she has puts on this guy as well, she is doing this with another doctor and this guy just gets to pay us rent which means my wife writes the check to herself."
2021-06-28 08:13:18,wallstreetbets,No she runs the department and all its finances and hiring doctors.  The buying of the building means instead if paying rent to someone else they will be paying rent to us and one of the doctors who is financially savvy.  It was a toss up between buying a residential rental or this and this will easily provide more stable income.  It will also all be placed under our LLC.
2021-06-28 02:21:02,wallstreetbets,Sounds like an affair.

2021-06-28 01:50:00,wallstreetbets,"The vast majority of the population did not arrive at their political views and cultural preferences through intensive, introspective critical thought. Most people arrive at where they are through osmosis and propaganda. The media and academic institutions are leftist indoctrination factories, churning out a neverending stream of leftist ideologues.

But yes, America is, and has been for many years, a liberal, progressive country, relative to other empires throughout human history. This includes the entire right half of the country. Even most Republicans are liberals, they're just not as far gone or fanatical as those on the Democratic left. Republicans today are basically the Democrats of the 90's and/or 2000's."

And while the D and R swing dicks at each other the country burns. Our Founders warned about the 2 party system for a reason. But who gives a fuck what I say when we don't even listen the mother fuckers who founded the dam thing."
2021-06-28 00:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Both of y'all can relax. I'm fully aware that higher education tends to be more liberal. I was just sharing my experience living in a conservative state where the most liberal you can get is a gun horny queer-hating ultra nationalist that *doesn't mind* that his cousin's son is friends with a black dude. 

~~And if you're wondering why colleges tend to be more ""liberal"" it's because reality is more left-leaning than Americans are raised to believe and the US generally leans to the right (probably thanks to being an imperialist nation). So since college is most people's first opportunity to expand their minds it's their first chance to be hit with a more left-leaning reality, and so college *seems* liberal by American standards.~~ Nevermind ignore my leftist rant. 

>Well, most on Reddit live in an echo chamber.

You realize you're on Reddit too right? And that most people in general live in an echo chamber. That's not limited to reddit or even the internet. Why would most of us *want* conflicting views and opinions in our lives? Also y'all started your own little mini echo chamber by taking **one** comment about conservative education and making assumptions about all people and then confirming those assumptions between the two of you. This is a meme subreddit for losing our life savings. Relax."

2021-06-28 10:39:38,wallstreetbets,"The easy answer is money begets money in the stock market. Look into r/thetagang to learn more about *selling* options rather than *buying*. 

Selling options is significantly less risky earning you more money over time because theta is on your side. 

The one caveat to doing this is that unless you have significant dough you won’t be making *obscene* amounts of money. Nonetheless, having an extra couple hundred dollars every week is better than blowing up your entire portfolio. 

*Disclaimer*

Selling options works until it doesn’t. Make sure you never, ever write naked calls (selling calls without the 100 shares), or naked puts (not having the cash to make the purchase, should the price of the stock fall below the strike price). Not doing so can put you in significant financial trouble with a margin call (as you are inherently using margin to write naked calls/puts). 

Sorry for the long write up but hope it helps!"
2021-06-28 17:27:41,wallstreetbets,"Choose good companies with a future (generally, but not always). Look for volatility. Pay attention to chatter. Buy the red ones on your watchlist and sell the green ones, even if only for a modest gain (don't try holding for the peak, if you've snagged a good 300, 400, 500 dollars or whatever, take it. If it keeps going up, so long sucker, don't worry about it, look for the next red one with potential to go green. Place multiple smaller bets and avoid YOLOs unless you have a very high degree of conviction. Be prepared to wait out and average down positions that have turned on you. DON'T PANIC. I panicked once, on MVIS, when I realised the DD I'd been sucked in on had no basis in reality and the company was a steaming pile of shit which made less in one quarter than I did as an individual. I regret that panic only very slightly because it taught me expensive but invaluable lessons.

This game depends more on psychology than anything else. Yes I started with quite a lot of money (390k) but I had to sell my house and my boat to get that capital, and I seem to have a high tolerance for seeing things going red and instead of panicking and selling, buying more.

KNOW THYSELF. This is absolutely crucial, in my view, and I have always been very aware of my shortcomings and limitations.

2021-06-28 15:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Ya we are doing great, I worked an office job for a while and discovered I absolutely hate working inside at a desk.  So I went and did stuff in the oilfields for a while and made a bunch of money and lived a pretty low budget life.  Now due to covid and my wife having some illnesses I work close to home just driving a cement mixer truck which pays well for my area.  Most places do not pay like it is here but I pull in around 90k a year and have plenty in retirement funds and have tons of equity in our home.  Also I do play with stocks with one of my smaller accounts and do some WSB fun stuff.  

Ya my family wanted me to be an engineer but growing up around them made me not want to spend time with engineers.  They were aerospace and they just thought about it all day at work and at home, I'm just not built that way.  Both my parents died while I was going to school and it kind of screwed me up for a while and I went off track.  Such is life.  Working full time had nothing to do with how school went but if you can get by without doing it you will obviously have an easier time.  

I hope you have a great time at school, going to school is one thing I want to do in retirement.  I did not care so much about the people but just learning new things which is why the oilfields were such a great place for me, endless opportunities for learning."
2021-06-28 01:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, yep, I have a PhD in engineering from UMich (one of the most liberal…but doesn’t take the cake).

College is good for “expanding your mind”, but profs are indeed pushing their own agendas and opinions, especially when it comes to liberal arts and social science areas, particularly since those are the most subjective. 

There’s also a disconnect between the college experience and what the real world is. Students are spending tens of thousands of dollars each year at a place that looks pristine, has what feels like free housing and dining (future you will pay for it…or parents), and you mostly goof off and go to some classes.  So of course socialism and similar concepts seem appealing as those most closely fit with that experience. Plus, Dems are more likely to pay off their student loans (minor ulterior motive potential).

People who mold their mind in the “real world” have a better feel for what is actually feasible (especially financially).  Some people leave college and encounter this awakening…others have had their mind fully formed and reject other viewpoints than their own.

In general, liberals are in more personal debt and liberal policies promote more federal debt (though, republicans have been shitty there recently too).

i bought into the hype (even after reading all the DDs) and just realized it's all smoke and mirrors and pretty much calling everything a conspiracy and shill. which sucks for me cause i bought in at an average cost of 225, so yea pretty fucked on that. i would say i had a ""high degree of conviction"" about GME, im gonna sell as soon as it hits 300+. the counter DDs ive seen are always unanswered and gme apes are contradictory as fuck. half the DDs there are about an impending financial crisis and getting a shit ton of ""holy shit"" responses and believing GME is the ultimate hedge against inflation. they've gone fucking crazy lmao

2021-06-28 01:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Maybe it's all what we take from it. College taught me (also engineering) to appreciate other people's viewpoints and some knowledge on how to determine what sources are reliable and which can be decided. Plus some engineering or something.

At the same time, the ""real world"" taught me that workers are inherently exploited in this country, the people in power are beholden to the corporate elite, and the rural poor have been taught to love struggling to survive and hate help. This is working in an engineering/management positions in very rural, very conservative, very poor areas in the deep south. Working radicalized me more than school ever did."

When you sell option you get the “premium.” 

Say you have 500 shares of Apple, and for the easiness of the example each option for Apple you sell is going for $1.00. 

Because you have 500 shares, you have the ability to sell 5 *covered*call contracts (as 1 option contract = 100 shares). 

When you sell the contracts you automatically get $100 for each contract written. If the option contract expires OTM, you keep $100/option plus the extra $100/option due to theta. 

With selling covered calls or CSP puts, you have a clearly defined income."

2021-06-28 18:07:30,wallstreetbets,"You are welcome. And let me tell you something, starting small is exactly what you should be doing. Even though I started with 390k (NZD), I initially invested $10 on a shitty platform which allowed fractional shares. I knew nothing so I wanted to get a feel for making a purchase and a sale, for making a gain and taking a loss. Within 2 months I'd cranked the whole lot into the market and watched it tank initially, so I had to get used to the idea of seeing our entire nest egg down 15 or 20 percent. It was fuckin scary.

Then one morning I woke up to discover I'd made 8k while sleeping. It soon turned into a few tens of K in gains, then a couple hundy. Then I got on the GME train early, read understood and believed the potential for big gainz, and rolled everything into it for an eventual 7 or 8 hundred K gain, including swing trades which produced up to 14k in seconds. It was fucking WILD.

Anyway, everyone starts poor. I was expelled from school and left before finishing, started with nothing (and still have most of it left). Just be patient, disciplined, keep your eyes open, remember not all information is valid and useful, and learn as much as you can about everything. Godspeed brother!"
2021-06-28 18:08:31,wallstreetbets,"PS don't worry about GME it is the gift that keeps giving. But don't wait for 300+, it may not come again. Wait for a modest gain and take it, then look for a re-entry. If it doesn't come, don't worry, there are other opportunities."

2021-06-28 01:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Ha, at least you admit you’re radicalized ;-)

And you’ve taken some good points from both.  The real world is a cold place where things are dog-eat-dog.  It always has been, and is part of what drives people to do their best.  Some think we’re at a point in societal development that we can soften the world so that we feel better about it.  In many respects we have considerably softened it already by providing social safety nets across a number of different social programs.  But there is a point where it will disincentivize people to make progress.  We have already seen that in some programs, and we need to do a better job of ensuring programs like welfare are not being exploited themselves.  In fact, I could argue that some of these programs have severely damaged the cultures of some communities irreparably.

It’s great to want good things for the people of the our country and to ensure people aren’t being abused; you seem to have a good feel for that.  My problem comes when it’s the federal government doing most of the “fixing” as it’s sooooo inefficient (in time and money)…and the fact the we need to encourage people to help themselves as much as they can."

2021-06-28 09:29:36,wallstreetbets,"I went into this article looking for one key phrase: “Section 230”. I found it within seconds. The government is trying to work their way around a clause in the Communications Decency Act that essentially says a website can’t be sued for something someone says on there. I highly recommend you all read about the EARN IT Act, sponsored by Lindsey Graham. The plan to repeal Section 230 dates back to March of 2020, right when we were all focused on Covid. This suit is not about sex trafficking. It’s about setting a legal precedent for what the government is getting ready to do: Establish a 15-person commission comprised of tech officials, law enforcement, and a few others to decide the “best practices” for online conduct. I would keep a close eye on this story. Watch how many times they mention Section 230/CDA. The EARN IT Act is a bait-and-switch to control what can be said online."
2021-06-28 09:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Looks like a non-decision, section 230 removes liability for websites for what their users post and makes them only liable for what they actually do.

2021-06-28 00:58:07,wallstreetbets,"It’s Texas Supreme Court but they are constrained by federal law which will now kick in.  

Should kind of ignore until federal courts court holds that way since the effects would be dramatic and it’s not clear how Facebook, short of not operating, could prevent misuse 100% of the time. 

I of course think FB sucks, but I don't think this particular ruling is that much risk to them. Under this logic as I understand it, AT&T would be liable for people doing the same using the phone system."

2021-06-28 07:40:55,wallstreetbets,"Not only a question of what it allows but there is stuff housed here on Reddit that flies way under the radar. There are for example subreddits named with random character strings that have no subs and no replies to posts but facilitate link sharing of very questionable content. You can stumble upon them by looking at new posts Reddit-wide for long enough but I imagine that sort of thing is hard to prevent. Doesn't make it any less (probably) illegal though.

Facebook would face similar challenges and unfortunately this type of ruling is the only thing that will motivate these giant platforms."

2021-06-28 14:11:46,wallstreetbets,Name three that are universally true and accurate
2021-06-28 14:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Archeology for example is a social science, as is anthropology.

Sociology is basically pre-gender studies"
2021-06-28 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,Physicists are just washed out math majors.
2021-06-28 14:35:31,wallstreetbets,"I went into academia specifically to study religions and their history. I had to learn hard facts, methodologies to correlate data etc. Sociology is mostly critical theory and poorly sourced studies. It was sociology for example, not psychology, that first started normalizing pedophilia (which was going on when I was in college in the late 90s) because at the core of sociology is the (marxist) theory that society is responsible for all human behavior. 

I just spoke with a former colleague (I got out academia years ago because it's all washouts and losers) and he's been having trouble teaching classes in Deviance because the head of the dept. wants an emphasis on the ""oppression"" of people as it relates to criminality. The data they use doesn't back up that theory. Plot twist - no one knows that because sociology is the one discipline where people don't read the studies. His dept. head read the headlines on some website about what the studies said but won't bother getting the studies to read.

Now you may not like that people study archeology and anthropology, or sit down and figure out what kind of people are buying Sante Mueurte statues (mostly non-worshippers) but the idea that those social sciences are also just a bunch of pink hairs sitting on their asses making stuff up because they're hacks (like sociologists) is wrong."
2021-06-28 14:16:07,wallstreetbets,"Archeology, anthropology, Comparative Religion. All rigorous data driven surveys of things in our world. Sociology produce theories like ""pOoR pEoPlE sTeAl BeCaUsE tHeY'Re HuNgRy"" even though the study they used to show that shows the largest group of people who steal are drug addicts - regardless of if those addicts are actually impoverished."

2021-06-28 15:40:19,wallstreetbets,Can the phone companies be held accountable for that stuff? The difference is online communication is public and moderated. So Facebook would have to stop moderating their customers content according to their own guidelines and only take down illegal content.

look up dr. john money, the father of gender identity theory... he was very pro pedophilia, and abused his patients, even forcing children to commit sexual acts on video, claiming his child porn was part of his studies.

or look up michel foucault, the father of queer theory... a literal pedophilia activist who admitted he would travel to third world countries to bang child prostitutes as young as 8 years old.  he regularly advocated for the age of consent to be reduced to infancy.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls - an underrated and often misunderstood trading strategy I recently commented on a post about GME that I sell covered calls (henceforth CCs) on meme stocks. The reception to the comment was poor – 35 downvotes and counting. Upon reviewing responses to my comment, I realized that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of CCs. I hope to clear some of those up and introduce in what may be a new strategy to those who read this.

**What does it mean to sell covered calls?**

To sell a covered call means to buy 100 shares of a stock and then sell a call option against the shares. When you sell the call, you collect a premium upfront. If the underlying stock is above the strike price on the expiry date, you will get assigned. Since you are “covered” and own 100 shares of the underlying, you can deliver your shares to the holder of the call to satisfy your obligation. If the stock is below the strike price on the expiry date, you get to keep the shares. In either situation, the premium is yours to keep.

This strategy is different than selling a naked call option (i.e., selling a call without owning the underlying). In that strategy, you lose $1 for every cent the stock is above the strike price at expiry. With CCs, you own 100 shares of the stock, so those 100 shares were also able to make $1 for every cent in price appreciation. In essence, with CCs you are selling the upside above the strike price to the long of the trade.

**Three strategies compared under four scenarios**

The best way to demonstrate why I believe this strategy is so valuable is to compare trading outcomes under four strategies – selling covered calls, owning 100 shares outright, and owning a call option.

For this example, I will use AMC shares which last traded at $54.23 and a 55 strike July 2 expiry call which last traded at $4.25. This example is for AMC, but this can be done with any stock if you substitute the applicable pricing.

If this is too much reading, I’ve summarized what I believe is the best trading strategy in each price band within the chart below.

[Trading strategies compared](https://preview.redd.it/8c622ynpkw771.png?width=2604&format=png&auto=webp&s=8793805dbc8f0b621940bc7dc42bf1cb4d1b3640)

*Scenario 1 – AMC goes down (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning a call)*

* Selling covered calls: The shares will lose money; however, because you collected a premium, you are still ahead if AMC finishes above $49.98 ($54.23-$4.25). Even if AMC finishes below $49.98, you can “roll” your option to a different expiry and collect more premium.
* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will lose money.
* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425. I am giving this one a tie because if the stock tanks, the call has a 100% loss but in dollar terms the loss is limited. So in a sense the winner depends on how much the stock falls and if you believe the stock will recover in the future.

*Scenario 2 – AMC stays at $54.23 (Winner: selling covered calls)*

* Selling covered calls: The shares neither make nor lose money; however, you profit the premium received of $425. Since $54.23 is below the strike of $55, you can roll the option to a different expiry and collect more premium.
* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares neither make nor lose money.
* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425.

*Scenario 3 – AMC finishes in the range of $55-$59.25 (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning 100 shares outright)*

* Selling covered calls: The shares participate in the upside up until $55. This would mean a $77 profit on the shares (\[$55-$54.23\] x 100). You would also keep the premium of $425 which brings the total profit to $502. You would lose the shares as the stock finished above $55.
* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. So, if AMC finishes at $59.25, the profit would be $502 (\[$59.25-$54.23\] x 100).
* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.25, you would breakeven (\[$59.25-$55-$4.25\] x 100).

*Scenario 4 – AMC finishes above $59.68 (Winner: owning a call)*

* Selling covered calls: Same as scenario 3. The profit is $502 and you lose your shares.
* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $545.
* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $42.69 (\[$59.68-$55-$4.25\] x 100). As a percentage of the original investment, this strategy has a higher ROI than owning 100 shares outright for stock prices above $59.68.

There are a few gaps in these scenarios, but the point should be clear by now. Selling covered calls is profitable in scenarios 2-4 and in scenario 1 if the stock is above $49.98. Owning 100 shares is profitable in scenarios 3 and 4 while owning a call was profitable in only scenario 4.

This is why I love selling covered calls – it is profitable in more market conditions than the other trading strategies. It will outperform other strategies unless the underlying stock makes a large move to the upside.

**Misconceptions**

I came across a few misconceptions in responses to my comment. Here are a few of them.

*You can’t make money on CCs if the stock goes up.* – Absolutely you would. If the stock goes up, you get to keep the premium. Only in selling a naked call would you not make money in this situation.

*You shouldn’t sell CCs on a high IV stock.* – Assuming you're bullish on the stock, high IV stocks are the best to target as you can collect more premium. This point is only correct if you anticipate a large downward move in the stock that would lose more than the premium received.

*You should sell puts instead of CCs if you’re bullish on the stock.* – There’s some nuance to this, but this point is mostly incorrect. Due to something called put-call parity, selling a put is conceptually similar to selling a covered call. Both will benefit from the same price movements.

**Downsides:**

There are a few downsides to CCs which you should consider before trading.

*Funds required* – Selling covered calls requires owning 100 shares of the stock. This is capital intensive. Consider buying 100 shares of GME which would cost $20,800. Buying a GME July 2 expiry call with 0.71 delta (meaning you get price appreciation that replicates owning 71 shares) only costs about $2,443.

*Stock tanks and never recovers* – If the stock tanks and never recovers, you won’t be able to recoup your losses; however, even if this happens, your outcome is better than the other strategies from before since you got to keep the premium.

*The upside is limited* – Your upside is capped at the strike price. If there’s a strong movement upwards, the other strategies are better; however, there may be situations where you call “roll” your option up in strike and out in expiry. This may allow you to keep stock.

Conclusion: Selling covered calls are an underrated trading strategy that is often misunderstood. It is profitable in a wide range of trading environments. Sure it may not be as ""sexy"" as buying FDs and it won't get you rich overnight, but it can possibly provide strong and consistent returns over time."

2021-06-27 22:13:31,wallstreetbets,"Covered calls are the single family home rentals of the stock market.

It's requires a lot of capital, is labor intensive, and your returns are limited. But if done right it provides steady cash flow with limited risk."
2021-06-27 21:56:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm a big covered calls guy myself. I view it as picking a price that I would want to sell my shares at to collect profits, then selling calls at that price. That way if I get exercised, I'm essentially getting paid to sell my shares at the price I would have sold them anyway, and if it doesn't get that high I get paid to keep my shares. Obviously this only works if the share price doesn't drop too much, but as long as you're not selling calls at strikes below your cost basis you're basically ensuring profit"
2021-06-27 21:48:13,wallstreetbets,"I wish publishing this would stop people from downvoting you, but I feel your target audience is not the people reading this. However, I believe it’s good for all of us to go over the basics again once in awhile, thanks a lot for doing this and trying your best to increase the overall discourse on the sub.

Positions: made 500% on GME, wish I’d held onto those shares and sold covered calls"
2021-06-27 21:01:34,wallstreetbets,Very well put and easy to understand.  I’m not sure why people care if you do or don’t. To each there own
2021-06-27 21:14:22,wallstreetbets,Careful with the dividend stocks doing this.  Or at least be mindful of the Ex-Date.
2021-06-27 21:15:57,wallstreetbets,"Great post, I do this all time. It only hurts when you miss out on big run ups. I like your strategy of rolling the call forward, I am going to try this."
2021-06-27 21:31:56,wallstreetbets,"I consistently sell bi-weekly buy writes on multiple equities. I take away about $1000 in cash each 2-week cycle. Not enough to replace my day job, but it's consistent and I'm happy with it. 

Good luck."
2021-06-27 21:36:54,wallstreetbets,I currently make a decent living selling OTM CCs on my TLRY shares.
2021-06-27 21:52:36,wallstreetbets,I’ve been rolling $210 CCs of GME for the past couple weeks and keep netting roughly $1500 doing basically exactly as you described. Whoever says you don’t make money on CCs has either never taken any options course or watched any YouTube videos on it

2021-06-27 21:59:35,wallstreetbets,But I think most ppl just hate they bought your call. Not because they don’t understand what’s cc

Well, they are retarded."
2021-06-28 00:10:49,wallstreetbets,"If you like the stock, and you're long on it, and you already own 100 shares, you'd be a fool not write CCs at a strike where you would sell anyways. Either it sells for the price you wanted PLUS the premium, or you still have your shares and the premium and can collect another premium. Downside to this strategy is low premiums, if you're greedy on strike."
2021-06-27 21:34:13,wallstreetbets,"It basically just limits your upside a little, and it's free money when they expire. Considering how high the premium is on popular stocks even far OTM, it makes a lot of sense."
2021-06-27 21:13:08,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely beautiful! 💯% agreed and giving you hugs
2021-06-27 21:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Great post and great strategy. I think you’re right-  a lot of people don’t understand it. They focus on limiting the upside if your shares get called away. In reality, if you have a stock moving in a trading range and you keep your expiration dates short, you can make a lot of extra money this way. Short dated expirations give you flexibility to move your strike price up and down and still keep your shares. There seem to be enough people willing to YOLO on weeklies that this could be extremely profitable with meme stocks."

2021-06-27 21:02:34,wallstreetbets,"People don’t do covered calls because they are poor, you know this right?"
2021-06-27 22:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Well I was there and supported your downvoted comment. Of course there are folks that don't understand options, and I'd say CC's are the easiest type to explain. However, your comment was downvoted due to you selling CCs on AMC and GME, which have cult followings well known for brigading in both investing and non-investing subs. Your comment wasn't seen as bullish enough and got destroyed by the weirdos. Good post explaining CCs though."
2021-06-27 23:42:52,wallstreetbets,"One thing that's worth more attention:

Selling CCs on high IV stocks can be very profitable, but everyone needs to keep in mind that a high IV means the stock could tank hard. You'll say that it's still better than the scenario where you hold 'just' shares. However, if you own just shares you can just dump them as soon as you believe the stock is going to tank. 

If you have a CC and you sell the shares then you suddenly have a naked call, and this could have margin implications, especially in meme stocks where they can tank one day (and you decide to sell the shares) and then rally the next, and that's the worst (and very real) possible combo that can wipe you out fast. 

Selling CCs on meme stocks is very dangerous simply because they will (at some point) tank hard and you'll be holding bags forever, and no amount of premium will help.

Other plays are credit call spreads, where you sell a call at strike price X and you buy one at price X+Y. Profit is limited but so is the downside. If you get the price direction right it works nicely, and even if you get it wrong you won't lose much (or you'll lose far less than holding shares at the same time)."
2021-06-28 00:06:02,wallstreetbets,"i love selling ccs on meme stocks. buy 1-300 of them on monday sell ccs on wednesday exit position on friday.

relatively low risk compared to crazy meme stock pump and dumps and easy to profit ~10-20% a month with minimal downside.


also if stock tanks you still earn premiums which over a long period of time is no joke. 
when i bought pltr, selling weekly ccs offset the loss of stock value easily, and continued selling em on the way up."
2021-06-27 21:58:43,wallstreetbets,"People probably downvoted bc they don’t understand how options work and therefore are upset because you sell them calls at a strike 100%+ the current stock price week after week, while never getting to post gain porn. 

The GME culture on Reddit has become exemplary of why democracies may not function in our current media environment. People should not be allowed to vote until the display a certain amount of understanding and literacy about the issues at steak. Thank you for understanding."
2021-06-27 22:23:28,wallstreetbets,This is too smart and makes too much sense. Fuck you.
2021-06-27 23:05:46,wallstreetbets,"I’ve sold covered calls for about a year straight and here’s what I learned. Don’t sell covered calls on stocks that are insanely volatile. Sure there’s money to be made, but would you want to buy AMC at 55 a share, sell your measly covered call, collect a small premium only to have to stock tank to 25 bucks? 

It’s not feasible to sell covered calls so close to the strike price. I would sell covered calls on Delta airlines for an entire year (weeklies) and got exercised 3 times doing a 5 delta or 95% out of the money. 

The catch is, hoping the stock doesn’t completely smash through your covered call strike price. In my case, I’m bullish on Delta at the time. If I sold a 50 covered call for the week and the stock was at 45. If delta goes to 55 I would have missed thousands in potential gains. Selling covered calls would have made me a small amount of money along the way, but one smash through your strike and you would have been better off just never selling covered calls and holding the stock by itself. 

I don’t like seeing my portfolio go up and down insane percentages in a day. With delta, usually it was anywhere from flat to +/- a couple percent day gains and losses. There’s no worse feeling than selling a covered call for the week only to see your portfolio go down by 10% or more. I wouldn’t only do it in companies that aren’t crazy volatile and or have that slow steady growth. I made 14% selling covered calls, plus deltas stock appreciation for the year. This won’t be an every year circumstance I could duplicate unfortunately. 

My take away is there is an allure in selling covered calls. I wouldn’t do it on meme stocks unless you could care less. I’ve done it once time on GameStop and I bought 100k worth of shares and sold a next day covered call for 2k. Bought it back for 250 and the shares appreciated 7% super risky cuz GME had a 25%+ down down the day before. 

Sucks that there’s no money to be made in selling covered calls in the SPY cuz I would do that and just forget about trying to invest in anything"
2021-06-27 23:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Not sure who WOULDN'T sell CC on GME or AMC right now except the most fervent true believers who think the stocks are going to hit $10,000.

The premium is insane, so even selling OTM weeklies to degenerate gamblers will make you some nice income.

It's a great way to lower your cost-basis."
2021-06-27 21:40:25,wallstreetbets,When the apes evolve and become their own casino pit bosses lol. The IV premiums are so fat and juicy on the meme stocks so I always sell way OTM weeklies. 😈
2021-06-27 21:09:43,wallstreetbets,Thank you for taking the time to walk through this.
2021-06-27 21:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Don’t know if it’s mentioned here but the call premium is not directly proportional to the movement in the underlying stock price. In layman’s terms, by owning the 100 shares, you could be taking a big hit that would make the actual premium collected (especially on a low IV stock) peanuts if the share price drops substantially."

2021-06-27 23:00:20,wallstreetbets,Excellent!
2021-06-27 23:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I think CC's are a nice tool to have in the kit. Especially if you're lukewarm on a stock and looking to get out anyway.

I personally think AMC is a pretty reckless stock to do this with. It could easily go up 100% and you lose your position on the cheap. It could just as easily drop 80% and now you're bag holding. 

It all depends on your thesis."

2021-06-28 00:22:35,wallstreetbets,"been playing around with this to some success. the possibility of the underlying stock tanking is very real. however, you gradually ""improve"" your cost basis through the money you make selling calls."

2021-06-28 02:55:38,wallstreetbets,"I am currently selling CCs against BB. I use it as a drip dividend strategy in a way and have used it to build my position, I literally built my own weekly dividend. Bought shares and immediately sold calls against them, they expired worthless and bought my shares to sell calls against. They continue to expire worthless and I buy more and more shares. I set a stop loss for the calls if they skyrocket based on the share value, then I try to sell calls with much higher premiums now that the volatility and shares are taking off. My first 100 shares of BB I bought for $8 and have since got those shares for free really considering how many call options I have sold. The week BB hit 16, 20 dollar calls were going for 3.5 dollars a share. Selling CCs is great if you know what you are doing, you should have a plan for when they expire OTM or ITM. 

I’m here for BB long term, weekly though I don’t mind the volatility, I embrace it."
2021-06-28 03:14:14,wallstreetbets,"Note that you want to buy stocks you like so if it goes down you can lower your cost basis. As long as your CC is above your cost basis you are in good shape. Even if a stock gets assigned you still lock in some profit and can go for other plays. High IV stocks are terrific to sell covered calls on, lots of the memes fit that bill. Don't try chasing premium to protect your shares IMHO also known as don't fear the reaper. If you are getting assigned accept it."
2021-06-28 05:35:27,wallstreetbets,"I just tried doing this for the first time last week, and damn I didn’t expect them to exercise every single   call I sold lol but I’m pretty sure I broke even at least lol"
2021-06-28 06:50:36,wallstreetbets,"This is a pretty good write up, thanks."
2021-06-28 07:00:43,wallstreetbets,"As someone who sold his first covered calls against gme this past week (250 strike 07/02 expiry, 4 contracts with 14.70 premium each) I plan on continually doing this to be paid to hold the meme, and therefore never give a fuck what the stock does.  If I do the above trade every two weeks that’s 152k (without getting taken out)

Just saying"
2021-06-28 09:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Here’s my personal example of why I sell CC. All numbers are approximates

I bought BB at an avg of 14.50 with 10k shares. Price drops to 12. Big loss.  Decides to make CC. Have 100 contracts with a total of about $1500 for premium and strike price set for 15.  So whatever happens I get to keep that $1500. If shares goes down, nothing. If shares go up but less than 15, I still keep my shares. If shares hit 15, I sell my shares with a .50 profit since my avg is 14.50 to begin with. So that’ll be $1500 + $5k = $6500 total profit. 

I just started doing CC literally today so did I miss anything?"

2021-06-28 13:10:02,wallstreetbets,"Seems like another get rich when you are already rich scheme.

Just looked at my account. I can sell covered calls and make like $2-4 this week. Oooo weee. 

Maybe if I had 10× the funds and 10× the amount of shares. CC would be great.... ."
2021-06-28 14:09:56,wallstreetbets,The upside is limited hurts me too much. About half of the time( which isn't a lot) I just see my stock shoots up one day out of blue and I can't make any money cuz I sold my calls for like a few dollar. I either then have to roll it out or sell my shares. Which I don't want to lose my shares. I guess it's super good strategy if you don't mind losing the shares.
2021-06-28 14:10:30,wallstreetbets,I was considering doing this for BB but it just doesn’t seem that profitable since premiums aren’t that high for less risky calls.
2021-06-27 20:56:49,wallstreetbets,But what happens when it goes to 100k a share.  all them gains lost /s
2021-06-28 00:43:26,wallstreetbets,"You're missing one simple fact. When you sell a call, you're probably selling it to retail. That's one less call a market maker will hedge, which undercuts gamma pumps. Worse, if you sell your call to the market maker, they're going to take the opposite position and short shares/negate delta, again undercutting the pump.   


The cultists are right to hate you. You're right to try and make money off the IV. Don't give into popularity contests, but also understand exactly why they hate you."

lol"
2021-06-27 21:05:05,wallstreetbets,"It’s a stupid move. Selling covered calls on AMC for this Friday with a $145 strike (a relatively safe price) make you like $25 dollars. It’s it worth the $25 premium in the event it moons? The IV already has to be through the roof to make money, the exact time it’s likely to moon. Maybe if you have tens of thousands of shares, selling covered calls on like 1000 might be worth it, but you’ll lose huge on potential gains on  AMC and GME if you pick the wrong week."
2021-06-27 20:46:06,wallstreetbets,Ban.
2021-06-27 21:32:52,wallstreetbets,"So, this is best for stocks that you believe in their current valuation enough to want to own outright, but you believe they will not go up in value.

Why would this strategy NOT work out? When you end up eating the downside on a big drop, but never get the upside from the spikes. Your premiums need to be enough to cover that."
2021-06-27 21:40:34,wallstreetbets,New to options here. Can you explain how the delta works when selling calls? Is it something you set in the contract? How do the other deltas works?
2021-06-27 21:56:14,wallstreetbets,"It's a great strategy with stocks that are easier to predict, with meme stocks covered calls are highly risky imo.   There's no telling what these stocks are really capable of."
2021-06-27 22:20:30,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing how through put call parity selling puts and covered calls are similar; however, someone correct me if I’m wrong but it’s only equal if there is equal likelihood of the price going up or down.

But often times there’s upcoming news that tends to shift sentiment towards one direction or the other. So they’re not exactly the same and practically can have vastly different outcomes."
2021-06-27 22:26:32,wallstreetbets,"This is essentially my BB strategy, where I started out with a $19/share cost basis(sitting a little below $15/share now). Selling CCs on XXXX shares 1-3 weeks out, keeping XXX shares on the sideline in case if it does moon, and keep my strike prices above my cost basis. I keep the premiums & ensure that I profit even if my shares get called away."
2021-06-27 23:14:41,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely the way. I do a bit of a different strategy where I buy a deep ITM call with a far out expiration then I sell calls against the call I bought and collect the premium once I’ve collected enough premium to exercise my call option I do, and continue selling covered calls. Only downside like you mentioned is you cap your gains so if it was to have a huge run up you’d miss out on some huge gains"
2021-06-27 23:29:10,wallstreetbets,You really want to quit working? this is the way.
2021-06-27 23:35:54,wallstreetbets,I also thought that selling puts would be a better play for meme stocks you’re bullish on specifically because if you get assigned you buy shares vs with cc’s you’re selling once assigned. i know it’d be practically unnoticeable but selling pressure is selling pressure.
2021-06-27 23:36:28,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never been on the opposite side of buying calls and always wondered how exactly it works for the guy writing the contracts. 

What I still don’t understand is what happens to the guy writing the contract when I sell to close my contract for a gain before expiration even though it hasn’t hit the strike price and what happens when I sell to close a contract when I’m losing money and cut my loss before it expires worthless ? Who’s paying my gain even though the strike wasn’t reached and who’s getting my losses on the premium that isn’t at 0 yet? Anyone ?"
2021-06-27 23:48:09,wallstreetbets,Want to hear something neat about covered calls? I sold some on SPCE a day before it went up 42%. Then had to buy close the option for 1300 dollars just so I can hold my shares.
2021-06-27 23:52:55,wallstreetbets,wrong sub retard
2021-06-28 00:09:21,wallstreetbets,"As far as ""rolling"" does that mean buying your call back to close and selling a higher strike call?"
2021-06-28 00:16:22,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls is a great strategy IMO - I plan on doing that when I'm actually properly investing. I'd most definitely sell covered calls for relatively stable stocks to collect that extra bit of premium as a supplement. 


But the thing about GME though, is that it's a generally considered a speculative bet with a potentially very high upswing. I personally wouldn't limit my potential gains from GME by selling covered calls on it UNLESS I have enough shares on hand to already make a tidy sum of money e.g. I have 5k shares - selling covered calls for maybe 2k of those shares during the run up, pocket the premiums for income and if it moons I'd at least keep the full winnings of 3k shares. I most certainly would not recommend selling covered calls if the person only has, let's say 100-200 shares as that drastically caps the upside potential (and the entire reason for investing into GME as opposed to a more stable stock)."
2021-06-28 00:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Own 1,000+ shares? Sell call options for a quick hefty upfront premium so you can turn around and reinvest the premium to make more tendies on said stock. Rinse, repeat."
2021-06-28 00:39:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah but then you have to get a margin account to do so. If you do that your broker can let hedge funds borrow your stock at their discretion. That'll make the game a little bit longer.
2021-06-28 01:00:59,wallstreetbets,I really appreciate your in depth post but I’m not gonna lie I’m still lost as fuck on how to profit off covered calls!
2021-06-28 01:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Also you forget to add that with CCs, when they expire in the money the stock will trade at the strike price. Which guarantees but limits your profit. 
I think people think that the premium is all you get with the CC, which is true when you sell the option. But at execution you still get strike price * 100."
2021-06-28 01:14:33,wallstreetbets,"When did this place turn into thetagang?

But in all seriousness,  selling otm CCs are fine if you are neutral on a non-meme stock.

But this is WSB where 10%gains are laughed at and where 1000% gets you all the internet awards and accolades you can dream of."
2021-06-28 01:17:30,wallstreetbets,"I think in the case of meme stocks “the stock tanks and never recovers” is more likely.  So there is a risk to buying 100 shares.  However if you want to yolo meme stocks, who cares

I will also give another scenario.  I had 600 shares of GME and decided to sell a covered call at 80.  Thank god I only sold one.  The stock rockets up and you’re locked in.  The stock then proceeds to come back and you couldn’t sell your shares and your call isn’t exercised.  Yeah you got some premium, but you missed the big spike completely."
2021-06-28 01:24:08,wallstreetbets,"You’re downvoted because this is WSB. If you want to sell CC, go to r/thetagang"
2021-06-28 01:50:13,wallstreetbets,I sold $12 cc’s on GME. That shit went to 400. No more covered calls for me.
2021-06-28 01:57:07,wallstreetbets,Ah yes reminds me of the time I sold $3.5c on AMC while my cb was $2 and you apes pumped it to $20 in Jan
2021-06-28 03:52:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m a big fan of covered calls and have made some nice gains on it. However it’s not going to get you 10X and it’s capital intensive. I feel it’s the best strategy once you have big money. 

My retirement plan is to get a large enough portfolio (~$1M) and just thetagang for income. 
You get to work from anywhere in the world and only takes 1 hour a day to manage your account."
2021-06-28 04:28:18,wallstreetbets,Hence my AMC shares are negative average costs...
2021-06-28 05:34:13,wallstreetbets,Commenting just to say great post.
2021-06-28 05:54:52,wallstreetbets,"Nice write up. I have family that makes a small, but regular income stream selling covered calls. I haven’t understood properly how until now :D"
2021-06-28 06:05:13,wallstreetbets,"great post. I spent some of my january gains from GME to buy another 100 shares in my roth ira during the feb/march runup. 23,600 cost basis, but i've made almost 9000 buck back by selling CC's.  it really is an underrated strategy.  


 should make a point to mention the math- you'll always want to double check your strike price + premium is at least your cost basis, or have a firm belief and reason why you doubt the call will be assigned. i've definitely sold calls below my cost basis (most recently on the tail end of the june announcement), which is risky but highly profitable if done with said math and conviction in mind...oh, and definitely make sure to roll them when you're hitting 50ish percent of profit, unless there was a major downturn and you're not going to be able to get the premium+strike to protect the original investment"
2021-06-28 06:12:48,wallstreetbets,"LEGIT QUESTION:

Can I sell naked calls (100 shares of stock ""A"") at first, then buy back 100 shares of stock ""A"" before the expiry date to make it back into Covered Calls? Based on the assumption that it's OTM at that point of time but i felt bullish that the call might go ITM. Not sure if it makes sense but is kinda like insurance."
2021-06-28 06:42:31,wallstreetbets,I could never downvote someone who spent this much time writing about something I still dont understands
2021-06-28 06:46:56,wallstreetbets,Deep 1 year ITM >.90 delta calls are far superior than picking up 100 shares. 3 of these with Qualcomm generates about 800 per month in premium with $20k invested.
2021-06-28 06:50:44,wallstreetbets,"I implemented a CC adjacent-to-the money strategy on all my trades July of last year. My returns have been EXCELLENT. I started it in part Bc I realized I never get out of my positions until it’s too late/off their peaks, and it gave me a very detached opinion of the underlying position. My version of the play is I WANT MY POSITIONS TO BE EXERCISED. Do I get ALL the benefits if a position rockets? No. But that’s not the strategy - I get SOME. If my positions aren’t getting exercised, at least then I get ALL of the premium. 

Since March, I’ve “trimmed the sails” Bc the market has shifted. Puts and already in the money calls (for higher premium). 

I had a return on 17.5% over the course of the year for a six figure realized gain."
2021-06-28 07:31:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m interested in selling CCs, dont have the shares yet and selling poor mans ccs is still a little vague for me. However, I’m Dutch, I have my stocks portfolio on my DEGIRO acc. And have just made myself an IBKR acc. I dont have any stocks on this IBKR acc, so would I have to buy these here first to be able to sell those CCs? 

Because if my CC gets exercised how would I else be able to sell them the shares?


Asking for myself! Not afraid."
2021-06-28 07:42:10,wallstreetbets,Covered calls on a meme stock doesn’t seem like a good idea. You miss out on wild upswings and you might get caught holding huge bags of a shit stock like AMC till the end of time. Pass.
2021-06-28 07:47:59,wallstreetbets,Tbh I'd say the strat is overrated more than underrated on here.  People constantly act like its pretty much free money.  The only time it works REALLY good is when you get in on a meme/high IV stock super early.  Then you have the benefit of selling high premium calls without the risk of being gaped when the stock craters back down.  Otherwise for it to be an effective strategy you need an account size bigger than 90% of people here have.  People here are buying FD's because they're playing with pennies and hope to strike it rich.  Not cause they already have 100k+ in their account.
2021-06-28 08:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Ditto. I was bullish on $NOK... bought $NOK at $4.17 , sold $7 CCs expiring July and pocketed around $1300 premium. If NOK reaches $7 ... then my profit from the stock assignment would be around $28000."
2021-06-28 08:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Well written article, OP.

I've been watching EV stocks for a while, and tried the strategy of selling Puts in order to try and catch the bottom with a small premium in my pocket to boot.  It worked to a degree, resulting in ownership of the security at a price point that I was comfortable with, but each time I've used it I noted that I could have gotten a better price point by simply watching the security closely.  Selling Puts is either a lazy man's, or a busy man's scheme ... useful when you either don't want to take the time, or don't have the time to watch a stock closely.

I've sold CCs on those holdings a few times, but never had the price target hit.  Pocketing the premiums there is nice, as long as you won't be too upset if the options are exercised.  If you're very bullish, and want to be a long term investor, this may not be for you."
2021-06-28 08:45:24,wallstreetbets,My advice is watch the stock carefully if there is any chance of volitivity and you want to  keep the stock. I began sell CC's on my GME stock beginning in March. I was up a little over $16k  when GME shot up in May. It cost me about $20k to roll up so I wouldn't lose the stock. I am now back in the green on GME CC's but I push my strike prices further OTM so I don't get stung again.
2021-06-28 08:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the detail post, OP.

In any event, do you ever consider buying back the CC?

I'm long on GME, sold 3 CC Jan 2021 $500C for $115 premium 2 weeks ago when GME was in the 300ish range.

Now that GME has dropped to 200ish, I could buy back for the $60.

I still have many GME so thinking of riding it out."
2021-06-28 09:05:36,wallstreetbets,Scenario 1 selling the call is definitely the winner here. The other option is 100% loss on your position. How is still holding the shares with the ability to sell more calls equal to losing 100% of your money on a call position?
2021-06-28 09:42:58,wallstreetbets,It's unfortunate that some people downvote actual useful tips and strategies for making money in this casino.  I hope that eventually things calm down and people like me can actually benefit from the knowledge available from you og's.
2021-06-28 10:00:13,wallstreetbets,"So I have 100 shares of $GPRO shares, if I want to sell covered calls which selection do I choose in TD Ameritrade?

There is Buy to Open, Buy to Close, Sell to Open, Sell to Close.

Which one?"
2021-06-28 10:07:04,wallstreetbets,"So wait, when you get assigned they just take your shares away? I thought the option owner just had the right to buy the shares at strike price…so wouldn’t they be buying those shares from you? Would you make back that capital on the shares? Or are you out the money you spent buying the shares and left only with premium cash?"
2021-06-28 11:08:54,wallstreetbets,"So why does fidelity track it like you're losing thousands of dollars when the stock goes above the mark? I had 100 shares of moderna and made a tidy profit because it went up 40%, but damn did it go way above where I thought it would, like 300%. I couldn't look at my fidelity account though. It would make me sick because it summarized it like I was going to have to buy 100 shares at market. 
 I thought for sure I fucked up somehow but the call came and the shares were deducted from the account and the crazy potential losses went away. This experience soured me on CC."
2021-06-28 11:13:57,wallstreetbets,Nice to see CCs getting some love. They also carry tax implications for short term and long term gains depending on if the CC is qualified or unqualified. Might be worth adding that to your main post to give people a heads up.
2021-06-28 11:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I have been doing the same .. but I have also implemented a wheel strategy too. 

I have 145 shares of GME with an average negative cost of 0.57$ ( I have made 0.57$ per share).

2021-06-28 12:39:36,wallstreetbets,Most of my income comes from selling covered calls and selling puts. If you do it with the right stocks you can make fantastic returns with limited downside. I do a lot of debit spreads as well.
2021-06-28 13:25:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes its also a lot easier to make money when volatility is over 100% selling CCs, especially if you wait for spikes. The price and vol downside opens up so much more opportunity to consistent cash flow. With long options trying to trade in the 100+ volatility climate means you have to be much more accurate with your entry and exit. Its all about fitting the strategy to the stock at its current point in time and managing it as it changes. Glad to see someone discussing the theta gang again"

2021-06-28 14:54:08,wallstreetbets,"U/Nav2055 if you are selling covered calls your cost basis needs to be really far below where the stock is currently trading. I don’t think anyone is willing to pay up for wildly out of the money (OTM) Calls once the daily/weekly trading range is established. 

Btw...Hedge Funds can buy these calls too and control your position. Let’s say you’re in a position hoping for a squeeze, you’ve just given Heggies an easy way out to cover PLUS YOU lose your rocket to the moon."
2021-06-28 18:16:46,wallstreetbets,"With covered calls you ARE the casino.

It’s an income strategy."
2021-06-27 22:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Nice analogy haha.

I didn’t want to make the post longer than need be, but there’s a strategy called “poor man’s covered calls” which allows you to do this basic strategy with less capital. Basically instead of buying 100 shares of the underlying, you buy a LEAPS with around 0.7 delta."
2021-06-28 11:25:06,wallstreetbets,How does it compare to just owning a dividend aristocrat though?
2021-06-28 08:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I've made good money selling weekly CCs on BB, GME, and similar stocks when the IV shot to something ridiculous like 400%+

Here's one of my personal favorites: https://imgur.com/LPuJvNZ

2 days from expiration, the IV was something insane like 900% (even if the calls got exercised my cost average is $10 so I would have doubled my money *plus* the premium*).  TBH I should be selling more CCs but I'm holding shares in like 30 stocks and I'm too lazy to track it all."
2021-06-27 22:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Ditto.  I'm not trying to play chicken versus my cost basis over a little more premium.  I sell those shits way OTM, and in the event that I get exercised, I still get paid."

2021-06-28 00:39:06,wallstreetbets,Because GME people think the only two valid market actions are buying shares of companies that you like and then selling those shares when you don’t like the company anymore. They don’t understand how to make money. The tiny number of them with realized gains bough calls and got scolded by the rest.
2021-06-28 00:44:16,wallstreetbets,You don't understand because you don't understand what the collective effect of retail call buying does to drive these stocks.

2021-06-27 21:57:50,wallstreetbets,"This happened to me on PLUG last year right before the pandemic started. Made me a 3 bagger, but it could have been a 10 bagger. Still, profit is profit and these paper hands would have probably sold well before the 10 bagger point."
2021-06-27 21:24:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s the big negative of the strategy. I did covered calls on AMC right before the run up. The premium was nice but I would’ve been better off without selling the calls against the shares.

And yeah, give the rolling idea a try. Look up “InTheMoney” on YouTube and look at his covered calls and wheel videos. He walks through the concept well."
2021-06-27 22:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I wrote July 2 SPCE 50's on 6/22 when the underlying was at 37 or so. 30% room to grow in 10 days, what could possibly go wrong?

2021-06-28 11:31:07,wallstreetbets,Can you give some examples of plays you run? Every time I write a CC even very OTM it ends up getting called away. Might be doing it on stuff that isn't appropriate or I just get unlucky. (I wrote a 95C on NET when it was below 90 for example and got dumpstered)
2021-06-28 14:51:43,wallstreetbets,Oh what holding size of portfolio?
2021-06-28 17:39:33,wallstreetbets,What strike price?
2021-06-27 22:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Nice work.

With the comment I mentioned, people were specifically saying it’s impossible to make money on selling covered calls on AMC and GME… like wtf no it’s not lol."
2021-06-28 04:10:20,wallstreetbets,"Same here but on the 220 strike. 

Just don't expect these kind of gains on normal stocks and that these meme stocks are exceptions."
2021-06-27 21:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I like it. The beauty of it is that if it’s below $100 on July 16th and IV is still high (I’m sure it will be), you could probably get another $2K or so by rolling the option."
2021-06-27 22:09:36,wallstreetbets,Because the call wasn’t profitable for them? Haha
2021-06-27 23:10:16,wallstreetbets,They’re called apes for a reason 🦍
2021-06-28 00:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is a good way to think about covered calls - you’re getting paid to sell at a price you’d be comfortable selling at anyway.

On the flip side, with selling puts you get paid to buy the stock at a price you’d be comfortable buying at anyway."
2021-06-27 21:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, as you say on a high IV stock you can still catch getting a decent premium by selling OTM calls. My analysis used ATM, but this strategy can be modified to do OTM based on how much premium you want vs. how much you want to keep the shares."
2021-06-28 01:08:30,wallstreetbets,"If you want to sell your shares, the strike is your profit target. If you want to keep your shares, the strike is the lowest price that you think won’t get hit. 16 delta is a good baseline. 

Expiration depends. For normal stocks, I just sell the next month. If it’s less than 30 days out, I’ll sell the month after. For meme stocks, I know a lot of people prefer weeklies. I don’t know if the math works out better for those in the end, but it seems like it would be better just by letting you sit tight when it’s hot and sell calls when it’s cold."

2021-06-27 23:28:58,wallstreetbets,I think ironically the most fervent of disbelievers wouldn’t do it either.. if you think AMC will go to $20 overnight or something lol.
2021-06-27 21:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my analysis was for ATM, but you can absolutely do OTM if you don’t want to lose the shares. Love to see it. 😈😈"
2021-06-27 22:01:20,wallstreetbets,Good point. It’s important that you do this on a stock that you think will do fine long-term. Doing this on a stock that tanks and never recovers is a losing proposition.
2021-06-27 22:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Between you and me.. I think you’ll be fine on the trade lol. This carries much more risk since your loss is theoretically unlimited, but I assume you understand those risks."
2021-06-28 01:04:51,wallstreetbets,How much is your maintenance requirement for opening this position?
2021-06-27 22:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, can definitely do them pretty far OTM. Less premium, but if you want to keep the shares it’s the way to go."
2021-06-27 22:49:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got assigned on CLOV right before it tanked as well. Good timing.
2021-06-28 00:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah put credit spreads are nice too. Definitely less capital intensive, unfortunately you collect less premium though."

2021-06-27 21:19:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’d say that’s the main risk.. you miss out on rallies. I sold covered calls on AMC right around the big run up in price. I did well on the premium, but I would’ve been much better holding the shares without calls against them."
2021-06-27 21:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s a fair point, this sort of thing doesn’t really jive with the “bets” part of WallStreetBets."
2021-06-27 21:49:31,wallstreetbets,"Man idk. I dont have the shares to dive into selling calls for something like GME, but damn are those premiums intense. If I had a hundred shares id definitely be tempted to pocket some of those sky high premiums selling slightly out of reach strike weeklies when shes ripping."
2021-06-27 23:35:15,wallstreetbets,"Well BB ain’t doin shit and I’ve been regularly making 5% a week on CCs, so, some stocks are better than others there."

2021-06-27 23:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain more beyond “lol?”

Put-call parity means selling a put is the same as selling a call, buying the shares, and selling a bond with a face value of the strike price. Absent the bond part (which in reality are just borrowed funds), they are synthetically the same."
2021-06-27 21:17:24,wallstreetbets,Of course an AMC call with a $145 strike makes no money. $145 is extremely OTM..
2021-06-27 21:26:03,wallstreetbets,I’ve made 10k selling calls since amc’s most recent run up. When utilization goes back to 100% and IV comes down more than I’ll stop. If you own a few hundred shares you should be taking advantage of this right now.
2021-06-27 21:14:33,wallstreetbets,"I mean I suppose that could happen, but going from $54 to $150 in a few days seems highly unlikely.. Regardless, even if that happened, you’d still get $9,600 on the appreciation of the shares ($150-$54)."
2021-06-27 21:14:24,wallstreetbets,This assumes AMC will squeeze greater than 200%. What's the likelihood of a stock that has spiked already to spike again? Even GME hasn't had another event like it's initial short squeeze.
2021-06-27 21:32:02,wallstreetbets,"You still make money, and if you get assigned and want the sttock back, you can buy a call or just buy back your shares at market."
2021-06-27 23:36:46,wallstreetbets,"You make the 25$ per 100 shares, and sell the shares for 145$ a share…what’s wrong with that?"
2021-06-28 04:15:26,wallstreetbets,"One big rally can eclipse months of thetagang profits for sure. 

Which is why I either sell ATM calls or way OTM calls and rarely anything in-between."
2021-06-27 20:47:10,wallstreetbets,You should be happy I'm selling you calls to buy
2021-06-27 21:44:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah you want to avoid stocks that you think will 1) go down a lot and not recover and 2) have a large rise in price (at least before your expiration date). Other stocks are fair game for the most part.
2021-06-27 22:07:00,wallstreetbets,You can get the upside from the spikes if you roll your calls at that point and take advantage of the volatility.
2021-06-27 21:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Right, so as a definition the option delta is how much the price of an option goes up for a change in the price of the underlying stock (all else being equal). For example, if an option has a delta of 0.70, that means for a $1 increase in the price of the underlying, the option would increase $0.70 in price.

There’s a useful feature of option delta, particularly in the context of selling covered calls. That feature is that you can use the option delta to approximate the chance that the option will expire in the money.

For example, if you sold a covered call with an option delta of 0.70, there’s around a 70% chance that the option would expire in the money and you’d lose the shares. With an option with 0.30 delta, there’s only a 30% chance.

This is useful because if you don’t want to lose the shares, you might want to sell calls with a lower delta. Maybe 0.10 (so 10% chance) is what you’re looking for. Just know that the smaller the delta of the call option, the less premium you’ll receive for selling it."
2021-06-27 22:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, definitely very risky. Though I’d say most trades on these stocks are lol."
2021-06-27 22:33:25,wallstreetbets,"I could be wrong here as well, but I actually think put-call parity makes them essentially the same. (Technically the put-call parity formula includes a zero coupon bond, but I’ll ignore that for simplicity.)

Let’s run through a scenario with a $50 stock. We’ll sell a put with a $50 strike and a covered call with a $50 strike.

Stock goes down:
- Selling a put, you collect the premium but will have to pay $1 for each $0.01 move in the underlying.
- Selling a covered call, you collect the premium but your 100 shares will have decreased by a total of $1 for each $0.01 move in the stock.

Stock stays at $50
- Selling a put, you collect the premium. Since the underlying is ATM, you don’t have to pay out anything.
- Selling a covered call, you collect the premium. Since the stock didn’t move, you have no gain or loss from the shares.

Stock goes up
- Selling a put, you collect the premium. Since the option is OTM, you don’t have to pay out anything.
- Selling a covered call, you collect the premium. Since the call you sold expired ITM, typically you’d have to pay out; however, since you have the shares, you don’t owe anything.

The dollar value you collect in premium between the call and the put won’t be the same (I think at least partially because of the zero coupon bond thing I mentioned earlier); however, you can see here that a down move, staying even, and an up move have essentially the same results for each strategy."
2021-06-27 23:06:06,wallstreetbets,"Short put and covered call are kind of the same thing. They have the same p&l profile and are both bullish. You make money if the stock goes up or stays the same, you lose money if it goes down. I prefer short puts because they are generally less capital intensive when you use margin. But if you already have the shares then obviously go covered call. Or don’t. I only run covered calls on stocks I don’t want to keep long term."
2021-06-27 22:42:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m doing BB as well. It’s been a good trade.
2021-06-27 23:42:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this strategy is the only way I’m comfortable still holding BB. XXXX at 14.50, but with CC premiums that number is actually around 12.50…would still love to see it actually AT 14.50+, but it helps me sleep at night."
2021-06-27 23:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you can always sell puts. If you get assigned, then you could sell calls against the shares. This is called the wheel."
2021-06-27 23:43:45,wallstreetbets,"Well for those of us selling covered calls, we can do a similar process..

In your example, you are long a call. If you want to close the position, you sell to close.

When I sell covered calls, I’m short a call. If I want to close the position, I have to buy to close.

So just as we were on opposite ends of the trade initially, we (most likely it’s another trader now) would now take offsetting trades to close.

As someone who sells covered calls, there may be a number of reasons we’d do this. Maybe we’d buy to close a call that’s expiring and then sell to open a call with an expiry that’s further in the future. This is called “rolling” the position. Alternatively, maybe we want to avoid getting assigned on an ITM call (because we want to keep the shares) so we buy to close at a loss.

Hope that’s kind of what you were looking for."
2021-06-27 23:50:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s a risk you take doing covered calls on high IV stocks. You could try rolling up in strike and out in expiry and then hope the stock goes down some. But it’s admittedly difficult to go up and out like that if the stock blows through your strike. You’d usually have to roll way out.
2021-06-28 00:03:51,wallstreetbets,"Fine, I’ll get back to r/thetagang"
2021-06-28 01:03:34,wallstreetbets,"That’s the gist of it. So say you sell a covered call at a $45 strike expiring in a week. Then a week goes buy and the stock is at $45.25. You could try “rolling” the option by buying to close the $45 strike, then selling a new one another week out with a $45.50 strike. 

Depending on the options pricing at the time, you may be able to do this without spending any money. This is because the new option you’re selling has time value or “theta.” So even though the new option has a higher strike price, the theta compensates for it."
2021-06-28 02:15:15,wallstreetbets,Yikes 😅
2021-06-28 08:58:01,wallstreetbets,"Definitely agree with this. Getting in super early reduces the risk involved with selling near ATM calls which will have the highest premium on the meme stocks, but also the highest risk for assignment, you could also choose to sell very far OTM calls for much less premium as your cost basis is so low in the first place you don’t need to drastically drop it with pocketing a high premium."
2021-06-28 09:11:36,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say the stock tanks and never recovers. The premium you get for selling calls will be so low that you might never recover. Think of something like Sears, if it collapsed and never comes back, covered calls aren’t a winning trade either.

With buying a call and the stock collapsing, it may be a 100% loss but your dollar value loss is much smaller since your loss is limited to the premium paid. Since the stock is way down now, you may be able to buy more calls now and try to recoup the losses (if you believe the stock will go back up in the future.)

So there’s a lot of dynamics at play here. It depends on 1) how far the stock goes down and 2) if the stock will recover in the future."
2021-06-28 10:02:22,wallstreetbets,Sell to open
2021-06-28 10:10:25,wallstreetbets,"If they exercise the option, you sell the shares to them at the strike price. Since you own the shares, you just give them the shares. You receive the strike price x number of options in cash."
2021-06-27 22:04:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah probably not a WSB… but I’ve seen a lot of misconceptions so thought I’d write this. Besides, apes should educate themselves on who is selling them their FDs lol."
2021-06-27 22:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Poor man's covered calls are great if you are very bullish on a stock and want the cash flow.

I think it would be tough to deploy on meme stocks though. The IV spike makes leaps expensive and one pump could force you to be exercised too soon to really maximize the credits from weekly calls. I've done quite a few CC and CSP on meme stocks but poor man's covered calls make me nervous."
2021-06-28 11:35:08,wallstreetbets,"Way better in my opinion.

I can earn 1-2% per month writing covered calls. That's in addition to any dividends paid or stock appreciation.

My best example from this year is RKT. I bought 100 shares in my Roth back in February. My cost basis is around $2,100. Currently I'm down $50 on the shares. But I collected $500 worth of premiums by selling covered calls. So even without accounting for their special dividend back in March I'm up over 20% in 4 months."
2021-06-28 08:49:51,wallstreetbets,"Damn that's a pretty sweet return. My best example for the power of CCs is RKT. I bought 100 shares in February/March and have been selling covered calls every time I get a stock movement. I've netted nearly $500 on premiums. My cost basis is like $21 and currently I am down $50 on the shares.

Without selling CCs I'd be down like -2.5%. But by selling covered calls I'm up 21% not including the special dividend payout.

You can easily make 2% per month selling OTM CCs. Where even if exercised you'll make money. It's not a get rich quick scheme. But it's consistent cash flow."
2021-06-27 22:08:42,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good way to think about it, WACS_On.

You’re right, ProfessorJP. You can go below your basis. I’d probably avoid being too aggressive though, because you may force yourself into a losing trade if you’re selling below basis."
2021-06-28 04:08:28,wallstreetbets,Isnt just holding the stock way better as it should recover sooner or later?
2021-06-27 22:04:35,wallstreetbets,"I had no idea about CCs before the big boom from last year, and didn’t really start using them, or spreads, or CSPs until this year. Now my entire portfolio revolves around them, it keeps me flush for taking wild FD gambles. And as much as we like to tell the new cats that they’re not going to learn anything here, if they were to keep their mouth shut and listen they’d actually learn that there’s good DD and good advice still being tossed around on this sub."
2021-06-27 23:30:32,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-06-28 08:50:53,wallstreetbets,Oh. I don’t. Thanks for telling me
2021-06-27 22:23:28,wallstreetbets,Because you could potentially get your shares called away before the dividend gets distributed
2021-06-27 22:22:08,wallstreetbets,Option could be exercised before expiration so the buyer can collect the dividend payment

2021-06-27 23:14:43,wallstreetbets,Not if you lose all your money before the end of the year.
2021-06-27 22:53:52,wallstreetbets,"No more than any other short term trade; the only real gotcha would be not knowing that if you write calls < 30 days to expiry, you reset the purchase date on your underlying equity for tax purposes, so you may think you're holding long-term capital gains on the underlying, when you're not.

EDIT: It's a little more complex than this (there are additional considerations for whether the short call is OTM, ATM, or ITM and by how much; you can also reset the holding period on your underlying if you write an ITM call that's more than one strike below the underlying's previous day closing price, even if it's > 30 days. Look up ""Qualified vs non-Qualified Covered Call"" online for more details).

Edit again: I found a thread over at thetagang  that may help. [CC Tax Treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/o7sx0n/dont_get_your_holding_period_reset_when_wheeling/)"

2021-06-27 21:44:43,wallstreetbets,Help me understand “rolling” an option. Doesn’t this just mean selling and re-buying at a higher or lower strike?

2021-06-27 21:28:54,wallstreetbets,This is buying a deep in the money call and selling a call that is out of the money using the more valuable call as collateral.  Works just as well

2021-06-27 23:41:34,wallstreetbets,"Name a stock that isn’t a meme stock that would generate 2.5% a week for 9 months that isn’t crazy risky. Like potential to go down 50% or completely blow through your strike. 

If AMC is 55 bucks you can’t just sell 56, 60 or even 65 strikes every week and expect to profit. 

AMC could go down to 30, it could also blow to 70 and you’d miss out on the gains cuz you would be exercised.

I know this is wallstreet bets and it’s an unpopular opinion but dumping your entire account into meme stocks is a terrible idea. Sure hindsight is always 20/20 wished I would have done it. But it’s all about preservation of capital. You don’t want to be invested in something that has the potential to take a massive chunk out of your account. 

Sure you could say that for stocks in general but sticking to things like the SPY, or giant tech companies like Apple, Google, amazon, fb etc is probably the better way to go. Yes I know they could tank too but look at their daily moves. They’re not bouncing around up and down 5% a day. What’s the likelyhood of the spy, amc, Google or amzn halving? Probably not much, and if they did that would probably be the least of everyone’s concerns because something major probably happened. 

I’m not here to tell you not to do it, and yes there’s people that make a lot off of it. If you bought in at 10-30 bucks then sure go for it because your gains are already massive. But the wallstreet bets/ yolo options meme stock buying is kind of ridiculous. You see these massive gains but go look at the loss porn. 

Investing is all about transferring wealth trough time. What’s the point if your account halves or someone yolo’s options? 

Slow and steady growth isn’t sexy but at the end of the day you still have your money."
2021-06-27 23:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Also if you had 100k and were generating 2.5% a week compounding for 9 months which is 39 weeks. You go from 100k to 262. 

Or even 10k to 26.2k. 

In my opinion not doable due to the potential downside risk of the stock and or the price going through the roof. 

If you wanted to play it safe in covered calls, you sell out of the money. Not one or two strikes out either. You probably couldn’t do a 70delta on AMC for weeklies. Realistically a 90-95 to play it safe so you could actually see some of the stock gains but the trade off is the premium collected is much smaller. 

There’s no magic one sized fits all selling covered calls and you have to be ready for weeks it makes massive gains or losses. I wish it was easy just to sell the first strike out of the money or sell 70 covered calls since that’s a top. You could probably get away with it but even at 55 what does a 70 covered call get you? Just checked on a 100k account you could get 2600 for the week. That’s looking at Friday data so Monday would probably be lower due to time decay or whatever happens to the stock price. And the delta is 87 which I could live with 

Here’s the thing. You generate let’s say 2.5k on a 100k account. If the stock goes down 2% or $1 you’ve already lost the difference. 

And then you keep holding cuz you like the stock and a month from now it might be 40 bucks. You probably would have lost way more than what your covered calls even generated. 

Portfolio diversification and risk management. But no one here knows anything about that. They just like seeing the crazy yolo plays that are just pure luck"
2021-06-28 10:16:42,wallstreetbets,">  up or down 5% in a day

or 

> selling weeklies for 2.5% a week

Pick one.  Stocks that pay 10%/month in options premium can swing 50% in a day."
2021-06-27 22:23:29,wallstreetbets,Ya I'm good. I will only get margin called if AMC goes to $800.
2021-06-28 07:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Right now the mainence requirment is 500% of the notional value of the calls. At the moment this is $59,130. I use eTrade, but I'm sure other brokers are quite similar."
2021-06-27 22:37:07,wallstreetbets,"Yup I wait for a good push and then sell as value increases.  Made a quick 23% on some BB a few weeks back and have sold a few more for much less but it's all money on top and just continues to give.

I do place a limit buy to close order as soon as I sell the CC so I just don't have to think about it as there does come a point that it is just not worth holding onto."

2021-06-27 21:20:17,wallstreetbets,AMC went up 300% + in one week without the shorts  getting called. The short interest is even higher now; imagine if most get forced to cover on a run… Moon!
2021-06-27 21:38:59,wallstreetbets,You’re gonna lose if you get your cover called exercised at $65 and have to by them back at $80+. Go do that shit with Ford or Microsoft. You can get destroyed of potential gains with meme stocks. People with a few 100 shares are apes holding for a cause. They are giving up their seat on the rocket for 20-40 dollars.
2021-06-27 20:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Damn, fair enough. You may proceed."

2021-06-27 22:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I understand the parity bit when it comes to calculations. Though I guess my question is whether parity holds when the likelihood of strike prices are not the same, yet are not yet reflected by the premium prices of puts vs calls.

I.e. price is currently at $10 with theoretically extremely strong historical resistance levels at $9. Say premium for selling puts at strike of $8 is $2 and premium of selling calls at strike $12 is $2. There’s parity of results if there’s equal likelihood of price movement. However given the sentiment and historical resistance wouldn’t selling puts be safer and net more profit? I may be missing something here"
2021-06-28 00:16:40,wallstreetbets,I just took the hit and hopefully on Monday SPCE keeps running
2021-06-28 11:41:03,wallstreetbets,Fair point. But unlikely. Sears doesn’t happen often. AMC is not going anywhere anytime super soon. Holding the underlying is a better position IMO. But I do understand what you are saying short term
2021-06-28 10:04:16,wallstreetbets,"Ok thanks. Can you also explain what the other selections mean? 

I also plan on holding GPRO for a long time, what strike price should I sell it at?"
2021-06-28 10:06:50,wallstreetbets,Do I click on the bid price or ask price?
2021-06-28 10:27:20,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense. So if I have 100 of something that costs 1$, sell a call at a strike price of 2$, then the stock goes up to 5$, I will make back 200$ in share price plus the premium on the call. Right? I would technically “lose” money because I couldn’t sell at 5$ but overall still a profit"
2021-06-27 22:38:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree on that. Hard telling where a stock like GME or AMC will be at in a year or two.

I’m currently doing PMCCs on stocks that I genuinely believe in long-term. At the moment that means Boeing and Coupang. The premium received on the calls I sold isn’t as good as a meme obviously, but I like the leverage I get from the LEAPS on these stocks."
2021-06-28 06:56:34,wallstreetbets,Poor mans covered calls are selling call spreads
2021-06-28 08:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah TBH I'm still a little traumatized selling CCs.  I sold some on ZS and PTON right after the pandemic crash in March 2020 cause I thought they'd trade flat or down for a while and then they proceeded to shoot up 200% past their previous ATHs.  I made a couple grand, but I missed out on like 20-30k.

When the IV gets so delicious like this though I just can't help myself.

>I've better nearly $500 on premiums.

My issue is that my perspective on money is just completely warped now.  A couple hundred doesn't feel worth it to me and if the IV's not high enough I remember getting fucked on my CCs last year (the quote ""picking pennies in front of a steamroller"" comes to mind.

I've been debating cutting down on the number of companies I'm invested in so I can keep a better eye on them and focus more on reliable income like CCs.  I just don't want to be the asshole on the other side of a trade like this https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o996be/spce_did_me_good/ even if that strike price is well above my cost average."
2021-06-28 00:28:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s dumb to write calls below your cost because of you do get called away at strike below your cost then you end up losing money. Covered calls are best if you’re neutral-bullish on a stock, which are the majority or blue chip stocks given stable and normal market condition."
2021-06-28 11:52:27,wallstreetbets,"It's better to sell calls as you hold.  If it doesn't recover to your basis, you can still recoup all your losses through premiums from your sold calls.  If it does recover, you're making profit with premiums on the way up to your basis.  If the recovery of the price hits your sold calls' strikes on the way up, you just roll the calls (a simultaneous buy-to-close and sell-to-open at a later date) so you aren't assigned.  When you roll the calls, set a higher strike with enough DTE so the roll results in a net credit, where you still get premium."
2021-06-27 22:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m the same way. Picked this stuff up fairly recently just from resources on the internet, especially InTheMoney on YouTube. I’m mostly CCs, CSPs, and LEAPS at this point."
2021-06-27 23:25:40,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. Was wondering if there was a larger negative side effect.
2021-06-27 23:02:40,wallstreetbets,I did it with AMC on this current run. I was selling $15 CCs and then it ran so I slowly rolled it up to $50 and let them get assigned. Got some money on every roll as well.
2021-06-27 22:24:59,wallstreetbets,The promised land for sure. Too bad you can touch it if you're not old

2021-06-27 22:34:02,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a covered call it's treated as short term capital gains (as opposed to long term), which is subject to income tax instead of the lower long term capital gains rate. If you want to protect yourself from this, sell your calls in a tax shelter like a Roth IRA. Of course that means you can't touch the money penalty-free until you're old if you go that route."
2021-06-28 11:21:22,wallstreetbets,"You're at an additional disadvantage relative to buy and hold, which already probably outperforms options for most traders."
2021-06-28 13:42:12,wallstreetbets,What kind of contracts do you usually write? Like how many DTE and how far OTM? Any favorite tickers?
2021-06-27 22:14:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah selling naked puts are so satisfying if they go your way. Literally a credit directly to your account.
2021-06-27 21:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for asking this, I'm not clear on what rolling an option is either."
2021-06-27 21:55:08,wallstreetbets,"In this case he’s the option seller, so he’s buying it back and reselling an option at either the same or a higher strike for a later date."
2021-06-27 22:50:35,wallstreetbets,Since nobody gave you a good response... You would be looking to roll up in strike and out in expiration. Up and out. Google will help you find more details. But there can be big advantages to this.
2021-06-27 22:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah high IV means larger potential movements. So they certainly could be very profitable, but the stock still needs to move in the right direction. High IV could also mean a large move to the downside. As a call buyer, that means you paid a lot of premium and got nothing to show for it."
2021-06-28 01:39:26,wallstreetbets,"InTheMoney single handedly taught me selling covered calls, selling puts, and the wheel strategy. It is currently what ive been doing for about the last 4 months. I am fairly new, but once I really know what im doing, I definitely owe him a steak dinner."
2021-06-27 23:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Except it doesn’t compound weekly because you need units of 100 shares to add another CC - it compounds like stairs, which is just gonna depend on which stock we are talking about as to the amount of CCs you can add per week. Right now I’m probably adding 0.6ish BB CCs per week.

You certainly are right about the underlying stock - I think the key there is to find a stock volatile enough to have good premiums but one you are long on for several years and if it tanks, it’s okay because you aren’t trying to sell right now."
2021-06-27 22:35:42,wallstreetbets,I mean it’s still bad to lose money even if you don’t get margin called lol

I just provided the definition of put-call parity. Absent the bond part, they are synthetically the same. In reality it’s for a European call, but now we’re getting pretty technical.

There’s a comment on this thread where I ran through a stock trading at $50. I then compared selling a put with a $50 strike and a covered call with a $50 strike. The dollar value gain may be different, but an up move, a down move, or no move all have the same result."

2021-06-27 21:27:07,wallstreetbets,To each his or her own… I think that sort of price movement in a week is highly unlikely (less than a 1% probability imo. That $25 could buy me a lap dance at the club so I’d take it.
2021-06-27 22:05:44,wallstreetbets,"So sell covered puts on AMC, or buy a higher strike call when you sell your call, it's only stupid if you play it stupid.  If you have the shares and don't play the options you're leaving easy money on the table."

2021-06-27 22:47:44,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I think I understand. Honestly I’m not sure on the answer. My guess is it’s possible there some breakdown in put-call parity in this case. At the end of the day, it’s traders posting bids and asks - they make the market, not some theory. Unless there’s institutional traders taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.. not really sure if they want to be crossing bid-ask spreads to do arbitrage."
2021-06-28 10:08:13,wallstreetbets,"It’s all in the name basically. If you want to sell a call you use “sell” and if you want to buy a call you use “buy.” If you want to enter the position you use “to open” and if you want to exit the position you use “to close.” Intuitively understand those 2 rules and you’ll understand the 4 terms you just mentioned.

As far as a strike, that depends on how much premium you want to receive, your outlook on the stock, etc."

2021-06-28 11:47:15,wallstreetbets,It's definitely labor intensive. But just like a single family rentals as you scale it becomes less labor intensive. I try to keep 20 to 25 different positions within my Roth along with about 5% of the balance in cash to right cash secured puts with. So unfortunately that account balance means that I'm writing a lot of calls that are only netting me double digits.
2021-06-28 01:28:45,wallstreetbets,You can be bearish in short term but bullish long term and sell below your basis for extra premium if you’re expecting bad news or missed earnings in the short term. There’s a reason high open interest in a strike/expiry in call contracts could be indicative of a bearish outlook by the option sellers.
2021-06-28 02:04:37,wallstreetbets,What's dumb is writing calls without knowing how to roll them to avoid assignment while collecting a net credit.
2021-06-28 00:17:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah so simple math would be something like strike price minus dividend payment per share and so it would be worth it for call buyers to exercise at that reduced priced to get their divvy before the ex-date.
2021-06-28 09:51:01,wallstreetbets,"Stocks that pay dividends tend to have their value increase roughly/close to the amount of the dividend about to be paid. Tends to prevent people from buying the stock the day before dividend, collecting the dividend, then selling the stock, and pocketing the dividend.

If apple pays 1% dividend qrtly, the price of the stock will typically increase at least .25% week/day of dividend payment, and decrease almost right after."
2021-06-28 00:37:23,wallstreetbets,"I find it really hard to believe that you 1. were able to roll far enough out that you were receiving a credit, when you were rolling almost $40 from DEEPLY in-the-money to at-the-money, AND 2. Even after rolling (what I assume would have to be REALLY) far out, it somehow wasn't that far because you've already been assigned? I find that extremely hard to believe as that's not really how options pricing works. But I could be wrong--care to tell me from what strike and expiry you were rolling from and then what you rolled to (I'll probably never get an answer lol)?"
2021-06-28 03:58:33,wallstreetbets,No way. You actually lose a bit every time you roll.

2021-06-28 11:39:16,wallstreetbets,What? Do you understand what a covered call is?
2021-06-28 19:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Bi-weekly, so usually 12 days out. I like ATM calls as they're mostly extrinsic value."
2021-06-27 21:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it means you buy back the call you sold.  Sometimes I’ll do this if the underlying stock performed better than expected and I didn’t want to lose my shares.  Other times I’ll do this when the stock went down and I already made a 50% return.  The “roll” simply means you buy back the old one and sell a new one."
2021-06-27 23:09:37,wallstreetbets,"A big advantage of rolling is that you don’t need the funds to buy back your contract, you just need to pay the difference or even get a credit for the new contract you sell. Helped me with my $15 AMC CCs that I sold right before it ran."
2021-06-28 00:16:18,wallstreetbets,That's a good point also you might be even or have a credit due to time value
2021-06-28 02:04:51,wallstreetbets,He’s a real OG
2021-06-28 00:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s understandable. Sorry I was thinking of compounding interest. You’re right, the 2.5% would be on the initial investment or 100 shares each covered call per week. 

The idea is nice but there’s no having your cake and eating it too with options. (No one perfect or once size fits all) there still pros and cons with covered calls but I like the idea since it’s seemingly one of the least risky strategies if your long in stock. 


My idea was to try and generate 3% a year extra selling covered calls in my portfolio. That sounds horrendous, but I’m looking at it until I retire. 3% compounding interest extra on 6-7% account doesn’t sound like much but it’s the difference for be between 2 and like 3.1million or something when I retire"

They're the total opposite of each other.
The put-call parity is the exact opposite of what you described.

At least now you know you're on the right subreddit."
2021-06-27 22:02:09,wallstreetbets,"This is a short squeeze situation with a stock that recently jumped 300%+ without almost any of shorts having to cover. Imagine what happens when it starting running again with now a higher short interest and them this time having to cover!? $25 to risk losing thousands, if not tens of thousands? Not to mention, the shorts would love to have you to post covered calls to hedge themselves when they let this run."

2021-06-28 02:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I was in a similar position, sold AMC CC at 18 and I would have had to pay more than my initial cost basis to roll out that call."
2021-06-28 01:19:31,wallstreetbets,"I rolled weeklies just enough to get a small credit. Look at the premiums, I can roll a 7/2 $55 call to a 7/9 $65 call for no cost. Or roll to $60 and get ~$120 per contract. I rolled the first one the day AMC broke $15, it wasn’t deep ITM yet. Then just kept doing it 1-2 times a week when I found a strike and premium that worked.

AMC shot up fast but has been hovering in the 50s for like 3 weeks now. Only broke $60 a few times and then went back down. That made it easy to keep rolling up and out."
2021-06-27 23:43:34,wallstreetbets,Didn’t know that fact thanks.
2021-06-28 01:57:12,wallstreetbets,"Not really wheeling just selling covered calls when the price spikes then waiting on the correction to rebuy at lower price. Works decently and I can get additional returns on some long stocks. 

So do you have to rebuy after 30 days or is it just using 30+ day options?"
2021-06-28 05:59:24,wallstreetbets,"the only backtesting (granted, it was really well done) i've seen was tastytrades, and that was only SPY/X. meme stocks are much more volatile and prone to singular news events, hence why i find it best to trade in 2-3 periods."
2021-06-28 11:44:44,wallstreetbets,He doesn’t
2021-06-28 11:37:22,wallstreetbets,When you say “buy back” can you clarify this? That isn’t necessarily an option in a brokerage account. Are you saying you buy the call at the current price on the market?
2021-06-27 23:26:58,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, sir ape."
2021-06-28 00:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes I understand that a put benefits from a decrease in price and a call benefits from an increase in price. Anything I wrote would tell you I have a much deeper understanding than that.

What you’re missing is that selling a put benefits from the same price movement as selling a call PLUS BUYING 100 OF THE UNDERLYING. I usually don’t use caps lock but that’s what you’re missing. Or maybe you didn’t know a covered call means also owning the shares. 🦍"
2021-06-27 21:48:05,wallstreetbets,If this situation happens.. I’d absolutely patronize your strip club as a kudos to you lol. No lie.
2021-06-28 01:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Dude I love the username lol. Vandelay Industries even has a new opening for a latex salesman, I heard"
2021-06-28 02:14:13,wallstreetbets,"That's what I'm saiyan, bro. Never heard of being able to roll from super itm to atm--for a credit--and be assigned so quick."
2021-06-28 01:51:37,wallstreetbets,">I can roll a 7/2 $55 call to a 7/9 $65 call for no cost.


You're talking about rolling OTM to OTM. That's WAY different than rolling from deeply ITM to OTM or even ATM. When an option is deeply ITM, typically ~95%+ of its mark price is intrinsic value. There's no way you can accrue enough theta to offset how much of the overall value of that is already intrinsic.


You mentioned looking at the options chain: if you had a short $25 call expiring next friday--so ITM by roughly $30, you would have to roll all the way out to January 2023 to even be *at-the-money*. And yet you're telling me you've already been assigned? And again--this is *post* IV crush. AMC's premiums have declined since its peak at $70 or whatever crazy shit it hit.


But if you've really done it, you should be able to look at your trade history in your brokerage and link it back to me. Again, I'm very curious what strikes and expiries you rolled from and to."
2021-06-28 01:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it definitely made it easier to go the Roth route, even though it doesn’t help with taxes."
2021-06-28 01:09:37,wallstreetbets,"Guess what happens when you just own the shares and never sell cc and the stocks go up???

All you're doing is shifting the risks around, but with the completely wrong justification.

Again, saying selling puts == selling covered calls just shows you are in the exact subreddit you're supposed be."
2021-06-27 21:53:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding you this this. It will be named “Ass Hammerer’s Lounge, a Gentleman’s Club.”"
2021-06-28 04:52:47,wallstreetbets,I bought 100 at about 14 a share and bought back my 50 option when it hit 40 to sell another one at 70... sell them high enough to be on with it. Can't hold if it's sold.
2021-06-28 01:20:31,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Seriously open a college finance textbook and chill. I posted the put-call parity equation which showed what I’m saying. If you saying the equation is wrong helps you sleep at night, go for it. But you’ve yet to say anything that makes an ounce of sense besides saying I don’t know what a call or put is. Considering I work in finance and have extensive financial education and credentials, I’ll tell you that’s false.

Let’s try one more time.

Stock + Put = Call + Strike/(1 + interest)

Subtract stock from each side

Put = Call - Stock + Strike/(1 + interest)

Since selling a put means being short the put, multiple each side by negative 1. 

-Put = -Call + Stock - Strike/(1 + interest)

Selling a covered call equals being short the call and long the stock, so I can substitute “sell covered call” for “-Call + Stock.” Also, “-put” just means “sell put” so I’ll substitute that in.

Sell put = sell covered call - strike/(1+interest)

So yes, holding the borrowed funds portion constant, the put you sell and the covered call you sell will benefit from the same price movement.

Stop coming in here trying to act smart (which you were acting all high and mighty starting a conversation with just “lol”) when you clearly don’t understand what’s going on."
2021-06-28 02:04:28,wallstreetbets,"""Selling a covered call equals being short the call and long the stock""

I rest my case.

Looks like your ""financial education"" did you no good, you can't even grasp the very definition of puts / calls.

Try to get a refund from University of Phoenix bruh."
2021-06-28 02:05:53,wallstreetbets,"“A covered call refers to a financial transaction in which the investor selling call options owns an equivalent amount of the underlying security.”

Source: investopedia and anyone with a finance education"
2021-06-28 02:07:35,wallstreetbets,"If a covered call is not selling a call and buying the stock, what’s the definition? You keep saying I’m wrong about stuff but never say how so.

Honestly just telling someone they’re wrong and refusing to say why doesn’t make you look intelligent. It makes it look like you don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re arguing like a child would while I’m explained things."
2021-06-28 02:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's the definition. Re-read what you wrote above, it is the complete opposite of it.

Good luck with this strategy, I'm done trying to get you to see what you got wrong.

Come back three months from now and tell me how much you lost."
2021-06-28 02:13:02,wallstreetbets,"If you think me saying “selling a covered call” means exiting a covered call, that’s not at all what I’m saying. The “selling” refers to the selling of the call (hence being short the call). Since it’s covered, I’m long the stock. That’s the definition of a covered call, as you just agreed. That’s the definition I had in my put-call parity equation.

Also, you’re still not explaining stuff, you’re just saying I’m wrong lol.

I’m throughly done with this. I don’t get what you’re not grasping here. I can recite first, second, and third order derivatives of all the Greeks and you’re over here acting like I don’t know what a call is lol. Okay dude. Go back to your wife if she’s not with Chad."
2021-06-28 02:15:01,wallstreetbets,"Ok, whatever let's you sleep at night bruh."

2021-06-28 12:04:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't get options trading. Doesn't this say he bought 100 options at $0.04 with a $52 strike price? So didn't he only spend $4 (100 x 0.04)? And today it is trading at $55? So if he exercises his options at $52 and sells at $55, didn't he only make $300 (100 x 3)? Turning $4 into $300 is still awesome, but what am I doing wrong in my calculation? And how does this work out to a $41,000 gain??? Not being a dick, just really a noob in understanding how to calculate gains on options trading."
2021-06-28 12:07:18,wallstreetbets,SPCE get over $60 so I can celebrate my with you lol

2021-06-28 14:23:14,wallstreetbets, Congratulations! When did you buy these?
2021-06-28 14:23:16,wallstreetbets,OP what would’ve happened if it hadn’t of hit the price it needed to? Would you just lose 400 or would you have owed money? Still don’t quite get options.

2021-06-28 00:53:16,wallstreetbets,Someone here said he probably bought them at Thursday right before close
2021-06-28 10:46:43,wallstreetbets,These calls were priced at 0.04$ last week. Literally almost bought some myself :(
2021-06-28 01:05:45,wallstreetbets,Omg I was thinking the same thing.😂😂😂
2021-06-28 06:40:42,wallstreetbets,SPY 500C GANG REPRESENT
2021-06-27 22:27:47,wallstreetbets,Which contracts did you get
2021-06-27 22:05:29,wallstreetbets,basically he turned 400 into 40k.
2021-06-27 23:38:49,wallstreetbets,Wow*
2021-06-28 10:48:58,wallstreetbets,Probably last week. The calls were 0.04$ last week when I was looking at them. Almost bought some.
2021-06-27 22:04:16,wallstreetbets,Right after pleas fly again
2021-06-27 22:47:03,wallstreetbets,"Risking 400 is far from retarded, regardless of odds. Lol"
2021-06-27 21:43:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean I wouldn't call it that retarded or irresponsible considering he only put in $400. its not that much or like he yoloed 25k or something.  I guess chances of it going up this much and getting lucky with the news made it super unlikely it would work out, but betting $400 for something like this to happen isn't that crazy"
2021-06-28 01:10:04,wallstreetbets,Yea wasn’t afraid to lose 400 so I just said fuck it
2021-06-27 20:52:10,wallstreetbets,How did you not sell till now? How can you possibly have that kind of discipline (seriously)
2021-06-28 01:08:53,wallstreetbets,I wish man I’d make millions
2021-06-27 23:16:30,wallstreetbets,With Gut Instinct & Good DD Any patient Ape can make gains like OP
2021-06-28 01:07:26,wallstreetbets,My strategy that’s been working for me is playing options on meme stocks. I’ve made money from bb CLOV etc by predicting a huge rise in price the day before and buying calls. But it works until it doesn’t.
2021-06-28 08:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Dude, that's pure luck.

A price jump of $10 is nothing but getting luck with news.

Then again you think ladder attacks are real so..."
2021-06-28 14:22:28,wallstreetbets,"Look into GSAT, still under 2$ a share, might be able to get in some cheap calls, thinking about buying more for myself after this. I bought some 1.50$ calls for Jan 22. I’m ITM."
2021-06-28 01:17:01,wallstreetbets,i sure hope so. CLNE still has massive potential.
2021-06-27 23:22:09,wallstreetbets,He bought options which were priced very low because they were about to expire and there was no hint of good news so there was no demand for these options.
2021-06-28 01:20:44,wallstreetbets,He bought OTM calls on/or before Thursday. He was down 50% the day before. This retard just got lucky.
2021-06-28 04:53:26,wallstreetbets,">I'm not all too familiar with options.

So what exactly are you asking us then. He bought options. You clearly know they're options."
2021-06-28 01:16:11,wallstreetbets,Great way to lose all your gains
2021-06-27 21:50:40,wallstreetbets,It was $400 but still one of the biggest baggers you'll see outside of legends like DFV.
2021-06-28 04:40:52,wallstreetbets,because it only works like <1% of the time
2021-06-28 12:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Remember that there are two ways to make money when buying a call option, either you exercise or you resell the call. He bought 100 calls that were worth $4 each so he dropped $400. Because of the price and volatility increase of the stock, now each contract is worth $400 which is $40k for the whole 100. He could exercise but like you saw, that wouldn’t make much sense since he would make more money just selling the calls."
2021-06-28 14:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Each contract represents 100 shares so you have to multiply contract prices by 100

You don’t have to exercise the contracts you can just resell them to someone else. He spent $400 (100 x $4) and can sell them for what they’re worth now which is $41,000 (100 x $410)

Most people don’t exercise their contracts theres no reason to unless you really want to own shares"
2021-06-28 14:28:04,wallstreetbets,He would've lost the 400
2021-06-28 16:37:24,wallstreetbets,Sell? It expired last friday
2021-06-28 17:20:44,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-06-28 11:40:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the other day I lost $75 and felt like a baller"

2021-06-28 08:04:38,wallstreetbets,Can these idiots get banned for brigading yet?
2021-06-28 05:44:49,wallstreetbets,If insider trading. Why only invest 400 and not 4000 or more?
2021-06-28 01:28:06,wallstreetbets,I don't think insiders post. It's called gambling luck.
2021-06-28 00:00:03,wallstreetbets,How so? Just curious.
2021-06-28 00:18:47,wallstreetbets,How exactly would one go about this? Asking for a friend.

2021-06-28 08:02:59,wallstreetbets,Can someone link the post from the person that sold him these? Wondering how their Friday went.
2021-06-28 01:05:58,wallstreetbets,So he literally hit the lottery lol

2021-06-28 01:13:22,wallstreetbets,Basically the gist of it been seeing some patterns and took the chance. A lost of 400 isn’t much anyways if my predictions were wrong
2021-06-28 05:00:33,wallstreetbets,"See I did that
I somehow turn 69 in 6k over 2 weeks but then continue to get killed by ladder attacks

I do think bb will fly high soon I made a nice bit off that pretty berry"
2021-06-28 15:20:06,wallstreetbets,"Ladder attacks aren’t real?
Or sell offs of loaned shares whatever way you look at it

2021-06-28 10:40:55,wallstreetbets,Thats how you stay under the radar and still make money
2021-06-28 15:11:00,wallstreetbets,There were several plays to gamble on in the last 11 months (OP's account age). Don't you find it odd that this guy's first post to wsb is 1 DTE lottery tickets?
2021-06-28 00:01:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah how so also curious?
2021-06-28 14:11:04,wallstreetbets,So?
2021-06-28 10:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Idk if you want a serious answer or not and I can’t speak for OP but it’s been rumored that Richard Branson is going to try to fly up to space before Bezos, but not confirmed. Back in May SPCE was around 15 dollars a share, making 50 dollar call options expiring in a month dirt cheap. It’s a gamble to bet money on a stock more than tripling in price in such a short amount of time but OP was watching the situation and was able to strike at the opportune time. Plus it’s only 400 dollars, and the potential benefits are huge. All in all an amazing play by OP who was able to position themself in the best spot at the best time."
2021-06-28 00:26:15,wallstreetbets,You get tipped off from someone that something big is about to go down and you buy options to make money off of that. Its that simple. Oh and also super illegal...

2021-06-27 22:41:06,wallstreetbets,He bought a call option which is basically saying the stock will hit a certain price at 4$ a contract. He bought 100 of them so 400$ now each contract is worth 4.10 (in options that’s $410)
2021-06-27 22:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Before CLOV took off I put in an order to buy an OTM call.. bid was 5 dollars, ask was 10. Would have bought 39 of them, so 390 bucks. Figured it would drop so I'd just put in at the lower price and get them on sale!

CLOV skyrocketed the next day, and those contracts we worth over $1200 that day because they went from $8 OTM to around 12 dollars ITM.

I'm sad about it."
2021-06-27 23:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've been reading but they didn't teach this shit in the trailer park so it's a tough row to hoe. But keep reading and keep hanging out...all we can do."

Inside Trader: Fuck yeah, let me drop four HUNDRED dollars on it.

Informant:  No, I mean it's a guaranteed winner, you'll get rich. Mega rich.

Inside Trader: I'm not greedy.  $400 is plenty."
2021-06-28 01:04:19,wallstreetbets,Lol no just got super lucky saw a pattern a day before and I just took the chance. I wasn’t afraid to lose 400 bucks so I bought the calls 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-28 09:06:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you're hearing it from a friend of a friend who has an uncle who works at virgin galactic, is it really illegal? You have no idea if they're telling the truth or not so it's still a huge fucking risk."

Congrats on the absolutely insane gains btw"
2021-06-28 14:13:20,wallstreetbets,Hi. SEC is here to welcome you with open arms.
2021-06-28 03:35:55,wallstreetbets,"Can you please tell me how to understand this? I learned option basics recently. Correct me if I’m wrong, but if your premium was $400 for 100 contracts, that means your premium per contract was only $4? And how far above the current price did you have to buy to get the contracts so cheap? Also, how long were your contracts? If you help me do what you did, I’ll send you 1% of my profits for life :)"
2021-06-28 14:18:04,wallstreetbets,You bought those contracts last week?
2021-06-28 01:09:02,wallstreetbets,This is sick! Congrats
2021-06-28 05:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Same in nowheresville Ohio.  I don't think I even believe him, unless it's in like, Detroit."
2021-06-28 01:02:14,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-28 00:53:52,wallstreetbets,Well I’ve got 500 shares of SPCE so maybe not
2021-06-28 07:41:47,wallstreetbets,"the dude didn't explain it very well... let me try. The premium when they bought was $0.04 per share. Since each contract is (the right to buy) 100 shares, that's where the $4 per contract comes from. Since it blew up waaay past their strike price, the premium is now $4.10 per share, which makes each contract worth $4,100. 

They bought 100 contracts for $400, and now they are worth $40,000


Option premiums are based on much more than the stock price. Volatility and time to expiration are just as important."

2021-06-28 00:20:38,wallstreetbets,No these were option contracts on the bottom of the picture it has the stock price. The +100 is usually an indication that it’s an option because 1 contract counts as “100 stocks” which is also why when I contract says it’s .04 it’s really worth 4$ because you move the decimal over twice. So because it’s 4.10 it’s really $410 and because he bought a bunch of contracts he turned 4$ into 410$ a LOT of times

Here is the content of the DD put together by [u/working\_choice\_7785](https://www.reddit.com/u/working_choice_7785/) (moderators-- I hope it's okay to share here):

""**UPDATE market close 6/18**

Despite the Dow dumping more than 500 points, LZB held firm at the support of $35-36 and in fact gained a tiny bit day to day. People are asking for my position screenshot so here you go. Best of luck to everyone who's already jumped in. Spread the good word about LZB as far wide as you can. Let's make next week LZB week on Wall Street.

Hello everyone,

I just made an options play yesterday on LZB (La-Z-Boy) that I think is very exciting so I'll share it here.

I bought:

$45 call options exp July '21

Current stock price is $37.85.

TL;DR/Reasons

* **Market cap = $1.66B = Same as GME and AMC in January 2021.**
* **Down nearly 15% over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues.**
* **Now trading 33% below fair value of $53.39 as per Nasdaq.com**
* **Last time stock traded near current $36 support level was after last major dump on February 1. Stock recovered to $41 (10%+) by February 8 and hit $45 (20%+) by March 12.**
* **As per June 15 earnings report, orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand.**
* **Trailing 12 months P/E ratio = 14.31 = Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17.67 for this iconic brand!**

Long version/full DD

After the 10 bagger+ successes of GME & AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger. I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB. Why? This stock has everything Reddit needs!

1. **LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker -** LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price! Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per [Entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/374743) but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap.
2. **It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it 33% below fair value! Why did it dump? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short-term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
3. **The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.

&#x200B;

4. [**Forbes.com**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2021/06/15/la-z-boy-q4-proves-home-is-where-the-money-is/) **notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales** \- Some quotes for those that don't want to click through to the Forbes story -

>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.  
By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.  
Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

5. **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report**

6. **And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to this dump**

&#x200B;

If Reddit gets interested in this low cap stock I expect it to go to the moon. I recommend getting in like I did. Best of luck and don't forget to buy one of these with your tendies""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s. The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now.

LZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion. For a fantastic earnings beat, the drop in price was an overreaction, I think it will bounce. As always do your own DD and see you all on the damn moon!"

2021-06-27 22:49:42,wallstreetbets,Agree.  I'm going to look at $38's in the morning.
2021-06-28 12:00:28,wallstreetbets,Literally no analysis by the op. Even fair value is just assumed from the nasdaq report. One of the main catalysts is that it has “low market cap so easy to trade up”? Is this some pump and dump strategy?

The next update will be Wednesday night. (I will try to get it out before 8 pm)

iStar had a great last week. However, at this time I am not upgrading the price target for July 16th, 2021. I am maintaining a price target of $22.75 for July 16th, and 35 by end of 2022. Remember this follows a healthy sustainable climb to 35. What I would like to see this coming week is a pull back on the overall short interest. Less net shorting = more buying pressure. Again, as I have previously mentioned we prefer short volumes to be less than 50% of trading volume.

Last week, a member of the community asked the following:

Why doesn't iStar mark the real value of their subsidiary SAFE on their books? Ask yourself, would you want to realize gains and pay taxes. Best to keep them unrealized as long as possible. In the case of iStar Financial, they are an REIT. Which comes with special tax perks in a way.

When they have income they have two options. Either they have to pay taxes on the income or distribute dividends. They need to distribute at least 90% of their income and be taxed on the rest they decided to keep to be pushed into working capital.

This same member asked for a valuation of iSTAR without SAFE. Now the company itself values its operations around $12 without SAFE. I don't share that same valuation, for a number of reasons regarding the current commercial real estate market. I discount their operations to $10 at best. Now, that isn't to say there is a lot of potential. But realizing potential isn't cheap either. If they wanted to get Grand Vista out of the mothballs that will require taking on more debt. But, I also think now is the best time to realize the potential of Grand Vista. Which is a 10 billion dollar book of business if it ever gets realized. Unfortunately, iStar will not be able to look into that potential until the end of 2021.

iStar Financial - Safe Subsidiary - Ground Leasing

How does Ground Leasing work? Below is a quick intro into how it works and why businesses actually prefer this setup.

Disclosure: None of the photos below are to be regarded as ""properties"" of SAFE. They are merely examples to help illustrate Ground Leasing.

Below you have a hotel. Now let us say the property as a whole is worth $100 million dollars. What parts of the property are driving revenue? The actual building and it amenities, the land underneath the property isn't. However, the land itself is worth 40 million. With ground leasing through SAFE, the hotel owner sells the land to SAFE, which then leases the land back to the hotel owner. This lease will follow whoever purchases the building in the future.

Now that the hotel owner has separated the hotel and the land and gotten paid for the land already. If the owner ever wanted to sell the property, it's now much easier to find a suitor for a 60 million dollar property than it would be for a 100 million property. There are tax incentives obviously of being able to sell a property without the land. Tax laws vary state to state. However, one can avoid paying real estate transfer taxes in some.

# The basics

Virgin Galactic is a space travel company founded by **Richard Branson** and his Virgin Group.

It is developing commercial aircraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflight to space tourists.

Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004.

On Monday, October 28, 2019, Virgin Galactic was listed by SPAC on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker symbol 'SPCE.'

After its IPO, it was viral among retail investors, and us, the diamond hands retard cartel.

Market cap: $13.458​B(YahooFinance)

Share price:$55.91

Shares outstanding:240.71M

Virgin Galactic's float shares / outstanding is 64.2%(Finbox).

# Management

**Michael Colglazier, CEO**

He graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and holds a Master's in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Before joining Virgin Galactic in 2020, Michael served as President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International. Previously, he was the President of The Disneyland Resort in Southern California. Michael had an extensive career at Disney spanning over 30 years.

# Collaborations

**Nasa**\- they signed an agreement to develop a ""private orbital astronaut readiness program.""

**Boom technology:** Virgin Galactic and the Virgin Group collaborate with Boom Technology to create a supersonic passenger transporter, a successor to Concord.

**OneWeb** satellite internet access provider- Virgin announced an investment into the OneWeb satellite constellation providing the world Internet access service of WorldVu.

**Under Armour**\- Virgin Galactic announced a partnership with Under Armour to fabricate space suits for passengers and pilots of SpaceShipTwo.

# Products/projects and property

Virgin Galactic uses a reusable **SpaceShipTwo** spaceflight system – consisting of **WhiteKnightTwo**, a custom-built carrier aircraft, and SpaceShipTwo, the world's first passenger-carrying spaceship. They also use an unscrewed launcher vehicle called **LauncherOne**.

The three-day Virgin Galactic Experience costs *$250,000* per person and includes all training, required clothing, accommodation, food, and beverages. Seven hundred people have already booked their place in space. Virgin also hopes to offer space flights from multiple locations eventually.

FAA **Full commercial Launch license**

The approval followed a test flight on May 22. After the news, the stock price fucking flew and woke me up in the middle of the night, rising 39%, surpassing the $55 threshold.

The company is also planning more test flights in the summer months.

# Financials

The full-year 2020(vs. 2019)-all numbers in millions of $:

Revenue: $0.238($3.781)

R&D: $158.757($132.873)

Total Expenses: $295($275)

Cash on Hand: $679($493)

Biggest shareholders:

Sir Richard Branson 56,819,260 23.6%

The Social+Capital Partnership LLC 15,750,000 6.54%

Mubadala Investment Co. PJSC 11,804,836 4.90%

# Competition

Private competitors include:

**Blue Origin(founded by Jeff Bezos)**

**SpaceX(founded by Elon Musk)**

Both companies have made incredible strides in space travel.

# My thoughts

I believe that Virgin Galactic has enormous upside potential, especially in the coming months because of the upcoming test flights. If all tests turn out successful, we can expect a steep rise in share price.

Assuming everything with the tests will go successfully, the first commercial space flight will be scheduled. That event significantly spikes my interest because it will send the stock to the moon and beyond if it goes favorably.

And there's the dark side. A test failure will lower the price, of course, but if the first commercial flight goes terribly wrong, then the shares will be fucking gone.

# TLDR

Great company, excellent management, huge potential.

This is my due diligence before my first trade ever! I hope to get some feedback about the DD and some opinions about SPCE from you guys before I ultimately make my move."

2021-06-28 06:18:21,wallstreetbets,"SPCE should be at least an $8bn business by 2026, based on £600k per seat, 6 global spaceports, starting commercial operation in New Mexico in 2022, and expanding to another 5 sites by 2026. Italy, Sweden, UAE already in discussion, with Asia and Australia likely candidates. 

There is no real competition with X or BO, which are different experiences, comfort levels and price points. Every space tourism company will have an endless line of customers. There are 1.5 million high net worth individuals in the US, never mind the millions globally. Everybody wins in space!

Given that growth businesses operate at a 10-20 times multiple, that would put the 2026 stock price between $350-700 on a conservative outlook. Today it's a bargain at $55. It is a fantastic long term and short term play! 

It's the Tesla of space tourism and should rocket at each big step in the next couple of months. I expect SPCE to hit around 80-100 sometime this year.

Go SPCE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🤑🤑🤑"

2021-06-28 01:45:21,wallstreetbets,"I think you should include Axiom space and Sierra Nevada Corp (Dream Chaser) to your competitors. Axiom is contracting crew dragon flights from SpaceX, and working on building their own space station for tourism. Dream Chaser is probably about 5 years away from orbital space tourism. Once orbital tourism is readily available I doubt the price/demand ratio works out to sustainable suborbital tourism, but I guess time will tell."

I think it will be a week or so after, before Bezos goes up, but I do not think Branson will be on it. VG has a test plan, and I think they stick to it, and that Branson goes up 2-4 weeks after this first next flight. (Again, though, the exact timeframe has NOT been published.) after Friday's run up, I expect a dip on little-to-no updates this week. I hope to use that dip to buy a few OTM calls for the end of July and a few for August. I wouldn't buy earlier than that. IV will plummet if they don't fly/announce soon enough and you could easily get caught with your shorts around your ankles.

But if it doesn't dip, and it just keeps rising and they announce and all is glorious, well, I still have plenty of shares and ITM calls to make me very happy."

2021-06-28 01:57:22,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair. I still think tourist demand for VG will be much greater than for SpaceX. Also VG will have more flights for tourism anyway. SpaceX seems more bent on satellite launches/moon or Mars missions than just sending people to space for fun.

2021-06-28 02:10:09,wallstreetbets,"Really it's just something to add to the long term risk side of things. Say Axiom finished their space station as Starship gets it's human rating, and Axiom is ferrying 50 people up to an orbital hotel for 2 week stays, that's going to seriously undermine demand for VG. 

Set aside that, I have serious questions about the actual launch cadence for VG, because their liquid/solid hybrid engine is going to have a far longer turnaround time and less performance than a pure liquid engine, and is more complex than a pure solid engine (and probably longer turnaround too). It may fit their needs, but I truly wonder what their launch cadence will be running at operational speed."
2021-06-28 02:47:26,wallstreetbets,"Ya I can see your point now. 

Time will tell more about the abilities of VG. Either way I love space and I’m excited for the futures of all of these companies"
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It's Time For $NNDM To Shine I originally posted a DD ON $NNDM back on April 30th. If you had bought Nano Dimension on that day, you'd be up 23% right now. If you would have caught the bottom in Mid-may, you'd be up over 58%.

Here's the same DD, with updated information.

Think you missed it? No. I think this stock has room to run further. Here's why:

&#x200B;

Nano Dimension $NNDM

Company Description (From their website)

Nano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.

**Where They Can Sell**

In several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. 

In March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station. 

In May, the company sold one of their machines to the University of Quebec.

**Customers**

Nano Dimension recently posted their June 2021 Investors Presentation.

Samsung, Nvidia, Elon Musk's Neuralink to name a few of their customers.

&#x200B;

**Cathie Wood**

She is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\* as of 6/27/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.

ARKQ (7,644,621 Shares)

ARKW (7,630,616 Shares)

IZRL (733,585 Shares)

PRNT (198,291 Shares)

**Revenue**

It's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.

In 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.

In pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.

Most recently, they released Q1 2021 Earnings. They reported revenue of $811,000 in the first quarter and a net loss of $9,314,000. 

*""Wow they are losing a lot of money!""*

***-->  The Company ended the quarter with a cash and deposits balance of $1,471,014,000 (including short and long-term unrestricted bank deposits) <--***

\*As stated on their most recent earnings call, no guidance was given\*

**Cash on hand**

Every time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION

(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)

Yes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.

To put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.

**Acquisitions**

The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)

So far, they've acquired two companies this year (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)

DeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)

NanoFabrica (3D Printing - \*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\~$59 Million TOTAL - \~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \*The final numbers are not confirmed\*

So they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.

Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.

Type A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!

Type B - Technologies they think their machines need

Type C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.

**Unusual Option Activity**

Specifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.

July 16th Options (\*As of 6/27/21) \*This stock has had HEAVY volume on $10 July 16th calls almost the entire week of June 21st-25th trading week.

$7.50 - 11,820 Open Interest

$10.00 - 39,978 Open Interest

$12.50 - 18,114 Open Interest

Should also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.

$7.50 PUT - 6,732 Open Interest

**Stock Activity**

This stock, as well as other growth stocks, seem to be gaining steam again, and momentum looks to be back. Do with that as you please.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

* News related to new customers/partnerships/sales, including with their 2 new recently acquired companies, NanoFabrica & DeepCube
* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release in the near-future
* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 this year - The CEO on their May earnings call said starting in June they can tour facilities - they couldn't before because of COVID)

**Video With More Information**

Quick 15 minute video with the CEO, Yoav Stern.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY)

**The Negatives**

* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%)
* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash

TL;DR - This company has a bunch of cash (1.4 billion), has some futuristic technology, and can literally buy out their competition or buy companies that'll help them (which they are doing)

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DIY Sentiment Investing - Beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception. Last week's numbers and positions: Hey guys! There’ve been a lot of phenomenal sentiment trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach — what I did was create one that focuses just one what people in this sub are saying. I’ve created my own sentiment analyzer, and have been investing in it for more than a year now. If you want to take a crack at using it yourself, here’s the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).

# The Important Stuff

Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, BUZZ, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when BUZZ came out), compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.**

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \*\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF\*\*. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction. 

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

# How is sentiment calculated?

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \*\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”\*\* I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

2021-06-28 08:58:06,wallstreetbets,"That sounds exactly like a UWMC comment, a stock which stays sideways."
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC is setting up for the mother of all breakouts 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 mini DD With the recent rumours of Comcast M&A and the breakout that happened on Friday plus the options activity, I really think it's good time to get in the train of $VIAC, from Fundamental point of view the stock is perfect, and technically also it looks perfect right now. 

My favourite fact in the whole market right now is that VIAC is in the same business as NFLX,  has a comparable Library of content and has roughly the same annual revenue and profitability, but trade at 1/7 of the Price/Earnings ratio and 1/8 of the Price/Sales ratio of NFLX.

The book value per share of VIAC right now is 29.69$ so in the worst case scenario we can assume that the price won't go below 30$ which I think will not happen unless we have a financial crisis. In my opinion the price won't drop below 40$ again this year and if it drops to this price I will definitely YOLO all my portfolio into VIAC.

Growth is coming for VIAC, and what makes the things more interesting, VIAC is an attractive target for big whales, and any day soon we may here M&A news.

Finally I really believe that VIAC is undervalued in an overvalued market, and it has more room for growth with Paramount+ than its competitors, IMO in a normal market the price have to be 70$ but in this overvalued market it should be at least 100$

In the comments also I will add a link to a small comparison between VIAC streaming revenue and ROKU total revenue.

Market cap:

VIAC 28$B 🤯

ROKU 57$B

NFLX 223$B

TL;DR VIAC has just started to move and it is setting up for the mother of all breakouts, options volume confirms this, to the moon sooner or later 🚀🚀🌕🤞💰💰

I already started my position in the last dip, 100 share at 40.30$ and my exit price is 80.60$ and probably 100$ if the momentum will be high.

This is not a financial advice."

Also they own MTV cable network and CBS which deliver survivor and the challenge as their top reality shows.

With Pluto they can run free AVOD streaming of their content.

They also have paramount pictures and make a ton of movies. snake eyes next month, mission possible, transformers, teenage mutant ninja turtles. They have sold two movies during covid just to Amazon for hundreds of millions of dollars. 

They are so under valued because of the late redstone that passed away and the daughter has taken the rains and helped merged both cbs and viacom and owns the voting rights. She has out some top talent into content, they just re-organized some more this week.

Viac makes its money in traditional channels like cable tv, movie theaters but is shifting over to be  much more in streaming —- partnering and selling content to players like Netflix, Amazon, Apple,  but also through its own subscription services - Paramount +, Showtime and Epix.

On top of those it had free/ad streaming Pluto which is the industry leader in free streaming and growing very fast.

Buying calls means you’re also bullish on an overvalued market short-term.  Just because it’s a ridiculously undervalued stock doesn’t mean it’ll jump overnight.

At least shares don’t expire, and these pay a dividend."
2021-06-27 20:34:21,wallstreetbets,Did you buy VIAC leaps at a 2 year expiration break even price $10 lower than the company fair value or most price targets?
2021-06-27 20:28:45,wallstreetbets,was the 8K all leaps?
2021-06-27 23:40:14,wallstreetbets,"According to your post history - No, you lost 8 grand on FD’s. That isn’t what this person is suggesting."
2021-06-28 08:01:20,wallstreetbets,Try the Comedy Central roasts
2021-06-28 08:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Yep, more competition in streaming puts pressure on content prices"
2021-06-27 20:13:34,wallstreetbets,"Surprisingly, those numbers are better than cash-rich, $2T Apple.

1.78 is fantastic.

Some debt, especially in the low interest rate environment we’ve been in for years, is to be expected.

They’ll be able to pay off even more after closing on Simon Schuster for over $2B (I don’t think that happened yet); also trying to sell Black Rock building for $1B.  If they use these proceeds to pay down more debt, they could have one of the cleanest balance sheets around.

Great job of losing the post-merger weight."
2021-06-27 20:37:45,wallstreetbets,"This is really an understated topic. I noticed the debt drop for Q1. 

The 3 billion in shares sales too was really helpful to help launch P+.

With the feds not messing with rates to inflate out of their own debt, they can really get the cash flow going with stream and advertising migration between network , cable tv, and stream."
2021-06-28 02:46:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks for debt work.  Had seen bear reports about debt.  But his give a bit of nice colour on VIAC change
2021-06-28 00:31:09,wallstreetbets,Ah.... Patience is what your looking for.
2021-06-28 08:08:11,wallstreetbets,Raised 3B in March at $85. PE to S&P is what versus historical?  This should see a 15-20 PE on $4-6 in EPS imo
2021-06-27 20:36:18,wallstreetbets,No…it was short term play. I bought short term calls as a earnings play for a no name propane company based on some post on Reddit. I’m not joking either…
2021-06-27 23:44:05,wallstreetbets,I’m aware of the difference. I’m not saying that buying LEAPs are bad…I would buy it too if I had more money…but I also am just staying away from buying options for a little. I also enjoy selling premium against VIAC through spreads.
2021-06-28 08:34:29,wallstreetbets,Not NFL or NCAA
2021-06-28 08:35:41,wallstreetbets,Prices or asset valuations?  I like the p+ lineup
2021-06-28 11:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Cashed in some meme stock status, company was going downhill, they just have more money to lose. Fundamentals are not there, having said that it’s up 6% it takes a while for fundamental to catch up."
2021-06-27 20:58:40,wallstreetbets,Its Wall Street Bets. No one assumed you were joking. ;)
2021-06-27 23:29:43,wallstreetbets,Friendly piece of advice don’t hold options through an earnings report unless you are using some type of advanced strategy or they expire at least a month in the future. Implied volatility is part of the price of the option and it always goes down significantly after earnings so even if the stock price moves the direction you want it to you can still lose. It is just not a good risk/reward trade and there are plenty of trades in the market every day that are good risk/reward so no reason to put the odds against you.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Possible Bull Run for NKLA So I hope this post does not get removed Like my old post. Besides that Mods have Mercy on Me. 

Now considering that NKLA short float is 32.4% and has formed a Cup & Handle Patten.

&#x200B;

[I'm not lying look at the chart.](https://preview.redd.it/hchsand8cv771.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c18861f175978953aa9713724a06865e160ee5d)

We could see a possible run up to 24 and more so In my opinion This stock is a good short term and long term buy.

Considering it invested  $50 million In Clean Hydrogen Energy shows that it is serious about Hydrogen Based Fuel. 

So this is far from financial advice and always do your own research. Also give advice since im a Noob and just giving out my thoughts with some Evidence to make a DD. (my calls are 7/9 21$ call.) so with this one I say adios :)"

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bullish news for TSLA? Panasonic sold $4b TSLA in March 2021. So, I’m just reading about Panasonic’s completion of selling its TSLA stake for almost $4b. It seems like this was reported Friday and the sales concluded in March. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/panasonic-sells-its-stake-in-tesla-for-nearly-4-billion-report-11624588939?mod=mw_quote_news

$4b is a ton of selling to do, and I’m wondering if that artificially depressed TSLA’s stock during March. And if we are seeing a bounce back now that the selling pressure is gone…

Overall, I am bearish on TSLA for multiple reasons, but for folks who are bullish on TSLA, I think getting that $4b sale absorbed and in the rear view mirror would be a good thing for TSLA stockholders. And it means a lot of the selling pressure in March wasn’t really price discovery and speculators, but a major corporate shareholder exiting its position. 

Thoughts? Is this at all anything that matters? Or in the face of a $650B market cap, does a $4b sale not make a difference?"
2021-06-28 02:19:27,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I have said before I believe there was a lot of shareholder rotation with Tesla the last few months, primarily a result of its incredible performance the prior year. Whether, companies like Panasonic who had business reasons for divesting, or people needing to diversify, or just taking some profits. As that supply dies down, you have more demand for the stock hence it goes up. My guess is that Tesla stock can possibly run a bit before it goes high enough that selling picks up."
2021-06-27 22:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, bullish for the giant TSLA. TSLA will do more with batteries in the next 5 years than Panasonic has done in the last 15 years.

Also, ignore the crap on ""Chinese TSLA recalls"" TSLA does not do ""recalls"" they do over the air upgrades. China probably has interests targeted towards stealing TSLA IP if not Chinese mfg. plants.

You might get some dips. Those are buy opportunities."
2021-06-28 01:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is insanely overvalued IMO. It will either see a major correction, or spend years, possibly even a decade, to catch up to its current valuation. Walmart experienced a similar situation and it took twelve years to catch up to its high valuation."
2021-06-28 08:38:48,wallstreetbets,You want to be rich? It's easy. Buy TSLA and hold. That's it.

2021-06-27 21:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Vw said everyone is about five years behind Tesla. The Tesla doubters just don’t get it. I would explain, but it’s all easily findable. If you don’t want to understand, I’m not gonna force it. Go ahead and short it, me and other stockholders will keep enjoying the squeezes. 

Outside a major market correction, Tesla is going to be a multi trillion company."
2021-06-28 02:50:36,wallstreetbets,"I think that the problem is that people are assuming that they are going to own the EV space and that's just not realistic.

EVs becoming ubiquitous is bad for Tesla.  It means that they have to compete with real car companies.  They no longer get to own  this niche space, because it will become mainstream.  They will get crushed.

In 10 years everyone will be driving EVs but they will be made by Ford and Toyota and VW, just like they make all the cars now."
2021-06-28 11:39:51,wallstreetbets,"Even if it was true (there aren’t any other reports?) All that shit gets covered under warranty and the majority of Tesla vehicles are still in warranty. For autopilot phantom braking, this is a consequence of using sensors beyond just cameras. Once v9 beta fsd is pushed, Elon specifically says that issue is resolved. Also lol @ rest of your post, straight up lies."
2021-06-28 09:02:58,wallstreetbets,"So this means you think TSLA stock still has that much room to grow when it’s valuation is pegged to something like 50x it’s “best case”
2025 earnings? 

Basically that it will be a $3T market cap (or more) auto manufacturer? 

Or is it other business lines that will make that growth happen?"

2021-06-28 09:51:19,wallstreetbets,"VW never said they were 5 years behind tesla. It was some random WSJ journalist’s opinion after he test drove vw’s EV. 

I’m invested in tesla but you posting fake news isn’t going to help your cause or get your point across those who disagree."
2021-06-28 02:47:33,wallstreetbets,"This was painful to read.

What makes you think it competes with Amazon or Microsoft? 

What about a car company (which they are at the moment) makes you think they’ll go multiple x on the current price.

When the ceo himself states that the stock price can fall badly if they have a bad quarter.

You know Elon isn’t interested in you right? He’s just another billionaire."

2021-06-28 11:36:51,wallstreetbets,"You know how some oem PCs say “Intel Inside”? Well, soon enough Tesla could simply opt to sell powertrains and batteries themselves. Once their own needs are met ofc. “Tesla Inside” makes money too. Just ask Toyota and their old RAV4 which was a Tesla collabo."
2021-06-27 20:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Probably, i dont really see why this is relevant thought.

Here they aim to pass Tesla in 2025. I do recall seeing news about him saying everyone was years behind Tesla but can’t find it right now. 

If you dive deep enough into the company, past the fud, you’ll see why some big names are heavily invested."
2021-06-28 09:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Where did I say anything about Elon caring for me? Or me even liking Elon? 

If you want somewhere to start, go look up people that have dived deep into Tesla. Ron Barron or Cathie wood’s ark team for example."
2021-06-28 02:59:03,wallstreetbets,"I had a separate thread about this yesterday , I guess mods removed it. Was about this fake news against tesla. Any why was this termed as a recall when it only a software update like an IOS/App update."
2021-06-28 11:41:21,wallstreetbets,Plenty of FUD makes the news. Doesn’t mean you should parrot it.
2021-06-27 23:12:01,wallstreetbets,SPCE is SHIT that English prick couldn’t even get a balloon to do what he wanted. Now you think that clown will compete with Elon? Space will be on its way back to $17 pump and dump. They don’t even have a good vehicle it’s garbage.
2021-06-27 22:38:19,wallstreetbets,I know a lot of folks who say that about the cybertruck as well. But to each his own. I won’t be buying either one. But many will.
2021-06-28 07:56:37,wallstreetbets,"I hope they get harder to meet over time. But I feel like now that all the automakers have seen the light (like antilock brakes or fuel injection) there is no turning back. EVs will be the dominant vehicle in 10-20 years. So I don’t see those credits being only something TSLA can sell. Shit, if I was Ford, I’d spin off the EV business and sell its own EV credits back to legacy Ford and cut TSLA right out of it. And other automakers could do that too. But the credit sales are a profitable thing while it lasts (like selling AOL internet before folks just got regular ISPs)"
2021-06-28 12:04:32,wallstreetbets,"1) Not everyone takes 500 mile road trips. 

2) Your thesis on TSLA is that they alone can make.m a battery and power a car? (I remember when Motorola and BlackBerry ruled the earth with cell phones. And then the competition arrived and destroyed them. Same with IBM, etc… first to market is a tricky game in tech. It pays off with Facebook, Amazon, and the Apple ecosystem where it is hard to migrate elsewhere, but auto buyers can and will buy the best vehicle for their needs.)

I don’t know if that’s how we get to a $1T-2T market cap for TSLA…"
2021-06-28 11:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah looks like VW does see themselves behind tesla in the game. Color me surprised they would admit that, but I guess it goes to show just how far ahead tesla is."
2021-06-28 13:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Maby, maby not. This is one of the biggest newspapers here, and there are dozen of big (car) news telling the same. Im just ""parrot"" the news whats probetly not in your news. I would like to know as much of a stock as possible if im doing DD. What you do with it is up to you. Call it fud, ignore it or something else, thats your call.

Im not pro or against Tesla."
2021-06-28 02:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Vehicle to grid is a gimmick. You drain your truck battery when powering the house and when driving your truck your food in the fridge goes bad.

A solar roof + powerwall makes a lot more sense. If the combination is too expensive, then just a home battery makes more sense. You can use the savings getting a CyberTruck over the F-150 Lightning to pay for that home battery too."
2021-06-28 11:31:59,wallstreetbets,Where will Ford find enough batteries for all the trucks they want to build?
2021-06-28 12:46:57,wallstreetbets,"1) It seems generally dumb to produce cars that cannot travel. Even cheap gas cars always could. That’s how you turn a Leaf owner into a Tesla owner over time IMHO (“I love the feel of the electric motors in my Leaf, but I wish I could get out of my city!”).

2) My thesis is that the best, cheapest production costs for batteries will be the key to the game. Anybody can throw a computer in a car, but making a BMS behave better than the next guy is a real arms race. If someone comes up with amazing batteries, they still get sold for a premium. That’s why I am concerned that many auto companies may end up at a discouraging price point per vehicle - battery costs.

The feel of the wheel seals the deal, and it’s obvious now that electric propulsion feels more fun - even a Leaf gives you electric joy like a go-kart. Same feeling in a Tesla, only more powerful.

Have a great day!"
2021-06-28 12:05:53,wallstreetbets,I forgot. They can’t. Only TSLA can make batteries… /s
2021-06-28 12:56:35,wallstreetbets,I agree with you that #2 will be a huge key to who prevails. Battery costs and durability are the new fuel efficiency standard.
2021-06-28 12:37:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this sub still thinks 4680 isn’t coming because Panasonic doesn’t have it in production today. Ignore Tesla’s own in-house battery production at your peril. Tesla invented the 4680, and said they would buy as many high quality cells based on that form factor as the world can get them, *in addition* to their own supply."

2021-06-28 02:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Anyone still bullish on the markets, I implore you to look at 2 very simple charts/statistics.

The current S&P Shiller P/E ratio compared to the historical average and what the market does every time the Shiller P/E ratio has surpassed 30 (hint crashed from 20-89%).

Zoom out to a 20 year chart of the S&P 500. It's absolutely frightening where we are at and this is 100% a blow-off top we are experiencing. We will selloff to under 200 before rising to maybe the 250 range for SPY.

You want the next 10 bagger play? Here it is. SPY puts expiring somewhere in the next 6-12 months with a strike around 340/350. When the easy monetary goes bye bye (it will soon as CPI#s continue to blast off until fed is forced to taper fast), market is going down faster than a boulder tied to your nutsack. Thank me later, cause this ship is going down faster than the titanic. We are the most margin heavy market in history with all these newbies who don't know what they're doing in the markets. When the market actually starts selling, it's going to be the quickest domino effect you've ever seen."

One day at lunch in high school I had a woopie cushion. I don't remember why. My friends and I thought it would be funny to use it on one of the girls that sat with us. She was a friend (genuinely a friend, wasn't sexually interested, not that I could get it then anyway). I sat next to her. When she was sitting down I put the cushion under her but moved too slowly. She sat on my hand. She was mad at me for like a day then got over it. The end."

According to you, it would seem that a bunch of people spamming an author's work constitutes a banable offense for the author even when they had absolutely no involvement in the spamming of the work itself. That's obviously moronic so I'd be very interested to learn what your angle is here.

Seems a little dangerous if you ask me. The SEC most assuredly is always looking for clues to the actual identities of moderators of this sub. I wouldn't be in a hurry to draw more attention to myself if I were you. Particularly if you're actually working in the financial industry."

2021-06-27 20:14:35,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is very unlikely to catch up to their valuation with Space Tourism.  A niche service, likely to only be enjoyed once or twice, offered to a high-end customer is rarely going to be a money making operation.

The only avenue I see for them is to figure out Exo-atmospheric Terrestrial travel.  Leaving the atmosphere can make for some insanely fast travel ( As we see with the ISS and ICBMs that can travel faster than 15000 mph ).  Being able to fly from DC to Japan in the time it takes to fly from DC to Vegas ( or less ) would be incredibly appealing to wealthy, business class, and everyday vacationers alike, which would ( should ) allow them to push costs down to an acceptable level.

I don't know if this is their ultimate plan ( if it isn't, I have no idea how they intend to actually make money ), but that still seems like a ways out and there's some first-mover risk of dumping a lot of capital to figure out all the gotchas, only to later allow latecomers to benefit from your efforts and surpass you with healthier balance sheets.

I'm neutral on SPCE and have no dog in the race for now, but just wanted to point out that space tourism isn't likely to be the cash cow you might think.  Proceed with caution, but best of luck!"

2021-06-27 20:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Sure, if you can tell me what it is that I am trying to shill for.

The fact of the matter is that a screen shot of the ban lists an organized brigadiering effort from a sub that he is not posting on as the underlying reason. Even if some overzealous traders had waded into brigadiering territory from that sub, that does not mean that the author is then guilty by association. The reason for the ban clearly exposes the fact that it is unfounded in reality. The DD was all posted to another popular sub which was not named in the ban reason. The spam was coming from a much smaller sub that exists only for that ticker and that the author doesn't even contribute to.

All of that can be proven. Where's the proof of your accusation against me, ape? Or is your brain so smooth that you didn't understand that's how it works?"

2021-06-28 01:18:05,wallstreetbets,Airbus is the only major airplane manufacturer whose planes actually fly. Its a move so obvious idk why nobody is seeing it
2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why NIO will be the next “Apple” and the leader of EV’s. - EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.
-Best customer service in the world… Wether its at the NIO houses, or providing a utility vehicle if you ever get stranded, NIO wins.
-Building an “Industrial Park” to ramp production to all new levels and have their part manufacturing done right next door.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I’ll throw a 🚀 cuz I know this is WSB 🦍

ALSO: WKHS needs more attention and legitimate diamond hands. Naked shorting, 40-60% SI, fundamentals, and an electric fleet contract stolen from them by under the table money (to a 90% hybrid company that doesnt make engines) I don’t want your support, I want your oath… we need to send the horse to the moon."

2021-06-28 09:16:47,wallstreetbets,"Battery swapping sounds good until you have to think about it critically.

First of all, it means you have to build many more packs than you do cars. And packs are both the most expensive part as well as the limiting factor in terms of how many vehicles you can build. Many people are cell limited. So you can build 100k cars with 100k packs, or you can build 30k cars with 100k packs to support swapping.

It means that the pack you do end up building is going to be a 'sack of potatoes' kind of pack. It won't bear any structural load and ends up being carried around like cargo. Or you could build your pack to bear a structural load and let you save a significant amount of weight. Enough to have a large impact on performance and range.

And also NIO didn't pioneer that tech. Tesla demo'd it on a trio of model S's years ago and did a presentation showing they could swap 2 packs in the time it took to fill up something like a BMW 7 series. And they decided not to because Tesla's got the big brains. Just like not using LIDAR for self driving."

2021-06-28 09:56:06,wallstreetbets,"NIO life is a t-shirt business (also cookies?). Carmakers usually sell t-shirts. Many have companion apps as well. NIO house website offers... coffee. 
Aaaaand Nio isn't attacking anything. It's a niche premium brand with 100k cars sold total, and about 8k this month. As a reality check, VW sold 9.3 million cars in 2020 total, and plans to sell 450k EVs this year. Yes, AAPL sells iPhones for 1k, 57 million of them 1st Q 2021 alone. NIO needs to seriously step up their game to reach these revenue numbers, but since they only have expensive cars, how do they scale rich people? It's not like half of China can afford a 80k car all of a sudden. I hold Nio shares, by the way."

2021-06-28 07:46:20,wallstreetbets,First car they build was a premium one. With those profits make an affordable one. Business strategy and model are pretty similar.

2021-06-28 12:37:54,wallstreetbets,I think NIO gets ... Africa.
2021-06-28 11:16:06,wallstreetbets,I dont get how americans can think getting back production jobs will actually benefit them. Without significant automation there is no way they can bring down the proces of goods which would be produced here in usa. Dollar has higher value than most currencies in asia. Which means paying less to get production done is more feasible for a company if they move to asian countries.
2021-06-27 23:01:58,wallstreetbets,So when does your boy Mango get reinstated? How’s Q?
2021-06-27 20:41:56,wallstreetbets,That must be why all those other companies spend so much time assembling their cars compared to Tesla

2021-06-28 17:02:42,wallstreetbets,Employers wont really care about that. They care about making more bucks. If they did really care about american families so much we wouldnt have lost so many jobs so far
2021-06-28 17:07:14,wallstreetbets,Also you cant really well pay american ppl. Lets say iphones cost us 1000$ to get it assembled in china. Chinese probably get paid enough for them to get by month on month with their money. If that moved to america then americans will get paid minimum wage for assembling phones to keep the cost low. So newer made in america iphones would probably cost more than 3000$. Dont ask me why 3000$ dollars. Its just a figure to give you an idea. But i can garuntee you that the phone would cost more and employees would still get minimum wage. Only way to fix this would be to improve automation so less number of ppl need to be emplyed here while keeping the increase in phone cost much lower

2) the impeachment would hinge on connecting fraud to Biden and Harris. If that occured, this would only be as difficult as getting republicans to stop being democrats (meaning this is the hardest part, and why I'm pessimistic)

3) president - > vice president - > speaker.  This is literally the easiest part if everything above happened.

Yet you have the audacity to call others clowns or disconnected from reality? You can't even believe that a pillow is good because the TV told you the guy who sells them is politically wrong.  I can't even begin to comprehend how you think anything you have said puts you in a positive light. 

I can at least explain and support what I believe, as I have already. Something you clearly can't as you have had ample time to do so.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"INOVIO’s TIME is at hand—pay if forward! &#x200B;

📷**INO Cheering**

As I have often said, I’ve never seen a stock with such potential, which is why I’ve held on and put every dollar of discretionary income I had into increasing my position in INOVIO stock.

I remember back in September or October when I was so upset, and the pps was about $15. Someone encouraged me to sell—my own fault—since he said the pps could go to $9. I thought he was crazy, so I bought back 12,000 of my 15,000 sold shares for more money and just held on, adding whenever I could. Looking back now, I can see that, while nearly impossible to take, the grotesque decline in share price has allowed me to acquire what could be 30,000 shares by tomorrow night, with 4000 of those being in $50 strike price, January 2022 puts, I have sold since late summer of last year.

When the pps went up to $33+ one year ago, almost exactly, I only had 9000 shares, but my account value was over $300,000. Sadly I didn’t take any off the table then and saw my account decrease by $200,000 to a low of just over $100,000, even though I had continued to dump in thousands of dollars. But, the joke was not on me, I believe. Many of you have tens of thousands of shares now, and for me every ten cents this stock increases, my holdings go up $3,000—and $30,000 for every dollar. As far as I can ascertain, my average is now about $12. Still not there but overtaking that number seems more than possible this week. The astronomical gains in account value which are on the horizon would not be possible if the June 2020 price of $33 had sustained. I may have only had 15,000 shares now. Still, I’m NOT happy to have endured this horrid year, financially, as many of you would agree, especially when nearly every other stock in the market grew exponentially.

But this is Inovio’s time—I know it. Will we be at $50 in July? I have no idea, but it is certainly possible.

I may sell some of my shares when we pop over $33—but only so I can make a significant donation to the Stephen Siller Tunnel2Towers Foundation, which provides smart homes for our catastrophically wounded soldiers and pays off the mortgages for the families of our fallen first responders. Started by his brothers, the foundation was named in honor of Firefighter Stephen Siller. On September 11, 2001, Stephen, who was assigned to Brooklyn’s Squad 1, had just finished his shift and was on his way to play golf with his brothers when he got word over his scanner of a plane hitting the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Stephen called his wife Sally and asked her to tell his brothers that he would catch up with them later. He returned to Squad 1 to get his gear and then drove his truck to the entrance of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, but it had already been closed for security purposes. Determined to carry out his duty, he strapped 60 pounds of gear to his back and raced on foot through the tunnel to the Twin Towers, where he gave up his life while saving others. Stephen left a wife and five children.

I have donated $50 a month for several years and recently increased this amount $100. For a $50 a month donation, the foundation asks if donors would consider adding a dollar for administrative costs, so 100% of the donation can go directly to helping the recipients of their largesse. THIS IS UNHEARD OF in the industry. I encourage all of you to consider donating to this fantastically worthy cause. Even $11 or $22 a month can make the biggest difference in the lives of those who sacrificed so much to keep us safe.

Investing is not only a numbers game. I believe that donating and sharing, while not done for personal gain, typically always comes back to the giver many fold and opens universal channels of abundance. It’s KARMA—GOOD Karma, and it’s time for INOVIO investors to enjoy it. We have held on not just for money; many of us, if not most, have held because we believe in a company working indefatigably to save the world from the most horrendous pandemic in over a hundred year, in a company desperately trying to cure cancer… Poppy

If this ever even gets on the market, it will be way too late to have much impact when so many other major players have an enormous head start...and every day those companies are getting more and more data about the safety and efficacy of their products.  INO is still limping towards Phase 3.

Volume, the inevitability of the hedgies covering their shorts, and the practical moves of the company itself. And just the history of the stock YTD.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fisker ($FSR) and Canoo ($GOEV), Their Discrepancy in Value, and Suspicious Canoo Price Action \*This DD serves as mainly a bull case for Canoo and is not intended to be a bear case for Fisker.

**Introduction:**

Fisker and Canoo are both EV companies that completed mergers with special purpose acquisition companies to go public and immediately gain access to capital. This was the route of choice for many other EV companies as well, since the automotive business is naturally capital intensive and this was the quickest avenue for them to get funding. I chose to compare Fisker with Canoo because they are both **legitimate** EV startups on similar timelines, and were compatible for comparable company analysis. 

**Current Valuations:**

Fisker has 295.24 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $19.30 is valued at **$5.7 billion**.

Canoo has 237.5 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $9.67 is valued at **$2.3 billion**.

**Models:**

&#x200B;

[Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle](https://preview.redd.it/bbz3ywca6u771.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d77153f52d1d954f8c3660306e92a21ada8999f)

[Fisker's Ocean SUV](https://preview.redd.it/piv2ehs05u771.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e23371f0deedde93db66e98cf08c94a364f2efb)


These are the two models Fisker and Canoo chose to begin production with. Clearly Fisker's Ocean SUV looks like something we are used to while Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle is a modern/reinvented minivan. The most used bear case against Canoo is the bold design of the minivan. However, what is overlooked is that the fully electric minvan market is **100% untapped** and Canoo is the only EV maker with plans to release one. Fisker's SUV is nice, but the electric SUV market is going to be one of the most competitive in the industry, with Tesla already having the Model X and Model Y, GM releasing it's electric Bolt SUV, and Ford releasing the Mach-E SUV. Canoo will have **no direct competitors** with their Lifestyle Vehicle. While it has a bold design, it's extra interior space will make it desirable regardless of it's look (who wouldn't want to take a Lyft/Uber in that?).

The ocean starts at $37,499 while the lifestyle vehicle starts at $34,750. Canoo has 3 trims other than the base model: Delivery, Premium, and Adventure ([seen here](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/)) that will run more than that. Fisker likely will too but hasn't released any.

Canoo already has released two other models (a Pickup truck and Delivery Vehicle) that they plan on producing in 2023. It's clear they are targeting the areas that have been untapped by EV's, practically guaranteeing themselves adequate demand.

Fisker has not released it's future models.

**Production:**

Both companies plan to have production begin in Q4 of 2022, both doing so with the help of outside contract manufacturers. Fisker has a contract with [Magna](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000119312521192732/d175606dex101.htm) for it's Ocean model and one with [Foxconn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530) for a future unknown model. Canoo has a contract with [VDL Nedcar](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021008512/goev-20210616xex10d1.htm) for the production of it's first model, the Lifestyle vehicle, expecting to produce 1,000 units in 2022 and 15,000 in 2023. Fisker's long term plan is to stick with outsourcing it's production while Canoo has recently announced a contract to build it's own manufacturing facility in [Oklahoma](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021008512/goev-20210616xex99d2.htm).

Canoo has been making vehicles for testing for months, and has over 500,000 test miles. [see here](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1405551289321263108)

[Picture of Test Vehicle Taken in Buckeye, AZ](https://preview.redd.it/7l32db087u771.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f7c929038678a3d7326266afcda07952d26443)

**Financials:**

Canoo had $642 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.

Fisker had $985 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.

Canoo recently stated they have enough cash on hand to last them through their first production phase (Q4 of 2022). We can assume Fisker does as well, but they have not given a specific estimate.

**Bearish Cases:**

The biggest bear cases for Canoo earlier this year was their pivoting away from the subscription model/engineering services and the departure of their former CEO Ulrich Kranz. However, both go hand in hand and make perfect sense. In order to have their subscription model work, they would have to pay the cost of all the vehicles they planned on using upfront before generating any revenue. Their CAPEX is already going to be high enough and this plan made 0 sense. Helping other companies engineer their own electric vehicles also seemed counterintuitive. That would be like Burger King helping McDonalds create a new, healthier burger. These ideas were made by Ulrich Kranz, a famous engineer (clearly not a businessman). The board of directors realized this, and Ulrich decided to mutually part ways. It was not a hostile event and he still is holding over 1 million shares in the company.

Fisker's biggest bear case is probably it's CEO's, Henrik Fisker, previous failed attempt at starting an automotive business. His first company was also named Fisker and went upside down after a first product launch riddled with problems and a failed attempt to retool a factory(which is why he is probably sticking with the contract manufacturer route).

Both are often called pre-revenue duds/bubble stocks. However, EV is the biggest business opportunity in the automotive industry since 1903 when the first Ford was made. With an estimated $2 trillion dollar automotive market up for grabs with gas prices soaring and green energy trending, I believe high EV valuations are warranted.

**Back to Valuation:**

After all this, why is Fisker currently worth 2.5 times more than Canoo? This type of discrepancy is not warranted.  You can argue it's hard to value pre-revenue companies(it is), but by that large of a margin? When they both have accomplished the same milestones and are on the same production timeline? I think it's more fishy than that. Canoo has had 2 months full of positive news and is still trading down, pinned under it's original NAV price of $10. Whenever it has broken it (2 times the past 3 weeks) it has quickly and sharply retreated back under 10.

**Potential Explanation:**

After March (when the news of the CEO departure and business model changed were released), GOEV shares were heavily shorted. Ever since then it seems the price has been actively manipulated.

Here is a chart with the share price of GOEV (blue) and GME (orange) the past 6 months.

https://preview.redd.it/0lwvqv6l9u771.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=79be0b0a77caf2a00ad6c7659be5627b837cae85

As you can see, **before March** GME and GOEV movement were completely unrelated. But **after March**, they became very similar. Canoo could have gained hedge fund interest similar to that of GME. Otherwise it should easily be trading much closer to Fisker's valuation. Short interest has steadily risen and is now **almost 40%** (see my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7pl8h/goev_the_best_way_to_play_russel_reconstitution/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for exact data).

**Conclusion/ TLDR**

Canoo and Fisker are the most promising companies out of the EV startups. However, they are trading at valuations nowhere near each other. Canoo is severely undervalued in comparison to Fisker. Could be the result of short manipulation. Due to Russell 3000 Inclusion, volume should be up this week and things could get interesting.

2021-06-27 23:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Have roughly 650 shares at $11.8. Goev has been in a downtrend since Jan. I’ll probably buy more once it starts dipping under $8. IV is high for 2023
LEAPS as well. Ugh."
2021-06-28 19:09:44,wallstreetbets,"Anybody who calls Canoo a minivan didn't read the investor presentation I guess lol... I invested in the design as the ""evolution of the station wagon""...I totally agree 100% with Canoo's thesis that it goes from old station wagon to minivans in the 90's and early 2000's - there it shifted to SUV popularity for families...and Canoo is certainly trying to compete with this Fisker - just like an SUV - with a modified shape... if you don't understand that eliminating the hood of a car is not at all equivalent with ""minivan"" .. becuase it's a whole new car design - more like the Fiat 600 multipla and the early VW bus... then I don't really take much else in this opinion that seriously because I don't think you understand the bread and butter of what Canoo is - an innovative new design for an EV with multi-use potential. However, as an Investor - I'm pissed off about the recent changes in the LV design - if you're paying attention - you'll see the more masculine, 'adventure' / pickup style front and bumpers are now the design for all the lifestyle vehicles - which fken infuriates me and it's not a good design decision - and if anybody wants to lead a campaign on behalf of Canoo investors to petition the company to offer a base version of the original prototype design - I would be all about that. So unfortunately, lots of news articles and you here- didn't actually show the current version of the LV which Canoo now has as standard - with the raised bumpers - and the new version really looks quite different and not like a sleek / urban / futuristic thing like it did before. In Summary, I think Canoo is worth about twice as much as Fisker now, and potentially will be worth ten or twenty times as much as Fisker in the near future - I expect Canoo's range of vehicles - including an awesome looking sportscar - to send the stock flying while I don't even expect Fisker to survive the second wave of EV's when there are actual Tesla competitors. But it's still a good subject and thought to compare it to FSR and I agree with a bullish case for Canoo - at least double $ what it is now regardless"

2021-06-28 12:38:27,wallstreetbets,"In the interest of providing thoughtful consideration points, I think it is worth mentioning that VW is working on their electric minivan bus that will (IMHO) compete with Canoo's lifestyle vehicle.  While Canoo should beat VW to market (by \~1 year, I think?), VW is a serious competitor, and their bringing back a cult classic in EV form.  So to say that Canoo has 0 competition in this space is probably inaccurate.

  
I think if Canoo can get some corporate contracts for delivery vehicles (UPS/USPS/Fedex/Amazon), that's *really* where the money is.

2021-06-28 08:27:02,wallstreetbets,I’m bullish Canoo. I’m saying it’s ridiculous to have class action lawsuits against a company with no product.

I  noticed some growth compared to the previous week in TSLA, SPCE and  JPM. With regard to TSLA, we can see that the sentiment is positive, but  going south for the past days:

Regarding SPCE, the growth was quite recent (as we all know), and the sentiment was also quite positive.

JPM also had quite the explosion this week in post mentioning it, with the sentiment being quite positive as well.

I was doing very well up until the semi-finals when I started taking a small loss, and began chasing. I DCA’d like a mad man, and spent all my Schrutebucks on a phat yolo on $CUM. Well we all know how that went. 

Watched in horror as my Schrutebucks became Stanley Nickels, and all my paper gains disappeared like a shart in the wind. 

Like a true degenerate, I pulled it all out following the rules I have learned. “Buy high, sell low”. 

Well what do you know, after I pulled out (nice) I immediately received a ban. 

Why ban? I thought to myself. 

So I messaged the mod team. The response I got, changed my life. One simple sentence, and this boy became a man.

This is first foray into stocks, and it's mind-boggling to me how little risk is (seemingly) involved if you're just buying shares like this."

2021-06-27 23:10:36,wallstreetbets,Does anyone think it would be smart to put puts on it? I've been learning a little about options and curious if that would be a good play?

2021-06-28 02:27:17,wallstreetbets,"It used to be public under KKD symbol from 2000-2016. Here is the stock chart:

[http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/4BAyV54ffkXHhH3Yx7.G5A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYxNQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/blogs/the-exchange/kkd-gif\_152749.gif](http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/4BAyV54ffkXHhH3Yx7.G5A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYxNQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/blogs/the-exchange/kkd-gif_152749.gif)

In the early 2000s Krispy Kreme was a sort of food fad  because the donuts looked ""perfect"" and were relatively cheap.....so it was almost viewed like buying a luxury item for the lower and middle classes. You could also go to the stores and watch the doughnuts being made, so I guess that added a sort of nostalgic feeling to the stores overall. As with all fads, they eventually come to an end.

Overall, I don't see much has changed with Krispy Kreme and I don't see many people hyping over the brand anymore so I would say bearish. It does, however, have a decent loyal following so if the management can make the existing stores profitable then it might be a worthwhile stock. I don't see it going to the moon though (10x)."
2021-06-28 02:55:28,wallstreetbets,Tech company?  What?
2021-06-28 17:14:29,wallstreetbets,"Y'all donut apes forgetting about the cookie cats: **Krispy Kreme owns Insomnia Cookies**. If y'all don't know Insomnia, they are the dopest, gooy-est, sugary, floury tendies that money can buy...

... oh, and they deliver to apes like us. Insomnia had 54% of 2020 revenue come from e-commerce. KK had 18%.

We don't know how big Insomnia's revenue is (from S-1: ""\[KK\] consolidates the financial results of Insomnia""), but this ape has a couple wrinkles in his brain to do some quick math:

* Insomnia sold  65 million cookies in 2020. KK sold 1.3B donuts, or about 20x the donuts vs cookies.
* However, Insomnia charges $21 for a basic dozen cookies, vs $7.99 for a dozen at KK. We'll call this 3x the price for easy math.
* 20 / 3 = KK has \~6.7x more revenue than Insomnia, or 13% of revenue is Insomnia.
* I think this is a low estimate because it doesn't take delivery or shipping revenue into account, so let's say that **Insomonia Cookies are \~15% of $DNUT revenue.**

Why is this important to apes? Because **Insomnia Cookies are going to the moon.**

>Insomnia Cookies opened 17 locations in 2020 and has plans to open 30 stores in 2021. The company locations offer delivery up to 30 minutes. The company plans to offer next-day delivery in the future, covering a larger percentage of the U.S. market.

e-Commerce capabilities also give a company ability to drive lower margins than 100% traditional brick and mortar. And with KK is investing heavily into their most e-Commerce heavy, growing brand (Insomnia Cookies), this could help growth *both* their revenue growth and bottom-line performance.

**TL;DR**: Apes buy the DNUT to get the cookie.

2021-06-28 00:17:47,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: OTM weeklies = super high risk/high reward. Slightly ITM or slightly OTM have a lesser chance of lossing all your money. Strong advise selling half if your contracts double and scaling out of the ""house money"". In short, buy low sell high. Calls = ape predict stock go up, Puts = ape think stock go down soon. Trading weeklies on Friday's = lottos (use very small positions cause you're either going to double it or lose it all).

Options can make you rich or poor very quickly. Remember, it's not profit till you sell and if it's good enough to screenshot it's good enough to sell. I look forward to seeing your retarded bets!"

2021-06-28 13:59:34,wallstreetbets,"I have a few questions. My brokerage lists a break even price of a $60 call on TSP that I bought at $65.20 this is the break even price if I were to exercise the option right? Because the equity of my call is now greater than the premium. So if I were to sell and not exercise the break even price wouldn’t matter right? 

Second question why does the call price affect the gains. If you have a call at $60 and a call at $80 and it becomes $90 why would the $80 be more valuable? Is it just because the premium was lower or is there another variable at play?"

So I'm dipping my toes in the water of this insanity with covered calls which seems a bit safer than buying options until I have my head wrapped around it all.

Ok, so I sold 2 AMC options that have been filled.  Strike 65 expiring this Friday.

Of course AMC is going up today.

But ideally I'd like it to expire worthless and keep the shares and pocket the premium.

But let's say it hits 65.01 on Wednesday.  Can the buyer of the option take my shares at that point?

Or does it have to expire above 65 on Friday at closing before it's assigned?  So I don't have to worry about possibly buying to close keeping the shares until that point?"

2021-06-28 18:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Another thing to keep top of mind when dealing with options on something like AMC or other meme stocks is that volatility that OP covered in pretty good depth. IV swings can massively change the price of an option, leading to profit or loss in spite of other factors.

For example, last Monday an AMC ATM (strike 56) expiring the upcoming Friday would have cost you 6.20, due to IV being at \~242%. Today, an AMC ATM (strike 58) expiring this Friday is 3.85, with IV at \~143%. Last week's call cost over 60% more, despite having lower strike and same theta."
2021-06-27 20:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Well yes and no. Yes that first part is true you buy call and if the price moves and hits on the money before expiry then it prints and thats when you sell. If price doesn't reach your strike price it expires worthless and you're only out the original money you used to buy the contract.

 When you speak of assignment  when you buy a put, if it goes south you will get assigned the 100 shares per Contract now if you like the stock then its not necessarily a bad thing cause you will make money off the premium then when assigned you will have 100 shares of the stock so its not like you are out anything you have 100 shares now at a ""discounted"" price."

2021-06-28 13:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Selling naked puts aren’t technically infinite risk, but risk down to a zero value stock price.

2021-06-28 01:00:21,wallstreetbets,"You’re correct it is limited risk. The thing is that most people here are comparing the risk of buying contracts to the risk of selling them, and of course the risk of selling (theoretically) is usually multiples higher than buying. But yes, you are correct that it is indeed limited to (strike-premium) in the case of a put and (cost/share-premium) in the case of a CC."
2021-06-28 05:19:57,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a Put you only collect a premium - you do not gain anything more than that. You can, however, lose up to the Strike price. Consider that an option is typically only worth a few bucks, maybe a few cents. If it went to zero miraculously then you'd owe the entire Strike for EVERY Stock that underlied the contract, e.g. if the Strike was $100 and it went to 0 you'd owe $100 x 100 stocks = $10,000 for a single contract of extreme loss, of which you would've only earned a few bucks.. Nobody should rationally think that earning a few bucks for the risk of that big of a loss is worth it.

Since options trading is performed on margin, even if you DIDNT have that much cash the brokerage will put you in the red until you get margin called, and then will close your position at the huge loss if you don't post collateral.

TLDR:
Yeah, your risk is ""limited"" in the same sense that you can only lose a TON of cash. Beyond anything else, the goal in trading is to be able to come back and trade again tomorrow - if you lose all your money because you got margin called to Kingdom Fuck you can't do that."
2021-06-27 22:26:40,wallstreetbets,"That's not the point; That's literally worst-case scenario but you don't need ""worst-case scenario"" to end up F'ing yourself and having to cough up a fat check to your brokerage to avoid getting your positions X'd deep in the red when selling contracts. 

Consider that many stocks become highly correlated when they lose money (i.e. when selling Puts lose money, many other sold Puts lose money) - and when markets turn downward they tend to turn downward very quickly and very fantastically (i.e. the seller of the naked Put will lose money fantastically, unpredictably, and quickly).  

There's a reason that hedge fund managers with very high ""alpha"" tend to have short lifespans and are replaced the instant they stop producing milk. That's because they're measuring uncalibrated model error, not actual outperformance.

Even the greenest and most retarded profitable traders learn things like Straddles, Box Spreads, Iron Condors, etc. because these limit downside risk while still allowing you to express sentiment for a stock - even if you think it'll go up or down."
2021-06-28 02:46:40,wallstreetbets,"I do believe your adversary makes a valid point.  Stock move together with crashes.  You say you've been selling puts for 20 years.  So, how did you fare with the 2008 crash, the 2010 flash crash, the recent Covid crash etc?  Any major draw downs? 

&#x200B;

I'm also unclear of your strategy.  I'm assuming you're selling on margin not selling cash-secured puts?  Are you selling ITM, ATM, or OTM?  Do you watch the deltas for picking your strikes?  Do you close early or run to expiration?  How are you mitigating risk?  Your specific implementation of your strategy effects your risk.   You appear to simply ignore the very real risk of blowing up your account, although probabilistically low with good risk management (not impossible)."
2021-06-28 00:36:56,wallstreetbets,"(Edit to clarify but leaving original post below this. I never said anything about probability, I am talking about the total amount you are at risk of losing on either side of an options trade.)

Did you even read my post? You are trying to flex without even listening to what I wrote. Fuck your flexing on people for no damn reason dude.

Most people here are trading meme stocks. Can we agree on that? WISH, CLOV, and WKHS all had weeklies priced in ranges almost identical to what I just posted. All I did was spell out the *exact amount* you could lose on either side of the trade. 

I even plainly said it wasn’t unlimited risk in my post. It doesn’t change the fact that on those weeklies you do have the possibility of losing wayyy more on the sell side. All the math checks out. Pick a fight with someone else."
2021-06-28 00:20:05,wallstreetbets,"The numbers I used were for simplicity, and the point was simply to show the difference in theoretical risk of buying vs selling contracts. The percentages are relative to whatever the fuck ticker and time period you damn please my dude.

Anyhow, to say my math doesn’t make sense is basically to ignore the entire post and conversation this point. I clearly stated **a weekly** contract. Still it should not matter because we just finished a damn novel by OP about the role of greeks *yet you have already reverted back to only comparing the share price and exercise price* as if that has your bases covered in figuring the value of a contract... honestly smdh. 

I am going to explain a little more for others. I am almost entirely positive this will be lost on the person I am replying to, but hell someone might benefit. If you sell a $10 strike weekly option for .1, then you are netting 1% of your collateral for only a weeks worth of time. A gain of 1% a week is no joke (regardless of what the previous poster thinks). If the greeks look good and you really like the company and strike price, then there is no reason not to sell a weekly to net 1% until you acquire shares. **As with all sold puts, it is important that you like the company and like the idea of acquiring shares at (your strike price - premium paid).** 

Edit: by the way CLOV, WKHS, and WISH weeklies all traded like this the past week."

Nowhere do I claim not to have taken a loss.  Yes I’m trading on margin, that’s what makes the ROC around 20%+ per trade.  I had/have a universe of 20-30 names I played depending on several factors. I had names that were between $10-$25ish, I always sold OTM puts and I sold enough contracts to net me between $1000-$2500 per trade.  Greeks, and all other factors like that I never understood nor did I find necessary (maybe if I did understand them I’d feel differently).  Look I make my posts as an experienced investor who’s done this literally my entire life (opened my first brokerage when I was ~10 yrs old) my intention is to educate or help less experienced investors not to prove my successes.  I could (probably should) just stop because the unnecessary bullshit I have to deal with is ridiculous. If someone feels like questioning me it really makes this more stressful than enjoyable.

If u sell a covered call you don’t take and risk of loss but may cap your possible gain.

Calculating it on the total cost IF assigned isn’t as important as the amount you make with the capital it requires and if you can get 5% weekly you’re doing extremely well."

2021-06-28 13:47:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm also calling bs on your claims.  Don't throw out bad strategies to beginners especially.  You're completely ignoring risk by paying no mind to the Greeks among other things.  Delta, for example, can tell you the directional risk of your trade.  e.g.  You sell a put while ignoring delta when it's screaming at you that the stock is gonna crash, then the outcome is very likely your option going ITM.  I'm not looking to be impressed, I'm looking to see if I can tweak my own strategies to make more money.  Having experience doesn't actually mean squat.  One can trade horribly for 20 years, and claim they have experience.  It doesn't make them good at what they do.  If you want to help someone, don't spread bad advice.

&#x200B;

I consistently sell puts, and successfully.  I mitigate risk.  I keep position sizes small, watch the Greeks, know my probabilities and stay out approximately 1 standard deviation or more.  Simply being OTM is not enough.  I have little to no draw downs.  Had 0 last year, but I didn't trade during the Covid crash.  A beginning trader should start with a simple strategy that includes risk management, not focus solely on gains, which you seem to do."

Not reading the initial post or replies will do that

&#x200B;

>an example of collecting $10 while still ticking $990 doesn’t make sense to me because it’s an unreasonable example

Weeklies with a 1% return on collateral trade in volume every market day. If you read my reply in it's entirely you would see that I stated the theoretical total possible loss on either side of the contract (buy side or sell side). When a trader posts collateral, it is for a damn reason. Is it likely that you lose your entire collateral? No. Is it possible? Fuck yes, that is why it is fucking required to make the trade. Is there a higher total possible loss on the sell side of a put? Almost always. I simply grabbed a weekly option with easy math to illustrate the point. 

&#x200B;

>  If u sell a naked put the only way you lose money is if the shares drop considerably

No shit, that is literally the risk... That I spelled out. 

&#x200B;

>if the shares drop you can always roll out farther in time and continue to do that collecting premium every month 

That doesn't change the fact that you already lost \[100x(strike-share price)-(premium)\] per contract... You are just reacting the loss, the risk exposure is still the entire value of collateral with premium subtracted. 

&#x200B;

>If u sell a covered call you don’t take and risk of loss but may cap your possible gain

If you sell a covered call your risk is still the collateral (100 shares per contract). You know, since you have to own the shares to sell a CC... Your risk throughout the life of the contract is exactly \[(share price x100) - (premium)\]. Again, like I said before it is not likely that you lose the entire collateral but you still almost always have higher possible loss on the sell side and there is a reason you have to have the collateral (because it can be lost).

&#x200B;

2021-06-28 10:53:46,wallstreetbets,"There is an option requirement when dine on margin different than cash.


NAKED PUT MARGIN REQUIREMENT
APPLIES WHEN SELLING UNCOVERED PUTS IN A MARGIN ACCOUNT
The margin requirement for an uncovered put is the greatest of the following calculations times the number of contracts times the multiplier (usually 100):
20% of the underlying price minus the out of money amount plus the option premium
10% of the strike price plus the option premium
$2.50
The premium received from the sale of the short put may be applied to meet the initial margin requirement.

That is why I’ve always used 20% of the exercise price as it’s usually very close enough while in a cash acct it’s 100% of the exercise price.

So in your example of a $10 strike I’d use 20% or $200 as my requirement amount, if I collect $10 (your example) thus I tie up $200, receive $10 equals 5% return on my actual capital requirement.  I know it’s not exact but very close for a quick thumbnail calculation.   Take good care"

100% requirement is what you are going to find with most WSB tickers and accounts. Either way, you have the same total possible risk unless your broker stops you out. You are just levering up with the 20% requirement. To say that the math doesn't work just because certain combinations of accounts, brokers, and tickers only require 20% collateral is fucking stupid. Especially when you say that you are familiar with the concept of 100% strike secured. The math is fine."

2021-06-27 20:39:35,wallstreetbets,How are the girls in Kyiv? Do most of them still believe in traditional family values?
2021-06-28 12:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, when you sell puts and they get exercised you're on the hook to buy shares at the strike price (if strike is above the market price). Luckily for OP it's part of a spread, so TD would automatically just exercise the other leg and sell those shares and get the money back (and then some in this case).

Whether you buy or sell the put doesn't change which side of the strike the put is worthless on, it changes whether you get the right to sell shares or the obligation to buy them."

Maybe people will dump but the dump will be the new floor which will be higher than the last floor price. There will always be one and the only one GME. The other meme stocks such as AMC, CLNE, WISH, CLOV will only shadow GME and will never be the OG. Without GME, there are no such thing as meme stocks. GME created meme stocks. GME will only rise higher and higher."

Bro that isn't why... oh my god. It was because people from superst...nk were crossposting and upvote rigging. That's nothing to do with organic posts coming from users. You can be a poster on multiple subreddits lmao. That's not what brigading means.

Organic posters are almost *exclusively* in the other subreddits because they're morons who believed the bullshit about this subreddit being ""compromised"". ... there was NEVER any proof of it. Not once. It was a totally successful poisonous misinformation.

As a ratio, there are no more GME posts removed than any other ""meme"" stock. The data is publically available. There have been **multiple** posts about it on wsb."

Here's my old account dumbass. You're not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?

I'm well aware of what a bid-ask is you dumbass. But I'm beginning to think that *you* have a serious case of Dunning-Kreuger going on.


But ultimately this is why arguing with conspiracy theorists like you sucks: you believe you can replace evidence for one claim with two more entirely new bullshit claims. This whole chain started with me asking for evidence and you have yet to provide any. Instead you've managed to spend several comments making *even more* claims and assertions.

You claimed that these memestocks were P&D's orchestrated by Citadel and then proceeded to do everything possible to avoid giving any evidence of this. If I were in a less charitable mood I would ""proof or ban"" your ass under the ""No bullshitting"" rule."

2021-06-27 22:37:47,wallstreetbets,">I’m brand new to this and have a RH account. If this squeeze plays out what would be the difference in buying $500 worth vs $1000? I’m seeing people emptying their accounts into GME, which I have no problem doing but if it’s part of a longer and more elaborate game plan, I think I’m in way over my head. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Bottom line, I have money and want more money (this is a thing right?) thanks!

Step one would be to get the fuck off of Robinhood onto another broker. The only reason to stay in Robinhood would be if you like getting robbed."

Any broker that offers you trading with no fees is profiting off you in other ways. Mainly selling your order to wholesale market makers so they can front run your order."

2021-06-28 00:33:40,wallstreetbets,You don't add up FTDs; they are already aggregated (added up)  The number for today is the total shares that are due and have not been delivered yet.
2021-06-28 17:05:05,wallstreetbets,You also need to factor in the operational shorting of ETF's that contain GME. Check out all the OTM puts on those. The number could be 2-3x higher.
2021-06-28 06:00:55,wallstreetbets,Sounds good to me!

2021-06-28 00:34:35,wallstreetbets,That wasn’t what my data came from. I looked through the daily amount of reported FTD’s. Did not go off a cumulative source

2021-06-28 00:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but why do you assume that they were never delivered?

The daily amount of reported FTDs is cumulative.  If I'm supposed to deliver 100 shares on Monday and I don't, 100 shares get added to Monday's FTD total.  If I don't deliver them on Tuesday, they stay there for Tuesday's total.  You can't add 100+100 and get 200; it's just 100 shares that are 2 days late.

Then if I deliver them on Wednesday, those 100 won't count towards Wednesdays total.

Also FTDs are often caused by long sales, but that's a different topic."

To me it means far more people doing their own taxes rather than paying an accountant, and also more people upgrading to ""premium"" versions and paying for extras like audit protection because they're afraid they're going to screw up capital gains tax.

I think Intuit is just going to print money until the IRS decides to simplify tax filing, and given their lobbying presence I'm not really expecting that to happen any time soon."

Also, they stated they will have 8 to 10 new stores in 2022. And from then on they will be very aggressive. A new store costs 2.9 millions sans inventory. I think they can manage 25 new stores every year. I am in this for a long ride boys. If Lululemon can be 40 billion dollar company, Academy sure can hit that number in seven to eight years time. For another comparison FIVE below is an 11 billion dollar company.

I think most SHFs didn\`t close their short at a loss, not even Melvin, i actually think they did a double down and msm back that theory by writing that they lost even more on meme stocks since May.

reddit doesn\`t let me link to seeking Alpha, but here what they say:

Hedge funds lose $6 billion more betting against meme stocks - FT

Hedge funds Melvin Capital and Light Street Capital have suffered steep losses since the start of May as stocks favored by Reddit's (REDDIT) WallStreetBets crowd rallied again.  
  
Melvin lost another 4% in May, bringing its losses to 44.7% for the year, the FT says.  
Ortex co-founder Peter Hillerberg told the paper that while funds have recently reduced short positions, short interest is still ""at very high levels.""  
The meme trade has broadened this time around and shares have shown more resilience staying at higher levels. But most of the stocks are sliding today.  
Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian says that Wall Street has ""crossed the Rubicon"" on meme stocks.

2021-06-28 02:19:07,wallstreetbets,General Mills is an interesting one because they’re entire business is directly impacted by inflation and commodity’s increasing
2021-06-28 12:21:11,wallstreetbets,"$BBBY is the earnings play this week. IMO, a squeeze is imminent. 32% short interest is buying that MUST happen. It's also a long term play as BBBY is a solid company now under great management. Even if you could give a rat's left ball about long term, this makes it more bag-proof and people less likely to bail early.

Could see a 10+ day parabolic rise like that popcorn shtonk. (smaller 100M float, higher SI, and current 10-day DTC).

Here are some points from my prior DD posts...

1. Customers flocking into stores now that COVID is canceled. Huge pent up shopping demand.
2. Booming housing market. What do you think people buy when they move in to new house? Fucking towels, sheets, and shit for the kitchen of course.
3. Niche market that favors in-store shopping over online. People want to see curtains in front of them, not in a picture. I, personally, want to squeeze the fuck out of a pillow before buying it, the ones ordered online are never right.
4. CEO Tritton is excellent and executing a similar plan as what he did with Target. Unlike some CEOs that hype their stock and then repeatedly create and sell new shares into the buying.
5. Much improved online presence following large investments under new management.
6. BoA analyst (bear) drops coverage BBBY and GME because ""movement is impossible to predict"". 10 days later, same analyst resumes coverage of BBBY with a ""Buy"" rating and target of $38. Hmm...
7. Insiders only buying since new management took over.
8. 32% short interest is starting to bail, in part causing the part of the green dildo you can see now. More shorts will cover over next 2 weeks. They are fucked. I was one of them until \~3 weeks ago when I saw the writing on the wall after DD and my brokers raising the margin requirement to 100%. You (we) have their ass now. They HAVE to close/cover or they will be forced to do so at much higher losses

The dry powder is there boys... just needs to be ignited. Note that the current rise is on zero chatter but a ton of call buying going on in the background."

2021-06-28 08:46:13,wallstreetbets,I think they have raised guidance twice. I don’t think there is much of a question that earnings will be through the roof. Just a matter of how much of that is already built into price. Still as good of chance if any other to 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-28 16:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the BBBY shorts (I was one of them until recently) are quick to cover but they all pile back in on the spikes because so far it hasn't maintained upward momentum for more than a day or two. At 32% SI, that trend can easily be reversed on 3 or more days of solid uptrend. I can tell you first hand the bears on this one are nervous as shit and they will all try to fit their fat asses out the door at the same time. They have to. Margin requirements now 100% on upside risk, and one of my brokers said they will raise that to 150% on any sign of a large upward move.

To the OP, I certainly wouldn't recommend unhedged long puts on it at the current Vols, which will drop way down after Wednesday regardless earnings result and stock movement. You'll get reamed on the vols. If anything, maybe a put credit spread would be in order, or call credit spread if you are a bear."

2021-06-28 01:15:50,wallstreetbets,I'm not finding $BODY on yahoo finance OR wealth simple.  It's this available in Canada?
2021-06-27 22:40:28,wallstreetbets,I could see $BODY having more potential for growth compared to PTON because this is like the PTON for the 99%. It's much more affordable and therefore can reach a vastly larger customer base.
2021-06-28 12:39:20,wallstreetbets,Did they drop the MLM side of their business? Did I miss this and what will happen to the coaches?

2021-06-27 21:52:08,wallstreetbets,Well profit isn't 'profit' should do more research before throwing money at it.

2021-06-28 16:55:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it was 110% return, pretty slick didn’t sleep well last night but worth it. 100% pretty much first 10 min of trading"
2021-06-27 22:04:34,wallstreetbets,WSBet have too many bots and shills. I stay away from this sub reddit most of the time now.

2021-06-27 21:33:13,wallstreetbets,So… wen moon?
2021-06-27 21:53:30,wallstreetbets,Ok so I continue buying AMC and GME
2021-06-27 22:01:07,wallstreetbets,This is coming from a guy that bought BB at 13.70 and claiming it'll rocket the next day but it dropped instead. Ok and we take advice from you??? Sike I buy more AMC and GME.
2021-06-28 09:40:00,wallstreetbets,Amc was up 1000% still up 500%. So bankrupted.🙄
2021-06-28 02:43:05,wallstreetbets,Viac is my prefers of those
2021-06-28 19:55:40,wallstreetbets,Yup. He leveraged it to the tits and got margin called.
2021-06-28 10:33:48,wallstreetbets,"As predicted, VIACOM is back from the Dead!!! Lets go pluto!!! We dont need a rocketship we need 🛸🛸🛸🛸🪐🪐🪐"
2021-06-27 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,"If there was no vol, I could understand the concern that WISH is being spammed by a small group. But when WISH is pushing more vol that GME, AMC, CLOV day after day...clearly no a small group of people"
2021-06-27 22:16:49,wallstreetbets,And the way WISH was sandbagged thursday night probably fucked a lot of people with options expiring friday. similar effect to when brokers limit trading etc. People get spooked when suddenly no mention of WISH. Not a surprise WISH traded weakly.
2021-06-28 12:00:20,wallstreetbets,Most of the time I invest for the sole purpose of making money. DNMR offers me an opportunity to invest in a company that is making a positive impact on the world and our environment while also making a shit ton of money. WIN WIN. DNMR TO THE MOON

2021-06-28 11:22:30,wallstreetbets,I’ll get my chance.
2021-06-27 23:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. First think my grandparents did when they retired is get lazy boys for both the house and the cottage.

I can totally get behind the demographic shift idea.  Great write-up."
2021-06-28 00:51:30,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy out money at such a high a strike price with only few weeks away? There is no way this will reach $30 by 7/16. Unless it gets short squeeze. No catalyst coming anytime soon
2021-06-28 12:13:47,wallstreetbets,You fucking genius
2021-06-28 12:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I usually get calls atleast 1 week after I expect movement. Even if it's a bit more, if it moons, they all moon"
2021-06-28 10:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Because it got a lot of negativity due to some of the marketing over the past year (so called pandering), but shoe hype didn't die down at all.

2021-06-28 10:49:04,wallstreetbets,"I am not a psychic, but the longer this stays suppressed while HRC steel trades above $1100 (current ~$1700), the more the spring coils. 

CLF is absolutely printing money right now. I think they have eliminated a substantial portion of their debt load already, and at the end of the year could be sitting on cash that they do not know what to do with."

2021-06-28 13:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...  it was back when the weed stocks were first starting to boom. Weed drinks, CBD oils, etc...  do I sound bitter?? (Shakes head yes)

I did make 6k on CGC, though. I sold after it popped.  It popped when Constellation Brands bought a (I believe) 42% stake in the company."
2021-06-28 14:47:22,wallstreetbets,"No thanks. However, millions of people do. Just because we don't use it, doesn't mean we can ignore it and say Tilray has no US presence. They are definitely setup to benefit once it's federally legal."

2021-06-28 02:47:59,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t seem likely…why cry about 700k in losses with +100mm stack?
2021-06-28 08:11:22,wallstreetbets,"If this dude was seriously who he claims to be and not some LARPer he could reach that fuck Portnoy no problem and make the bet public. Instead he writes some obscure reddit post that he knows nothing will come out of.

He has already been exposed. He actually doesn't take any bets. He just talks about them."
2021-06-28 08:42:50,wallstreetbets,"Then call in a mod to get a proof or ban bet going with him. His account has been verified a few times now though, so good luck"
2021-06-28 09:36:21,wallstreetbets,The fuck it has. Post proof.
2021-06-28 10:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Then tag him and a mod my guy, see if he wants to take the bet"
2021-06-28 11:19:08,wallstreetbets,Nerd has never taken a bet that I know of. He threatens it all the time then runs away when it’s presented. Good luck.
2021-06-28 11:15:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm telling you he doesn't. Couple of weeks somebody called him out with real sums (take a look at u/verb0182 comment history a little while back). He just gave the run around. 

Why would a billionaire waste most of his time on this degenerate forum?"
2021-06-28 12:27:44,wallstreetbets,"It’s interesting, he’s been very inactive by his standards since you exposed him. I think he’s slowly retiring that account and phasing in a new alt (one who’s been commenting fairly prolifically on OGs lately and uses a lot of the same verbiage and idioms)."
2021-06-28 11:20:02,wallstreetbets,"I saw that that, but its a lot harder to get out of a bet here than where verb posted. I dont really care, either make the bet or don't but aren't you doing the same thing here as you're accusing him of? Either tag him and a mod in for a bet, or stop posting about it

Edit: also there have been a lot of wealthy people in this sub for awhile. There was the son of a Russian oligarch not too long along that blew up his account and he was a member"
2021-06-28 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,"lol ok. 

you're probably some sort of alt account of his. good luck."
2021-06-28 11:25:21,wallstreetbets,"No, Id just like to see an actual bet go down but thats your call sport"
2021-06-28 11:52:05,wallstreetbets,Just two from Blackstone. Two from CVC and the rest are pretty serious CEO-type players that are great for their M&A strategy going forward imho.
2021-06-27 23:58:31,wallstreetbets,"I love this author looking forward to reading more from you. Keep it up. Great plays, well written. DFV would be proud of you."

2021-06-28 17:16:51,wallstreetbets,Waiting for it to kiss the 20 DMA. Also don't want to make any moves this week with the economic data coming in.
2021-06-28 15:42:01,wallstreetbets,the purple line is my guess as to where the stock wants to be post covid. As long as it takes a few steps in that direction that'll be a nice profit
2021-06-28 15:41:13,wallstreetbets,"100% true. So far it seems like Pfizer and Moderna are effective against it so at least for heavily vaccinated first world (USA, parts of Europe, soon to be Canada) we hopefully will see a relatively smooth ramp up. definitely risks to watch for"
