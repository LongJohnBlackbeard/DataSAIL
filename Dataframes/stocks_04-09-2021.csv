2021-04-09 19:58:34,stocks,Yes options would trigger it because of the underlying share count indicated by the number of contracts you‚Äôre trading. Unsure of consequences as I don‚Äôt trade options and I don‚Äôt know the exact threshold but I suggest trying to get clarification ASAP.

2021-04-09 19:38:29,stocks,You can generally buy stocks with unsettled funds as long as you don't sell that stock prior to those funds being settled and it won't be a violation.
2021-04-09 19:14:04,stocks,Its regulations.  You can‚Äôt even argue about it.  Call them and ask them to explain how it happens so you can avoid it.
2021-04-09 19:13:43,stocks,You should wait 3-4 days to make trades after you sell.
2021-04-09 19:17:22,stocks,"The only way around it would be to apply for margin, that let's you trade with unsettled funds as much as you want."
2021-04-09 19:31:14,stocks,They will consider that day trading . You will need to keep a minimum of $25000 in a cash account in order to do that . I break the T2 rule alot myself but I don't do it with the same stock. So if I sell a stock I will put that money in a different stock and not right back in the one I sold .
2021-04-09 19:19:58,stocks,Did you sell and then buy the same stock back the same day ?
2021-04-09 19:42:12,stocks,"That's interesting,  I use Webull and when I have buying power even though the funds haven't settled I still buy . Not sure why I haven't got a violation because I break that rule all the time.  I've been told to transfer to Fidelity but I guess all brokerages have limits on what we can do ."
2021-04-09 19:18:44,stocks,"I mean, I can't really avoid it if I've made several trades, and I don't know which ones are responsible for the unsettled cash."
2021-04-09 19:19:04,stocks,That's no fun.
2021-04-09 19:20:36,stocks,"Yeah, but in reality I need to slow down my trading. I've been over-trading and it's hurting my success rate.

That's my point, if I got a 3rd strike, then TDA handles the unsettled cash issue, and I don't even have to think about it."
2021-04-09 19:35:58,stocks,"That's what gets me, I'm not day trading because I don't make a round trip in one day. I just make trades when it says I have funds available, but they let me use unsettled funds which gets me in trouble I guess."
2021-04-09 19:21:37,stocks,"No, apparently it was the next day, but the cash was unsettled."
2021-04-09 19:50:18,stocks,"Webull gives you instant buying power, just dont sell anything before the funds settle. I also use fidelity because its much quicker with deposits. Both accounts are on margin."
2021-04-09 19:20:59,stocks,Open a margin account then
2021-04-09 19:20:02,stocks,Well keep doing it and go on a 90 day time out.

2021-04-09 19:53:45,stocks,"The best thing to learn quick about the entire weed market is that farmers don‚Äôt get rich.

There are millions of pounds of weed in Canada just warehoused. Going stale.

There is a race to the bottom on pricing. Growers will go bust, there is not much money long term. 

Then it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it‚Äôs imported from central/South America where it grows faster and cheaper. 

The money will be made with transportation, distribution, products with branding. People who grow flower won‚Äôt be rich or make you rich. Just like the people who grow grapes or hops aren‚Äôt."

2021-04-09 18:56:52,stocks,"Seems unnecessarily high. For example I have my S&S ISA with Vanguard, they have an account fee of 0.15% and an ongoing charge which depends on which funds you choose, but is around 0.2-0.25%. Big difference between 1.2% and 0.4% IMO. Also can't see how a platform with higher fees is necessarily safer or give better returns, most major platforms are FSCS protected meaning your all your investments up to ¬£85,000 are protected should your broker go bust, and your returns are determined by what you invest in not the broker itself. I would consider transferring."
2021-04-09 17:42:30,stocks,Which broker has that fee?
2021-04-09 17:57:53,stocks,Does seem high. Most I've seen have been under 0.5%. Could be justified though if your broker has low fees for transactions.
2021-04-09 19:01:04,stocks,"Upon looking I see vanguard is quite a high investment (¬£100) a month minimum,where as mine is (¬£25) a month minimum. Would that explain the higher rates??"
2021-04-09 18:59:03,stocks,"I may to be fair. The investment portfolio, what it‚Äôs invested in, I do love. I can‚Äôt see specific companies, but knowing what type of companies they are brings me a lot of peace of mind. However, I will check out vanguard as well!"
2021-04-09 18:33:04,stocks,"Which one, the 1.17 or .48?"
2021-04-09 18:33:28,stocks,"I feel they‚Äôre low, it‚Äôs 0.11%. But I don‚Äôt really know!"
2021-04-09 19:09:25,stocks,"That ¬£100 minimum is just an option when you open the account, you can either open one with a lump sum of ¬£500 or set up a ¬£100 monthly payment but you can cancel this whenever you want. Once the account is set up you can pay whatever you want whenever you want, personally I haven't paid into my account for about 4 months, no problems. Another bonus is that it's a flexible ISA, meaning if you contribute and withdraw money it will not count towards your ¬£20,000 annual allowance."
2021-04-09 19:04:27,stocks,"Incidentally if you want more info on ISAs try /r/ukpersonalfinance, there are plenty contributors over there who know far more about it than I do!"
2021-04-09 18:47:54,stocks,Yeah that's ok. Some of the bigger brokers charge up to ¬£15 per transaction.

2021-04-09 19:14:24,stocks,"No problems, not trying to plug them or anything! But they're a good choice and a fairly popular platform, I'm sure there's other very good brokers for ISAs as well but I just don't have experience with any others."

2021-04-09 16:31:39,stocks,"In my mid-40s, started January 2020 with a robo for my Roth, started taking a more active role this past February. Started because I took a hard look at my mom‚Äôs poverty and realized how awful it‚Äôs been for her. I‚Äôm a newbie, but my only real tip is never be afraid to take profits, particularly if you‚Äôre trading/gambling in OTC. Can quickly disappear after potential profits appear. It‚Äôs hardddd, but don‚Äôt be greedy. Opportunities can dry up rapidly."

2021-04-09 18:02:08,stocks,Started around 1986 when I was around 23. I used to watch the ticker when I was about 15 years old during the summer when the weather was right so you could get the TV signal.
2021-04-09 18:24:41,stocks,"I started investing with my first job at 21 just at work, got a bit more serious at 24 when working at a place without a 401k and opened an IRA with an advisor. That advisor left and I didn't trust/know the new one so I tried a different advisor whose advice derailed my investing for 2 years.

Got more active in the last year, especially in the last 4 months, with picking individual stocks and a new brokerage account. 

I wish I had known:

- not to be afraid, knowledge helps a ton and you don't learn if you don't try

- don't trust advisors who barely know what they're doing, it's better to do it yourself and stay consistent than to wait for an advisor who's mucking about for years and not doing anything.

- Losses are lessons and that's ok, get a good (but not devastating) lesson early

- if you know and believe in your research for a company it's a million times easier to wait through a dip

- your life is more than the stock market, it's ok to miss some gains to take care of your real life instead of obsessively watching a ticker

- if you're getting emotional you may be covering up a mistake, are afraid to take the loss, or reading too much reddit. Just face the emotions head on, be gentle, and find the smartest way forward from where you are.

I'm still learning and I hope for future me I'm doing an ok job. I just want to leave my partner well off when we get older and give her the time of her life while we get there. Fingers crossed!!

2021-04-09 19:00:24,stocks,"At 25, I started 2008, but quit investing after a year because I have no insight. bought AMZN at $34, and panic sold at $26, 100 shares. Over the years I didn't invest, but still use most of the FANG service and products except A.

Then started again, at 34 since the end of 2018 because I feel I am missing out the Golden 10 years of investing.

I short term trades on IPO, meme stocks, false notions of what the market will do, loss abput $1500 by Oct 2019, and finally decided a very diversified portfolio with 270 stocks and ETFs in Oct 2019 and Jan-Feb 2020. Finally narrowed down to 30 or so stocks right now to just keep pouring into.

Buying a basket of small to mid cap stocks with research over a year, with DCA method, and keep auto-invest, will more likely beating anything.

1 to 2 golden egg(s) are likely to outgrow anyones that doesn't grow. Be sure the company you invest is on a pivotal point of success in 2 to 3 years. Right now I recommend the Semiconductors sector (don't just go for the ones that are widely known, there are bunch of still widely known ones and no one ever mentioned on reddit or youtube because those are boring and not volatile at all, but still grow.)

I also recommend the VR, AR, sector. There are plenty out there that are not just the big 5 making it. Look at the components that support AR, VR, not just the main product."

Yet Im waiting for tech to decrease value - not like titanic sink, but I do have a feeling prices are going down soon since its going up in a crazy way - and then hop back in"
2021-04-09 19:12:32,stocks,"21, started investing cause i wanted to understand the value of money better, 29 now. My advice is always be wary of the duning kruger effect.

I wish I knew that markets aren‚Äôt rational, especially in the short term, and you need to understand as an investor you‚Äôre not playing the same game as traders or institutions.

I‚Äôd be a lot farther ahead if I had opened an IRA when I started working at 15 or even when I started getting into investing at 17.

They provide easier access to capital than traditional financing, but at a high cost.   They are a necessary evil for many smaller corps.

2021-04-09 14:59:46,stocks,"its hard to tell without you telling us your positions.

Are you buying into overhyped MEME companies?

Also you don't want to get too greedy, take your profits.

I am up around 300% since last March when entered, I bought beaten down companies that would very likely recover.

I still hold some recovery plays.

For example I bought CCL at $9 and sold at $25

then I went to with those profits XOM at $41 and sold around $55

now I own ET since $6.80 and plan to sell around $12.

I will hold until it goes there, they pay a dividend and the company isn't going to go under.   if it takes 5 years, so be it. 

If it takes 5 months, great.   

Cant time it exactly, just be confident in your buy / sell points you pick ahead of time.

I could have held CCL longer as its higher then $25 now when I sold, but it hit my goal so I sold."

2021-04-09 16:17:42,stocks,"I did some of what you did for a bit. Now keeping a 60/40 ratio of safe holds versus more active trading. And I implemented a system for the active trading, as described by others above. Stop losses but also sell limits for gains. My trading is a lot calmer now. Some of my positions still lose, but I keep following my system. The goal is to come out positive on average. I tweak my system when I think there's something wrong with it. I mostly keep the active trades because I'm interested in getting better at this. If I keep tweaking and learning more about investing, I think I can probably beat the market. But I'm not necessarily expecting that right away.

Investing is mostly research and waiting. It requires a lot of patience. Less buying and selling. Unless you have a ton a capital and knowledge and choose to day trade. Neither you nor I seem to be at that point right now :) And that's ok!"
2021-04-09 19:14:25,stocks,"Take your profits and be realistic about gains. I tend to buy-in with a smaller position and increase it over time, kind of DCA but I keep checking my stocks and buying opportunities on a daily basis. Sometimes I just buy a little more when I think the price is right. I have an entry point and at least 2 lower DCA points.  

So lets say I want to buy a stock for $20/share, I expect it to go to $25 because it is a good stock (25% return on investment). I expect the stock to move in the worst case to $16/share or $12/share and will sell if it reaches $10/share. I want to invest $1000 in this company with the goal to get $250 in gains so $1250 total.

If I invest 50% of my initial money at $20/share I get 25 shares at $500 total (or 50 if you go all in but we won't do that in this example). If the price drops to $16 I'll buy more worth of $250. So it drops 20% I invest another 25%. When it drops to $12 that is another 20% drop from the $20 entry point so again you can choose to invest the remaining $250 and get more shares. At $16 you can buy at most 15 shares and at $12 you can buy 20 shares at most - so 35 + 25  = 60 shares. If it hits the $10 price target you sell and get $600 instead of $500 if you would have bought them all at the same time. 

If you would have stopped at 40% loss with the initial investment of $1000/50 shares you would have had to sell everything at $12 instead of being able to ride it out a little longer. I'm not saying you should use these exact same margins because it can depend on the stock how much it can swing but the principle is sound. If a stock does not move over a certain period of time you can buy more for around the same price. If a stock moves really hard downwards you can say at the 1st DCA point that you are out and you would have had $900 instead of $800 and at $12 you would have had $730 (35 shares x $12 +$250) instead of $600."
2021-04-09 16:15:31,stocks,"I feel the same. I didn't have any stop losses set and when the market tanked all my stocks were at a loss except one. 

I figured I was going to at least save my profits from that one stock so I set a stop loss for half my shares. Sure enough 2 days later I noticed my stop loss triggered, the stock went down to 4 bucks and up past my 5.25 buy in all the way to about 5.80. And this was all in the span of a single pre market session with no news from the company.

Within about 3 days that stock is now sitting at almost 10 bucks and there still hasn't been any news released by the company. The stock keeps going up despite of all my other speculative plays getting hammered by short sellers except the one stock I set a stop loss for. 

So it's definitely a very rigged market and they can probably see everyone's stop losses and trigger them to tank the stock when there are enough stop loses set for a particular stock."

2021-04-09 15:53:25,stocks,"> On top of that, if I sell for a profit what if that same stock just keeps going up

That is your problem right there. you will NEVER time the exact top its literally impossible. so no matter what this is goin to happen.

like my example I bought CCL at $9 and sold a $25.

I am not angry it went up to $29 months after. I got an almost 200% return in less than a year.

 then I moved my money to another stock with a new price target which I also hit and made more in that one then I would have made holding CCL to $29.

You need to set price goals for yourself and stick to them.  you can make them as high as you want, but I suggest making them realistic.

It's definitely infuriating, not even counting the fact that freezing trading in a so called free market is totally ok.

In the case of these stocks the big money and media were constantly posting negative things on forums, reddit and the news about why people shouldn't be buying them and why investors are stupid for investing in these stocks.

2021-04-09 15:56:46,stocks,">We've known how profitable index funds like SPY and VOO are compared to  other investments. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017 contributed  greatly to this

The macro-economic conditions are what led to increases in the stock market. The TCJA had very little impact (except that it may have impacted retail interest in the market from the individual income tax changes).

The major change brought in by the TCJA that may have had some impact was the shift to territorial tax, but as US companies that were trading abroad had, de-facto, done this themselves by having international headquarters abroad with US subsidiaries to manage the Americas taxes, the impact was limited.

>no doubt many of these big companies swiftly recovered from the  coronavirus recession.

Mostly due to the CARES act, in my opinion. Many of these companies took money intended to be used to furlough instead of fire employees and kept it. The market was more impacted by the increased liquidity from the Fed and from the relaxation of the banks collateral rules

>Yellen has been working towards a minimum  corporate income tax to put pressure on tax havens and accounting  practices that allows companies to keep more capital. Wondering how this  would play out in terms of broad market growth.

Corporate tax rates are something of a red herring in my opinion. To reduce corporate tax avoidance you need 3 things (some of which were tackled by BEPS).

1. Gobally agree where money is taxed. At the moment companies take advantage of differences in the territoriality of taxation. A simple example would be if Ireland does not tax income not earned in Ireland, where the US taxed income earned worldwide, and Germany taxes income based on where it is booked. So a US company sets up an Irish company and books its European earnings there, legally avoiding German and US taxes. This is a very simplified view of what's actually happening but as an example it shows that differences these rules  can make taxation easy to avoid for large multi-nationals.
2. Legacies of empire need to be wound up. Jersey, the Bahamas, the Dutch West Indies, the Cayman Islands, and others for historical reasons have preferable conditions for transferring money from their former Imperial overlords (the UK and the Netherlands are notable for this in particular). This means that taking advantage of item 1 gets the money to London/Amsterdam cheaply, then can be moved to the offshore accounts cheaply. This flow should be disrupted so it's taxed before it leaves. Companies like can borrow at incredibly low rates because they use the capital building up offshore as collateral, then declare any interest as an expense and write it off.
3. Do what Ireland did and remove all the exceptions, and put the headline rate to what you actually want. Ireland have a tax rate of 12.5% and take in 12.4%. France have a rate of 36% but depending on location, business, and incentives, a company could be paying 6%. The US had a rate of 35% but again depending on a multitude of factors companies are paying less than half that. Cut all tax breaks on corporations, remove location incentives, and reduce the rate to match what you expect to actually take in (around 16-18%) and the overall tax take would rise.

I was reading that psychologically, people dislike subtraction if addition is possible in basically all contexts. The tax code everywhere is a shambles of overlapping rules because things just get added. Simplifying this would lead to less lawyers and accountants having jobs, probably, but would provide a boost to business by empowering medium sized business to compete more effectively although multi-nationals will always have some advantages.

Anyway, a bit of a rant.

The short answer to what you actually asked is any discussion like Yellen has started will cause skittishness in the market, particularly if it looks like going anywhere, but the impact will be small and short lived unless it's actually enacted and the details of that will be very important."

2021-04-09 14:17:43,stocks,I read somewhere that the 'better' way to play with VIX is to buy put when it is high. Personally I have not tried it.
2021-04-09 13:36:54,stocks,They are also often used for hedging purposes.
2021-04-09 14:15:40,stocks,Not necessarily a bet. Might just be a hedge.
2021-04-09 13:38:53,stocks,"Yes but only short term hedges because they lose money over time. You need to know how to use them, the vix and it's etns respectively are much more complex financial instruments than people give them credit for."
2021-04-09 14:19:14,stocks,"if his SPY calls don't print, these might:-).  or the market just trades sideways and screws us all....."
2021-04-09 13:25:09,stocks,"SCHD been great for me. +13% YTD so far on my end. 

They recently rolled out of oil stocks and picked up HD and a few others. It is managed well, pays well, and has been very steady even over the past turbulent month. 

I try to add monthly."
2021-04-09 13:29:39,stocks,I am tempted to put my ROtH VOO into it as well since I am so heavily allocated to S&P in my 401k. That‚Äôs would amount to about 10% of my total position in SCHD. I am at about 6% now.
2021-04-09 13:39:25,stocks,"It is hard to argue against VOO and the S&P, but if you do want to broaden, I can't say SCHD is a bad way to do it. SCHD is broad market. Less volatile, steady growth. 

Certainly the backbone of my portfolio I have a full 35% in it."
2021-04-09 13:39:48,stocks,"People did exactly what OP did March of last year and they are still sitting on the sidelines waiting for a ""crash"" while missing out on x2 returns in a year. So when the ""crash"" happens and it somehow drops 50% which would go back to the levels a year ago, you would buy in then? Then why the hell did you cash out in the first place? Their logic makes no sense."
2021-04-09 13:17:26,stocks,If you‚Äôre only 27 it‚Äôs a 10 on that scale. The market will ebb and flow over the next 30-40 years but if you look at it from a historical perspective you‚Äôll average 5-10% annually.
2021-04-09 14:22:17,stocks,"Bad idea. Just keep adding money overtime. If we do hit a drop, then maybe add a little bit more then."
2021-04-09 14:23:35,stocks,"i got in and out and in and out and in and out last year

dont do me. hodl"
2021-04-09 15:28:24,stocks,"Well, to be different, I welcome a crash.  It's pretty easy really.  When the market crashes, since my portfolio is all dividend stocks I not only get to buy cheap shares because of the crash but also get cheap shares through dividend reinvestment.   All dividend  reinvesting is about patience not panic.

Will admit the 2008-2009 recession was a little panicky but still had more than 60% in dividend paying stocks.   With big brokerage houses getting in trouble and the government not taking the CEO's of the offending brokerage firms and whipping them in the middle of the street for punishment it was kind of scary but as a nation we managed to come out of it.  Did very well after 2008 Recession and the 2020 pandemic.  

At points a lot of the hysteria around crashes is media driven.  They get lots of gory headlines.  which means more subscriptions.  They feast on tragedy."
2021-04-09 13:49:11,stocks,"I definitely wouldn't sell. At 27, you have decades to recover from a crash, and you can lower your cost basis every month you are down.

If you are really concerned, you could buy puts. If you don't want to pay put premiums, you could consider a collar: sell a CC and use the premium to buy a put. Personally, I think it is overkill at your age.

If you think you might need money, take it out, but if not, just ignore the current price and rest assured that it will be a lot higher in the future."
2021-04-09 14:17:30,stocks,If you want to try actively trade and beat the market then start a separate investment account. Put money into that account that you can afford to lose and see what happens. You seem like you really want to take a shot predicting the next crash so in that case you could always start saving that disposable income instead of investing it so that when your crash does happen you have money to pour into the market.
2021-04-09 13:17:10,stocks,That idea is stupid. Literally stop checking your account for the next decade and just leave the money there. Not trying to be an dick about it but realistic
2021-04-09 13:20:02,stocks,"Gme is not a hedge lol, when we crash next it will be the bubble bursting, gme is definitely a part of that bubble. If you want to hedge buy an inverse etf of put options, vix calls, a vix etn. But note these are all complicated instruments and most are derivatives. If you don't know how to use them don't. I don't know your skill level or if you are short term or long term so if I had that info I could help more."

>I know that you can't time the market

So don't. If the market crashes, it won't be because of Gamestop..."
2021-04-09 13:29:37,stocks,Get out of GME for one.  VTI and QQQ and never sell.
2021-04-09 16:55:17,stocks,9
2021-04-09 17:07:44,stocks,GME has a 0% chance of crashing the market. Are you new to stocks?
2021-04-09 13:28:21,stocks,"Good move in my opinion. Market crash is inevitable. Buy in when it falls. You will be happy you did. Our entire economy is running on printed money, zero to very low interest rates, and other policies to keep it afloat for far too long. Since 2008 it‚Äôs been run on bailouts, low interest rates and stimulus.. Not to mention buy backs and other policies that Trump deregulated to allow Wall Street and banks to inflate their asset values. We are living the 2008 financial crisis all over again.... same thing but this time it‚Äôs less real estate and more stock market. Biggest bubble yet. Just my opinion of course but I‚Äôd say you are making a great move and you will stand to make a huge amount of money locking in gains and waiting for the drop."
2021-04-09 13:25:17,stocks,"Unless you need the money, leave it where it is. 

Time in the market rather than timing the market."
2021-04-09 15:03:45,stocks,Extremely stupid. Don‚Äôt do this
2021-04-09 16:28:10,stocks,I would say it would be a smart play. A few weeks ago I moved all my 401k to a money market in anticipation of the recent correction and I'm slowly buying back in on the dips. But low sell high.
2021-04-09 15:41:01,stocks,"trust me, you can't afford to stay out of the market."
2021-04-09 13:40:21,stocks,Have you ever thought of building up a hedging position? This will give you the possibility to participate on a strong market that might keep running for some years without a crash and is your insurance if it crashes sooner.
2021-04-09 13:51:14,stocks,No point wearing that proverbial suit of armor when a tsunami is coming... but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
2021-04-09 14:10:57,stocks,"You should definitely try to time the market.

Ignore the haters."
2021-04-09 19:13:38,stocks,"GME crashing the market xD not possible my friend.  You know how they changed the rules to stop the MOASS?  They can change the rules again if anything were to be an actual risk to the 'market'

&#x200B;

There wont be another 'crash' for a while my friend, the FED wont allow it.  You gotta understand how powerful the fed is.  They are the god damn central bank and will print us out of anything right now.  

&#x200B;

Maybe in another 2-3 years we can see a Covid level crash.  But not until they start raising interest rates."
2021-04-09 14:59:57,stocks,"Yeah, this is pretty much exactly what I did with my retirement fund.  I felt super smart for getting out early and avoiding all of the impact from the March crash.  But then I never moved back in, and missed out on those potential gains.   

It seemed like the right thing to do - there was (is) a global pandemic and the global response was pretty ineffectual, especially in the US.  In April, I figured any recovery was just a dead cat bounce.  In May, I thought, ""hell, they can try to pump the market but it's a house of cards and it's gonna collapse any minute.""

And so on.  It ""had to crash any day now"" for months, and I waited and waited and didn't get back in until I'd missed out on almost all of a ridiculous bull run.  I probably would have been better off if I hadn't done anything at all."
2021-04-09 16:32:58,stocks,"The problem is them waiting on the side lines, once the stocks hit bottom they need to buy back in, not sit on sidelines. For many years the only time I invested in stocks was during crashes, like during 9/11, 2008, covid lockdowns and then sell out a few months to a year later. Sure I missed out on all the 300 percent profit in between crashes but I was content with the money I was making. I feel like once the market gets to where we're at now it becomes to unpredictable and sometimes it's just a whole lot less anxiety pulling out during times like this and waiting for the next crash with cash in hand."
2021-04-09 14:31:26,stocks,"Hmmm.  I already maxed it out for the year so my head went into the ""can't contribute more"" mode.  But I guess I could take a little out, like 4k (25% through the year, so take out 25% of the max contrib.), and trickle it in throughout the year.  Which is what I plan on doing next year from the beginning."
2021-04-09 13:55:36,stocks,"Not concerned in the slightest, I know it would rebound and if it didn't then we'd all be in deep shit anyway.  Just trying to grow the money as much as possible, viewing it as a growth oppurtunity rather than risk avoidance."
2021-04-09 14:37:30,stocks,"That I am doing as well, figured I could also extend the logic into my existing funds ;)  Thinking i'm going go for a mixed approach with this logic thanks someone else's comment.  Gonna cash out a couple thousand and trickle that in during the drops."
2021-04-09 13:21:07,stocks,"Why is it stupid?  Playing devils advocate as I gave my rationale, which is a market crash isn't inevitable and their are signs it may happen again soon.  So what's your counter reasoning?"
2021-04-09 13:47:59,stocks,I don‚Äôt think they want to sell to buy GME. They are worried GME will crash the whole market and want to be in cash.
2021-04-09 14:56:35,stocks,"Perhaps, but curiously GME has surged higher during some corrections."
2021-04-09 17:09:03,stocks,"If he thinks GME can crash thr market, his skill level isn't high enough to touch options"
2021-04-09 13:34:12,stocks,"I am in GME with my standard brokerage account, but not with my IRA.  This question has nothing to do with GME directly, only regarding a hypothetical crash and whether I should ""liquidate"" my long term investment in anticipation."
2021-04-09 13:32:40,stocks,You have no clue.
2021-04-09 14:23:40,stocks,"That's a snazzy tag line.

Did you invent that?"
2021-04-09 15:44:41,stocks,"I appreciate the sentiment, but I can afford 1k.  Only intended a few months of idling with a 30k account.  Regardless, I'm pulling a few thousand out that probably should have been trickled in throughout the year regardless."
2021-04-09 13:52:40,stocks,Tsunamis terrify the shit out me.
2021-04-09 14:38:20,stocks,Lol truly can't tell if sarcasm or not.  But I'm gonna pull out a few thousand for this logic instead of the full account.  Acting as if i didn't max it out on the first day of the year.
2021-04-09 15:56:10,stocks,"Honestly, I considered the March dip the ""crash"".  Not every week an index fund loses 25% of it's value."
2021-04-09 17:13:16,stocks,"That's the problem. They thought it was going to keep dropping, and instead it recovered... alot more. But throughout this past year, they were still clinging to ""oh it'll crash eventually"". So not only did they lock in losses, they also missed out on a year's worth of gains by being delusional."
2021-04-09 16:44:58,stocks,Don't forget the 7 layer dip on the way to finding the bottom.
2021-04-09 15:03:31,stocks,"I wouldn‚Äôt mess with your Ira. Just keep adding. If you really worry about the crash, just save up some extra money and if there is a crash, you can buy stuff in a taxable account"

The market is rumored to crash every year by thousands of people. If you listened to these hints and pulled your money for 5+ years, you'd have missed on 5 years of gains. Leave your money in and stop trying to time it."

2021-04-09 13:22:53,stocks,My counter to you is that your reasoning isn‚Äôt strong enough therefore mine still holds due to decades of studies on market returns.

Just defending your right to ask without it being a religious dogpile, as it seems to be with the clerics of bogle, here.

Ultimately, it's our money and if other people don't like what we do with it, they can piss up a rope.
My life's methodology is to ask questions, listen to answers, try to read between the lines for hidden motivations or reasons to doubt the data, and ultimately keep or drop the components that will or will not work for me. 
I'm about to get a $450K windfall that I worked a long time to realize.  Probably half will go into VTSAX, as it appears that QE and governmental support will continue for another year or two at least.  Not to mention the renaissance of a strengthening economy.

Probably half will sit in cash to see if I am wrong about that."

The younger someone learns this slogan is false, the better."
2021-04-09 13:25:46,stocks,"Not to be a dick, but your first comment had no substance.  No numbers, figures, anecdotes, nothing.  And this comment is the same.  You didn't provide anything other than ""listen to me, i know better"".  Which possibly you do, but I want to know what you know that says this idea is as ridiculous as you make it sound.  I'm not a child, ""mommy says so"" doesn't fly anymore."
2021-04-09 15:02:21,stocks,"I'm not endorsing the theory, but I can explain it, and it's not what you're saying.  The theory is that synthetic shorts are wildly overdone, and that changes to DTCC along with a share recall will expose the extent and leave some influential players with enormous losses.  Then it's a question of whether that contagion spreads.  

It might sound like poppycock, but consider that since the theory emerged, GME caused at least 3 huge players to blow themselves up, two of them (Melvin and RH) to insolvency, and one of them (Citadel) to require a massive emergency weekend bailout by one of their enemies.  That's not normal, and all three players lied going into the collapses that they were fine, and have since been less than truthful about what happened.

Then we've had a couple more major implosions that have not been specifically tied to GME, but nobody would be overly shocked if that were to be confirmed."
2021-04-09 14:48:31,stocks,"9 billion market cap is not small cap broski.

I do agree if the GME situation does squeeze again due to synthetic shorting it will likely cause select stocks to crash, not the market, due to select hedge funds being margin called (eg another archegos)"
2021-04-09 15:14:21,stocks,That doesn't matter though.  It matters not to me if my share of ABC goes up 50% due to correlation or causation.  It's still a 50% gain whatever the reason.
2021-04-09 13:52:30,stocks,"If you can‚Äôt correctly time a market crash, you‚Äôre just not making the predictions enough. Michael Burry has called 13 of the last 2 crashes for example. EZPZ"

Because if I didn't then I 100% agree with everyone saying this is a ludicrous idea as any normal time wouldn't have this scenario.  I haven't mentioned it until someone else did in which case I clarified what I meant.

2021-04-09 18:22:15,stocks,Haha. This guy ^ knows
2021-04-09 14:34:19,stocks,"It's a good t-shirt platitude, but it has lost all but the most basic meaning.

It's patently false, but requires a lot of tuning of assumptions and parameters.  Absolutely 100% wrong that time in the market beats timing the market, if you have absolute facts.  A perfectly delivered time-traveled certainly buy will 10,000% beat the market.  Look at DFV and GME, and that was just some insight and a whole lot of balls.

It's just that for most schlubs without training, better research and access, tools and cojones than the army of pros, your likelihood of success in trying that approach is extremely small.  Time in the market is just accepting defeat, admitting you're weak and stupid and cannot do better than the rising tide of an average market and average intelligence.  OK, just admit that, because it is equally true.

For the vast majority of people, just let the market do what it wants, let it take you with the rising tide and accept your 9% gratefully. You're just riding the coat tails of others. And that's fine.  We need those people, too.
 
Get rich quick gamblers won't be satisfied with that.  Some will win. Some will lose.  Some are born to sing the blues.  But the story never ends, it goes on and on and on and on."

Congrats to you!  May want to wait a couple months to make that 50% investment ;) ;)"
2021-04-09 17:03:41,stocks,"> doing nothing BUT trying to time the market, every second of every day

Afaik most traders are paid with set fees, not investment gain percentages. Most money managers' incentives have nothing to do with fiduciary duties and over the century they made bank on everything from trade commissions to activity percentages to every scheme in the book to dry out money from the investors. 

This is why total stock market index funds are so dominant, because most people *have* woken up to the risk or effort it takes to buy stock and beat the market and it's far comfier to just plop money into VTI and watch it rise every year."
2021-04-09 13:35:28,stocks,"Unless the market crashes so bad that you can't even fathom the world having an economy, all that will happen is that any S&P/NASDAQ/DJ/China Market ETF will be at a discount to what it was the day before the crash. That means that you can buy more of it with cash on hand. If you don't have cash on hand, don't worry. you can make more. If you are legimiately out of a job. Don't worry, just don't sell your shares and keep accumulating more because the indexes as a whole WILL ALWAYS GO UP.   


Inflation, money, population, economy will always drive up the market. Always. You may have a couple bad years but take a look at the charts. Historically it will go up. If you're worried about a crash, don't play the market and just put your money in a bank."
2021-04-09 13:33:46,stocks,"Of course, I don‚Äôt take offense to any of this.We are having a discussion and being straightforward. 
I don‚Äôt have to provide data because what I‚Äôm saying is common knowledge. So yes, I said so so it works in this case. It‚Äôs not even what I say, it‚Äôs literally vanguard, fidelity, finance research articles, and even modeling it out in excel yourself can get you your answers. I‚Äôm not gonna spend time looking up numbers for you cos you‚Äôre not a child and can do that yourself. So take it or just lose out on more gains in the long term. You are asking cos you don‚Äôt know better, so just just listen. If you are so convinced about your idea, then do it. Watch yourself lose out on gain. You clearly don‚Äôt understand the market mechanism enough so just take the common knowledge and go with it. I personally lost money doing what you are suggesting. Lost money meaning losing out on gain not taking actual losses. IM VERY SURE THE MAJORITY WILL AGREE WITH ME"
2021-04-09 19:10:04,stocks,"It is poppy cock..  those institutions you mentioned were not driven to Insolvency xD are you kidding me?  They are richer than before all this.

&#x200B;

There is also no evidence that they are 'all over' GME.  Quite the opposite.  The fact that you cant prove otherwise shows you dont know what youre talking about.

&#x200B;

GME absolutely cannot tank the market, period.

&#x200B;

And for the most part the ""MOASS"" squeeze is not possible anymore because short interest is NOT even close to 100% now.  Yeah there can be small squeezes still, but nobody is going bankrupt or losing billions over it anymore."
2021-04-09 15:08:31,stocks,Well first isn't a synthetic short a options combo. Also idk who these big players are again as far as I know according to basically every SI metric the short intrest is so low.
2021-04-09 14:51:10,stocks,"Dude you are talking about a market worth 85 trillion, so yea 9b is very small. Also I don't follow gme but it's over dude there are no more shorts, the SI is down so much."
2021-04-09 15:16:59,stocks,"What? You said gme curiously goes higher during corrections, which implies you belive it goes up during corrections. I said that correlation dosnt equal causation in this case because the two are completely separate. So I just don't get why you are now saying you don't care whether it goes up in a correction which is diffrent than your previous comment so I'm confused."
2021-04-09 14:56:53,stocks,"> I'm relatively safe if the market crashes from say... GME? .

> With GME doing its whacky stuff, and the possible effects it could have, I feel like this isn't a normal scenario so abnormal moves should be considered."
2021-04-09 17:13:35,stocks,"It is far comfier, true. 

But buying VTI is so incredibly risk averse to the point that it should not be recommended to everyone. People have parroted buying broad market funds so often that we are at the point where people won‚Äôt listen to anything but that."
2021-04-09 17:08:06,stocks,"They spend every second of their career timing markets.  And so do you, in every *other* aspect of life.   The notion that only retail customers shouldn't do this is false, and is a myth devised by entities who profit the more this misperception thrives."
2021-04-09 13:41:43,stocks,"Don't get me wrong, I understand long term returns, and this move isn't derived from concern but from trying to squeeze out as much money as possible that I can.  If the market crashes and I make the move, then in 2 years I may have 40k (Guessing it drops 30%, time the dip well, and excluding contributions and yearly return).  If it doesn't crash, then I may have 31k (again ignoring yearly return as really just calculating a 3 to 4 month unrealized loss)."

Keeping in mind, I only have a measily 30k in the account.  My loss of gains is only 1k, which frankly isn't a big deal.  I probably wouldn't do it if I had 10k+ potential loss on the line, but for me it's 1 week's pay check."

It might crash, there‚Äôs always a chance. It probably won‚Äôt anytime soon though. Historically a crash hasn‚Äôt happened within 8 years of the last crash (I might have the number a little off, but it‚Äôs something like that)."
2021-04-09 13:51:11,stocks,"> if you had hints of a crash

Bro people have been literally calling for a crash every day for the last 50 years. Hell, you should have seen it last March when tons of people cashed out thinking the market will go back to the stone ages. Those same people are still on the sidelines and every day on here calling for a crash when the market goes down .01%. The reality is, no one knows. 

Human psychology is weird. If an item's regular price is $100, people won buy it. But if the store doubles the price and puts it at 50% off, people suddenly think it's a bargain. Same with the market. People keep saying ""cheap prices"" a month ago at the sell off, but they refused to buy it at half the price last March."

And to make a very long story short, as a brokerage RH has obligations related to the positions and in the case of GME, Robin Hood was dangerously under capitalized, and became insolvent.  That's why they needed the bailout billions, and why they imposed corrupt ""reduce only mode"" conditions and changed margin rules on the fly.  Of course, their CEO lied and said ""there was no liquidity problem"" despite going insolvent and needing a massive liquidity bailout to survive the day."

In theory, having a portion in cash, prepared for intelligent opportunism in the event of a crash and potentially the need for a larger emergency fund is fine.  Only you can understand how valuable these intangibles are to you.  That seems to be something that the armchair pundits fail to acknowledge.

At one point, my Dad had $400K sitting in a bank account doing nothing.  I said ""Geez, Dad, you missed out on extreme gains in the biggest bull run in half a century.""  He said, ""It doesn't matter, the capital is still all there.""  I saw the lost potential if it were all in AAPL, AMZN, etc.  He saw the value of knowing his money was safe, even if it was being slowly eroded like the grand canyon. 

I was greedy (with this same nest egg, actually) going into COVID last year.  I misjudged my need for an emergency fund, and panicked a bit.  I pulled back to 30% cash at a loss.  The gains since have erased that loss, but the cash is now more costly than it's face value.  Yet, it had value to me, and I paid for it.   And if it dropped hard again, i could have leveraged that money, in which case it might have turned a profit. Ultimately, all that matters is, did I get value for my money?  Did it buy me security, peace of mind, growth, opportunity? Money is only a tool to help the living. It's not a good reason *for* living."
2021-04-09 16:03:08,stocks,"I was paying attention. Crash start on Feb 21. At that point there were 35 cases in the US.

I had no reason to think that was the end of the dip."

EV/EBITDA currently hovering around 8, while the alcoholic beverage industry for decades has averaged 18-20. Companies like the Sam Adams Company who have pounced on the fast-growing hard seltzer market have seen EV/EBITDAs in the 40s range.

Lots of tailwinds. Reopening of travel, hotels, restaurants, sports, music venues, bars will be a boon to keg sales, as they will need to completely replenish inventory upon reopening (rather than month to month replenishment sales)

They have catalysts in terms of product development, particularly in the hard seltzer space. Big marketing and branding opportunity in their partnership with Coca Cola for the Topo Chico brand. Early entrance into Central America/Mexico/Europe compared to main rivals (Truly/White Claw). APAC is still an unknown, as all seltzers have been slow to move into this geography. They have a wide and differentiated seltzer lineup thus far (Vizzy, Coors, Topo), and are expanding this rapidly.

Coors may be the largest and most well known CPG brand in America, that is trading at or below a 10B valuation. There's been a whole lot of hedge fund fuckery pushing this one down for years, but I'm also picking up a lot of momentum coming in from the other side now. MACD moved across signal line for first time in literal years, and picking up some interesting accumulation by known value-hounds such as Michael Burry. For any well-established beverage company, trading at less than 7x price to pre-COVID free cash flow is absolutely worth a look."

I wouldn't necessarily say it's undervalued yet until we begin seeing prescriptions rolling out. PYR and HPQFF will be moving in tandem as PYR licenses out and owns much of HPQFF, but I'm not expecting any big jumps until the fall or 2022.

I think that the market has been sleeping on this stock and will eventually wake up.

It has 1.2k+ preorders for its products but is heavily discounted because:    
1. PR team basically unexistant (CEO doesn't want to hype the stock like NKLA).    
2. Low revenue, but nothing that's not planned. Deliveries should start at Q4 this year.      
It's also a great long term play (1-2 years) and I think 20-25$ EOY is reasonable  
Bearish analist's low price targets are around 12-13$, currently trading at 10s. 
It's a speculative stock but it does have trucks on the road unlike NKLA."

So back to BABA, China is 100% just making sure BABA stays in check with the ‚Äúmotherlands‚Äù wishes.

They are probably making sure the education isn‚Äôt too westernized and that the company isn‚Äôt becoming too liberal. 

All this said, Alibaba‚Äôs responded with increasing their stock buyback back when Jack Ma went missing lol.

Forward pe is 17x or something within a few years (2023 or 2025) and probably continued growth after.    
They also have their hands in a lot of pies in china and many other companies and them work together on stuff. They continue to grow and sponsor and cultivate these.    
Right now every analyst that covers them says their valuation is around 320. But nobody is buying either due to the uncertainty so.....     
  
The negatives are Political pressure is applied.    
Ant ipo got shot down. Also not considered fintech anymore either or something.    
They're probably not gonna be able to leverage as much or have as much freedom.    
Chinese government has power of persuasion in china. They say baba is bad. Everyone turns their back on it and it dies.    
Today they stepped in and stopped chinese university students doing something sponsored by or to do with Jack ma afaik.    
They're really clamping down on stuff related to him.    
They've already told them they need to divest their media empire or a large part. I don't know how they use it. But it's probably gonna have to be sold at less than fair value...    
    
There's new rules coming in to nyse about naming any board members who are part of the ccp (chinese communist party).    
They can be delisted in the usa if not meeting certain rules.    
    
Right now if feels like ccp is pressuring them to get in and control some aspects like they do other companies.    
If they don't they could look weak in china, If they do, internationally it looks and and they risk delisting potentially..

We know that online retail is the future (Amazon), and Alibaba is poised to sweep in in markets where Amazon still doesn't have a firm foothold.  Not least of which is China.

Of course, you've also got the constant narrative of ""what about the CCP!?!?!"", which is indeed a fair question to ask.

Its entirely possible the current administration backs away from the antagonistic approach the last admin took and that we are able to rebuild the relationship, however I am doubtful, as its not really in China's best interests at the moment. Something as ""simple"" as a strong message from the US re: Uighurs, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc could elicit blowback. Not to mention some N. Korea or East China Sea BS.

Second: your actual question.  At 52 (me) as far as ETF's are concerned that is not what I'm thinking about, if I knew now what I do when I was your age, I would look at the last 10-yr performance of an index fund.  You can't touch it for \~30 years without penalty (i.e. Roth at 59 1/2).  Think the long term game, not the hot item today.

At the end of the day, the risk level is not much different, but to say VTI isn't riskier shows a gross misunderstanding of growth potential and market volatility. Lower cap allows for more growth potential and higher volatility..

If you buy another stock to gain more dividend pay, it would still take you 23 years to break even. Am I missing something? I learn about something, maybe a few things, and then all of a sudden they make no sense to me and I can't grasp a single concept. This goes for all the different types of strategies and what not. I feel I make progress in learning and then take 20 steps back. I could receive such great advice and tips, I feel I understand it and then I fall into back into the pit."
2021-04-09 11:48:35,stocks,"it's not about breaking even, it's about passive income. If you own 50,000 stocks x .234mX12 month = that's 11,700/m (140,400/yr) in income that you are generating without doing anything other than owning the stock."
2021-04-09 12:51:37,stocks,"It doesn't take 23 years to break even. It takes 23 years to double your money, assuming you don't reinvest dividends and the stock price doesn't move"
2021-04-09 12:15:12,stocks,"What do you mean ""break even""? dividends are 100% passive income. If the stock price is not overall down, dividends are positive returns. Buying a share for $65.22 means you still own that share worth that amount of money, you are not down anything and there is nothing to break even towards. What you seem to be calculating is how long it would take one share to give you a 100% return on dividends. 23 years seems about right...

If you bought 1 share of O, you are getting a monthly dividend payment, most recently of $0.23 or $2.76 per year, which equates to about a 4% annual return. all for doing nothing, and importantly, actually realized gains. you were paid that. you didn't have to sell the share to get your money, in one year you realize a 4% return

What you are also ignoring on your 23 year calculation is Dividend reinvestment, or DRIP. You take that $0.23 per share per month and you buy more shares. Then next month, your per share amount is higher. and so on, and so forth. you achieve actual compounding interest effects this way. 

Lets say you buy 10 shares of O. it will cost you $650.22 on those 10 shares you will be paid $0.23 per month, or a total of $2.30 per month. Here is a simple example assuming price and payout are static

First month: $2.30 reinvested, you own 10.04 shares of O

Month two: $2.31 paid, reinvested, you own 10.08 shares of O

Month three: $2.32 paid, reinvested, you own 10.12 shares of O

and so on and so forth... It seems small, it seems slow, but it snowballs.  Which means instead of 23 years, If you reinvest your dividends in O, with all other things being equal, you will achieve 100% gain in 12 years. If you put $650 into O and walk away and never touch it, you will have $1300+ after 12 years strictly on dividends alone."
2021-04-09 11:52:14,stocks,It's the compounding interest as buffet would say. Dividends plus natural stock growth equals value

Also, I think O has raised its dividend yearly. So your payment generally will beat any raise in inflation. Alot of stable dividend companies raise the dividend 5 to 10%a year. Compounded, it a nice number."
2021-04-09 12:24:35,stocks,"Compounding interest. Lets use o as example.. It equals 4.4 percent right now. So, if you own 100 shares, and use a drip, over a year you passively accumulate 4.4 more shares, in addition to the increase of share value. The next year you add even more shares. Use dividend reinvestment to accumulate shares while younger for passi e growth and then switch to straight dividends later for passive income."

2021-04-09 14:04:00,stocks,"Don't forget that dividends also increase over time. One of my stocks paid like 1.50 20 years ago, today it's 9.10. So if you invested 100k, you would have made about around 1.1k per year. Today that would be about 7k, without reinvesting. And total worth would be around 250k. And the total dividend payout around since then around 100k. With reinvesting, you'd end up at a total value of around 410k (if my calculations are correct... so give or take a few %) and a yearly dividend payout of 11.5k. That's at least the past, we'll see about the future ...

&#x200B;

What I really like about dividend stocks is, that a paid dividend is actual profit. It's money on your account. And you can do with it whatever you want. Reinvest in the same company, maybe in a growth company. Or go on holiday :-) - or save it for when the market drops again and your favorite company is cheap to buy. It's a bit like investing in an investment firm instead of an ETF, because they can act anti-cyclical.

And there's companies that always paid a decent dividend for years or even decades, even when the market crashed."

Furthermore, they likely won't go bankrupt because many dividend stocks have been around for years and are proven businesses. Take the other 500k of your worth and invest it in more speculative stocks and you never have to work a day in your life again.

Also you can still sell the shares afterwards. It's like owning an appartment building, you collect rent off of it but it still has value when you sell it."

Facts. However dividends do play an important role in the overall returns of a stock. 



People on here don‚Äôt wanna hear you speak truth about their dividends. People seem to think cash from dividends just appear out of nowhere. You‚Äôll get downvoted on here for saying a simple fact like ‚Äúthe price of a share falls by the amount of the dividend on the ex date‚Äù and then they‚Äôll respond with some made up bs from a YouTuber (*cough* Joseph Carlson *cough*) to try and disprove academic research papers."

A smart long-term hold in my opinion that‚Äôs currently presenting great short-term opportunities. 
(KeyBanc also released a new price target of $518)

Roku, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates a TV streaming platform. The company operates in two segments, Platform and Player. The company operates in two segment, Platform and Player. Its platform allows users to discover and access various movies and TV episodes, as well as live sports, music, news, and others. As of December 31, 2020, the company had 51.2 million active accounts. It also provides digital and video advertising, content distribution, subscription, and billing services, as well as other commerce transactions, brand sponsorship and promotions, and audience development campaigns; and manufactures, sells, and licenses smart TVs under the Roku TV name.

Cup base printed on the daily chart, with #ActSeq crossover to be expected within the week. Decent size gap to fill up to $386. Trading well under February highs."
2021-04-09 14:43:57,stocks,"I'm very bullish on Roku.

Streaming is going to become bigger and bigger and Roku is selling the picks and shovels to this streaming gold rush. Roku doesn't care who wins the streaming war since they will be taking a cut of the money from all of the streaming services so the more new streaming services that get created and the more subscribers that they get, the more money Roku makes just for simply letting them be a part of their platform.

And all the while, they are also collecting tons of data about what people like to watch across all of the streaming services. Netflix only knows what people watch on Netflix, HBO only knows what people watch on HBO Max, etc. but Roku knows what people watch across all streaming services and that data can be sold to advertisers and also used internally by Roku to make better decisions about what exclusive content they should create themselves that would appeal to the largest amount of people."
2021-04-09 11:09:50,stocks,Is Roku all about the growth in ads now? Could someone explain why it‚Äôs taken off?
2021-04-09 11:00:38,stocks,Love this stock and company! Use their products and own their stock.
2021-04-09 16:20:51,stocks,"Also added some roku, passes all the tests for me, I understand and enjoy their product, charts looked bullish and strong fundamentals."
2021-04-09 17:48:50,stocks,"Ive made very nice amount off roku. Good buy.

Anything under 380 is a steal. Under 400 is decent."
2021-04-09 16:49:23,stocks,"Yes but they also already spun profit and announced better than expected future guidance. 

They first secured deals with most smart tvs (lower budgets, Sony will probably always prefer their own, worse OS). Then deals with Netflix Disney, and finally HBO. They get a cut of their money.

They recently bought their own advertisement studio, and will be able to help companies directly make ads to cut out middlemen. 

Look how the internet changed money inadvertisement. Roku has the streaming game locked down and aren't true competitor to the other companies involved such as nflx and dis, those guys will be competing against each other.

Search this sub, much better DD than I can provide. I am very, very large in Roku. I would have dcaed down to 200 if I had to last month, and it already paid off very nicely."
2021-04-09 11:22:15,stocks,I‚Äôm doing more research on that myself.
2021-04-09 11:21:54,stocks,That‚Äôs the way to do it! We love the stock
2021-04-09 16:59:51,stocks,Can you explain the strong fundamentals? For the people that may not have much knowledge on them.
2021-04-09 18:01:54,stocks,Thanks for the info. What‚Äôs the growth like in comparison to peers and does the premium in the valuation fit?
2021-04-09 11:29:55,stocks,"Glad to hear I‚Äôm not the only one trying to piece the puzzle together. 
Here‚Äôs my current take:

Roku makes the hardware that turns your dumb tv into a smart one and provides connectivity to various apps and streaming services. Besides the sale of hardware I assume it makes a small cut in the back end from these developers to host their apps. Now it seems ads are a growing portion of their business which is why people are bullish. Or are people just bullish on streaming in general?

To be honest I find streaming vs cable to be kind of stupid because all you‚Äôve done is cut the cord into each individual fiber, reassembled all these fibers into a new bundle, and have gotten charged effectively the same amount for the privilege. That‚Äôs why I saw Roku at 180 last year and thought it was too rich; at 370, it‚Äôs way beyond that point."
2021-04-09 12:37:44,stocks,"TCL TV‚Äôs also have ROKU integrated in their models so they are inherently smart TVs as well. I have a TCL and it‚Äôs a great brand, very cheap and reliable. 

But that doesn‚Äôt answer the spike. I was watching it this week and it‚Äôs 10+ dollar jump was unexpected. Even with roku recommendations catalyst."
2021-04-09 12:38:47,stocks,"Roku at one time was the only cord cutting player

Now there is stiff competition from Apple, Amazon, google and more!

What makes Roku better?  Hard to say"
2021-04-09 16:56:56,stocks,"Lol sound strategy, wow"
2021-04-09 12:50:25,stocks,"True. My significant other has a Roku and honestly it‚Äôs a bit shitty so I wanted to understand the hype. It‚Äôs super laggy, granted i think it‚Äôs one generation behind the latest, but it‚Äôs awful to use. I personally have a smart tv already that doesn‚Äôt need a connected device so chrome cast or fire stick or Roku aren‚Äôt necessary."
2021-04-09 14:51:59,stocks,"That is not true.

That competition has been there for a very long time. Amazon has offered competing devices since 2014, Google has offered competing devices since 2010, and Apple has offered competing devices since 2007 (before Roku even came to the market).

Yet none of them have been able to take the market lead away from Roku even after all these years and they have not done anything new to give reason to believe that this will change."
2021-04-09 14:10:21,stocks,I live close to Roku HQ.  They have 3 massive buildings all brand new.  I drive by wondering how they are doing.  Looks good.  Financials show they have tripled revenue in just a few years.  So maybe they are doing better than we think
2021-04-09 14:21:30,stocks,Yeah could be. But doesn‚Äôt mean share price is or isn‚Äôt justified. If I wanted to play ad space I‚Äôd go with the heaviest hitters since they trade at reasonable valuations still.
2021-04-09 14:29:32,stocks,"Exactly, and they don't seem to be diversified at all...so this could all come down fast one day"
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"So Biden is pouring $621 Billion into Transportation Infrastructure, what stock are you buying?  Biden is spending $621 Billion in Transportation Infrastructure:

Commercial real estate is sitting on a time bomb. Property owners on 5th avenue alone are owed over 200 million. Then the fact we lost 22 million jobs. Then the inflation factor. Things are about to get expensive. Lumber already is.   Next the fact nobody wants to work and nobody can hire anyone thanks to all the stimulus pumped into the economy.  As for the infrastructure bill. Please. What did Obama‚Äôs 1 trillion do? Nothing. They literally took projects already funded and slapped Obama signs in front of them. I saw it. Or took road cones and put them out and put his sign up. I have no idea where that trillion went. I don‚Äôt even know where the 7 trillion we have spent on covid has gone. Which speaking of its all about climate change. They have a plan for zero carbon by 2050, no air travel, no trans oceanic shipping, etc. That‚Äôs all covid is about.

2021-04-09 14:08:19,stocks,"I think a lot of people on here are disillusioned by the concept of what margin is. Do you not ask for a loan when you need to pay for a car, a house, or something on amazon? You are essentially using debt/margin when you have a credit card. It is your responsibility to have the funds to pay it back at a future date. Do we not make money to be able to afford these purchases at a future date? If you use debt responsibly, it can be a powerful weapon in your arsenal. Therefor, if you see something that has a future rising value potential (e.g. house), would you not ask for a loan to purchase it now and sell it out to pay back your debt and net a profit later? ‚Ä¶ I do not understand this risk aversion to debt. But then again, I was not a part of the 2008 wipeout.

Furthermore, loans on different investment vehicles carry different risks. A loan on a meme stock is very different from a loan in a growth stock which is also very different from a loan in a value stock. Not all loans have the same weight. I only use it when I have a strong conviction that I can earn faster than the margin going rate of 8-9% per year from banks.

For the record, 20% in investment account, 10k in trading. Reason is because if I ever happen to trap myself into a margin call, I have calculated my cash reserve to withstand the hit. And that is if I completely got a trade wrong. My bank only offers me 2x in margin. To the people that play with 5x or 100x on Robinhood, yeah, I would be scarred too if I ever just threw my money in the market and lost a chunk of it in 10 minutes."

What are your thoughts on impact on the company?  Given that the wages at Amazon in Alabama are $15/hour (roughly 2x the legal minimum wage in the state) do you think that had a measurable impact on the results of the vote (employees voting for immediate over long term interests)?

They created obstacles for me finding and getting work. The worst part was that there were a few times that they prevented me from making money that was rightfully mine.

So yeah, I had a really bad experience in my field. Many people in my field hate the union or simply regard it as a necessary evil from which they receive little to no benefit. I never really hear any speak highly of our union (Local 600, Film Production).

I understand it's not that way for everyone though, even within the same industry as me (film production has a few different unions depending upon your job), and I'm happy for those whom it benefits. 

I don't blame the Amazon workers for voting against it though. I think they know very well what their best interests are and I find it arrogant that anyone would suggest otherwise.

Because when a union is optional most of the younger people fail to see the benefit do not opt in and the older do see the benefit and pay dues. What happens is that is the union negotiates contracts for the whole company while trying to do what is best for their due paying members. This from what I have seen leads to younger people not liking the union.

Did the AMZN stock ""bake in"" the potential downside of a pro-Union vote?  I don't think so.

As such, it's the same position for AMZN as last year to last week to tomorrow.  No Union and no material impact upon operating expenses."
2021-04-09 19:39:13,stocks,"I wonder how easy it is to set up a new warehouse. Not just for Amazon, in general. Warehouses in this area of Alabama seem to have entry wages start much lower than Amazon, even unionized warehouses. However they also seem more selective at a glance. Amazon seems to recruit more from other fields. Retail, recent high school graduates, and so on. Their point of comparisons and expectations might be different from the usual warehouse industry of their locality and thus have different expectations in multiple ways, or desire for reform. Though I've heard Amazon also expects harder work for a higher salary. Not sure if that's true or not, other people who work at warehouses sometimes claim Amazon's no different from the average warehouse, but maybe they came from the lower end warehouses.

It's hard to balance limited resources and expected motivation. Motivation is especially tricky. Some people want to be motivated, focused and driven. But wanting it and actually being it to a mild or even high degree is different.

I think unions offer benefits, but also potential risks. Best case it helps the worker and potentially the business, higher salary, easier work, better hours, and maybe more efficient work.  Worst case its another layer of bureaucracy, and the union heads like any leadership position has risk of abuse of power, corruption, nepotism, etc. Some unions charge heavy fees or dues to work any job or even hold a title in the industry, and the bad ones might not give a tangible benefit for those monetary costs and physical restrictions on individual freedom to choose jobs/work. Plus promotion paths. Some dislike promotion paths weighing more on years worked, instead of quality of work. Someone with 20 years experience doing poor work gets more promotions and higher pay/control/leadership posts than someone with 5 years experience who works hard in some systems. That's worst case for it."

2021-04-09 18:01:10,stocks,"Yep, not all unions are great.  Not all are trash.  You have to really look at what you're signing up for and do some critical thinking.

I worked as a manager at a shop where the electrical union came in like a wrecking ball.  Our techs did low voltage work (think cable tv) and made an OK wage if they were good at it and stuck around a while.  Newbies made crap but were on the same scale as the vets, so their pay went up as they stopped screwing up.

The electrical union waited at the end of our street and stopped every van that went by.  They promised a 400% pay increase for everyone, plus benefits.  Sounds great, right? Who wouldn't vote for that?

Some guys were really into it, mostly the 15 or so that were screwing shit up in the field and everyone else had to fix their mistakes.  We held some meetings with the staff to talk about the issues they had, and gave honest answers.  The rest of the staff (about 100 techs) either were against it because they saw through the BS or really didn't give a shit.

So the vote happens.  In our state, it isn't a majority of the staff it's the majority of the *voters*.  So about 20 people voted, with only the ones who were really for it or against it showing up.  The vote was in the unions favor.

What they didn't tell the techs was that they owed dues whether or not there was a contract.  They were now in the union.  So everybody made *less* than they did before, and still didn't make any changes.  The problem guys all left anyway, and everyone else was left holding the bag for 8 years.  About 6 years in, they finally brought a contract up for a vote.  It was the current rate card, current benefit package, and current employee handbook we were already using at the time of the vote.  The union didn't negotiate anything.  Nobody voted for it.

They tried voting the union out, but the union filed several greviances with the state that stalled any vote.  8 years it took for them to let go of our techs.  We warned them...

Immediately after the union was voted out, everyone got a raise.  All the cost of living increases that they would have gotten if they didn't have to go through the union all caught up.  

And the 400% increase they promised the techs?  That was like double **what we made as a company before expenses** and was never going to happen in a million years.

Don't jump on the union bandwagon without really thinking about what you're going to get out of the deal.  Safety? 1000% form a union if the company won't listen.  More money?  Find another job, don't waste your time with a starting a union.  There's probably a reason the pay looks like that.  If everyone in the area is paying that rate, that's the rate.  You'll just end up paying the difference in dues.  Find a way to better your career like taking classes."

All German logistic centers of Amazon have worker's councils (which has a specific legal meaning in Germany) and Amazon is part of a collective bargaining agreement with the union."

Unions have a lot of drawbacks, and unnecessary political bullshit that a lot of people don't want interfering with their work. Unions also polarize workplaces and are outright hostile against people who don't care.

In my country here in the nordics, old unions are legit like a corrupt political party and there's often government-level negotiations with them. They're ironically also the biggest private landlord in the country ripping off working people. Terrible bullshit and luckily young people don't join unions anymore, unless forced to.

Amazon pays very well for work that requires basically no education. Redditors always scream stupid shit like ""oh lol, just walk into a factory and ask for a job, nice tip boomer"". But with Amazon you pretty much can.

Amazon is pretty strict about making sure that workers work, but it's a very fair deal that doesn't need essentially a mafia to extort the company."

As opposed to when it's not optional and the old members continually screw over the young without consequence.  

If the union is optional and they want more younger people to join then it needs to deliver more value to those younger people.  It's no different than any other organization trying to attract dues-paying members."

But in a place where they'd be lucky to get 51% it's not going to.

there's also the simple fact that good workers don't need the union to protect them, and don't see a point to paying a percentage of their salary (plus one time fees) to join a ""service"" they view as unnecessary.

As an example, think the old 'not my job' line.  In a union environment you can literally get written up for doing a task/job that belongs to someone else, or in a way that is contrary to the unions bylaws.

When a union is formed the employees become a separate body within the company that requires negotiations on pretty much every aspect of work, hours, pay, benefits, etc.  And then every x number of years a new contract has to be agreed to, and if an agreement can't be reached a strike can occur.

Again the culture of fear and deprivation to the point of desperation is unacceptable in our market economy considering the vast amounts of ‚Äúwealth‚Äù generated by Amazon‚Äôs activities. There is a fundamental ignorance of unions and propaganda against unions that are very effective at disrupting organizing power. 

My opinion on this is that unions work, the middle class and rich class which are racially stratified, don‚Äôt want unions to work for poor people. To speak against unions in America is really to speak against poor people unionizing not the idea of unions. There are many examples of unions that work very well for their members and has their members comfortably in the middle class. For example the police union, that protects murderers and negotiates insane contracts with cities for pensions and all types of extraneous pay. Who are the members of police unions demographically? Trade unions like the ironworkers union, that‚Äôs your white middle class. Your longeshoremen, your merchant marines. All careers with strong unions that provide incredible benefits.

At the core, Americans and by extension humans don‚Äôt like the idea of other people simply having anything due to zero sum thinking even in times of abundance. For example, People like that they are homeowners and others are not. People psychologically love the difference. The latter point is just not talked about, imo."

Also if the company just fired all the employees, that would be retaliation which is illegal. What are the consequences for such an action? Idk, but this would have been news that was too big for the NLRB to ignore. 

Next, once a union vote is complete, everything gets frozen- no raises, no bonuses, no extra anything, nothing can be taken away (scheduled vacation, such days, etc.), generally no terminations (unless legitimately justified, e.g. not showing up for multiple shifts)- until a contract is negotiated and ratified. Then the company must abide by the terms of the contract which, I can guarantee, among other things will specify a grievance procedure. A grievance procedure is what really prevents companies from unjustly terminating employees.

3. If a company has a persistent problem of workers pissing in bottles and shitting in bags that's obviously a result of the company's policies"

2021-04-09 12:53:15,stocks,"The customers will be served by other FC's around the country. When you order something it is not necessarily coming from your area. It could be coming from 3 states away or even the other side of the country. Amazon can get you a package from anywhere in the lower 48 to anywhere in the lower 48 in 1 day. There is even a system already in place for disruptions due to weather or civil unrest. The work will just shift to other FC's.

They would just shutter that building and move it to another airport code.

They would likely never re-open that building.

They would hire and train the locals at the new location. There is a whole team that does nothing but go around opening FC's and training the new teams. Training for a tier 1 job only takes a couple of days and within a couple of months they are full speed. They would also probably retain most of the management.

I have no idea what would happen to the vote, but I doubt they would ever re-open that building again."

Why even leave it up to a vote then? Isn‚Äôt the point of a vote to allow people to decide for themselves? The people there have decided. Maybe you think they would be better off with a union, but they don‚Äôt think so. And luckily, it‚Äôs their choice, as it should be. It‚Äôs insulting to insinuate that people ‚Äúvoted against their own interests.‚Äù Issues like this are not cut and dry. There‚Äôs long lists of both pros and cons. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a spectrum of opinions and views on this topic. It may hurt them in some ways, but they think that not having a union is overall beneficial."
2021-04-09 17:25:02,stocks,"Sorry about the delayed response. 

Let's assume that you are correct and they close that FC and move the work load to another FC. 

What happens when another votes to unionize because there will be others?

Amazon cannot afford to shut down all there FC's. 

Also shutting down an FC takes capital to move the stock, so.... Who are they gonna get to do that given that the they would have to negotiate with a union just to allow people to move out the inventory or pay a fine? 

I believe that if the workers vote to unionize, Amazon will be forced to negotiate. Paying employees a fair wage, setting reasonable metrics, and making the employees' work lives better is not as detrimental to the company as the companies would like the general public to believe. In the end, a cost-benefit analysis would be performed and Amazon would act on that by doing the lesser expensive option."
2021-04-09 17:34:09,stocks,"the example literally set forth today in alabama. They voted against being in a union. But again, i‚Äôm sure you know significantly more about their own personal situations than those individuals!"
2021-04-09 12:15:25,stocks,"So you're saying that 15% failure rate is acceptable? I can agree here as underperforming employees should be singled out and terminated if they cannot get up to standard, but.....

How many of those drivers who are passing their metrics are taking a piss in the back of their trucks to meet their metrics? How many of them shit in a bucket or box to meet their metrics? Do you know?

What if I told you that, in total, 50% of all drivers who meet their metrics are peeing in bottles in the back of their truck and barely meeting their metrics? Is that acceptable? Would that make the metrics unreasonable? Would that change your assessment of the situation?

Amazon doesn't have this data because they choose to turn a blind eye to what it takes for their employees to meet their metrics. They only care that their employees produce and nothing more- just like every other major corporation. 

The reality is that neither you nor I have enough data nor knowledge to properly access the working conditions at Amazon. What we do know is that SOME employees have turned to these tactics to achieve the company's goals so they can remain employed. How many? Idk and neither do you."
2021-04-09 18:16:18,stocks,"I think all of that would depend on the reaction of the rest of the FC's after the message is sent. If it keeps them in line then problem solved. If it didn't discourage other FC's then they would have to re-evaluate. 

Spending capital to move the FC would be acceptable. Everything Amazon retail does is geared toward the customer, not the associate. Unionization would be very bad for Amazon Prime. They would use away teams or contractors to do the move. Amazon has no problem with spending money to improve the customer experience, but they are not going to cave to a union. They are going to run their business the way they want to. Not how some union organizer wants them to.

How much leverage did the workers think they have anyway? They already make twice the minimum wage and have better benefits than most working Americans all for a job that requires 0 education, 0 experience, and 0 skill. These aren't mechanics or craftsmen or something like that. They are easily replaceable. Their value as labor is minimal.

As people I wish they would get more of everything. Most of them work hard as shit. I get twice that and I do very little while I watch them bust their ass all day every day. I would have no problem at all seeing them get the same pay as me. But that's not what my posts are about. Amazon was going to win this no matter what the outcome was. This was the best option for those workers."
2021-04-09 17:36:12,stocks,just because they voted that way doesn't mean its actually better for them to be non-union. is that really one of the examples you were referencing? because that has nothing to do with what i said...
2021-04-09 12:32:54,stocks,"Actually we do. Amazon has a really good reason to make sure their goals are reasonable, they guarantee delivery and lose money when those guarantees are not met. 

And unlike you, I‚Äôve worked in the transportation industry. Some people can do it, some people have absolutely zero chance. It is a very high turnover area and companies are very willing to give anyone with a drivers license a chance. That means lots of people fail miserably."
2021-04-09 18:25:58,stocks,"So you're the manager union busting? I understand your stance now and why you fail to understand the importance of a union for these workers. 

Most of this post feels like you're building up your employees only to beat  them down. How do you live with yourself and look in the mirror everyday knowing you're part of the cause of other humans' suffering? 

Just wow... 

Amazon workers need to unionize nationwide simultaneously. That would definitely give them the leverage they need to put Amazon in its place. 

You sound like an asshole in this post...just an fyi.

What's even more fucked up is that they can unionize without paying dues to the union because it's a right to work state. I doubt anyone mentioned that from either side."
2021-04-09 17:38:03,stocks,why would they vote against something if it would clearly benefit them? Pretty quickly disproven argument here. Thanks for trying though!

You assume I have zero experience based on what knowledge? Again, please share those numbers with me cuz I actually have first-hand knowledge of this bit of info. 

The truth is that you are trying so very hard to justify your stance with little knowledge because you feel like your are an expert based on your anecdotal knowledge of the industry as a whole. You have zero reason to argue with me yet you feel compelled to do so. Why? Why pretend like you are an expert in this field- especially when we both know you're not?

It amazes me how people cannot accept their own lack of knowledge and will choose to die on a hill for no reason."
2021-04-09 18:43:17,stocks,"I'm not anyone's manager. I get paid by the hour too. I just have a valuable skill set. I don't contribute to anyone's suffering. Most of my day is spent shooting the shit with the associates trying to make sure they have everything they need. I know their names and their problems in and out of work. We earn each others trust. Amazon has issues but the narrative that employees are overblown. It's the very vocal, very small minority that gets the attention. I believe that is on display right now in Alabama with a quantifiable result.

When other companies or the Federal government raise their standards, Amazon will raise their bar as well just to stay on top. People don't need a union for that. They need to quit voting for dickheads."
2021-04-09 17:42:52,stocks,"because they believe that it wouldn't benefit them? do you think people always vote for the thing that benefits them the most? do you really think every person is such a rational actor?

the fact of the matter is, when you're in a union, a third party protects your wage, your benefits, and can protect other things such as your employment status. when you're not in a union, you may get such things from your employer, but they can take it away any time. they also aren't required to increase wages or benefits like they would be if they're contractually obligated, as in the case of their employees being unionized. 

i think i've given you more than enough honest conversation here for you to continuously write me off in such a petulant manner."
2021-04-09 12:52:49,stocks,Keep trying. You are really good at making yourself look awful.
2021-04-09 19:25:49,stocks,"I notice you didn't deny the union-busting, and I find that curious. 

You claim to have earned these people's trust, but have you ever abused that trust by conveying misinformation? 

I believe that you genuinely believe denying a union was the best action for the associates, but I guess we will have to wait for a prosperous vote you find out in the future. The unions aren't going away. 

Now for my unionizing story-
 I got hired on with my former company just as my position became union. The pay when I applied was 16/hr max pay with okay benefits and very little other benefits (for example they had technicians regularly work 70 hours per week). After unionizing, a contract was negotiated for 20.54/hr max pay with defined raises from one's starting pay. Benefits became amazing $10/month ($60/ mon precontract) for a ppo w/ a $400 deductible ($1600 pre contact) and $2500 max out of pocket ($11000 pre contact). Weekly hours were capped at 54 hours. There were many weeks I told my manager to ""fuck off"" and that i wasn't coming in for my next shift because I was capped on hours. 

In addition to this, I was a union steward and executive board member. I saved multiple people's jobs and got punishments reduced via the contractual grievance process.

I have this person's permission in writing to talk about his grievance. In this grievance, a technician had his personal phone stolen out of his pocket while being battered by his manager. At least that's how I presented it during the grievance meeting as the manager reached into a technician's pocket (battery) to retrieve the phone (theft). After I threatened to call the cops and discussed the company's policies on battery and theft once he admitted it during a recorded conversation, he happily back paid the technician for the 5 day suspension the technician received for having the phone on his person (this is against company policies). 

Whereas in that particular story, no one was doing what the company's expected of them, I have dozens of stories similar to this one- many where there was no fair on behalf of the technician.

There aren't many things I am completely sure if, but I am one hundred percent sure that this same garbage happens to Amazon employees too. Some of these interactions result in firings/suspensions that would be prevented if the right steward were to handle grievances for them. 

Unionizing isn't only about the tangible or monetary, immediate benefits for these people, it is for the future employees and the wronged employees who otherwise have no voice and no say in working conditions and/or discipline.

I didn't proofread, so sorry if there are any significant errors. I'm sure any Swype typing errors can be deciphered fairly easily."
2021-04-09 17:49:46,stocks,"do i think every person is a rational actor? no. do i think if you have a sample size of hundreds and they vote overwhelmingly against something that is therefore more rational than single individuals? of course i do.

I'm at a very comfortable level where I make a managers salary but without the hours and bullshit they have to deal with. If my building wanted to vote for a union then that is their business. I would have a vote just like every other hourly employee. Not one word has been said to me by management about watching for union talk and due to my position I probably have my finger on the pulse of the workers more than anyone else in the building. 

Amazon associates already have everything you listed that your union fought for except for the max pay. I think they top out at just under $20 and they start at $15. 

For the grievance story, that manager would have been fired by the end of the day. No need for extra paperwork and procedure. It would have been on camera and Loss Prevention would have been all over that."

And I like to have some extra feedback on what people think of my choices. I'm 21 years old so I can have a little risk and have the time to wait.

My picks for now are (prices between brackets are estimated in euros)

8 shares of Volkswagen (1980), because of their growing EV share and their investments in this technology

5 shares of Apple (547), because I do believe Apple will stay for a little while and I do not own any apple shares at the moment

5 shares of Microsoft (1000) same reason as with apple, do not own any Microsoft 

6 shares of Disney (950), Also I love Disney, believe in their diversified product, and still see some potential to grow in the future 

400 shares (1000) of International consolidates airlines group, I already own a bunch as a Corona play, I believe the stock will raise when we can fly again, the airline is too big en too import to fall for now in my opinion. 

then ill still have a little over 600 euros (or a little more) to spend where I'm really curious what to pick then. 

\- I was thinking about buying (yes i know spacs bleh) some MUDS because of their merger with Topss with a great valuation

\- Maybe Maxar technologies Because it still has potential and space 

\- Corsair because of the potential

\- Or ABN AMRO (a dutch bank) who still has some problems thanks to COVID

I would like to hear everyone's opinion on this list, or maybe you know a stock that's not on the list for the remaining 600 euros I would also like to hear it in that case!

Airline stocks are all priced in and most have a higher valuation than pre corona as markets are forward looking (look at market cap, not share price).  I‚Äôm personally starting to exit most of my airline positions but I‚Äôve recently opened a position on Aercap due to their acquisition of GMs aeronautics division and their market dominance, it‚Äôs sort of a ‚Äúspread the risk‚Äù play.

VWAGY is solid but there‚Äôs inherent risk if you‚Äôre looking for a pop in the price for the EV play.  That whole area is a bit iffy right now as it matures and the small companies get eaten up.

now, i am talking about bottom up research, and i believe that mr buffet does not utilize internet screener tools , so to sum up my question , how the fuck does he find them, i am not a value investor but i will use the answer, so have a good day.
And how are you finding stocks growth and value investors of reddit"

2021-04-09 11:01:19,stocks,"I‚Äôm always amazed that Buffet can find these diamonds in the rough like Apple, American Express and Coca Cola. 

His analysis must be extraordinary to find these little known companies."
2021-04-09 08:56:10,stocks,Most of his findings are done at all you can eat buffet‚Äôs.  Getting there first will give you the advantage to eavesdrop which is all the research and dd you need to find that next Amazon.
2021-04-09 08:31:39,stocks,"Buffet has thousands of employees, and can call the CEO of any company on speed dial. He will always have an advantage of you."
2021-04-09 08:53:24,stocks,"Actually they probably do use screeners (probably their own algorithms though).  The thing is screeners are not DD.  They give you a list of possibilities.  From there you do your own DD and dig into the company.  Figure out what they do, how they actually make their money, what the prospects are for growth etc.  Digging into the numbers etc.  For the big guys that involves looking at lots of factors, projections, probabilities etc.  Finding companies that meet your criteria that you might be intersected in can be as easy as using a screener.  The actual DD and deciding that indeed this company is worthy of your investment is the hard part and where Buffet and others have succeeded."

2021-04-09 19:53:36,stocks,"Buffet is an odd duck.  At one time he used to read the financial statements of hundreds upon hundreds of companies a year.  By all reports he has a fantastic memory and if anyone brought up a public company, he had likely read its financial reports, perhaps for years, and knew all about it.

These days the only companies that can move the needle for BRK are very large companies.  There are a much smaller number of companies he needs to be familiar with."

I think this has something to do with it.  I would guess he runs a kind of multi-level marketing racket.  In a good/productive, not shady way.  I.E. he has big wrinkly brains that work under him.  They hire medium wrinkly brains.  The medium wrinkly brains hire small wrinkly brains.  The small wrinkly brains hire interns.   From there it works up the line.  Interns are each required to bring 10 good prospects to small brains.  The small brains pass 10% of those up to medium brains, the medium brains pass 10% up to the large brains.  The large brains send any they feel strong on to the big guy.  If he likes the ideas enough times the medium brain might promote to large brain."

2021-04-09 13:05:11,stocks,seems like you need to improve your reading comprehension first

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Is anybody else like me and almost always votes against executive compensation during AGM season? It seems pretty ridiculous that the directors of a company - often c-suite executives for another company already - can set forth a remuneration for an executive team valued in millions (either dollars outright, DSUs, options, or warrants) and then dip into the kitty for themselves.

I think it's dumb that these votes on ""our consideration, if advisable, to pass a resolution to accept the approach to executive compensation"" are recommended as ""FOR"" and that these votes often receive 95+% acceptance from shareholders. 

People should look more into executive compensation. Many investors will never have as much in their account in their lifetime as many directors are receiving in a single year just for playing an advisory role to a company that may not even be their primary focus throughout the year.

Something to think about."
2021-04-09 10:05:57,stocks,"I'm 72 and also vote against any board member over 70, any board member who is a former politician and any board member who's backround experience isn't related to the main business of the company."
2021-04-09 08:50:31,stocks,I vote against it. I also vote against politicians on the board. I know it‚Äôs common practice but fuck those political revolving doors.
2021-04-09 11:01:39,stocks,"I work for a publicly traded company that opened a second publicly traded company, both governed by the same CEO and board. The original company posted profits, but siphoned hundreds of millions of those profits into the second company and decided to post it as an under performing/loss year on the first company. 

The result was hundreds, if not thousands of layoffs on company 1. Wage freezes or roll backs, compensation package rollbacks, increased work load, and differed maintenance on company assets. 

The CEO was given a one time $9mil bonus, and increased annual compensation from $4m to $6m. The bonus was almost exactly the salary figure of the laid off employees."
2021-04-09 08:00:03,stocks,I think these are usually framed in a way that no response defaults to the board recommendation.
2021-04-09 09:27:06,stocks,I voted against all the proposals from my holdings. You are not alone.
2021-04-09 09:27:04,stocks,Yes. I always vote against the executive compensation. They're overpaid
2021-04-09 08:57:21,stocks,The thing is most of the votes are coming from insiders and institutions and most just want to agree with the board.  The board is made up of executives of other companies that figured out long ago that if this executive makes more money than I can justify making more money myself in comparison which is why the board agrees executives should make a lot of money and then actually come up with the ridiculous figures in the proposal you are voting on.
2021-04-09 10:03:36,stocks,"I have been downvoting executive compensation packages ever since the FTC or whichever alphabet caused these to be put up for an ""advisory"" vote.  

You didn't ask but I also almost always vote for any shareholder proposal that is put forth.  It used to be just me and the Dominican nuns voting our shares to reign in management, then the unions started voting their shares conscientiously.  

Some day, before I die, I hope the mutual funds start voting their shares thoughtfully instead of just supporting management without question."
2021-04-09 09:16:34,stocks,This is exactly why retail trading is soooo important.
2021-04-09 12:54:01,stocks,"Yes. I also don‚Äôt understand how someone is permitted to be a high level executive of one company, and a board member of a major competitor, like Apple and Google."
2021-04-09 11:47:06,stocks,I do. They make enough already.
2021-04-09 15:27:17,stocks,"I used to think this way, but I‚Äôve since thought otherwise. 

Say you manage to get the entire board of directors and c suite turned into volunteer positions just because fat cats shouldn‚Äôt get fatter and social justice and all. Take all that money and then spread it out across the whole company stock. 

For AAPL you‚Äôd need to cut nearly 17 billion in salaries to bump the stock price $1 which is just a fraction of a percent. 

On the flip side, you‚Äôve just made Apple very unappealing for the fat cats to work for. And sometimes the fat cats are important to making sure the company is very profitable long term. 

Sure it sucks that a billionaire is making millions and I‚Äôm not, but if you really look at CEO salaries and all and then spread it over who‚Äôs getting ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù so they can be rich it doesn‚Äôt make a huge impact on any one person, but it can make a huge impact in a company."
2021-04-09 10:28:15,stocks,The worst is when the stock is struggling. And y‚Äôall want a raise?! Da fuq
2021-04-09 15:27:39,stocks,"My worse voting experience was for what I call, family REITs.  This is where you see the son sitting on the board that his father chairs.  Or the son-i-l is the CFO, no outside directors.  What I would today consider a red flag but then paid no attention to.

One of the rating groups gave a board member of this REIT a recommended Against rating.  I read it, seemed reasonable and I also voted Against him.  

In one of the rare moments in history, the Director was voted out by the shareholders.  Seeing no obstacle, too unethical to climb, the Chairman declared a board vacancy and appointed the rejected Director to fill the vacant seat.  I sold the stock the Monday following the news story."
2021-04-09 08:11:51,stocks,I always vote against
2021-04-09 08:13:15,stocks,I do it yes.
2021-04-09 14:05:15,stocks,"In 2019 the shareholders of German DAX 30 member Bayer AG voter against the compensation of the management board, because of the poor performance of the group in the years before. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016, you guys may have heard of that. 

I was present during the Shareholder meeting and it was the first time in the history of the DAX (biggest German stock index, buy the way) that shareholders voted to not compensate the MB. What immediately happened was this: supervisory board overruled the decision and the management got compensated nonetheless. 

Sold all my stocks after that except for one. And I'm voting against compensation of MD & SB now every year."
2021-04-09 12:41:36,stocks,I usually vote always contrary to the board recommendations.
2021-04-09 09:08:14,stocks,"It ain't much but it's honest work. I also vote for reports on climate change, with KO a report on sugar content, and it's disappointing to see companies recommend to vote against such things."
2021-04-09 07:31:23,stocks,A GME style movement but to defund top brass across the globe.
2021-04-09 10:19:07,stocks,"I typically vote against all board recommendations. So often it's high compensation, or removing/avoiding transparency, hiring an auditor that's been accused of fraud (or has a significant fraud settlement recently). But it doesn't do anything"
2021-04-09 10:47:32,stocks,They should take the amount they would give as bonuses to execs and just reinvest it into the company. I don‚Äôt think those execs are going to go poor without their bonus.
2021-04-09 10:34:35,stocks,"You can vote with management, I work with and invest in publicly traded companies on the Venture and this is usually what I do.

Of course from experience I can tell you when management gets back in only narrowly it definitely sends a message, so if you want to do that it also works. 

Coordinated takeovers also happen this way but it‚Äôs not guaranteed the new owners will be better than the old, really
Depends on the situation."
2021-04-09 11:10:44,stocks,Against
2021-04-09 14:23:20,stocks,"Board members aren't there for the massive amount of time they put into a Company. At a well-run Company, they are there for a variety of other reasons, which often include things that you and I don't and can't contribute, and aren't a result of any attainable education. For example, family/business/industry connections, technical expertise in the industry, and even connections in D.C. that can directly or indirectly gain the Company access to lawmakers.

These traits are worth huge amounts of money to the Company (think corporate tax breaks as the most extreme example and fast-tracking a drug for approval as a more common one). The argument is that there are many companies that are looking for Board members with these traits, but not many such people exist. Board Members also wield incredible power over management of a Company (obviously), and if there is no consideration coming their way (usually tied to stock on a vesting schedule and subject to restrictions on sale) for their services it becomes, in theory, easier for a Board member to jump ship and take institutional and other knowledge with them.

If they don't offer these compensation packages, other companies will. This is really the only way for non-sexy companies to attract competent people.

That said, all of these top executives make way too much money because they have too much equity. I'm a believer in spreading the equity more throughout the Company's lower-earning workforce (without substituting such comp. for wages).

Last thing I'll say is that these compensation packages are based on consultant firms research and recommendations to a Board committee. The Board will often simply adopt the recommendations of the consulting firm because the comp. package transaction for C-Suite/Board Members are, by definition, interested transactions, and this is the best safe-harbor to avoid shareholder suits."
2021-04-09 16:54:09,stocks,"I've always thought compensation tends to be fairly disgusting, in terms of the sheer amount they get paid and of shareholder value, but also why should they be paid in options or cash?

That money is far better used in dividends, if the executives truly believe in the company they'll hold and buy stock to take advantage of that dividend. This also maximises shareholder value"
2021-04-09 18:19:17,stocks,"This is well said and i dont want my completely off-topic comment to take away from OPs point here, which is valid.


But, having said that, ""something to think about"" or ""makes you think"" is a surefire way to trigger me these days haha. You see a version of this at the start, end, or title of pretty much every conspiracy theory post in social media. 


Again, not relevant to this. I just needed to get that off my chest"
2021-04-09 19:22:45,stocks,If the CEO is growing my shares I want him to stay there.
2021-04-09 11:08:57,stocks,There‚Äôs been a couple vote items recently where shareholders have asked for a report on diversity and/or the gender wage gap of a company and the vote recommendation is No. between that fuckery and the board compensation it motivated me to start voting in each shareholder meeting again
2021-04-09 09:47:09,stocks,"It depends. If a company has amazing directors they need to keep them from leaving. Aggressively paying them is the best way to do that. If a company has been struggling no they shouldn‚Äôt get raises. Director changes can move a company from being great to underperforming quickly. There is a ton of value there. Look at AMD, horrible stock until they changed their leadership. Now they‚Äôve been on an incredible run"
2021-04-09 12:12:01,stocks,"So if it's cash comp, nah.  If it's stock comp, yeah sure.  It gives the exec incentive to create stock value for the company which is what you're in it for isn't it?  You're not investing in a company to just tread water, lose money and lose YOUR money are you?  Neither are they! 

Even outrageously overpaid execs that get 70%+ in stock based comp are looking out for their best interest.  If the difference in having a good year and an okay year is 10-20 million dollars, wouldn't you think an exec with a bigger bonus based on stock value would be interested in producing results that make the stock go higher for you as well?  

I think a lot of people get severely confused at executive comp packages and think they're getting wheelbarrows of cash thrown at them and don't realize that their money is in stock and a direct reflection of the company they work for and their value in the stock market.  Elon Musk isn't a paper billionaire, a whole ton of it is tied up in the value of his companies.  He's not in danger of going to the poor house (aside from the debt secured by Tesla stock in other companies that could technically bring all of his companies down if Tesla were to go under but ANYWAY) but he's also not sitting with that money in a checking account like most people either.  

Some execs are definitely given cash comp that's too high, nobody should make millions in cash per year, but if it's tied to stock and company value, that's kinda what you're after so like... why discourage it?"

I think we as individual investor should have more of a say in who runs these companies."
2021-04-09 15:36:57,stocks,Not the same but similar topic. why would you vote to keep the same auditor? It just increses the risk that there is a fraud that goes undetected becuse a longterm auditor gets lazy and doesnt check everything. In europe they are starting to require companies to rotate auditors every few years to prevent this.
2021-04-09 16:12:57,stocks,"I am shocked with the amount of rules and different types of compensations that they are given. It's pages and pages of the legal terms that ensure that even if the company is left in smoldering ruins, it has to pay directors and officers with its last breath."

2021-04-09 13:39:49,stocks,"I think you are viewing this decision through the wrong perspective. If you're voting as a shareholder, you've put money at risk in this company's stock. Therefore you want the stock to go up (and NOT down). The people who have the most individual impact on the company's ability to perform are the C-suite. And to one of your points, they're probably already wealthy; that DOESN'T mean they'll work for free, but rather that they're going to want a large sum to make it worth their while to come to work and grow the company, rather than chilling on the beach and playing golf all day.

Rather than saying ""they're wealthy, don't pay them"", you should be saying ""incentivize mgmt so that in order for them to win big, shareholders have to win, too"". That means you need to scrutinize how their compensation is structured, not how much the total amount is. If you look at intra-industry behavior, you'll see that mgmt comp structure explains much of the differing behavior of competing companies. Some mgmt teams will be paid if they grow the company, so they'll do lots of acquisitions. Some will be paid to grow EPS, so they'll execute more share buybacks. Pay attention to how they're incentivized, decide whether it's in YOUR best interest as a shareholder and vote accordingly."

2021-04-09 12:25:14,stocks,I look at compensation on a case by case basis...  A favorite stat of mine (this is from 2012 -- I assume it hasn't changed) is that >> 50% of all CEOs had a clause in their pay structure that said they would be paid better than the average CEO!  This guarantees that each of them will get a pay raise every time the issue comes up...  Brilliant!

* How many people in this sub would be willing to work pretty much every day of the year and around the clock?
* How many people in this sub can repeatedly sell in the millions over and over again?
* How many people in this sub could effectively lead thousands of people and still be accountable to shareholders?

That makes sense, because only a small percentage of people actively invest beyond a Roth, index funds, etc. However, if we begin to shift as a country/world to an era in which most people invest some percentage of the money in companies they believe in, ideas they‚Äôre interested in, etc. - then that‚Äôs an entirely different world, one in which tens of millions more people will be putting pressure on companies as shareholders. 

Sure, it might just be a far-fetched dream. But it is supposedly the mission of Robinhood and others, though of course they‚Äôre equally, likely more, motivated by the profit they derive from the so-called ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of investing. I‚Äôm optimistic about this & see a much better society if the median person becomes an investor like the ones on this board who are upvoting this intelligently composed, ethically devoted post about influencing, even if in a tiny way, the ability of a company to put executive compensation above all else.

Also, as a side note: a company that overpays its executives is inherently losing you money by doing so. Even if it‚Äôs making you 25% per year, if it‚Äôs spending 1% on excess compensation, that‚Äôs still losing you that 1% of money that could‚Äôve been returned. This is simplified, of course, but it‚Äôs important.

I read just an equally long response similar to yours by someone else that found a way to articulate his point without getting political. This is not the place bro. 


You linked a study that's outdated. 

And I am not asserting they are overpaid. I never made any such claims. I asserted that it's unjustifiable to seek further increases in compensation when the entire world collectively went into a recession. That's three times now you've tried to assume my or OPs stances btw. 

What is excess greed? This may come as a surprise but excess greed is greed...in excess. When 15-20% of the country is unemployed and a good chunk of the population literally can only stay in their homes longer because the CDC banned evictions, common sense says avoid bad optics and wait at a later time period to evaluate compensation. On top of that many of not all of these executives are obligated for various other types of compensation in stocks so presuming their company is doing well and the street recognizes it then their net worth as a whole increases. But the same does not hold true for their employees. 


Typically in recessions, income inequality tends to increase not just in the economy as a whole but even within the company. https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/corporations_in_the_age_of_inequality.pdf if you observe the chart in page 6 and page 9 and focus on periods of recession, you'll notice the gap starts to accelerate as soon as the recession ends and rinse and repeat. 

The one thing I will say with regards to your last link is I didn't even bother skimming it. So I don't know and tbh care about whether an analysis existed or not. I know who Rand is and I'm very familiar with her work, its the very reason I didn't bother reading if because as previously stated, I and the rest id this sub don't care about debating political ideologies.

2021-04-09 17:37:34,stocks,"Thing is, there's a LOT of good companies out there. You as an individual investor can't possibly research them all and pick the very best ones. So you have to restrict yourself to a smaller area using whatever criteria. The main one would probably be industries that you understand well. Another one could be market cap, whether you focus on mega caps for stable, almost index like gains, or you focus on startups for riskier, potentially more profitable investments. 

Restricting yourself to companies with morals that align with yours is just one filter among lots of others, and unless you have very specific and strict values you should have a large number of companies to pick from. 

And in the end it might be hard psychologically to hold onto a stock when you hate decisions that they make. It can make you feel more bearish because you have a negative reaction, even if those decisions are good for business.

Warren Buffet has a team of smart people helping him, and he has been doing this full time for decades. So if he didn't restrict himself, sure, he could do a pretty good job picking the best overall companies that fit his thesis. But for an individual investor, that's impossible, so filtering by values is just one of many ways of reducing the size of your universe of stocks that you look at."

As far as your unjustified comment. I just explained it. Many of these companies likely had to trim ‚Äúthe fat‚Äù due to the recession putting a burden on their business. Not every company in existence is a cloud company or FAANG. So from a financial, ethics and optics standpoint don't fucking ask for a pay raise during a recession when that money could be better used elsewhere. Pay your employees more who are likely going through a tough time. Or put that money into R&D or M&A or investments in other companies or asset classes (whether or not it was a great idea Tesla buying Bitcoin is a great example). There's better ways to use that money than enriching a few dozen people when *the entire world is in a recession*"

2021-04-09 16:52:31,stocks,"It's funny how ingrained your politics are, that you are unable to see that you're not making any argument at all, you're simply repeating yourself.

Why is it good to pay your employees above what they earned, and not pay yourself what you earned? What is wrong with a few dozen people earning high amounts of wealth when other people are not? Where does this standard of goodness come from? You haven't explained it. You simply assume everyone agrees with you that these things are bad; I disagree with you, earning high amounts of money should be celebrated. During hard times, it should be encouraged. You learned in high school that 'profiteering' is bad. Again, reject these fairy tales.

This is the root of what I brought up in the beginning. That people simply assume executive compensation is immoral rent-seeking. This is a political opinion that needs to be rejected in favor of more rigorous logical and mathematical reasoning.

""excess greed"" ""unjustified wealth"" ""poor employees suffering while rich executives get bonuses"", these are things political people say.

The financial standpoint is justified if people all agree to take these actions, and our priors are executives are underpaid. Bonuses during a recession are OK thus.

2021-04-09 15:14:46,stocks,"I hope the mods keep letting us have this daily thread, even if it loses popularity in posts.

So today GME has crashed pretty hard. We're nearing back into the $150 range.

What's everyones predictions on this? Does it spike back up to around $200 like it did last week (where it had like a 50 point gain in day or something like that)?

Will it fall below $100 and shoot up again to maybe $150 or so?

Maybe it goes back down to $40-$50 and then shoots back up?

Or does it just slowly decline to sub $50 and stay there?

What are your predictions?"

2021-04-09 13:05:59,stocks,"Can someone  give me a rough/quick explanation or direct me to an explanation of what the hedge funds or big shorters might be doing right now with GME? For the sake of me making money, I want to believe that they are freaking out and just trying to buy time as they bleed money, but I don't think that's actually the case.

As you know, anything besides full belief of GME going to the moon is not received well in wsb or r/GME, whether people are just meming or actually believe it. The cynical side of me doesn't think anything big is going to come from this in the end because I'm assuming something is going on behind the scenes that is chipping away at any possibility of some mega squeeze. I just don't know enough about stocks, shorts, or market manipulation to know what that might be. 

I've already sold some shares at a good point to get my initial investment back, so any amount I sell my other shares for is pure profit at this point. I'm just along for the ride now. It would just be nice to know the feasible scenarios that could come from this."

2021-04-09 13:44:41,stocks,"I don't know why there has to be any conspiracy that hedge funds are doing anything to manipulate the stock. I think that's just a story the wsb folks come up with to make it seems like they're part of an important mission to destroy evil hedge funds. When it's mooning it's easy to get people to buy, but without that you need a good story.

The short interest isn't particularly high like it was earlier this year, and there's the looming dilution of up to 3.5 million shares, which seems like it would help quash any short squeeze.

My guess is much of the wsb crowd that pumped up the stock are slowly cashing out. After a few days of seeing a stock trade down or sideways, it's psychologically difficult to hold on while the rest of the market is booming. That's the problem of relying on retail investors to pump of a stock which is detached from any fundamentals. They're fickle. If GME made sense at the current price, institutional investors would be buying it up too.

I'm bearish, so take what I say with a grain of salt. But this is part of why I'm bearish."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about choosing a brokerage I‚Äôve seen a number of threads across several investing-related subs discussing which brokerages people prefer.  They usually cite things like quality of user interface, availability of stocks, helpfulness of customer support, and/or low-no commission.  I walked away realizing that it is (almost) all about personal preference, but without knowing if there are actual quantitative reasons to choose one brokerage over another- besides price of course.

So, I want to ask: What are some things to consider when choosing a brokerage that a newbie could easily overlook, other than what I‚Äôve listed above?

To that point, say you find a new brokerage whose services you think are superior to those of your current brokerage.  Is it worth paying the $75ish transfer fee (obviously depending on the brokerage) to have your portfolio transferred to the new service?

I‚Äôm asking the question generally, but to be more specific I began trading/investing about a year ago using Robinhood.  Now that I‚Äôve grown more comfortable, I‚Äôm looking for something a little more... _robust_.  Could I actually benefit from the move or would it be pointless?

Again, I realize that personal preference is a big factor in this decision, but I‚Äôm seeking advice anyway to make sure that I‚Äôm not missing something.

(No one in my immediate family/social circle has investing experience or I would talk to them.  Instead, I‚Äôm asking strangers on the internet, I imagine a lot of people on this sub can relate.)"

2021-04-09 10:19:41,stocks,"I've been investing for over 30 years.  My 1st broker was Merrilly Lynched, I wouldn't recommend them to the dying dog of the person I hate the most in this world.

From there I went to Olde Discount which was a Detroit based broker, I believe.  From there to Muriel Siebert, the first lady of Wall Street. 

And now I am with Wells Fargo Advisors.  Everyone loves to bash WF and they deserve it.  But their platform is awesome, easy to use, chock full of useful information.  

I went with them because 10 years ago they offered me 100 free trades, per year on each of my 3 accounts.  Back then, that was a bargain.  Now there is no limit.  

What I have come to love about WFA is their platform.  I tend to buy and hold.  For instance, I have 500+ shares of MRK.  I started buying it 15 years ago.  WFA lists my whole share count, then by expanding I can see each purchase, the date, the cost and both the current yield and the effective yield of the dividend based on the price I paid for each lot.

I don't know how one goes about checking out a platform, in advance, but if you can find friends who use the platforms you are considering, do ask if you can try them out.

To me information is what I value the most.  How much I can find out without going to another website is very important for my style of investing."

2021-04-09 06:53:16,stocks,"Yes, move to a more reputable brokerage that you can actually get on the phone.

Which one specifically depends on your situation.  You‚Äôll need to do some digging.  For instance Fidelity and TD both offer 401k and HSA services.  If you get those through your work it may be beneficial to lump it together to get good service as a large account.  Vanguard offers lowest fee mutual funds on the market.  Schwab offers Amex platinum benefits after a certain account size.  These are all depending on your situation."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Universal Music Group IPO / Spin Off Hey Guys,

so I was looking to Invest into the Universal Music Group spin off hopefully later this year.

Tencent recently bought 20% of the Company at a 30 Billion Valuation, so Vivendi decided in February to Spin Off 60% of Universal Music Group to Investors. I assume the offering price for the company will be around 30 bln as well since the Tencent purchase only happened recently.

As far as I understand they will distribute Shares of UMG to Vivendi Shareholders via a special asset dividend. It is also mentioned, that they will List the Stock onto the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

Does this mean, that I have to own Vivendi Shares in order to receive Universal Stocks at IPO or will I also be able to buy them directly on the Stock Exchange on IPO Day without owning Vivendi Stock?

Thanks alot!"
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Anyone else feel like Tesla will become huge for the same reason Apple did? Their products aren't anything special in terms of hardware but they make up for it in user experience and ""luxury"". They both have a cult following. Their products are desired by most people under 30. They both experience major competition from massive companies (google's android vs Apple and every car manufacturer vs Tesla) yet both are seen as the height of luxury for their respective industries. Despite the stupid valuation and P/E ratio, Tesla probably will produce the best EVs in a couple decades, and they will be cheaper."

2021-04-09 09:24:27,stocks,"I actually think there is a parallel between TSLA and AAPL but I don't necessarily think that's bullish.

AAPL became the dominant player in smartphones because they came out with a product that was light years ahead of the competition.  That's essentially where TSLA is now with their EVs.  But eventually everyone caught up to AAPL and their smartphone share started dropping.  That is a huge risk for TSLA because 10 years from now every major auto company will be offering a full selection of EVs.  AAPL's longevity is due to their ability to pivot away from hardware and grow the services side of the business.  TSLA will have to do the same because they simply won't be able to remain the dominant EV player.  That's why lots of true TSLA bulls describe TSLA as a tech company, not an EV company.  I just don't know what that vision is."

2021-04-09 06:15:55,stocks,"I dunno, Teslas model S has not been refreshed in a long time and starting to look dated. Tesla will have to up their game and refresh quicker because Apple would never allow any of their products to get stale."
2021-04-09 07:50:59,stocks,"One of the biggest advantages that TSLA has:  When it had many mishaps, EV is not mainstream yet and people overlooked those events.  This is the advantage of the first mover - when there's no real expectation, you can mess up and be forgiven.  The smaller numbers of vehicles in the market - in the early days - make damage control much easier, especially when there's no alternative for buyers to move to.

The bar is set very high now.  Everyone wants quick charging at home, longer range.  TSLA had made incremental improvements and learnings along the way.  Competitors have to jump in at the deep end.

Three to five years from now, when other competitors deal with battery fires and the public won't be as forgiving.  VW is selling in the EU, no problem there.  Let them mass-produce the same design to capture the cool climate market.  The same car, when plugged in inside a modest home in southern Nevada, may catch on fire.   

What will the news say?  ""Keep your home safe,  trade-in your VW for TSLA credit - a great new discount program just launched by the world biggest and most experienced EV manufacturer""

I have TSLA shares."
2021-04-09 06:12:11,stocks,Tesla was way ahead of the curve in manufacturing as well as infrastructure with charging stations. They have made some amazing advancements but there are a lot of companies coming up behind them. They need to get a more affordable car  and SUV on the market. In my opinion Lucid and BMW will take some luxury EV market share and companies like Ford will dig into their base model shares. If the infrastructure bill passes we are going to see a huge influx of EV companies and charging companies.
2021-04-09 07:22:16,stocks,"Tesla has nothing to do with luxury. Poor manufacturing and visual imperfections like panel gaps. Cheap feeling interior materials. A poor buying and support experience. Nothing about it speaks of luxury.

Apple is the opposite. Expensive feeling materials, perfect manufacturing, a shopping and support experience studied to make customers feel special.

Also Apple hardware is ‚Äúspecial‚Äù in a way, because Apple tries to produce all around high quality devices without trying to cut corners where customers may not notice.
Take an iPhone, the screen, audio, battery life, speed, smoothness, user interface, camera, materials, they have always been among the best.
Now competitors have caught up, but in the past even good brands like Samsung used to be subpar in at least some of the above.

The only way to see Tesla as ‚Äúthe height of luxury‚Äù is to never have seen a real luxury car, honestly.
The model 3 is indeed one of the best sport-ish EVs you can buy for the money, but that‚Äôs in part due the lack of competition in that segment. The Polestar 2 is a well regarded alternative, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be widely available.
Try comparing a Model S with a Taycan.

I‚Äôm not sure about the cult following either.
Brands like Ferrari have a cult following. That means they can sell a product even if it‚Äôs not especially good, just because of the name and heritage. Tesla, I don‚Äôt think."
2021-04-09 06:25:12,stocks,"I totally respect what Tesla have done.
I would however be cautious of allowing sentimental factors to cloud judgement.

2021-04-09 12:59:19,stocks,"I like tesla. They put rockets on ev development. However, i in no way understand how tesla is luxurious.

They've been popular here because they offer good range, american size, huge ass display, and (with model x) the ability to haul a trailer.

I've been both a driver and passanger in three models though, and I wouldn't buy one if i got it 30% off. In a european city it's more size than you need - to the extent that it is troublesome. The amount of problems (production mistakes) has been astounishing, seats are uncomfortable compared to similarly priced european cars, at 6' or above you have to tilt your head slightly on some of the cars (passenger only, in my experience). The cars have a hard and uncomfortable feel. In terms of luxury, tesla does not deliver. I never once thought of them as a luxury car manufacturer, but i hear all the time how tesla gets put in the luxury segment. Before model x i found nissan leaf to be more comfortable the tesla...

I agree with you that tesla in many ways will be the apple of EV (seems like it for now at least), but in terms of luxury i think mercedes, lexus etc. will greatly outperform (mercedes is already in a different league with their eqc; i have not tried jaguar but imagine it too is somewhat superior in terms of ""luxury"")"

Tesla doesn't quite have all those key factors lined up yet.  AAPL also did so into somewhat of a narrow competitive universe.  There were not two dozen already well established MP3 player companies for the iPod to challenge, nor a bunch of revolutionary touch screen tablet makers, plus monopoly digital music store selling bits for $, same thing for apps.  

Tesla is facing a couple dozen established automakers.  It's a bit like Netflix, all of netflix's growth happened when there were zero competitors.  Tesla had that window for awhile but it's rapidly closing."
2021-04-09 19:22:41,stocks,"There's a small difference : Apple was making a truckload of money every quarter for a decade, and not by selling regulatory credits to competitors."

2021-04-09 10:55:05,stocks,"I tesla will be bigger than apple ever could be actually. Because they are mostly a energy company. Yes they make other things, they're known for cars. But as chemical energy goes the way of the dinosaurs (pun intended) a new stable source of energy will be needed. They are the only ones who are visibly solving this issue right now."

2021-04-09 16:52:25,stocks,"Tesla is compared to Apple because Apple took an idea and went all in while the competition just watched before making a half assed attempt of their own. 

Being new to the space (phones) allowed them a lot of room to innovate and not be held back by the old guard who enjoyed the dividends of their work and didn't want to spend money on the new tech. When something works, don't fix it, right? 

When someone's hungry they work harder. When they're at the top they become complacent.

So the way it see it. It's just as much that the competition act similarly.

Tesla is going to dominate because everyone else is letting them. And now they are stumbling on themselves trying to figure out how to stay in the game. It's too late to be the leader in EV. They are still the leaders in total vehicles, but not EV."

2021-04-09 09:58:09,stocks,I totally agree. That's one of the reasons why there is Tesla Energy and the development of FSD.
2021-04-09 12:37:20,stocks,"Tesla's plan is not to be a big EV company. They already innovated with EV **years** ago. It panned out into reality and changed the market, and it has been going excellently for them for quite some time now. But we're at today, not then, and Tesla is in the business of pushing for **innovation** around breakthrough ideas. What could such an idea be for today then?

I believe their plan is to be the first to realize the **SMART (autonomous) CAR**, together with a broad-scale **DISTRIBUTED and SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE**. Think car that a) drives you where you want to be, b) takes off to find a spot on its own, c) goes to recharge if necessary at a supercharger hub which is d) owned by Tesla with power provided by its own network, power storage, and generation, and e) the car drives back to pick you up when you want it.

And that's why Tesla is focusing on autonomy + energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities by selling batteries and roofs here and there, or making advanced driver assists. It's the start to GROWING into something groundbreakingly different as a company, and they are again going to be the FIRST to do it, thus having a good chance of dominating the future market.

Pretty much like the back then *""overpriced""* Amazon who *""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world""* as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets one **HAS** to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain **tarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)"

2021-04-09 08:36:09,stocks,"Yes! Every five to ten years premium automakers will introduce a new design language (apart of super-luxury heritage brands like Rolls Royce or Ferrari).

Tesla‚Äôs latest model, the Y still shares the same language as the original S. Probably also one reason why the refresh of the Model S has almost no change in design.

I wonder when Tesla will have their iPhone 4 moment with a change in the looks.

My uninformed guess is around 3-5 years; after both Model 3 and Model Y have settled."
2021-04-09 10:29:24,stocks,"Tell that to the iMac, lol."
2021-04-09 10:04:19,stocks,They just updated the model S. It looks like a blend of the previous S with the inside layout of the 3 with the big screen. Pretty nice imo and the obvious Tesla to get if you have the money.
2021-04-09 12:33:50,stocks,"Partly true, but it's a basic industrial thing to get every model of every competitor, tear it apart, analyze it and learn from it. So Tesla's mishappenings/errors and advantages are free to learn from to the competition.  
I work in the security industry and that is how things are working. My company is the biggest in the field in my country, yet we still always analyse every product of our competition"

He basically pulled a Thanos on the major manufacturers and became the catalyst for major EV adoption. Now that the majors are on board, it will calm it down a bit. The one thing I see still being a plus for Tesla ( and Lucid ) are the D2C models. I am not sure the majors can afford to form a rift between their distribution networks in favor of D2C, so it will be stuck with them for a while."

Remember the iPhone that dropped your calls whenever you held it against your ear because your hand was blocking the phone signal? Does that sound like a premium product that's built well to you?

What matters if the market perceives Apple's iPhone's as a premium product superior to their competitors, and they perceive Tesla EVs as a premium product superior to their competitors. Just because you don't like Tesla's doesn't mean they're a terrible investment. A lot of people hate Apple and Apple products, but they can't deny Apple stock has been a terrific investment."

They still have 60hz refresh rate screens, small batteries, proprietary ports, and specs that are generally below flagship Androids.  Doesn't detract from their market leading position at all, and I'd caution against comparing specs-to-specs.

I'm unclear about the EV market moving forward (in terms of competitors) but I think TSLA has a built in branding advantage that is here to stay, even if they don't have the best specs ""on paper""."
2021-04-09 08:11:14,stocks,"No they won't. Even the bearest of Tesla follower knows that is not correct. Like Apple in the early days, Tesla still has better technology than the competitors.

Tesla has vertically integrated as much as possible to save cost to produce a BEV that can compete with an ICE product on a value level. Creating this system is capital intense and has been done at record pace. This will always make the PE ratio pointless at this point in time for Tesla. Have to tracked Amazon‚Äôs PE over the last 15 years? 

The OG post was asking about brand loyalty, and yes Tesla has the same or better brand loyalty as Apple. Plus Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, so there is a point to be made that Tesla is ahead of Apple on this point."

It's better but it's not that much better. But brand recognition is everything so we have Apple and most of the public thinking that iPhone is the absolute best in everything. Gotta give props to Apple - marketing is top notch.

To your supercharger point, I don‚Äôt agree. There are 33 million cars in for example the U.K., and 20,000 superchargers in the whole world.

and GM already has the Hummer coming out before cybertruck."
2021-04-09 15:07:45,stocks,But Apple‚Äôs advantage is their ecosystem. To get someone into their ecosystem it cost a 500 - 600 dollars not 30 to 40k.

2021-04-09 11:58:29,stocks,"The issue I see with the super cruise vs ""FSD"" is that its not really an apples to apples comparison *in the sense that* super cruise is restricted to the freeways/highways that cadillic has specifically mapped for supercruise and its my understanding that it only really works when there is a clear divider (jersey barriers or similar) separating the opposing traffic whereas FSD (while still sucking in city traffic or congested areas) does have the ability to function solely from the input the car derives from its sensor suite."
2021-04-09 16:08:16,stocks,"GM super cruise is only for the highway. That technology is trivial compared to what Tesla is doing. Amazon warehouse robots can already go from point to point and avoid obstacles.

The key to autonomous driving is the ability to drive on any road in any city. Otherwise all they have is an advanced cruise control.

When Tesla has enough data to fully launch FSD, the other options that require radar and lidar and manual road mapping will fall to the wayside.

Tesla can manufacture cheaper, faster, and it's FSD is more scalable. 

GM already stated the Bolt is losing money. They are full of shit if they say it will come with super cruise, unless it's a several thousand dollar add on.

There's a reason why the Hummer is over $100K. Can't wait until they announce the price on Silverado. Probably double the price."
2021-04-09 12:28:01,stocks,"I wasn't aware of super cruise, so I've look into it: 

GM:  
‚Ä¢ keep you in your lane, even around corners.  
‚Ä¢ stop you from crashing into things in front of you.  
‚Ä¢ change lanes when requested.  

Tesla:  
‚Ä¢ Same features, though reviewers feel it doesn't take corners as well.  
‚Ä¢ recognizes road signs, and responds accordingly.  
‚Ä¢ Automatically changes lanes as needed (can also manually request a lane change). 

However, that is just the released products. Tesla has demonstrated their actual FSD tech doing a journey involving parking lots, residential roads, city streets and freeways in a single trip with no human intervention whatsoever.

GM has announced that they plan to start working on something internally called Ultra Cruise that would allow their system to work on city streets, though they admitted it still wouldn't be FSD.

And a downside of GM's approach is that it requires detailed 3d maps of the roads it drives on. The maps are built from Lidar data gathered manually by employees. This data must be downloaded to your car from GM servers periodically to be kept up to date. That severely limits their ability to expand and maintain their system.

One thing I couldn't find information on that interests me in particular as a Software Engineer is what their approach is. Tesla talks about how they use a Neural Network, but I can't find any hints that GM is using on. If they are not using any kind of self learning system, then I am very impressed with what their engineers have accomplished so far, and also very pessimistic about their ability to expand that system to be FSD."

The issue I see with the super cruise vs ""FSD"" is that its not really an apples to apples comparison in the sense that super cruise is restricted to the freeways/highways that cadillic has specifically mapped for supercruise and its my understanding that it only really works when there is a clear divider (jersey barriers or similar) separating the opposing traffic whereas FSD (while still sucking in city traffic or congested areas) does have the ability to function solely from the input the car derives from its sensor suite. I DO think others will catch up, and there is nothing fundamentally unique about Tesla's FSD, but I dont know if the comparison is accurate yet."
2021-04-09 13:34:52,stocks,"You can't just narrow it to ""EV manufacturing"" when you claim they're the elite manufacturer.  When building a car, slapping in an electric motor is a tiny fraction of the manufacturing.  

My guess is the situation will improve as they supposedly have a couple factories opening, and the assumption is that new factory means latest and greatest assembly.   As for cost efficient, I also have heard the talk about how they're getting better at the economy version of their car and building up margin.  Haven't followed closely enough to know if that's real or not."

2021-04-09 08:25:49,stocks,"So what? VW has an entire stable of cars that aren't EVs. Seeing as the world is transitioning to EVs for the future, the money VW spends on non-EV technologies such as leaner petrol engines, for example, is not really going to pay dividends in the future.

Tesla also gathers significant amounts of data from their current vehicles. That's cheaper - and perhaps more useful - information than R&D output may deliver. 

I could also argue that cumbersome, historical companies such as VW perhaps get less R&D output for each dollar (or Euro) spent versus modern, leaner companies such as Tesla. But I have no data to back that up, other than industry experience."
2021-04-09 15:21:29,stocks,"If your point is that there is another auto manufacturer that is selling more EVs than Tesla rn then great you've made your point. But also I don't think there's to much for Tesla to worry about in that regard. The vehicle that outsold Tesla there has a range of around 110 miles and a top speed of 62mph. The reason why its selling so well is that it is specifically appealing to a large part of the Chinese population that isn't super wealthy, and doesn't need to travel far due to work/living in a city reasons. I think Tesla is soon going to break into that industry with smaller compact cars that are more appealing for the Chinese there, but it is also important to note that some of these cars might become less appealing in the future as China becomes more prosperous and it's citizens make more money to spend on better cars. Basically this car is no threat to Tesla since the Chinese government won't allow export of it I believe, and trends show that their population will become more wealthy with time and grow out of these small little cars."

Your need to look into the hardware and technology behind the various systems. 

Some others might beat Tesla to specific markets but will fade away when Teslas FSD machine learning matures. 

For waymo to scale up it will be prohibitively expensive.

It's easy to do what cruise and waymo are doing. Tesla could do it that way if they wanted to. Amazon warehouse robots already have that technology. 

Tesla wants the car to be self driving in any situation, any location even if the cars have never been there before. The other big guys aren't taking that approach.

Those who are, are way behind. Machine learning requires massive data. Tesla is miles ahead gathering that data. Every one of their cars on the road right now and in the future is passively collecting that data."

Battery technology, software (car OS, FSD, Auto Bider, enterprise OS), Super Charger Network, and straight to consumers sales to list a few more advantages. 

The main reason for Tesla‚Äôs evaluation is because more people believe in Tesla‚Äôs ability to rapidly grow in a rapidly developing segment. This is base on pass performance."
2021-04-09 13:48:13,stocks,"Supercruise also does not require you to keep your hand on the wheel. Attention checking uses eye tracking. Supercruise is also making its way into nonluxury models beginning with the new Bolt. Looking into the future when FSD full release, I'd also point out GM owns a majority of Cruise which started testing autonomous vehicles in SF end of 2020. 

From a personal standpoint, I don't know if I would use any self-driving when not on highways. From that perspective Supercruise is very competitive with Autopilot and they both feel barely different from adaptive cruise. If I am representative of consumers, will buyers be willing to shell out at all or as much for self-driving add-ons as valuations indicate?"
2021-04-09 16:13:06,stocks,Why are you impressed with cruise? Lidar gives the system distance and relative speed all of objects. That's enough info to not collide into anything. Then it just needs the map to stay in the lanes.

The difference between TSLA and AAPL or AMZN in their early days is that their stocks were worth nothing because nobody saw the vision.  TSLA already has a market cap of $645B based on speculation that it will change the world.  AMZN didn't hit that level until early 2018."
2021-04-09 10:47:07,stocks,"Yeah, but what the original poster asked was if Tesla would become the Apple of cars. That is, a symbol of quality and luxury. Kind of a status symbol.

In this perspective, I find it mistaken - if not intellectual cheating to try making a point - to treat the EV market as if it was different and segregated from the car market as a whole.

When people buy a car, today, they generally don‚Äôt start with the requisite that they will exclusively buy an EV. They measure pros and cons of both, so EV have to compete with ICE for the sale.
Thus, being a recognizable EV brand is not more important than being a recognizable luxury brand, or sports, or city car, or whatever the individual is looking for.

By the time that most people will be buying EVs, traditional automakers will have so many of them on sale that Tesla will not be synonymous with EV anymore. It may have become a well known name, it may have a reputation (and remains to see how good it will be), but so do the usual BMW and Mercedes etc.

Competition changes the landscape. Model 3 has little competition in its specific niche, for now. What will happen when it does?
That‚Äôs why I suggested to compare the Model S to the Taycan. We will see how the S refresh does, when it is available. Right now I have little doubt on which is the overall best between those two."
2021-04-09 09:28:47,stocks,"The point is the scale of their R&D spend is absolutely trivial compared to the dollars being spent each and every year on auto development by other manufacturers. And compared to their valuation! They spent $8.5 billion in the entire period 2010-2020. So if Tesla‚Äôs value is in the tech, and their market cap is nearly $656 billion, and they‚Äôve spent ‚Ç¨8.5 billion on that tech, I‚Äôd like someone to explain to me where the other $647 billion in value is coming from. 

For reference, VW spent 14 billion in 2019 alone. There is no question that they are now outspending Tesla quite considerably on EV R&D. 

And by my calculations Tesla have spent ‚Ç¨5.5 billion on their supercharger network. That‚Äôs not a moat in the context of the size of the auto industry in any way, shape or form. 

I think what Tesla bulls fail to realise is just how insignificant Tesla‚Äôs size and spending is compared with the total auto industry and compared with their valuation. Thus superchargers referred to as a moat, which they really aren‚Äôt, and talking about the value of the company being in their technology, which cost less than 2% of their market cap."

GM sees the EV transition as taking on massive debt, lowering margins, cannibalizing ICE car sales. 

Their plan is to slow play EV adoption, make as much money with ICE cars, pray they come out with a breakthrough technology in battery or self driving. Which I highly doubt will happen.

Right now they are losing on pure EV manufacturing."

2021-04-09 16:25:01,stocks,"Super cruise requires lidar and manual road mapping. The former is expensive hardware, the latter is expensive and time consuming labor.

Exact opposite of competitive when Tesla releases a mature FSD. The cameras are cheap, the data collection is free. 

All teslas already have the hardware for FSD. It will only need an over the air update to work. Their $25k car will have the hardware.

For a future bolt to get super cruise, that will probably be a several thousand dollar add on. Google says the price is about $7500 right now. That's why it's only available on its luxury cars.

GM already said the bolt isn't profitable. I can't imagine they ever get around to adding super cruise control to their low end line up."
2021-04-09 14:17:47,stocks,Super Cruise isn't full self driving at all full stop.  They are completely different products and shouldn't be compared.  They may feel similar to you now but ones development path is very different.
2021-04-09 15:28:06,stocks,"Well that's the question, can Tesla figure out how to build a car quicker than car companies can figure out how to become tech companies/ battery manufactures.  As long as these dinosaur that will write you a blank cheque for HTML 5 supercomputers are in charge in don't fancy their chances. Or even better remember that Ford guy that was trying to make Ford a ""data company""."
2021-04-09 16:33:57,stocks,"GM isn't even trying. Not because they don't like EV, it's because they love gas. Gas is profitable for them. Transitioning to EV is putting them in debt. 

The only reason they make a show of it is because they don't like buying teslas emission credits.

If those stopped existing, they would dump their EV lineup in a heartbeat.

They definitely can make an EV car. Making a mass market profitable one is unproven. GM already stated the Bolt isn't making money. We already know the product is inferior in terms of battery technology. We'll soon know super cruise is inferior in the autonomous driving space.

Someone who's not deep into the autonomous driving technologies being implemented can't see the potential of teslas vs the limitations of super cruise. Lane keep and collision avoidance is trivial compared to self driving in a city. Super cruise isn't even attempting the latter.

That's why they claim their city driver is called ultra cruise. It has to be a completely different product. They are probably at square 0 in development."

According to your figures, they've spent less on R&D than competitors, yet still they have product technology that is several years ahead of even the likes of VW.

Plus, claiming that the Supercharger is not a moat is something I absolutely cannot agree with. In many regions, people simply do not even consider buying an EV other than a Tesla simply due to the supercharger network. It is a moat, because it is translating into real world purchases of the cars. In Wales in the UK for example. The entire country has 11 high-powered chargers of 100kW or higher. 8 of those are Tesla Superchargers. And that's with another approximately 12-16 Superchargers due online in the next quarter. If that's not a moat, I have absolutely no idea what is."

2021-04-09 10:48:33,stocks,"It all comes down to valuation. Everything you say is true. But not for a $700 billion valuation. A $6 billion investment in superchargers is not a moat for a $700 billion company. Nor is $9 billion of R&D. 

You could buy the whole of VW, build an entire supercharger network for VW customers, and spend 10 times Tesla‚Äôs entire R&D budget every year, and still have nearly half a trillion bucks in your pocket. And you‚Äôd also have a company which makes $15 billion a year in profit here and now. And you also get a network of hundreds of dealers taking part exchanges and where people can do test drives and buy cars, as well as online.

2021-04-09 17:24:22,stocks,"Saying it's milk able is kinda down playing it. ICE is pure profits. Transitioning to EV is debt. The vehicles are somewhere between low margins and taking a loss.

Tesla is able to bring in new advancements and techniques to every factory they build. Everything they do has efficiency in mind. 

The legacy autos can't make a comparable vehicle at a comparable price. Exact same can be said about autonomous driving. The other guys can make autonomous driving, but it will cost more, and be more limited."

2021-04-09 11:22:50,stocks,"I think the general consensus is that $700B is definitely a huge, huge stretch based on current numbers.

To be fair though, the OP question was likening Tesla to Apple, and that's something I can personally see. And my original response was disagreeing with the claim of other car manufacturers coming to 'smash' Tesla soon enough, as I absolutely do not think that will be the case. Both of those points are irrelevant with respect to my feelings on the $700B."
2021-04-09 16:09:26,stocks,"Because Tesla has the infrastructure in place, right now. Other companies had the same ability to invest in the infrastructure in Wales, but Tesla is the only company to have done it successfully (due to various points such as limited electricity infrastructure, land laws, and relevant sites etc.). And they are accelerating their lead with the new infrastructure coming online soon. 

Tesla's infrastructure is the best in the UK, by far. You'll be hard pressed to find anything that states otherwise. Notable competitors include VW et al funded Ionity, which is good hardware but sparse (and horrendously expensive) by comparison. BP Chargemaster have a poor reputation for reliability and price and have a limited number of truly fast (100kW+) chargers out and about. Instavolt/Geniepoint/Osprey are superb but also have little more than a handful of truly rapid chargers or installations with more than 2 units. Ecotricity has the Electric Highway contract, but their infrastructure and service is a complete joke, as polls and feedback has proven.

Tesla certainly has some gaps in the UK network that other vendors help fill. But it really is impossible to argue that Tesla's supercharger network is not years of work and millions of pounds of investment ahead of the competition."
2021-04-09 17:19:58,stocks,Yet Apple still wins and I say that as a android fan boy
2021-04-09 12:23:48,stocks,"this will surely be the decade most of them speed up the process, for example GM stating they will be ""mostly"" electric by 2035 and that was announced in 2019. thats 16 years to only be ""mostly"" and not even fully electric. i think their milking the current situation until the paradigm shift, and they know they have a role in that timeline. 

glad to hear india is taking some steps tho. i hope newer EV companies can speed all this up by being successful. but these auto companies know where their bread is buttered"
2021-04-09 16:22:01,stocks,"\> You'll be hard pressed to find anything that states otherwise.     
I don't know how we're evaluating quality to determine 'best' but that link I gave you sure says differently in terms of quantity. Superchargers are only 2.9% of the overall UK network and only 11.5% of the rapid charger portion. That doesn't seem like much of a moat to me. If anything, it's simply the brand association and consumer ignorance that might form a moat where users are simply not interested in searching for alternatives and only want to search out Superchargers because that's what they know."
2021-04-09 17:17:56,stocks,"The point is, however, is that the Superchargers are weighted towards where people actually travel. E.g. Near to busy trunk routes and motorways, as opposed to village pubs (both of which are important for different reasons). A lot of people hoping to transition to EVs will be happy with 8 150kW chargers at a service station on the motorway they use to visit family than 2 50kW units at a pub 15 minutes away from the motorway they're travelling on. Granted, others will happily top up whilst eating a meal. 

The problem with that article, which is good but has severe flaws, is its grouping. Tesla has X% of rapid chargers. 

However, Tesla's slowest UK chargers are faster than Instavolt's (widely regarded as the second best UK network) handful of fastest chargers. Tesla's number of 4+ charger sites is unparalleled. Tesla's payment/bill procedure is unparalleled. Tesla's reliability and real-time charger availability is unparalleled. Tesla's 250kW V3 units are only matched by a handful of providers in a handful of locations (Ionity and Gridserve notably). They are all significant factors in my opinion of the supercharger moat. I simply cannot agree that it is brand ignorance - I think that's a harsh disservice to the Tesla users and the supercharger network. 

Grouping all rapid chargers together is incredibly misleading when arguing that 2 50kW Ecotricity units at 4 consecutive service stations is even remotely comparable to an 8 stall 250kW supercharger hub."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2021-04-09 10:11:21,stocks,"Bought Apple in February. Held through its 10%+ drop, bought the dips I could. Wishing I bought even more. Hindsight is really painful with this stuff. Don't know how everyone copes with it. I'll end up making some decent money on its way back up, and I'm thanking God it's recovering because it's my largest position - but now I'm constantly bouncing between being frustrated that I was just *weeks* away from investing on the way up and not down, and that I chose to diversify because I didn't want to just pump my entire portfolio into Apple. Which seemed like the smart thing to do and I've made gains instead of losses during a brutal February and March with all those picks, but Apple is looking like I would have made more putting all my eggs in that basket."

2021-04-09 17:26:25,stocks,"Just come here to say thank you to this community. I started investing in 2021 February. Due to FOMO, I just bought a bunch of tech stock, and then you know what happened. In the past two months, I did my homework, added some VTI and blue-chip to my portfolio, and waited.

I've decided to play the long game because I have had several instances where my impatience has backfired. My new example, I bought INTC stupidly AH at $67.6 a share thinking I was catching it on a spike up, only to see it quickly drop to $64 and stay there, but now it has ever slowly got back up to my original purchase price. Now I shall keep being patient and hold this for the long term.

Another one is AAPL-- bought at $127 in August. It dipped below that several times but I held. Now back up to $131."

2021-04-09 09:19:48,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast:**

Buy puts.

**Fundamentals:**

The big story today is the producer price index, which investors were so eager to see that they actually crashed the Bureau of Labor Statistics' website refreshing it to see the data.

It's out now, and [it's bad](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm). It suggests that inflation is increasing twice as quickly as expected.

Inflation's been a big worry in the market since reopening, and this will confirm a lot of investors' worst fears.

**Technicals:**

Let me show you what I  consider one of the most underrated indicators: Stochastic RSI.

[Here's what the year-to-date chart looks like with a Stochastic RSI indicator](https://i.redd.it/7wud2lgce5s61.jpg).

You'll notice that every time the Stochastic RSI indicator is above 80 and the red line crosses the blue one, the stock market goes down.

Well, that's what happened yesterday -- so expect to go down today.

The only time this doesn't signal a drop is when the market is in a complete, unadulterated bull market -- and, with bad news this morning, it doesn't look like that's the market we're in just yet.

I'm forecasting a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,829** and a **low of 13,705**.

[Past predictions and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)

&#x200B;

perfect example of buying other stocks to offset losers, rather than sinking more money into a loser.

This is why i didn't buy that much TSLA even though I was underwater, because I would be too heavy on TSLA when I could have made up the difference with other winning stocks."
2021-04-09 16:05:20,stocks,Cheers! I‚Äôll gladly crack open a hard cider and drink to that
2021-04-09 16:12:49,stocks,I was so close to selling my FAANGs after they were trading sideways for so long. I think it turned into a good practical lesson that demonstrated how most stocks will make the majority of their gains within only a handful of days in the year.

2021-04-09 14:20:56,stocks,It likely will be good which means TSM will be down lol.
2021-04-09 15:31:17,stocks,"Their peers have been killing it and TSM is selling everything they can make right now.  The anticipated demand is strong enough they announced some enormous capacity increase project I believe.

Their momentum changed when AMAT had what was perceived as slightly soft 3 year guidance earlier this week, but that may have been an overreaction."

2021-04-09 11:31:04,stocks,you shouldn't be worried about a drop from 67 to 64 for a long term stock. That's just background noise
2021-04-09 12:02:20,stocks,"The main drops you gotta worry about are for massive speculative plays and super volatile small caps which don't recover as gracefully. Blue chip stocks, ETFs, and stable mid caps will usually recover sooner or later so a dip on a particular day shouldn't bother you. 

The only reason you should sell such things at a loss is if you want to rebalance."

2021-04-09 15:33:58,stocks,"I'm thinking of just buying the stock, the problem is the markets very uncertain right now, there's nothing truly cheap like back in March 2020, but also nothing expected to suddenly crack from their highs anytime soon. Options puts a limit on your time window, whereas shares you can sort of just hold forever."
2021-04-09 19:47:31,stocks,"TSM earning comes out on Thursday. They are also apart of Bidens summit to talk about government subsidies for chip makers. I'd say they are going to have a lot of room to run if there is good news on both days

2021-04-09 17:19:05,stocks,Just balance profits and greed. I‚Äôve lost so much just being greedy and seeing if it‚Äôll go higher only to see it never go back. Hard to do when you buy it and it shortly profits leaving you thinking it‚Äôll do it again
2021-04-09 16:27:19,stocks,"As a general rule I never buy into IPOs, and won't buy until at least a year after. They're almost always stupidly overhyped and overvalued, if they're a company that has any sort of promise. And then when people realize they paid 10 grand for the business equivalent of a car bought off a used car salesman, they dump their position---if the price hasn't already crashed."

2021-04-09 09:29:56,stocks,"I‚Äôm new, so forgive my stupid question. If the inflation happen, shouldn‚Äôt people be like, putting their money into stock market, instead of selling the stock and take cash?"

2021-04-09 17:03:18,stocks,I lost a lot as well because of this crap. Such a shitty company when you think about it. The founder couldn‚Äôt have done it in the Bay Area due to racial and fornication related discrimination. So it had to be controlled by ccp.
2021-04-09 08:51:50,stocks,"Sorry but he has nothing to do with what's going on, and really only had everything to do with what happened on the first Thursday of March. Yes, he spoke on days the market went down recently. But that was also a big rebalancing period.

Chatter is that March PPI is higher than expected, although it's not out, and when February PPI was higher last month, it sent the Nasdaq down in early March but it ended up being unnoteworthy."
2021-04-09 09:20:02,stocks,"Yes, inflation news out of US and China. Also some issues with vaccine rollout coming. Bond rates are climbing again.

2021-04-09 17:42:14,stocks,"> Why has Planetir stock stayed flat

It IPO'd at $10, shot up to $38, and has held steady at $23-24 in the span of 7 months. What more do you want? The general problem with IPOs, especially ones that get co-opted by certain groups of retail investors is that it's hard to place a fair valuation. Right now, their market cap is $40 billion. I am bullish on the company and I do believe Thiel and Karp can bring it to new heights, but they're trading at a generous valuation."

2021-04-09 12:54:09,stocks,For Chinese stocks their bear cycle usually take quite long before bull cycle comes back. Look at emqq and they were down for so long during trade war before the big comeback.

2021-04-09 13:52:22,stocks,I said that two weeks ago - my poor worthless SPY puts
2021-04-09 13:51:58,stocks,Why do you think that?
2021-04-09 08:53:38,stocks,The two negative stories are an error at a production site and a very small percentage of adverse reactions. The company is way too large for anything like this to have an effect. And if it does then I'm buying when it drops. But I doubt it
2021-04-09 09:43:07,stocks,"Do you have a net worth over $1m?  If not, you wait until it's available to the public at a higher price."
2021-04-09 09:46:28,stocks,"Wait a couple of weeks then buy, at ipo the price is massively over inflated"
2021-04-09 09:56:10,stocks,"Before DOCN came out I placed a limit order (morning of) at like $65 and it went through at exactly open at $41.5. Seemed to work out well, just had to wait for the system to allow me to place the limit order.

Be advised, most investors recommend not purchasing IPOs right out of the gate."
2021-04-09 09:47:39,stocks,I think you can place a buy order after hours today and it would go first thing Monday. But they might not let you place a market order on new listings since there's higher volatility. What's the company?
2021-04-09 09:49:44,stocks,There's a separate thread for meme stocks usually
2021-04-09 08:58:04,stocks,It‚Äôs an absolutely amazing device. My wife‚Äôs vet clinic she owns has 20 of them for all staff. It‚Äôs a game changer. Countless pets saved. They no longer have to refer out and can diagnose and treat on the spot.
2021-04-09 08:03:10,stocks,"You need to understand that their ultrasound device is one of a kind. Unlike typical ultrasound which need to use quartz crystals that turn the ultrasound waves bounced off tissues in the body into electrical signals, Butterfly Network's ultrasound device uses a chip that can be plugged into a phone, therefore dramatically reducing the cost for the device.

I'm very bullish on them long term- 65 @ $15.51"
2021-04-09 07:25:06,stocks,"she's making lots of questionable decisions if you ask me

we'll see in the future if she's a genius or lucked out on the bull market"
2021-04-09 07:41:34,stocks,"I suggest you look into the applications and popularity of that device within the medical community. Should answer all of your questions right there.

Is it safe to assume you're confused as to why DEERE is in ARKX as well?"
2021-04-09 16:26:29,stocks,What are you saying please explain
2021-04-09 16:32:37,stocks,You think SPY will blow off through the megaphone or get rejected?

2021-04-09 09:14:34,stocks,Yes
2021-04-09 09:51:30,stocks,Yes. But there is nothing to deal with. Your initial cost basis will increase and you will not be able to deduct your original losses. But you will be able to deduct your total losses.
2021-04-09 11:14:07,stocks,"I think it's due to this news:

2021-04-09 11:52:53,stocks,"When you say tomorrow in your first sentence, do you mean Monday?

And surely the SPY is more likely to trade 410+ on Monday than today because of the PPI data messing the market around a bit, no?

Agreed about OPEX, could be a pretty bumpy ride later on next week."
2021-04-09 12:54:09,stocks,"It's done like 40% even though gold hasn't slipped anywhere near that much, so even a partial reversion could be good.  Traditionally gold was the hedge against the inflation that's coming.  My guess is that many of the people who would normally have blown the lid off of gold and miners are plowing that money into crypt instead."
2021-04-09 12:13:39,stocks,"Double bottom at $110ish, the worst is probably over IMO"
2021-04-09 12:30:03,stocks,Interesting. DeMark is well respected
2021-04-09 12:45:27,stocks,What‚Äôs a counter-trend rally? He expects big tech to push higher and the S&P and Dow to sell off?

2021-04-09 12:54:39,stocks,"If you have to ask, your conviction isn't strong enough. :)

I love PINS, have owned it a few times, and currently have a substantial position at $70."
2021-04-09 13:51:39,stocks,"If you are certain your other pick will do better, why wouldn't you? The loss from selling will wipe taxes on gains, so even more reason to do it."
2021-04-09 13:10:17,stocks,its been crabbing for 13 years
2021-04-09 13:53:07,stocks,SPY - because apparently it only goes up now
2021-04-09 15:50:26,stocks,"420 is just around the corner. If you're going to buy puts, wait till then. Even still, this is the same growth we were experiencing before the march dip"

2021-04-09 16:13:22,stocks,Blaze it.
2021-04-09 16:25:27,stocks,spy calls i'm guessing
2021-04-09 08:40:05,stocks,Why are you in an empty sub? Go away.
2021-04-09 08:38:18,stocks,"8.2k active this moment, yet only 46 comments over several hours here"
2021-04-09 10:43:46,stocks,Guess what? You don‚Äôt have to invest in it!
2021-04-09 10:12:31,stocks,"Depends on a few things. I believe most brokers give 70% leverage, so in that case your buying power theoretically is:

 (Your cash) √∑ 0.3 = buying power

But you never want to use all your buying power because your risk of a margin call will be huge. Some brokers won't even margin call, IBKR for example will just liquidate your positions instead. 

It also depends on the stocks you want to buy. More volatile stock have higher margin requirements.

If you are American there are 2 different margin requirements you need to know. Initial margin is usually 30% (could be more depending on the stock) and overnight margin is 50%. If you're not American, the overnight margin could be the same as the initial margin.

Whether it makes sense depends on how much interest your broker charges, and how risky the investment is compared to your risk tolerance, and if you can afford a margin call."
2021-04-09 08:40:21,stocks,Glad someone feels the same way
2021-04-09 08:54:05,stocks,How many can you really track the news of during the course of any given week?
2021-04-09 08:47:55,stocks,"I have not found a consensus, but generally I see 10-15. I was at almost 40 and today I‚Äôm selling off 15 of those and concentrating on 25. I‚Äôm going to have 10 of them at 5% of my portfolio and the rest around 3%. It‚Äôs still diversified in that obviously there are 25 and there are different sectors represented, but it‚Äôs more concentrated than i was and it will be relatively tech heavy."
2021-04-09 08:34:31,stocks,What happened between you and Konami?
2021-04-09 08:39:59,stocks,That‚Äôs the consensus. My approach when I started in January was never going to significantly grow my money.
2021-04-09 08:41:12,stocks,"Yeah I know. It was in an attempt to diversify, but I‚Äôve learned that diversification is more for preserving wealth not building wealth."
2021-04-09 14:11:20,stocks,Exactly
2021-04-09 13:40:47,stocks,"yeah honestly i regret it too lol, but i'm pretty satisfied with the amount i have right now, its my biggest position. Don't see them going away for a looong time."
2021-04-09 10:38:07,stocks,Tim apple gets money faster then the Fed can print it.
2021-04-09 10:32:12,stocks,Got 100 shares and 5 options at $120.24 last month and it‚Äôs been printing lol
2021-04-09 19:58:45,stocks,How did you grow it  that much? What was your starting capital?
2021-04-09 18:43:46,stocks,"The Fed is a money printing machine and is essentially garunteeing it will keep the markets propped up with low interest rates in the near future. I‚Äôm still concerned that the whole margin call shenanigans could pull the rug out from under them in the near future, but apparently right now market ETFs only go up. If we make it through may/june without a correction, this summer is going to be pretty crazy. Could see SPY at $500 at this pace - assuming all market conditions stay the same (which is usually a dumb assumption)"
2021-04-09 15:30:27,stocks,"That‚Äôs what I said before it hit 400, now it broke $410. Not a single pullback in between lmfao"
2021-04-09 14:23:56,stocks,"You burned your money from the start given the pattern of the year so far. MM hedging has the market tied up yet again, the same story that has been seen all year with 1 exception, and that exception was followed up by a rally.

Edit: The time to play the bearish side will be next week. They unwind their hedges then."
2021-04-09 11:34:46,stocks,"Yo, why are you calling me out? What did I say? I sold Baba back in December."
2021-04-09 16:08:34,stocks,I think in 18 months this will age pretty badly. Ppl who actually bought the dip and bought shares these last few months are going to be very happy. It's my call options that I bought back in late December that fucked me.
2021-04-09 10:36:30,stocks,"Those numbers mean Amazon won the vote.  Sure its possible that the union could win, but extremely extremely unlikely."
2021-04-09 17:20:48,stocks,"Yeah, hence why I didn't buy more lol."
2021-04-09 16:51:47,stocks,"When the market decreases for 3-4 weeks in the row, then there is a dip. Probably not THE dip but ""dip"" enough such that you can make profit :D"
2021-04-09 18:59:13,stocks,Sideways? Apple is currently up 94.69% in one year and Microsoft is up 54.58% in one year. Why are you buying these stocks when you have so little patience? These are stocks you buy and plan on holding for a long time.
2021-04-09 17:57:35,stocks,We are fortunate to learn the hard lesson early!

2021-04-09 10:15:54,stocks,That is why it is so important to not care about people who hate on stocks when they are down if it is a legit stoc. When they go up they disappear.

2021-04-09 12:16:51,stocks,AAPL's been bullish all day.

2021-04-09 09:47:08,stocks,"The only real concern is if J Pow raises federal interest rates early than expected due to inflation rising faster than expected. He has said over and over again he won't. You have to be really careful who you listen to on this sub, every red day brings out the bear narratives, and they want you to sell your stocks which is typically not good advice. Then the next week you miss out on a 20% Square, Roku, and Pins runs."
2021-04-09 09:36:27,stocks,"The risk is primarily to tech and growth stocks. The worry is that inflation will hurt speculative, growth-focused companies, so it tends to lead to people selling off things like TSLA and SQ and putting their money in things like J. P. Morgan Chase and Coca-Cola."

Overall EV valuations are a bit nuts compared to other sectors so in general if that‚Äôs the concern - then yes, stay out. I am not sure what will happen though. It might go bonkers and CHPT is a representation of overall EV market - not just one specific company. So I am willing to put some $ in it."
2021-04-09 11:08:36,stocks,"The reason I went with CHPT is because it is the largest and current leader with 100,000 charging stations. 

Also, I like it‚Äôs business model. They essentially lease chargers to other companies/gas stations/etc and use their software to operate. So they don‚Äôt have to buy the actual property/land. It seems like less of an upfront capital and much more scalable business proposition."

2021-04-09 12:20:15,stocks,i think it can go up to 40$ but i would also think its gotten to 30$ way too quick. So i do think it will go down so i might sell now and reinvest at a later time.

I grabbed $190 call for next Friday for barely anything, just to avoid FOMO"
2021-04-09 16:28:19,stocks,"It just doesn‚Äôt make sense imo. It‚Äôs a typical reopening stock that will definitely be doing good once travel picks up this Summer. The fact that it dropped to the same value it‚Äôs been 4 months ago is frustrating though, we have a lot of good news regarding vaccines and even Europe seems to be on track to actually manage to reopen this Summer - which only means good news for Airbnb. Also, can‚Äôt really compare this up and down to other travel/reopening stocks where once they drop they reach a higher floor and then go up again until they reach a higher floor again."

Hm, I'll keep eye on it. I did some math with a friend (he did almost all the work while I am still learning) but I do believe it checks out. We think TSLA shares will cost at least above $800 by the end of the year. I bought PLTR on the dip and so far I am into profit there. So, I have some cushion to hold those shares.

The only shares I regret not buying are SQ and PTON :))"
2021-04-09 17:39:51,stocks,Thank you. It is very kind of you.
2021-04-09 09:55:43,stocks,"Ah ok, so the wash sale rule is only relevant if I hold the shares therafter. Just to make sure I understand, if I bought shares at $50, sold them at $45, bought again at $43, and sold at $40, I would be able to claim $8 in capital losses"
2021-04-09 11:55:07,stocks,"Yeah, I do."

2021-04-09 12:57:07,stocks,"Yes.  The ""trend"" being broad based index sell offs, but that while that correction/whatever is happening, some of the sold down high multiple names would be rebounding, thus a rally counter to the trendThat called shot would be related to treasury rate, and confined to just the better ones that have sold off, not all tech."

2021-04-09 15:53:44,stocks,The fastest growing streaming service in history that smashed their own expectations along with reopening and getting back to normal life in the next 5 years. It is a long hold and don't even think about it unless you are buying more.

You can start a company without the green card but you can‚Äôt work for it.  
US immigration purely judge you based on the initial location your parents fornicated. For example you are Asian origin, raised in Germany and lived in Germany your entire life, but you have been conceived in India during a business trip, you are considered as Indian from the US perspective. Neither your ethnicity nor your culture education matter, only the location of fornication matters to Americans.

Don't worry about prices in the span of weeks and buy the dip in solid companies you feel are oversold. Most who bought the tech dip last month are in a deep green this week."

yes it will, i just bought at 132

i dollar cost average. I want to own a ton of it. 

the moment AAPL announces an iphone or EV this shit will blow up 

honestly there might not even be a pullback anytime soon who knows

TL;DR: Yes ofc it will run up more"

It‚Äôs about 0.5% of my portfolio tho, so that‚Äôs what keeps me okay with it. Worst case imo, valuations come back down to earth, but the company‚Äôs growth offsets it and I net modest gains. I have no idea what the ceiling is, but I don‚Äôt think it gets there until charging stations start popping up ALL over the place. So I think we‚Äôre still several years off imo."
2021-04-09 15:46:55,stocks,Idk tbh. Right now I'm just focusing my money on some other stocks. If those other stocks weren't at a good price I'd probably take the opportunity to DCA down on POSH

2021-04-09 16:53:13,stocks,Yah I'm referring to the one from Nov '20 until now.  It looks like it's on a collision course with the resistance line sometime next week - especially with the current movement.  4150 is an interesting fib level too (1.618 from Feb 2020 high to March 2020 low).  Think it could pop above that as a blow-off to 4200ish but... anything could happen.
2021-04-09 17:22:08,stocks,"You are ballsy. I honestly don‚Äôt know the justification for why TSLA is so high in price, but nothing in this market really makes sense so I think it can go higher especially if they keep surpassing expectations like recently. As for PLTR, I also have a stake in them and believe in their future. I‚Äôm just worried you‚Äôre over leveraging yourself with these companies, but it‚Äôs ultimately your money. Sometimes you got to risk it for the biscuit, I wish you luck"
2021-04-09 10:10:52,stocks,"The only thing wash sale rule does is prevents you from claiming loss if you buy back within 31 days. But they help you out with adjusting your cost basis. 

So I believe you would be showing sell price of $40 and cost basis of $48...  I am not sure if this is correct to a penny or if they do some other adjustment but that‚Äôs how it should work in theory. 

That only applies if you bought back at $43 within 31 days. If you wait longer then you will have two separate losses."
2021-04-09 13:06:05,stocks,"Ahhh, cheers for the info. What are some examples of these ‚Äòsold down‚Äô stocks though? Does he mean more speculative small caps? Because MSFT, AAPL etc don‚Äôt seem to be oversold anymore."

Question is if it's just another quick pullback or if it's more. There are many looking for it to be ""more"" (like September or late October), and it's probably the last chance for it to be ""more"". If it's not ""more"", I'm guessing that we grind up for most of the summer."

2021-04-09 10:00:15,stocks,"Yeah, that was the first resistance line and we didn't plummet, so it looks like we're going to see a muted response today.

We still haven't hit the forecast high of 13,829 (which is yesterday's close), so watch what happens when we hit that line.

AAPL should be strong today either way. Their technicals are still very bullish."
2021-04-09 09:01:56,stocks,"Hopefully not. We were on such a run. Only time will tell but without some sort of recovery here before market open, it's not gonna be a great day. I would be happy with a flat day though"

2021-04-09 13:28:07,stocks,"I heart FSLY here in the $60's even though it doesn't really make money.  They're best of breed technology and what they do isn't going away.  The knock on them last year was they exploded thanks to COVID and Tiktok being their whale of a customer.  I see both of those as good news in disguise. Tiktok abruptly abandoned them after trump meddled, but they've survived that fine.  Their customer count is relatively low which just tells me they have a lot of *potential* new customers.  Making fat cloud applications work better and faster is needed now and will continue to be.  They merged in a security company and have deployed compute-at-edge ability that cloud businesses are only just starting to figure out how to exploit.  

They've surged over 100 a few times, and each time there's been speculation someone wants to buy them.  My biggest worry is someone will scoop them now at the depressed share price."

2021-04-09 13:47:02,stocks,"Not a man but thanks.  To me a buyout today would be not great because I'm wanting $100+, and someone doing a price+15% premium type offer would put a cap on where it could go for the foreseeable future.  Unless there's the rare scenario of multiple suitors.  But generally once an acquisition is announced, the price is just becomes arb-locked.  For buyers I'd assume some mega cap tech like a Cisco, Dell, AMZN, oracle or someone like that."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Big Crash?!? Hey everyone, I have been doing a lot research into the GME short squeeze and it‚Äôs implications. I have learned that a lot of people have been defaulting in their house payments (over 10% look it up I can‚Äôt find the link I learned this from). I‚Äôm scared that we might have a bigger financial crisis than 2008. 

CDO‚Äôs (one of the main catalyst for the crash in 2008) have been replicated into CLO‚Äôs. This is so scary to me because these CLO‚Äôs are practically the same as CDO‚Äôs (which are very prevalent in today‚Äôs economy). The default rate in america has steadily been increasing.. and that could lead to this financial system breaking again, or even breaking for good. 

If anyone else has more information on this subject I‚Äôd love to hear it, but the research and due diligence I have done is all pointing to an eminent crash that will ruin many innocent peoples lives."

2021-04-09 05:09:44,stocks,"tbh i strongly dont believe we will not have crash. the people who r defualting are probably the ppl who were gonna default way prior to the pandemic. the biggest difference between today and back then at 2008 specifically was banks were gving loans to everyone. but there is regulations and stringent procedures as of today to get loans. however we will see an inflation due to the constraint of supply and demand due to the pandemic not allowing us to be in full capacity to produce supplies. so mate chill and dont worry about it. also go listen to the fed or biden's plan when they go on air. they r trying to prevent ur fear from being a reality.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Evaluation method of ETF / looking for input on this Hi there

I recently had a very interesting discussion with a friend of mine. We both are investing into ETF¬¥s and exchanged positions and why we invested in them.

**His:**

1. World market ETF, and
2. World Market Small Caps.

**Mine:**

1. S%P 500
2. NASDAQ 100

He claimed my approach to investing would be ""wrong"".  


**My side:**I chose mine because - historically - the US Market grew the fastest , had the most stable growth and the most valued companies in the world are predominanty US based.I also chose those because

* S&P is diversified enough for me, and
* NASDAQ - being more tech heavy - offers even higher returns.

**His points:**I rely too heavily on the US Market (which I agreed with, reasons above).If I only invest in those indices, I will miss out on all the small caps taking off(which I countered that those small companies ""taking off"" make up such a small part of world market funds that the payoff is diluted because too many small companies never take off).

He also said that past performances are no indication of future performances. which I totally agree wih, YET its all we have to have an estimate on what avg returns might be. and an ETF that performed well for 20 years has shown to perform and work.  


**EDIT:**   
He chose his ETF¬¥s to ""get his hands on as many stocks from as many companies world wide as possible, to be able to benefit from as many companies being successful as possible.   
also, as a way to hedge against any singular market (US, Tech, whatever) going under.   


I would say to this that in theory it sounds great, but almost all world etf¬¥s and emerging market caps hold basically the same titles (e.g BABA Tencent etc.) to get their main growth / value.  


also my gut tells me that if you hold 1000 stocks, one significantly moving doesn¬¥t make such a difference as it would if you had only 10. thus an ETF with too big of a portfolio doesn¬¥t generate the returns a smaller ETF would. UNLESS the spread out ETF holds significant percentages of their overall value in companies moving enough.   


**TLDR:**  
world market and small caps world market is smarter ETF selectionhosing ETF¬¥s because of past performances is wrong.

so, peeps; what your point / take on this ?"

Past performance not being indicative of future results is a fine saying when used properly. It is meant to say that you shouldn't buy a stock based on solely on it's past performance, but the way a lot of people end up using it is to basically try and say that you cant predict what a stocks price will be at all, which is obviously wrong."
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Do you think social investing is worth it? I have been conflicted for past year over the idea of social investing etfs. I like and respect that strategy to pull out companies that pollute too much (oil companies) or are involved in excessive deforestation/unsustainable practices or manufacture certain products (cigarettes and weapons of war manufacturers). 

However, diversification drops quite a bit in the process. Let's take the 2 big ones. VTI vs ESGV (social investing fund). VTI has something like 3,500 companies and esgv is around 1,500. Fees wise, vti is 0.03% and esgv is 0.12%. Performance-wise, both have pretty much been equal over last couple years, but YTD 2021 vti is ahead by 1% growth.

What would your take be on this? Worth it in the big picture to not invest in non-environmental friendly companies? Where do you draw the line between profiting and ethics/morals? Do you draw the line at all? Truth be told, there is plenty of money to be with social investing so its not like losing money. Diversification drops though from 3,500 to 1,500 (the extra percentages are equally divided up based on index breakdown)."
2021-04-09 03:09:13,stocks,"The line between ethics and profits is up to the individual. Hell, you might even get an exact dollar amount for how much your values mean to you.

Personally when it comes to things as large as VTI I don‚Äôt feel responsible for the small amount of money that goes towards companies I would otherwise disagree with, but this is probably willful cognitive dissonance on my part. I do try to invest in green energy and things that will be good for the future, but I also invest in those broader ETFs because of the stability they represent."

2021-04-09 08:18:31,stocks,"Oncologist here. Couple of thoughts.

Important background: They are studying treatment in the *adjuvant* setting (meaning after surgery). These people are typically cured with surgery alone, although recurrences can happen years later, sometime as long as 10 years later. This is also only in women with HER2-positive disease, a targetable protein on cancer cells with many drug targets.

In this study, they took women with node-positive and high risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease to surgery, then treated with their drug + trastuzumab (a standard anti-HER2 drug) vs placebo. They report better disease free survival:

https://i.imgur.com/gYQpclc.jpg

Important to note here that even without their drug, 89% of people did not recur after 5 years.

However, the biggest issue is that this isn‚Äôt how we treat node-positive, high risk HER2-positive disease anymore.  We instead prefer treating with *dual* anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab/pertuzumab) before surgery (neoadjuvant), followed by an additional anti-HER2 drug (TDM-1) if there‚Äôs anything left at the time of surgery.

Even if you don‚Äôt choose to have treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, you would typically combine trastuzumab with chemotherapy after surgery, rather than giving trastuzumab alone.

So I really don‚Äôt think these results are interpretable because they didn‚Äôt compare with the current standard of care.

Furthermore, there are a ton of anti-HER2 drugs available now, so this is a disease population with a lot of further treatments after recurrence.

What would be more interesting to see would be long-term overall survival in patients who have already progressed on standard trastuzumab/pertuzumab/TDM1. But as it stands, this data presented is very weak."

2021-04-09 02:57:47,stocks,"Cancer isn't the same thing in every person. Cancer is when one of your cells changes and continues growing abnormally to the detriment of the organism's health. Could be a cell in your breast, prostate, pancreas, brain, bone, intestinal lining, kidney, etc. It's basically a shit lottery for your cells. The good news is that it would take many successive mutations in cells to become malignant as your body constantly removes cells that don't function properly and there are multiple checks cells undergo before dividing. 

This study deals with mainly a type of breast cancer that expresses a certain protein on their cell membranes and activates an immune response. The trial number is 138 participants which might point to potential efficacy but will require tens of thousands of more to corroborate in P3 trials. There are many biotechs developing synthetic antibodies that will target specific cancer cell types but few if none are in contemporary use over chemo or excision. 

I think there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation about what cancer is and how it's treated. Especially with sensationalist headlines like this title.

Even if P3 is cleared the therapy is still years away from mainstream use. Immunotherapy cancer research is nothing new. Buying on this news seems very speculative to me. 

Results of a full-fledged P3 trial with tens of thousands of breast cancer cases with similar results would be much more promising. That would also require years of data too. Don't expect anyone will get an immunotherapy shot that cures their cancer but it could possibly be maintained as a chronic condition within the next decade or two much like how HIV is treated.

Rest assured that any biotech that can develop an efficacious, targeted cancer treatment that utilizes your own immune system to attack and cure cancer would literally be the scientific breakthrough of the 21st century if not on the same level as landing on the moon. 

It would cure a disease that organisms have had since the beginning of time. It would revolutionize cancer treatment and make obsolete all the treatments before it. If/when that happens the company could be worth trillions. I don't think this P2 trial result is that. 

Also, they had their IPO in Sept 2020. If you're sitting on something this big you don't need to go public as private investors/multinational governments would pump cash into you."

My wife passed away from ovarian cancer. We knew her time was limited. We knew the recurrence rate was very high. Her oncologist is actually one of the leading experts in her rare form of cancer so we always felt we were getting the best treatment. Due to a schedule change, he couldn't perform her first debulking. The head Gyn Onc did it instead. 

After the surgery, the Head Gyn Onc said ""I got it all, you're cured, go home and life your life."" Which was very confusing to hear vs. ""This is a chronic condition, mean survivorship is around 5 years.""

The friends my wife met through treatment and therapy, young women with breast cancer who have had surgery and who regularly get scans and worry about recurrence, don't like to use the word ""cured."""

The vast majority of their cohort had continuing adjuvant therapy along with 14% who had neoadjuvant therapy beyond trastuzumab alone. At the beginning of pt enrollment (~2007) pertuzumab wasn't approved for even metastatic use, never mind for neoadjuvant use in earlier stage cancers. Given the long term follow up required in these indications, it's not an uncommon challenge to face. Hopefully the Ph3 trial addresses this, but by then there also might be better options than the chosen SOC comparator."

haha i kid, i kid. Good morning! I do have some questions/remarks about your statements...  


You say Cancer isn't the same thing in every person, and then go on to give a generic definition of cancer. so using your own definition, if these actions are happening to different people, then yeah, cancer is the same in every person. Now there are different types of specific cancers and all different places. Is this necessarily important? no. nitpicking? maybe. But i'm more so just remarking on bc the logical fallacy under minds the rest of your argument.   


"" The trial number is 138 participants which might point to potential efficacy but will require tens of thousands of more to corroborate in P3 trials. ""  
\-thank you for describing the FDA process to us...? ie,. -no durr. that's the point of phase 2 and phase 3.   


""I think there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation about what cancer is and how it's treated.""   
\- are you talking about cancer here? that thing doctor's cant really explain and dont know how to cure and are discovering new things about ""cancer"" every day? that cancer? Or that ignorance and misinformation? Don't forget, these guys cant figure out if eating eggs is good or bad for you so... 

  
""Especially with sensationalist headlines like this title. ""

Are you talking about this headline? **30 min ago $GLSI released the results from their phase 2 trials - 0 Breast Cancer reoccurences and immediate phase 3 push**   
How is that sensational, my dude thats just kinda what happened. i think they call them ""facts?"" 

""GLSI BEATS BREAST CANCER"" now that is sensational.   


""Also, they had their IPO in Sept 2020. If you're sitting on something this big you don't need to go public as private investors/multinational governments would pump cash into you. ""  
Over 70% insider ownership, and they didnt take a cash salary until going public. CEO owns over 7 million shares. So yeah, every dollar their share price rises, hit net worth goes up over 7 million. Why would not want to take that public?

2021-04-09 16:05:45,stocks,"I'm sorry this was triggering for you - it's definitely a very loaded word. Every oncologist is going to use it differently. The mentors I most look up to will avoid using it altogether for the first few years. We prefer using phrases like ""long-term control"", ""deep remission"", ""keeping \[it\] at bay"", ""preventing it from coming back as long as possible"". 

For certain cancers, if you don't have recurrence after curative-intent surgery after X number of years, recurrence rates may approach <1% and the patient is ""effectively cured."" Even in these scenarios, it's probably best to avoid use of the word in front of the patient, because <1% still isn't 0, and some people could still relapse unexpectedly. And as you are intimately aware, it is extremely distressing to relapse from a cancer that you thought had been ""cured.""

All that being said, when discussing with colleagues, the use of the word ""cure"" in this kind of context - referring to long-term relapse-free survival after curative intent surgery for early stage disease - is reasonably appropriate. But you definitely have to know your audience, and I think most oncologists know to be careful using that word around patients."

Seriously if I have 10K to spare right now, Singapore Airlines(SIA), it's a Singapore stock so not sure if you have access to it

Have to explain this one. I'm Singaporean so I know the Singapore government and Singapore Airlines. The Singapore government is NOT going to allow SIA to fail, they also openly stated that. SIA have enough cash to last > 1 year or so by which time international travel should recover somewhat, if not, the Singapore government via it's sovereign wealth fund has more than enough liquidity to inject into the company if needed(which IMO will not go to that).

SIA is currently operating at 8% capacity

Singapore has managed the COVID infection extremely well, there is next to no local community spread to speak of. We are seeing maybe 1 community case a week, the rest are all imported cases

Once any country out there is ready for us to create a travel bubble, the stock should start shooting up(it's already up nearly 60% from it's low but still down around 50% pre-pandemic)  


The downside, my country is a city state, we have no domestic flight to speak of so if international travel does not resume within a year, that is going to be a huge problem

2021-04-09 08:35:25,stocks,"It's an electronic medical record (EMR / EHR) like when you see a doctor and they enter your information into a computer they enter it into software like CareCloud. It also handles the billing / collections (referred to as RCM) which is likely a significant source of their revenue.

I'm not too familiar with CareCloud but I work for a similar EMR basically a competitor. It's typically used by private practices (local family practices and whatnot), not hospitals. Thing is basically every single practice already has an EMR they use so to get new customers they need to be convinced to switch EMRs and switching EMRs is a major headache for doctors so the market for potential new EMR clients is kind of rough - for many of these companies most of their revenue comes from subscriptions for existing clients and billing collections. I know fuck all about CareCloud or their stock though, just my 2 cents on the EMR business.

I have heard good things about CareCloud, providers seem to like it but me personally I wouldn't touch this unless there was some major catalyst or new product offering. That being said I haven't done any DD on this stock so my opinion means fuck all."

2021-04-09 00:16:59,stocks,Wealthsimple or your bank would be the easiest. Although if you're not investing much wealthsimple might be your best bet as canadian stocks are free to purchase and us ones are 1.5% commission per trade (they charge the commission to buy then again to sell). Banks usually charge a flat rate of 9.95 ish per trade based on the currency so a US stock would be 9.95 USD.

2021-04-09 03:18:58,stocks,I love my IBKR account but it's not for everyone. If you're planning on buying into 15 assets and holding for a year+ without buying/selling anything else then I would not recommend IBKR. If you're doing more than 10 trades a month then there's not really a better option for Canadians as far as I know. My biggest complaint with IBKR is the Trader Workstation looks straight out of 2005.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"SeaChange International DD and all the sea that is changing, well internationally. It's my first DD.

About SeaChange.

SeaChange is a leading supplier of Video Delivery Software Solutions.

Our solution powers hundreds of cloud and on-premise video delivery platforms, servicing over 50 million subscribers worldwide. SeaChange offers value-based engagement which provides content and service providers with a complete software delivery platform for linear, VOD and TSTV over managed and unmanaged networks. The SeaChange Framework solution includes video back-office, media asset management, targeted advertising management, analytics and the client interface for STBs, Smart-TVs and mobile devices. Our solution is available as a product or managed service deployed on-premises, in the cloud or as a hybrid.

On 3/29/21 SeaChange made the announcement that they and landed a multi year multimillion dollar deal with one of the biggest broadband providers in the United States which over the next 48 hours doubled their share from $1.03 to into the $2 range and their volume:

3/29: 386 million  
3/30: 50 million  
3/31: 30 million

These numbers are way outside of their average which is now looking like 10 million

Right now there is speculation on who the deal is with. A few hours of research and it's a fair assumption to go with Comcast.

Comcast and SeaChange have done business some 20 years ago and their contract is available online for anyone to lookup. I dont think i can post links but contracts.onecle .com/seachange/ comcast.video.2000.12.01.shtml

A very interesting clause in this contract pertains to the announcement:

SeaChange and Comcast shall agree on the form and content of any public announcement that shall be made concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither SeaChange nor Comcast shall make any such public announcement without the consent of the other, except as required by law.

Sounds like a real dickish thing to do in a contract but it does explain why the announcement was so vague and only giving as much information as they are allowed.

There is also the Q4 report from Comcast where they are planning move to virtualization as well as a few things i noticed on a social networking platform.

The announcement is anticipated to be in the earnings call on Tuesday April 13th at 5:00pm ET

On 3/30 there was an announcement for a public offering of 10 million shares at $1.85 per share that was quickly filled. Aegis Capital Corp. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering and is now closed.

During 2020, SeaChange went from selling individual services to full turnkey solutions. Their legacy framework sales are down but they are correlated the increase of their new framework. This is a huge sign of customer retention and migration on to the new platform as well as securing new business.

Yes, they are cash flow positive and on top of that they have a 20 million dollar offering which puts them in a very good place for either expansion or acquisition. They have also been busy with a number of 8-k filings over the last 2 weeks.

Overall, they have a pretty slick product and i recommend anyone to go to their website and check them out. They have a solid solution. Reading through their contracts from 20 years ago was so nostalgic when they are standing up infrastructure on 18gb drives with regedits and mpeg2 formatted video but i digress.

As it stands today, i believe that there are we are approaching T-6 (4/2 was no trading) where it could get really interesting. Looking at iborrowdesk and fintel this has been shorted to oblivion and well into the 400 millions of shares.

Insider trading looks good and no sales in the last 60 days.

Breakdown of shares:

17.43% % of Shares Held by All Insider  
18.29% % of Shares Held by Institutions  
22.15% % of Float Held by Institutions

TL;DR

Currently $seac is trading at $1.42 which is a bargain. In the upcoming days with all things considered who knows where it could end up.

2021-04-09 00:00:18,stocks,"A lot of people don‚Äôt notice that if you buy a house to live in, you are basically investing your money in real estate as well, which can have even higher return than the market given the right circumstances. So that counts as diversification, especially if you get a low interest 15 year mortgage to minimize what you in interest. This is usually the biggest store of money for most people and it is a fairly secure one. 


Owning a paid off house with a clear title is something that can really take a huge stressor of your shoulder especially after you have a family, and renting long term is just a waste of money. 



Can the market go down and stay down? Very very unlikely, but not impossible, this can happen if a massive political change takes place, such as a large restructuring of how taxes work. Again very unlikely that the US can abandon capitalism, but you never know. But the same could be said for government bonds, which are secure for now, but it isn‚Äôt unheard off that government can default, very unlikely but can happen


Anyway, you are young, definitely put your money in stocks, but make sure you are using all your tax advantages, 401 k and 529  accounts and all that. Also don‚Äôt trust it all to your own judgement, make sure some of your money is professionally managed. even the pros who do this for a living will put some money to be managed by someone with a different mind set just in case their own predictions don‚Äôt ban out. That is basically why hedge funds exist."

My wife keeps her savings liquid, and we live well beneath our means, so we could pay off most credit card buys within 2 weeks without liquidating anything.

2021-04-09 08:54:40,stocks,"I'll tell you what I do as a kind of intermediary between keeping a ton of cash vs investing it all:
For reference - I'm 27, good credit, high credit limit I dont use, no kids, no house or nice car needing expensive repairs. 

I try to keep roughly 10k in emergency savings which is like, 4 months of my fixed expenses. For the last 2 years - the most I've needed very urgently was 4k at once (moving so I had to pay for things in cash). Every other time I needed emergency money (like my car fucking up) I would put it on my card and pay it off with the emergency funds later. 

Now what I do is keep 2-3k in emergency savings in the off chance I need cash and I need it fast. I rarely need actually cash so time isn't the issue - just put it on the card and withdraw and when the deposit hits I pay it. 

The other 7k I put in a high dividend yield investment like QYLD. Now some people don't like QYLD because your investment principle won't grow - its gonna hover in the low 20's forever. But thats fine because I don't want something volatile. I want something that will generally hover around the same price with a stable dividend. 

QYLD pays a 10% div each year. My 7000 in there makes 700 extra bucks a year. In the WORST CASE scenario - if I have to sell it to get my money it'll be at most, like 10-20% down for ATH. So even if you hold for a year and dont touch it, the dividend alone takes all the risk out assuming you have to withdraw at the worst possible time (which is unlikely). 

The down side is: 
1. capital gains eating up the dividend - this motivates me to try to keep it in there for at least a year. 
2. It takes several days to get your money to clear - and if it's a weekend you have to wait longer. This only works for me because I have a high credit line to put things on in the meantime. 

I've started doing this for all my savings. For example - saving for a car? Every 500 I save gets chucked into QYLD. It'll be years before I get it anyway so who cars, let it grow. Mark it on my spreadsheet so I know how much is ""emergency"" money and how much is ""car"" money. Worst case if the market crashes, I'll just wait on the car and my savings for the car which has been growing like crazy can be used for something else. 

Hope that makes sense, I just woke up lol"

If I were you I'd buy FOF and every seven years you can double your money if you auto reinvest the dividends month after month. Safe investments with high dividends are a calculation rather than a speculation. Yes, if you have a crystal ball and perfect hind sight you can pick stocks better than FOF but the fact is you don't have hind sight when investing. Only hope and a positive feeling with growth stocks but in the end it's gambling and speculation."

I live alone but if you have a family you have a provider responsibility and then its even more important to be able to put food on the table consistently etc.

Also at least for me, if I sell stocks or funds it takes about 3-4 days until I get the cash back at my accounts. So if I want to reshuffle my investments quickly I need a trading buffer."

given the context of that assumption, putting all of your money into one asset class is still a bad idea. ideally you'd diversify a bit and do some stocks, some real estate, and some ""rule 6"" (which the poorly configured and overaggressive bot would automatically remove if i were to say it).

just because it's unrealistic to think that stocks will drop to 0 doesn't negate the fact that you will lose a ton of money if it drops 30% at a time when you need access to that money (which would mean you're selling shares low)

just because stocks will eventually recover in the long term doesn't mean that you won't need access to some cash in the immediate term at timing that could be inopportune based on market conditions."

to be fair, someone could simply have margin enabled on their account for situations like that.

there's an opportunity cost to having cash sitting out of the market in the form of all the growth, dividends, and premiums someone is missing out on.

look back at prices in 2007/2008/2009/2010. if someone ""kept money ready to buy a dip if a big crash happens"", they would have gotten that chance in 2020. the problem is that the ""big dip"" where everything  lost like 30% of its value still resulted in prices higher than they would have paid if they just bought a decade earlier.

someone would  be much better off buying on red days (so small dips) consistently, and then if a big dip happens, considering using some margin to take advantage of it (then paying off that margin as quick as possible rather than making new purchases after that)."

2021-04-09 11:59:35,stocks,"Going to have to disagree with a lot of your assumptions, there.

I am selling my house of 21 years.  I have owned property for 27 in total.  I am so relieved to actually get my equity out of the house and into diversification.

I have had lots of expenses on the house, new roof, burst pipes, destroyed walls and flooring.  Owning a house sucks so bad.  It's a barely-break-even situation in so many markets.  It's easy for someone to oversimplify if they haven't spend every day, month and year doing the upkeep and footing the bills.  Live with it all, and you know the gains are not free.

How many weekends do you spend with every other schlub waiting in line at Home Depot and wasting your precious free time working on the house?  Lots.  Home ownership presumes your time has no value.

My house sat at a plateau for nearly a decade.  Investment in the market would have quadrupled equity gains, at the very least.  I'm happy to get out with some gains.  But the returns coincidentally are just what I paid in mortgage for every one of the 252 months I owned it."
2021-04-09 00:05:01,stocks,"Personally I like 3 months of expenses in a money market, then I have 4 months of expenses in CD (4 of them 1 yr-maturity) that come due every 3 months.  The CD's are easily broken (small penalty) and available almost immediately.  For stocks, I don't plan on the money being available for anything less than 7 days from when I sell (trade+2) then my bank holding funds for a few days before I can withdraw from there."
2021-04-09 10:33:07,stocks,"Wasn't that late March drop not even 5% for the market overall(based on SP500)? If OP had 100k in the market, then that drop would have still given him access to more than 95k at any time. Even the Covid drop was about 30%, which means 100k account would have 70k accessible even at the lowest point.

I think the better example is the 2008 housing crash which resulted in 50% drop from the highest point to the lowest point in that time period. Or dotcom bubble of early 2000s which was about 44% drop. But even then about 50% of your saving would be available at any time. I think this is more realistic worst case expectation for modern age.

The most extreme of course is the great depression where the drop was 81%, which means out of the 100k you would only have access to 18k. But that drop took about 3 years and nobody was okay from it. I don't think we'll see something like this from a modern age given that we have(hopefully) learned from the experience."

2021-04-09 07:40:12,stocks,"The primary reason to have an emergency fund is so that you are not forced to sell any stocks or investments when you don't want to. The last thing you want is having to sell those shares to pay rent/mortgage. That means you are not selling when YOU want to but rather because you have to. This is almost certainly a bad thing. The opportunity to buy on a dip comes second.

I keep quite a healthy emergency fund personally and that would cover me for 6 months. I would however, be willing to deploy half of that emergency fund during a crash and I felt comfortable doing so. For example, let's say a crash happens and I know my job is safe and I have no looming large expenses, I would be willing to pounce on the opportunity and keep around 3 months expenses in my emergency fund and invest the other half."

If it eventually becomes a correction (like the last several weeks), I just keep buying little by little until I‚Äôm out of cash, but if it rebounds quickly, I rebuild my cash position to prepare for the next dip.

So I don't think my success speaks as much to my own skill as to the good time at which I entered the market."
2021-04-09 03:49:30,stocks,"When evaluating your skill as a trader, you should not just compare you gains to the indices, but also your holdings. For example, you said you beat the S&P 500 (the dow is a worthless index) but not the Nasdaq, if you look at your portfolio do you find that you were more heavily invested in the Nasdaq? If so, then the reason you outperformed the S&P could be because you held significant portions of an index that beat the S&P, not because of your skill as a trader. If that is the case, you can replicate the same level of skill with a group of index funds and have less risk with less work.

For example, if you outperformed the S&P but not the Nasdaq, and you look at your portfolio and find that 75% of your holdings are in the Nasdaq, it's likely you beat the S&P because you're holding a poor mans QQQ not because of your skill as a trader."

2021-04-09 09:29:14,stocks,"This may have already been said more clearly, but there‚Äôs a key aspect to an emergency fund that I haven‚Äôt seen clarified. 

Say you take an emergency fund of $50k that you have saved and put it into the market. Then the market crashes and you lose your job. You now need that emergency fund. But it‚Äôs only worth $25k now. 

You think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, my emergency fund is larger than I really needed, so I still easily have 6 months worth of what I need.‚Äù You liquidate some and use it to pay your mortgage for $1000. 

You‚Äôve essentially paid $2000 for your mortgage payment. The $1000 you withdrew started as $2000, and had you waited it would probably one day be $2000 again, but you had to spend it. 

So when you need that emergency fund you‚Äôre really spending twice as much on bills as you would otherwise. 

So, sure your emergency fund may not be able to grow along with everything else. But it also can‚Äôt shrink an exorbitant amount in a very short period of time which may coincide perfectly with when you need it the most."
2021-04-09 01:39:19,stocks,"Many brokers let you withdraw directly from them.  Eg, my setup at Fidelity is an investment account that I use as a checking account.  It has a checkbook, credit card, even my paychecks come into there.  I do not have an account at a bank.  I don't need one.  I have two different credit cards with 2% money back, one with a 20k limit, and brokers let you take out a margin loan if you have an emergency expense that you can instantly get access to (so you don't even need to sell shares to get access to your money.  Just write a check.), though that tends to be for big buys like a down payment on a house or buying a yacht, not an emergency expense which can always fit within a credit card or two."

Float is like an interest free loan that never has to be paid back if inflows = outflows. Buffett calls it ""other people's money"".

So when they deploy it, they are extra judicious. Currently they are using it to repurchase shares, roughly $25 billion in 2020, some more in 2021 (no one knows yet exactly how much). That should tell you something I guess."

So, if a stock I like takes a 6% shit in one day, I can scoop up more shares. 

For example, I've always bought YUM brands on a dip, like every few years, some news will come out about how Taco Bell uses shitty quality beef in their food, and the stock takes an emotional 10% hit. I have reserves that I scoop up some shares, and a week later, the stock has fully recovered and I've made 10%. It's not so much 'timing' the market as it is expecting that sooner or later, there will be a completely unnecessary sell off in something that I like, and can make a quick move to ""buy when others are being irrational"" or whatever."

The theta decay of holding a deep OTM put would be equal to or less than the fee of most savings accounts and swinging it on red days would provide a moderate ""interest"" flow on cash that would otherwise be parked having inflation eat away at it. Additionally, even if you just buy and hold, the delta return of a broad market downturn would also provide a premium that rivals or exceeds even the best high yield savings accounts.

except that example doesn't really hold up. if someone had the worst timing ever and did all their investing in early march before the floor fell out, they'd STILL have more money than they started with today for the vast majority of stocks. they only would have lost money if they panic sold at the bottom.

that's not even talking ""oh, a decade from now they'll still come out ahead"", i'm talking 12 months.

Don't keep years of emergency money in savings, but a a few months, for sure. It's insurance.

getting a loan on assets already in posession (other peoples money) is - in most cases - far cheaper than getting money if you do not have any assets. thus you get better conditions and higher sums. 

this is one of the main reasons rich people can get more money to work for them. they get better and bigger loans.

I'm long on LIT, but might look at getting a position in BATT too, but there's quite a bit of overlap in their holdings, so it might be a wash from here on. They are both really good picks given EVs are at an inflection point and should see tremendous growth over the next few years."

So I started investing at the beginning of the pandemic in Mar-2020, and since then my portfolio has grown in excess of $20,000 with investments each month from my paychecks. I have generally gone into single stocks with companies I trust and that I know will be around for a while. However, I do have some short-term plays where some risk was involved (nothing more than what I am comfortable with). I have two questions that I would appreciate advice on:

1. In total my portfolio is up just over $2,000, but I'm wondering if it is worth it to keep investing in these single stocks or if I should go more into larger ETF's and index funds? I have nothing in larger index funds like VOO, or similar funds, but I have a little bit in ARK's ETF's.

2. For those risky plays that are currently in the red, is it ever worth it to just cut your losses and re-coop leftover money into other tickers?"

Warren Buffet used to say you should find companies you truly understand and believe in and invest a lot of money in them. He said diversification was a protection against your own incompetence. I agree with him on this, but if you are unwilling or unable to make good and deep DD then passive investments are the way for you.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Dividends actually profitable? Does it actually take DECADES to finally start making profit off of the dividends? Rich people stay rich off of it, but I'm assuming it's not the best way to GET rich  unless you are a vampire? I am a new being to this type of world so take it easy and explain it to me as if I was 10."
2021-04-08 20:46:07,stocks,"I don't think it's been explicitly stated, but if you are investing in dividend stocks, you should be re-investing those dividends into more stocks through DRIP (dividend reinvestment program). This way a stock that pays 3% dividends and grows 5% per year will snowball on itself and can turn into a very profitable endeavor. In essence, the company grows and gives you more shares, which further grow and give you more shares. 

In some sense, with DRIP on, the growth is similar to any other investment. They actually typically have less growth than growth companies, but the upside is that the companies that pay out dividends are the ones that are well established, have a good cash flow, and are fully mature to the point that they do not want to grow. This may sound silly, but AT&T is a company that is fully mature, makes a lot of money, and isn't experimenting with groundbreaking new technology or otherwise. So what do they do with their money? They give it out as dividends. Other companies like Tesla, for instance, don't pay dividends because they take all the stock growth and reinvest it in new technology, factories, etc. 

The point I'm getting at is that typically dividend stocks are secure. It's much less likely that Coca Cola (a famous dividend stock) will go belly up and lose your life savings rather than the hot new biotech company. So after 30 years of racking up meager, yet substantial gains, you hopefully should be able to cash out of the stocks if you need to or simply turn DRIP off and start pocketing the dividends rather than re-investing them. 

A common and I think recommended strategy is to start in growth companies when someone is young (because it gives time to bounce back from upsets and potentially have better growth), and then gradually transition into value, dividend stocks near retirement. The lower risk of the stocks gives you security once you are no longer working and the dividends can directly pay for living expenses. If someone is able to and has the wherewithal, it's not uncommon to have investment funds reach at or near 1 million dollars by retirement, in which case a standard, healthy dividend rate of 3% would pay 30k per year (while still hopefully holding value in case you just need to sell all the stocks for one reason or another).

For more information on strategies like these, I would recommend /r/dividends. /r/investing also just has good advice on broad strategies"
2021-04-08 20:34:38,stocks,"You shouldn't think of dividends as a way to get rich, but a way to stay rich and avoid inflation. As you make more and more money, the concern will start to shift to not losing it and that is where dividends help. They make a small modest profit while hedging inflation."
2021-04-08 20:20:03,stocks,"You own 5 shares of company x.

2021-04-08 21:41:10,stocks,"Dividend stocks are great.   You get extra cash that you use to buy more shares.  No one sees when the market will crash ahead of time,  well, some people see it, but also ten other crashes that don't happen.  Whatever,  dividends help you profit when the crash happens, most companies keep the dividend,  you'll lose a couple,  but most of them keep paying you allowing you to buy more stocks when they really are crazy cheap.   That gives you the peace of mind to stay fully invested through the fake crashes too.  I rarely buy a stock if it doesn't pay a dividend and it's done well for me.

You don't get spaceships, but they do go up also,  and they rarely take massive losses.   Some of my good dividend stocks over the last ten years have been PFE, QCOM and SO.  both have more than doubled while paying me.  Honestly, I've had a couple of losers too, just RIG and WFC, but overall I'm very happy."
2021-04-08 20:26:22,stocks,"Dividends stocks tend to be safe/low-risk, but also slow to grow - startups and companies with exponential growth will have ideas to spend $ on, debts to pay, markets to expand into, and paying out dividends won't be a priority for them, whereas something established without much competition like a power company won't be looking to expand or spend more $ than needed on maintenance/upgrades, won't be doing much R&D work, and thus be more likely to have nothing else better to do with $ than to give it out to it's investors

2021-04-08 23:18:10,stocks,"Most will say,  if you dont have a lot of money to start investing with, it would be more beneficial to invest those dollars into growth stocks (no dividends but capital gains).

Small dollar amounts in dividends stocks will not grant you the DRIP compounding you seek. At least not at a desired pace. 

A friend of mine is against dividends stocks and I see why. You own 10 shares of a company that pays $0.30 quarterly. . . You get $3 every 3 months. You will want more."
2021-04-08 22:01:10,stocks,"If you look at T and verizon they just did a dividend. If you look at the charts they rose and rose up to the ex div date.  Then that day or maybe even the day before they dropped a bit, probably about what the dividend you would have gotten. Then the next day T dropped like .90 cents, and verizon dropped almost $2.  So basically moral of the story is if your going for div stocks you need to time if well and mostly be in it for the long haul.

Also of note, you have to hold a div stock for a certain period of time prior to the ex div date, otherwise your dividend gets hit with i think 15% tax.  So in other words the next day the stock drops by the dividend you got, you get hit with 15%, and people might sell stock dropping the price on it even more.  Do some research to check all that is correct, but to me div stocks are mostly things you time really well to get into, then you sit in it till your in a wheelchair"

Yes, you can do better picking the right growth stock, but that comes at much higher risk. Because you are just as likely to pick the wrong stock that goes nowhere or bankrupts.

2021-04-08 22:15:07,stocks,"The current payout for one share of Coke is $0.4 per quarter, or $1.6 per year. Since the share price is around $50, this corresponds to a yield of 3.16%. The yield is just a term indicating the percentage payout over a year.

So you'd need about 32 shares of KO for the dividend to kick that up to 33 shares after a year. It sounds bleak when looked at from that perspective, but that's where the company growth comes in to save the day. I'll make the numbers nice for this example to keep things simple. When investing with dividends (or most things) it's good to hold them for a long time unless you're making a speculative play. 

I pulled up a quick graph of Coca Cola stock and they went up 101% in the last 11 years (which isn't that much compared to growth stocks). Now lets see really quickly what would happen if we had 32 shares of KO back in 2010. 

2010 - 32 shares = $885.76

2011 - 33 shares

2012 - 34 shares

...

2021 - 43 shares = $2284.16

Technically there would be more than 43 shares after 11 years because I'm not including the amount of dividend generated by the additional shares. It should probably be closer to 44 shares.


Nasdaq report for KO dividend https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ko/dividend-history

Backportfolio test to verify my quick math for KO growth 
https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults 

my inputs don't save in the URL form, but if you look at 2010 to 2021, set the starting investment to $885 and have the portfolio be 100% KO, then after 11 years the final balance will be $2,322 for a calculated annual growth rate of 8.95%

I will note again that this actually significantly underperforms the market. If I switch the settings to contribute fixed amounts each year, the KO stock grows at a CAGR of 11.87% and the broad market grows at 16.87%. If you're wondering at this point, this is why I mentioned that it is typically recommended to invest in growth companies or S&P 500 ETFs as the returns are usually better for younger investors. Dividend stocks (good ones anyway) are generally safer and more suitable for conservative investors or investors who want to get money from their investments without having to outright sell their investments. By this, I mean if I have shares of Tesla but need some money in the short term, then I'm forced to sell off some of my investment which obviously prevents the investment from growing. On the other hand, dividends can just be toggled so the money goes into the pocket rather than be re-invested. Again, the dividends usually aren't that much anyway but it's a slight benefit"

2021-04-08 21:03:06,stocks,"You own shares of a company and sell calls every week or month to collect premiums. For example, lets say you own 300 shares of company XYZ. Company XYZ trades weekly calls that expire every Friday. Lets say you own company XYZ at an average share price of $90. You decide to sell the $95 strike weekly call and collect a $0.50 premium. This means you‚Äôre selling someone the right to buy your shares at $95 if the stock is $95 or above by expiration of the otm call. At $0.50 you would have collected $150 total for that week ($0.50 x 300 shares = $150 premium). If the stock goes to say $97 by Friday expiration you are forced to sell your shares at $95 bagging a $1,650 profit total ($5 x 300 shares + $150 collected premium) but lose/sell your shares at a price of $95. If the stock stays at say $90 you bag the $150 that you collected in premium and keep your shares because the price didn‚Äôt go at or above the $95 strike price for the call. If the stock goes to say $91 that week by expiration you have a paper gain of $300 on your shares and a secured gain of $150 from the collected premium on the otm call."
2021-04-08 20:33:35,stocks,"If they stayed flat the day before ex-dividend date, the easiest game would be to buy the stock right before dividend and sell it right after collecting dividend.

Btw, swing trading is not that simple... don‚Äôt get into it if you‚Äôre still trying to figure things out.

They will likely have this information, but a lot of times you or your accountant will not have access or the information may not exist to track your basis. It is up to you to keep records. 

So when you buy a security, you take a cost basis at the price when you purchase it. When you receive shares through DRIP, the cost basis is different in that it is using the average cost method instead. When the average cost method is used, it is a noncovered security. There are other circumstances where securities are noncovered as well, but I don‚Äôt think most retail investors will run into those.

If I had just said that timing doesn't matter and gone in when I felt like it, my return at the moment would no doubt be smaller. I understand that every ETF I'm looking at has positive returns over time, but IMO every dollar matters so if I can wait for it to drop just a bit I would rather do that.  

Though as someone else pointed out, I do need to math it out and see if waiting for these dips is worth in when compared to the returns I could have gained had I already gone in. If so, I might just go in when the valuation drops on the daily."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Roast my analysis of $ROOT, bonus one weirdo $CLLS I did a few days of this in r/swingtrading but thought it'd be cool to do in here. I'm very new to this, trying to get a feel for how to find stocks in a screener and then how to play them once I found them and I figured getting ridiculed by random people on the internet for being dumb is a great way to learn. 

[https://imgur.com/a/zIK2xML](https://imgur.com/a/zIK2xML)

Found $ROOT using a screener looking for optionable, high short interest, high volatility. Am I right in calling this a double bottom? How would you confirm this move and how/when would you enter? 

https://imgur.com/37Fr8nO 

Another one I found was $CLLS and it's mostly just ""what's up with this high volume spike?"" I don't see any related catalysts that could have caused this. Due for a correction or will momentum push it higher?"
2021-04-08 20:01:42,stocks,"Your discussion about ROOT is a textbook example of the misapplication of technical analysis and failure to consider the fundamentals driving major and lasting market moves. Even at current prices, ROOT is still at 15x trailing sales, for a company that generates a net profit of negative 261%.

Using your picture, its high point was the peak of COVID-era speculation. Other companies that got beaten down at the same time have recovered and hit new highs. ROOT lost 50% (!!!) and continues to languish.

This is because it's a newly-public and speculative company that the market doesn't know how to value yet. The technicals you're trying to play (double bottom, using previous peak as a price target, etc), don't even begin to solidify until the company has a years-long established trend of growth and profitability.

Please learn fundamentals and mix them into your strategy."

2021-04-09 10:23:40,stocks,"Thanks, you're right, I'm definitely emphasizing the wrong thing. I'll go back and get a better understanding of fundamentals. I've spent some time understanding them a bit but the thing I don't really understand is how fundamentals that are basically static on a week to week timeframe affect daily moves when there's no news or catalysts. Or how to tell when a company under or over valued. There seems to be a big gulf in explanation between ""P/E is the price of the stock divided by the earnings"" and ""We're adjusting the price target from 50 to 35 because.....reasons?"" Maybe I just need to immerse myself more."
2021-04-09 10:47:14,stocks,"Think of analysts and their price targets as Redditors who are paid for their opinions. Sometimes it‚Äôs good, sometimes not. Almost impossible to tell which is which. 

Ultimately, pricing a stock is a lot like pricing a house. Think of real estate location as a stock‚Äôs industry/sector. Think of p/e or p/s ratios as price per square foot. Remember to use these as your methods to value a company against its comps. 

A large profitable company will have higher ratios. For a small company operating in the red, p/e isn‚Äôt a functional metric, use p/s. 

Smaller companies have smaller valuations. Growing companies will grow not only in revenue, but in valuations. Those are where you‚Äôll find the outsized gains. 

For insight, read the company‚Äôs financial disclosures (10K/10Q forms) first, analyst assessments and opinions second (EDIT: or third or fifth or never).

Use technicals to assess market direction. Overall markets win, you win."
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Do you pay Estimated taxes? The title pretty much asks the question.   
My underpayment penalty this year was pretty low because my wife overpaid. However, I don't want to rely on that. 

I'm hearing that the average penalty would be around 9%. That's a pretty hard pill to swallow, but so is losing money that could otherwise be working for me.

What do you do, and why?"
2021-04-08 20:39:25,stocks,"I don't because I paid such a low amount when I was self-employed as a commercial driver that I either didn't want to bother with $100 or didn't owe taxes at all.

Transportation workers get a special per diem that's based on a daily rate. The effective tax deduction is 80% of $66 per day, with a commercial driver working for weeks at a time over the road. It adds up to almost $20,000 alone.

Another major tax deduction is the individual 401k. [According to the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans), the contribution limit and effective tax deduction are:

*The business owner wears two hats in a 401(k) plan: employee and employer. Contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities. The owner can contribute both:*

* ***Elective deferrals*** *up to 100% of compensation (‚Äúearned income‚Äù in the case of a self-employed individual) up to the* [*annual contribution limit*](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits)*:*
   * *$19,500 in 2020 and 2021, or $26,000 in 2020 and 2021 if age 50 or over; plus*
* ***Employer nonelective contributions*** *up to:*
   * *25% of compensation as defined by the plan, or*
   * *for self-employed individuals, see discussion below*

*If you‚Äôve exceeded the limit for elective deferrals in your 401(k) plan, find out how to* [*correct*](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/401k-plan-fix-it-guide-elective-deferrals-exceeded-code-402g-limits-for-the-calendar-year-and-excesses-were-not-distributed) *this mistake.*

***Total contributions*** *to a participant‚Äôs account, not counting catch-up contributions for those age 50 and over, cannot exceed $57,000 (for 2020; $58,000 for 2021).*

With just those two above-the-line deductions and the individual standard deduction of $12,000, you can write off all of your net income.

Other business expenses and individual above-the-line deductions are still available, but just using the ones I mentioned and other individual deductions would let you write off probably $125,000 in net income in total. Business expenses could be a whole lot more.

I must mention I messed up my first year of running the business and had to pay about $4,000 in taxes. I hired a scammy accounting service that my carrier was promoting and they were terrible at it. I got on the IRS website and several others and literally taught myself the tax code and all about how to manage business tax reporting. [TheBalance.com](https://TheBalance.com) is another great website to learn about the tax code, as well as all things financial."

The IRS rule is simple.  By the end of the current year, you must pay at least 100% of your previous year's taxes or 90% of your current year's taxes to avoid penalty.

That's why the first-year traders can get away without a penalty.

Since it's hard to know exactly what you'll make in the market,  I always pay 100% of my previous year's tax to be sure.   Sometimes I have to pay extra by tax time. Sometimes I get a big refund.  All the time I am in better shape than paying a penalty."

TL,DR:
- Less than $1k in taxes, no penalty
- No penalty if you paid the lesser of:
  - 90% of tax due for current year
  - 100% of tax due from last tax year (may be 110% if your adjusted gross income is high enough)"

2021-04-09 09:23:17,stocks,"Because you can incur a penalty of up to 25% of your winnings.

to be fair, that's not an apples to apples comparison. if a tesla looked and drove like [this](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20071031__SMARTCAR311.jpg), it wouldn't have blown up into a massive success. 

there's also the fact that tesla is years ahead of the competition in the EV and autonomous driving space, not to mention their battery tech/patents. there's also the plain and simple fact that the number of people who currently (or will in the near future) want to buy a car is MUCH higher than the number of people looking for fake meet.

on top of that, elon musk is a human marketing machine. everything he touches has a tendency to attract investment dollars and turn into gold.

what exactly makes impossible stand out over their competitors? because they have a lot more competition in their niche than tesla does, and it's not clear that there's anything that makes them unique or that a competitor couldn't copy quickly. money not caring about feelings cuts both ways. lots of people aren't interested in fake meat, and impossible has a lot of competition for a relatively small market. money doesn't care about impossible's feel good ideals."

The goal of impossible meat is to render the whole agricultural sector commercially unviable compared to lab grown meats because of the sheer resources it takes to grow such as land and water of traditional meat.

Right now impossible meat is expensive but if you couldn't tell the difference in taste and it was half the price of real meat which one would the consumer choose? That's why they are targeting fast food restaurants such as burger king.

Impossible meat is lab grown where they discovered a plant protein molecule similar to what makes meat red and ferment it like beer to produce huge quantities. The CEO is also the inventor of the DNA microarray. I wouldn't put them anywhere near Beyond meat as a competitor.

You are completely right about the marketing problem as I'm surprised how many think their competition is Beyond meat while everything they are doing is to make a meat alternative that is more economical to produce than agricultural meat."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Understanding Stock Lingo? Article about stock I was interested in:

>11 analyst(s) have assigned their ratings of the stock‚Äôs forecast evaluation on a scale of 1.00-5.00 to indicate a strong buy to a strong sell recommendation. **The stock is rated as a Hold by none analyst(s), 8 recommend it as a Buy** and 3 called the NOVA stock Outperform. In the meantime, none analyst(s) believe the stock as Underperform and none think it is a Sell. Thus, investors eager to increase their holdings of the company‚Äôs stock will have an opportunity to do so as the average rating for the stock is Buy. 

I'm not understanding why 8 analysts would recommend buying, but 0 recommend holding?

If the stock is at $10 and they think it will go to $20, then (to me) it makes sense both to buy at the current price of $10 and if you already have shares to hold.  

Are these somehow mutually exclusive?  Does the analysts recommending against holding (0 recommend holding) imply they are telling people to sell at the current price?"

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"FOMO starting to hit. I've been investing in a target retirement fund for a few years now.  Shamelessly I took a more active approach to investing right after the GME affair, about 2 months ago.

I don't have a lot of cash, and it was clear that we were coming off of a huge bull run after the Covid crash last year.  I didn't want to throw a whole lot of money into highly-valued stocks or ETFs, like ARKK.  In the end it looks like that was the right decision, at least at that moment.  Now might be a better entry point, not sure, it's also not one that's on my radar.

So I ended up doing some pretty defensive investments that have done pretty well for me these last 2 months. In fairness, what hasn't done well?  I had limited tech exposure and even those are racing upwards after the little pullback last month.

The idea, again, was to not pour a lot of money into stocks which were potentially at ATH (sorry, I tried timing the market) and also investing in things that would do alright in the event of a correction, since I don't want to lose this money in the short-to-mid term.  Once again, so far so good.

But man, it looks like stonks always go up!  Kidding, but this bull run looks like it has no end. Monetary policy is loose.  Economy set to reopen.  Massive stimulus.  What could go wrong? (somewhat kidding)

What I'm trying to say is that I was pretty bearish when I bought in 2 months ago, and now it looks like that prediction could have been wrong, and I'm experiencing FOMO. Can anyone relate?  

I was supposed to hold some dry powder in reserve, and a little bit of an extra cushion in savings, but man right now I just wanna buy buy buy.  Thoughts?

*(I know I will probably be criticized for my investment decisions, have at it, but the point was to see if anyone else is experiencing this feeling of FOMO right now and how you're dealing with it.)*"

I took all my Roth IRA mutual funds out and invested them in ARKK, ARKG, AMD, NVDIA, TSLA, AMC. 

SO I learned quick as not 2 weeks after, we had the correction and I was down 30%

Basically I had to sell a few of the expensive stocks that held green to buy down my failed stocks. 

As of right now, I‚Äôm almost back to where I started besides my 1 ARKK leap still being -50% (2500$) at strike 135. 

I have been wheeling PLTR for 6% gains off my 200 shares, even when the stock is still down a few %. 

Now my portfolio is a large chunk of apple and arkk and Arkf with a few hundo of PLTR. 

If I could redo this all, I‚Äôd have 50% in spy/index, 25% in FAANG, and 25% in riskier ARK/Tesla type stocks.

Line up your investment approach with your goals (whether you need dividend income or in for capital gain only, how long you wanna invest for etc), ride the ups and downs and you‚Äôll be fine. 

Regarding your point on the market and the bull run. There are some bond vigilantes who are causing inflation scares and there may be some inflation in the short term but the bull run should continue for a a couple of years given how much money has been pumped into the system already (stimulus bills) and how much is on its way (new stimulus bill). 

Tech has had a major correction in the first few months of the year.

You‚Äôre safe just dollar cost averaging into a wide variety of stocks and holding for >1 year.

I believe we‚Äôre referencing two different things. 

As a day trader, I‚Äôm more focused on what‚Äôs happening in the past 1-6 months and what those trends indicate for the near future. 

When I say volume is drying up, I‚Äôm comparing it to the chaos of January and February. Check out this link and plug in some of the more popular tickers in the search bar and then click the YTD tab.

Obviously, timing the market is impossible, but I‚Äôve lived through multiple crashes and still came out ahead. There‚Äôs money to be made in the middle. Here‚Äôs some more reading from others to give you more food for thought:

Master Wu on Twitter (legendary forecaster, holding 100% cash right now): https://twitter.com/masterpandawu?s=21

Forums on Reddit (along with my experience working on Wall Street, and other financial communities) have helped me make millions and retire early. I‚Äôm trying to pay it forward by sharing my thoughts and keeping the conversation going. I might be wrong, and my timing has been off before. But by sharing my thoughts, it hopefully provides more information for you to make decisions about your risk appetite and investing strategy in this current market. 

If you‚Äôre ever in NY and want to discuss all this over a beer, I‚Äôd be happy to join ya. Best of luck brother, and let‚Äôs make that money!"
2021-04-09 17:40:10,stocks,"Yeah, volume is drying up on tech stocks.  Every single stock you listed is a tech stock.  The data I showed you before was the entirety of the S+P 500.  There there's no trend of drying up.  Additionally, even in the case of the stocks you mentioned, volume isn't going BELOW normal.  It actually looks like it's trending back to normal (pre March 2020 levels).  After the covid crash volume was way, way up on these stocks.  The only thing that's happening now is that it looks like we're getting back to more reasonable volumes.  That isn't the same as volume ""drying up"".

It makes sense, too, why trading would slow down in those particular stocks.  There was recently a pretty big correction on the Nasdaq tech stocks and a shift into value.  So the massive tech run up got halted for a bit.  That isn't necessarily a bearish indicator.  It just means that people got afraid that things were running a little too hot.  Growth in the overall market continued and tech stocks are now rising again.

I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that people who make millions off investing don't use Reddit or Twitter as their primary source for investing tips, and if they do, they would certainly cite their (alleged) Wall Street experience before Reddit in their list of qualifications.

To be honest, I think you're just making all of this up.  You may actually believe your bear thesis and timing the market, I don't know.  But the bits about having worked on Wall Street, retiring early, etc... it all seems fake to me.  I don't know to what end - only you know.

No hard feelings but I just thought I should let you know that I'm not buying it.  I'd be surprised if anyone else did either."
2021-04-09 17:51:32,stocks,"Oh man. I guess this is why successful people don‚Äôt often post on Reddit. Too many people question everything as if i have something to gain by lying. I was just trying to have a conversation and you‚Äôre accusing me of making up my life story. Sigh...

Any way. Best of luck with your investing. I want us all to make money."
2021-04-09 17:53:44,stocks,"I could be wrong, feel free to respond to the points about the data.  That would go further than mere words."
2021-04-09 18:12:42,stocks,"You definitely make some good points about the data. For my current approach to trading (scalping/day trading), it doesn‚Äôt really affect me. I chose to hyper focus on very view tickers throughout the day and make multiple round trips via calls/puts to scalp. 

Since your investment strategy probably differs from mine, the discussion I presented is likely irrelevant for you. Feel free to ignore it. 

I‚Äôm not a bear/bull. I just look for indicators and follow options volume flow and run with the wind. The market has been very choppy lately and so I‚Äôve gone all cash. That‚Äôs my risk tolerance. I can still consistently make 5 figures a day scalping without risking financial ruin in case of a massive correction (like March 2020). 

Our goals are also likely different. I‚Äôm aiming for $16M after taxes before I move everything to a large bank (JPM probably) and have their asset management arm take care of it for me so that I can spend the rest of my life traveling and flying warbirds (P-51 preferably). In order to pull that off, I have to be a bit more aggressive with my trading...and a bit more cautious about any drastic market pullbacks. 

If you‚Äôre not too worried about current market conditions based on your research, then I‚Äôll add that to my own collection of data and reconsider my own analysis. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and the stimulus/infrastructure spending will make 2021 just as profitable for investors as 2020 was. 

I appreciate all viewpoints, even ones different from my own. Time for me to get back to studying. Thanks for encouraging me to think outside of my short term trading and tech stocks that I‚Äôve been scalping."
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,Quick question about buying stock a day later after selling it. I sold some shares at a loss I originally bought at around $9 a share averaged down to $8.19 I Sold them at $6 and bought them again at $7. All within a couple days. It now says price paid $8.79. Why is it $8.79 and not the $7 I bought it at? Is it because I bought it within a couple days of selling?
2021-04-09 10:22:07,stocks,"I leaned this by wanting to sell a VOO share to buy into GME, because I'm dumb. Didn't realize the sell process would take time, and in that time I was able to come to my senses and realize I wasn't gambling in a casino. VOO had risen in that time and I just said F it, that's the stupid tax. Personally I'm happy I can still track my cost basis including that loss."

With leisure travel at peak, the stock is above where it was. Any explanations?"
2021-04-09 00:26:02,stocks,"You‚Äôre asking questions that show your lack of knowledge of the industry. 

Southwest has some of the best balance sheets in the industry. 

Southwest‚Äôs MAX fleet is coming up quick. 

Southwest is domestic only - which will tick up much faster than international travel. 

Southwest also doesn‚Äôt rely heavily on business travel, and I honestly always thought the ‚Äúbusiness travel won‚Äôt ever come back‚Äù argument was always just media companies cashing in on the Covid hype. Yes business will come back. 

The market is forward looking and southwest will have a strong return. The aviation industry as a whole will continue to grow at rapid rates globally."

Low margin, very tight competition, arguably slow growth, probably two years out from being at 2019 levels, no real dividend, easily impacted by damn near everything.

IMO, nothing justifies it except people are willing to pay for the stock at this price. Its hard to believe there is not a correction coming when a lot of companies are valued higher than pre-COVID.

There is zero reason to suggest their revenue strength will be better than 2017-2019. In fact, their earnings were not keeping up with their miniscule revenue growth, which is probably why they failed to pass their ATH that was set 2017. Yet, somehow they are about to set another ATH? Yeah, major correction coming when they fail to meet those lofty expectations."

Could use some help/opinions moving forward post-covid.  I made a post maybe 4-5 months ago about having an additional 10k to invest which I did...ended up using it mostly for airlines and cruises which ended up working, however I don't think this is a long term (1 year plus) move.  Here is what I am currently holding.

TOTAL INVESTING - $36,579 (up 14k for 1 year)

* DAL - 8 shares
* NCHL - 367 shares
* SAVE - 209
* WMT - 15.07
* AAPLE - 14.01
* MSFT - 10.02
* T - 71
* MAIN - 47.39
* DKNG - 15

* AGNC  - 25.18
* KO - 15
* TRTN - 5
* VIRT - 12
* OMF - 9
* BYD - 4
* AMD - 3

Basically the last few months I've been trying to buy a few stocks a week of dividend stocks, trust me...I don't plan to do that whole live off them thing, i'd rather bet on growth, but having some seems like a great idea.  That's what a lot of those random capital stocks are.  Right now I'm up to about $50 a month from dividends which I am reinvesting.  My main concern is that moving forward past the summer, norweigein and spirit will even out (I do think it still has room to gain a bit) and I will be clueless what to do besides sell my shares...by that point ill have held for more than a year for tax purposes.

My goal is to continue to add maybe 100 bucks a week, maybe 50 into dividend/blue/whatever and have 50 a week for growth/tech/ or take some shots at more options.  (i have 1 long term with norweigein currently that I just added)

My question is, what would you guys do with NCHL and SAVE...my plan is to hold until possibly September, but what next...more tech?  More blue chip/dividends? Thoughts?  Concerns?  Any tips are appreciated!  Thank you."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,Playing Catch Up I finally set up a Roth IRA. I plan on maxing it out each year. I have some savings and real estate but haven't had a retirement account until now so I'm playing catch up. I'll probably split the account between VT or something similar and something more aggressive. Any suggestions for a not so low risk Vanguard EFT. I was thinking VB or VWO. Thanks!
2021-04-08 21:09:18,stocks,"VB has a maintenance ratio of 5% I believe. If you want greater lower cap exposure, I'd recommend using some ratio between VOO and VTI, because they're both 3% maintenance and together can cover several distributions of small, med, and large market cap within your portfolio.

VOO is obviously 100% large cap, and VTI despite being total market is still 70% large market cap.

I personally do a 50:50 split, and get 10% medium cap, and 5% small cap exposure, and 85% large cap all at a 3% maintenance fee.

Going hard on small and medium cap companies is higher risk. Big companies will more regularly make money. Up to you! If you want more than 20% medium or 10% small cap weight then this strategy won't work for you. If that sounds right, just buy VTI.

Also how old are you if you don't mind me asking? I just started as well and I'm almost 27 :( Not bad though!"

What are your thoughts on this company from the U.K. who are reimagining vehicle production methodologies whilst delivering EV niche for Commercial vehicles. In case you haven't seen any of their marketing material. 

Their main selling point is low capital microfactories that can be stood up in desired locations with little effort and limited space unlike traditional car manufacturing conveyor belt type traditional approach. I personally think this is a good approach to scaling and adapting to local needs. 

In their presentations they have referred to scaling to large number of factories over the next coming years and the strong revenue growth as a result. This may be optimistic but if they have the recipe to replicate then this will bring about a new standard in automotive manufacturing.

[Arrival presentation](https://arrival-site-cms.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/39573881-229c-4bae-927b-969002d4a01b_Arrival_Investor_Presentation.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj87oa39dfvAhUR76QKHV8ZA9YQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2fJ-FC1aSNL0MUJ4JrLw5m)

They have been working with UPS to design delivery vehicles and have said they have UPS order of over $1B - no doubt there are clauses attached to this and other orders Arrival speak of.

Also I'm sure they will benefit by the Infrastructure plan recently touted by Biden.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, ‚ÄúA big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve‚Äôs employment goals. He said ‚ÄúThe recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we‚Äôre talking about is a very serious issue.‚Äù 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We‚Äôve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see ‚Ä¶ the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.‚Äù

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"7 Must Know Things Right Now About The Stock Market (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More) **In today‚Äôs post I‚Äôm going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we‚Äôve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo ‚Äúsuits‚Äù that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE‚Äôs. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE‚Äôs and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE‚Äôs as well due to the recent ‚Äúbooming economy‚Äù helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let‚Äôs jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don‚Äôt think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don‚Äôt see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn‚Äôt be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It‚Äôs also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)‚Ä¶ just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It‚Äôs also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It‚Äôs still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It‚Äôs still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it‚Äôs very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it‚Äôs likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven‚Äôt seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it‚Äôs inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn‚Äôt fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very pleased with my investment‚Äù. That‚Äôs exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can‚Äôt really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we‚Äôve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN‚Äôs Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That‚Äôs why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

You see, there's a very good reason **not** to include basic commodities in the CPI. You can claim Corn is up 30% or more since last year on massive Fed printing and etc, but the truth is that last year's corn price was the same as in 1981!"

You were wrong.  I specifically looked at a chart showing dozens of commodities prior to me posting.  The majority are up.  Well over half.  

>Still, you are cherry picking

I didn't pick specific commodities, I spoke in a generalized way.  I literally didn't mention any single item. Cherry picking is the opposite.  


>The pandemic has had far more impact on shortages than inflation

This (I think) is the issue in our conversation.  I think maybe that you are implying inflation only comes about due to new currency being printed?  That is not the case.  Many economic factors can cause inflation, shortages are a textbook case.  

From investopedia:

Inflation is a measure of the rate of rising prices of goods and services in an economy. Inflation can occur when prices rise due to increases in production costs, such as raw materials and wages. A surge in demand for products and services can cause inflation as consumers are willing to pay more for the product"
2021-04-09 11:02:10,stocks,"Oh geeze, cut the crap.  You know the conversation was about general inflation, not specific items.  There is no evidence of some extreme surprise inflation like you people seem obsessed with."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Explain to me like I am 5 why I shouldn't buy TQQQ shares for the long term rather than QQQ shares...? I understand the basics of it. TQQQ is leveraged and the leverage restarts everyday. 

I also understand that 10% down today and 10% up tomorrow does not get you back to even. 

But hear me out. Look at the 5 year charts for the TQQQ and the QQQ. The TQQQ 5yr chart you would have a 10x return to the QQQ 2x return. If you would have held through the 2020 Market crash you would still be way up.

If one were to believe we were in a new bull market and believed that technology was going to lead the way in the future why would you not buy TQQQ shares instead of QQQ?"
2021-04-09 10:53:25,stocks,"> I also understand that 10% down today and 10% up tomorrow does not get you back to even. 


This isn‚Äôt how it works. 


Say you start with $10,000. Your portfolio drops 10% in a day, you now have $9,000. The next day you have a 10% run up.....



1.1 x 9,000 = $9,900 


This is why after the financial crash, you would‚Äôve needed more than a 1000% return from the bottom to have broken even on TQQQ. 


> But hear me out. Look at the 5 year charts for the TQQQ and the QQQ. The TQQQ 5yr chart you would have a 10x return to the QQQ 2x return. If you would have held through the 2020 Market crash you would still be way up.


You‚Äôre only looking at a bull run. The problem is TQQQ has only existed in a bull market so people don‚Äôt understand its potential drawbacks. And the Covid crash was rather minor for QQQ. Once you start talking about 30%+ crashes...you‚Äôre talking about 75%+ losses. 


In fact, one person did the math. If TQQQ existed back before the dotcom bubble, you would have broken even by December 2020, while QQQ was up over 500% before dividends. 



> If one were to believe we were in a new bull market and believed that technology was going to lead the way in the future why would you not buy TQQQ shares instead of QQQ?


This isn‚Äôt financial advice but I wouldn‚Äôt hold it for more than a year if you believe the bull market will continue. And I would buy it to supplement QQQ‚Äôs return, not to replace QQQ as a whole."

2021-04-09 02:32:34,stocks,"I've been contemplating tge same lately and try to put at least a small amount every month in it. Decay is the issue, but in a bull market the upside with leveraged funds is actually higher than the leverage and totally beats the decay. All the comments pointing dotcom assume you bought tqqq at the peak and never again - if you had the gut to keep buying after the crash you would have some crazy returns, but that's very emotional and subjective, considering few people had the gut to buy non leveraged qqq. I'm thinking a healthy mix of bonds and tqqq with quarterly rebalancing might be a good idea, since even in a meltdown you would've already taken out hefty profits, and would have the funds to go in after the meltdown. The worst case scenario I think is a prolonged period of no growth, that you just bleed the leverage, or of course increasing interest which would make the leverage expensive. I'd say a proper analysis is required to put entire portfolio on such strategy, but putting a few hundred bux a month in tqqq a month is a good bet."

2021-04-09 02:34:35,stocks,"That's a bit dogmatic, and simply not true on many timescales."
2021-04-08 20:30:22,stocks,"I'm guessing people who buy at 15:55pm are probably those who don't subscribe to the idea that you should only hold for a day. TQQQ is great for swing trades lasting days or weeks. You decide your stop and your profit amount and you go with it. You could hold it for 10 years if you wanted, as long as you accept and manage your risk."
2021-04-09 03:19:38,stocks,"To add to this, emotion is truly what will define your returns with such a strategy. Imagine having 2mil in tqqq last February. If you did absolutely nothing you'd have 4mil right now, if you rebalanced according to some strategy possibly more. But if you held, there would've been a point where your 2mil would've been 600-700k, not many people can get through this, especially if you're close to retirement. Because of this, I think everyone who goes with leveraged etfs needs to run their analysis on long-term simulated data, to have very strict rebalancing rules, and complete confidence and dedication in their strategy, as there will be hard times. But the strategy shouldn't be blindly and dogmatically discarded as even after a large crash you'd probably be better off compared to unleveraged investing, considering the huge returns you made leading to the crash.
Google hedgefundie's excellent adventure for a guy's detailed analysis on similar strategy (upro+tmf).
Also I think in the long-term leveraged snp500 might be better option than tqqq - diversification helps a lot to limit your downside."

2021-04-09 01:57:05,stocks,"This right here. Buying at the peak and riding down like that is not a fair representation in my opinion, especially when u think of the daily reset.

I‚Äôve help TQQQ, SOXL, UPRO  for well over a year now and I‚Äôm not complaining. Leveraged positions have a place in ur portfolio as long as you understand what your goals, and risk tolerance is."
2021-04-08 20:08:19,stocks,Is there such thing as being left in the dust on a leveraged fund that is only based on QQQ‚Äôs daily performance and not on the actual underlying value of stocks? The only thing that matters is what QQQ does daily going forward.

Personally, my portfolio has roughly 15 stocks and in the New Years I made a few rotations and now currently have 12 individual companies. I have a goal to analyze one company a week. I would gather up news articles, etc. throughout the week and read the annual/ quarterly reports throughout the week and do all the financial analysis and modelling on the weekend. This is typically enough work for me to keep me busy, along with keeping up to date with the ER for the current holdings. 

Which brings me to a few questions in your massive portfolio: how are you keeping up to date with them and how are you selecting them? If you are investing to ""diversify"" your portfolio, why don't you just use an ETF to diversify instead?"

Because a) we're emotional creatures and b) there's always the unforeseen - some things we do will fail regardless and that's just the way it is. So owning many might be a way to spread or minimize risk. Of course there's also the opposite strategy - pick a volatile stock, put all your eggs in, and ride the ups and downs. Some are just that volatile. Another strategy might simply be to buy the trends. Which I personally find difficult because I more often buck the trends. It's just the ""f\*\*cked up in me.""

2021-04-09 04:23:05,stocks,"I have 93 stocks in my portfolio. It just my personal etf with 20 year time frame. There are many new industries being born right in front of our eyes and it is imposibble to gather 1-2 companies from each of them and some divies/blue chip stocks with a small 20 stock portfolio. I think in todays reality small portfolio strategy is good for trading, not for a long term."
2021-04-09 04:54:36,stocks,"Why does it matter?
Also, I don‚Äôt trust ETF‚Äôs. I believe a lot of them use derivatives and other tactics to mimic the price of the underlying index they‚Äôre tracking, without holding the stocks themselves. You don‚Äôt actually own anything.

2021-04-09 06:46:17,stocks,Because it‚Äôs cheaper with options and you don‚Äôt get the junk companies owned by ETFs that buy and hold indiscriminately. At any given point a company can get annihilated for any number of reasons. If you hold less than 5pct in one company you won‚Äôt get killed. The inverse is the more stocks you have the greater the chance one of them will üåô and that‚Äôs like the venture capital model of betting on lots of companies to become the next google.
2021-04-09 07:12:56,stocks,"If you invested all your money once a year it would be easy to only invest in 15 stocks or less. When you wait to be paid and new ideas are thrown your way it‚Äôs hard not to buy another stock as it‚Äôs got just as much potential as your others. If one of your stocks is already up 100%+, it‚Äôs easier to start again on another stock that still has the gains to be made"
2021-04-09 07:56:51,stocks,"I looked into ETF's, and decided I would rather not pay the expense ratio. Fund managers appear to live a lavish lifestyle in expensive places, and I don't want to be the guy paying for that. Compounded over time, that expense ratio really adds up. I also noticed that all of the ETF's I looked into had 100+ stocks in the portfolio. If these guys are so smart and sophisticated, why do they have so many holdings? Shouldn't they be the best stock pickers around? Some megacap blue chip tickers were kind of no-brainers. Why should I pay some guy to hold MSFT for me and collect a percentage? I decided to educate myself about the market and, hopefully, get paid to do it.

So, I bought core stocks that pay dividends that increase every year. I'm DRIPing for now, and when the divs equal my retirement income I will switch to cash divs and hit the beach. I also bought some REITs with a good track record when they were cheap. When the correction comes, this core is likely to keep paying the divs to tide me over. Diversification helps to cover me in case one or more core holdings does cut their dividend. I sell OTM covered calls on these to generate extra income. 

Next, I bought stocks with higher volatility and started learning more about options. That has gone well, with more gains than losses. I will start making riskier and more sophisticated option plays this year, and invest any meaningful gains in the core funds. I will study what options fund managers do to learn more about it. I watch these stocks a lot more carefully than the core stocks.

When I do my research, I focus on sustainability and the likelihood of long term (10+years) returns. So, I am less concerned about daily ups and downs. I expect these, and  I am less likely to panic sell if a small percentage of my portfolio drops for awhile. I try to pick quality stocks that are likely to recover eventually, and so far I've been successful. 

I have spent my adult life educating myself, formally and informally, and I have learned a lot since I started investing. I will probably keep learning new things about the markets for the rest of my life. This education is one of the very few things in life that can never be taken away or lost, and I enjoy learning things about the economy, individual businesses, etc. Someday I might even be as knowledgeable as the Wall Street fund managers.

Finally, these days it's pretty easy to stay up-to date about my holdings. If you hold the actual stock, companies do make an effort to keep you informed and you can even vote on things that impact the future of the company. News feeds and such (and, rarely, Reddit) provide enough info for me to be comfortable with what I'm doing. So I spend maybe an hour a day keeping up with about 40 stocks in my portfolio, which has been time well spent so far. Wish me luck."
2021-04-09 08:14:52,stocks,I usually have less than 10.  If you've got money evenly distributed on 30+ then you might as well just buy an index fund.

2021-04-09 11:46:01,stocks,"You also need to keep the overall size of the portfolio in mind.

No offense to a lot of the new GME/AMC investors, but they're playing around with a few hundred dollars.

When you have tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands in your account, it would be really risky to have 50% of your holdings in TSLA. I take every claim of ""20% of my portfolio is  PLTR"" with a grain of salt, because 20% doesn't tell me anything - are you holding 5 shares or 500?

As for how you keep up with them all... my strategy has been to pick stocks that I don't necessarily have to keep up with. Coke, Microsoft, and Apple are ones you can buy and hold forever. One piece of news isn't going to move those by very much. Then I have my more gamble-oriented stocks like FNKO and BYND. Those are the ones I pay more attention to."
2021-04-09 14:54:12,stocks,"Because I sell all of the stocks I buy that make money, usually after somewhere between a 10 and 30% return depending on the chart and news landscape. But I hold onto all of the stocks that drop, waiting for them to at least break even. I convince myself this is because ""if the stock was a good buy at $100, it's a good buy at $90,"" but in reality there is some emotional irrational tendency to avoid selling at a loss. Eventually I am dragging around a pile of red line items. I have never gotten quite to 30, but I have definitely had more than 20 a few times."
2021-04-09 16:29:56,stocks,I‚Äôve recognized this as a problem so the trick is if i have a big new idea to take money from the stocks I don‚Äôt love. Sometimes I‚Äôll keep $1 or 1 share so I keep tracking. I think the most important thing is to have high concentration in the top 5-8 positions.
2021-04-09 16:50:14,stocks,"I made this mistake as a young investor. I started in January and built up a portfolio of over 40 different companies. I had a small piece of each company with basically every sector represented by 3-4 stocks. I was focusing on diversification and had the mindset of not losing money. However, I believe that I was cutting any gains I would‚Äôve made in the process. The more research I‚Äôve done, the more I realized that diversification is more about preserving capital than building wealth. Today I decided to liquidate about 1/4 of my account until I got down to 25 stocks that I believe have long term growth potential in sectors that interest me and will fuel that growth. Now I‚Äôm mostly in technology (big tech and communication), energy, financials, industrials, utilities, retail and e-commerce. I have 11 stocks that will serve as the core of my portfolio which account for about 5% each. The other 14 account for about 3% each and include other steady growth stocks and some more risky investments. While 25 stocks is still a large amount, that creates enough diversification for me to not lose my mind because of volatility, but concentrated enough that I believe the long term growth will be substantial."
2021-04-08 20:27:43,stocks,"Honestly, it‚Äôs just fun to research different stocks and sectors. I‚Äôve only been investing for a year, but I‚Äôve learned a lot more by doing high-level research on a bunch of different sectors, dividend stocks, growth, blue chips, etc than I would have if I just dumped everything into VOO and called it good.

2021-04-09 11:23:19,stocks,"Same, I think it also helps to control risk overtime after you've put in a substantial amount of money. When I had only $2,000 inside, it was okay to just own 5 stocks and split it equally around $400 each, give take +/-$100. Once you have about $20,000 inside, doing the same strategy, you'd be putting $4,000 now on the line into each stock, give take maybe +/- $1000. Some stocks I also buy with the intention of risking it to potentially either go to the moon or hit near 0, and doubt most of us would ever want to chip in 20% of our portfolio into such a high risk stock. Buying a ton helps to spread out the risk and feel more secure, if one of them really does go under, but also increases the odds, one of them maybe actually flourishes."

My total returns since I've been investing from 2007 is 54%

My advice, trim the winners. Buy more existing companies in your portfolio if the price is right. Buy other companies that are going to give you a better return otherwise.

Balance your sectors! 

Granted, you can't keep track of everything in your portfolio. But with such a large diversity of hopefully quality stocks, your portfolio should act like a total equities ETF.

Mine is so diversified with mostly great companies, it's been weathering downturns. 

During the start of Covid, i sold my REIT ETFs, Bond ETFs, Emerging Market ETFs.

Switched to buying specific companies in those respective sectors. Except bonds, cause bonds are going no where, and you can buy defensive equities like utilities.

How did I decide on what's a great company? Used top performing ETFs, looked at their top 10 holdings and weights. Bought those companies directly for my portfolio."

I‚Äôd be more concerned if this just kept going up when most of the companies in the etf are still in their infancy, the idea is get in these companies before the mainstream finally catch on to tech that still has a long way to go. 

Despite Tesla being a top 10 company now, electric vehicles and renewable energy usage is still not mainstream.

They‚Äôve got the best people doing the research not Reddit, so I think a correction is necessary, otherwise it‚Äôd be a sign of a unhealthy market if it kept going up.

Netflix will also be able to place films such as ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and future Venom and other Spider-Man films on its platform.

- anime
- stand up comedy

- documentary

There is no other provider with so much content share. Yes, Hulu dominates network sitcoms and reality shows. Yes, Disney+ ownes the largest individual IPs. Yes, movies is an incredibly fragmented space. Yes, HBO MAX dominates premium adult drama. 

But NFLX has done a good job of defending content, and thus market, share through the most competitive period in streaming history to date. I like them at $500 because of this proven ability to adapt to the space. The only other worthwhile buy is DIS, IMO, and that‚Äôs a ticker with a whole host of other considerations.

It's a drop in the bucket in comparison and doesn't essentially make dead content if they let some of these shows shoot like three episodes or a movie to wrap up, instead of dead ending them.

It's like try getting someone to recommend The OA to you with how it ended. If they had let them finish it off though you could suggest it as a really good short series with an either okay or amazing ending. If it's a bad ending I think people will still appreciate resolution."

Although they haven't really made any strong audience grabbers. I think Devilman Cry Baby was the last like ""OMG YOU SEE THIS SHOW?"" they put out. I know some people are pretty deeply invested in Seven Deadly Sins but outside of that it's been pretty niche and lukewarm for everything else.

Netflix has a huge slate of traditional animes coming out over the year that are Netflix exclusive though. Yasuke seems to be lighting people up though. Idk what's stopping netflix from buying out some big manga before someone else."

But even with Disney's success, people are gonna keep Netflix a stable in their streaming catalogue if they just keep doing what they are doing. All others are being cycled through. I believe Disney+ will become a stable too, if they are not already, they just need to scale. But they can co-exist as stables.

What are some other things you can invest in aside from stocks, and do you think people are aware of those options? 

Anything else you‚Äôd like to share?"

2 Need to beat inflation long term. Researched about how money works before my first paycheck so I could know how to allocate my income.

3 Of course. You invest forever.

4 Go pick up a simple book like 'Common Sense Investing' by Jack Bogle. Don't forget, ""In the short-run, the stock market is a voting machine. Yet, in the long-run, it is a weighing machine.""

Stocks are probably the best productive asset class to creating wealth. And stocks unlike speculative asset classes are not zero sum game; in other words, theoretically, everyone can win in the stock market.

5 Read hundreds of academia research papers, read dozens of books, watched hundreds of Youtube videos including MIT OpenCourseware lectures and other people trying to valuate stocks, read/watched through videos/annual reports of Buffett, Munger, Li Lu, Berkshire Hathaway, Templeton, Peter Lynch, Jim Simons, etc.

6 Go read 'Boglehead's Guide to Investing' by Taylor Larimore. Don't forget to get in the habit of budgeting.

7 I looked at the VT market cap ratio of US:International and buy myself ITOT + IXUS with a similar ratio (tilt toward US due to local exposure \[lower currency risk\])

8 As of right now, none. Everyone is throwing money everywhere and anything that remotely looks like 'the future' is priced quite high.

9 Stocks they don't know much about. What do you use everyday without thinking. Then look at its financial statements and come up with your own story.

I don't directly use (or know) Palantir products in my day to day life. I though however use Visual Studio Code a lot and enjoy the growth Microsoft is putting in towards future Computer Science majors (e.g.: upcoming terminal, github, etc.).

The other side is 'market cap is too big. It won't grow as fast. Won't go 5x'. Market cap always seem too big. That's the point. Trust a strong company that you actually use all day and would love holding.

Think of as buying a business. It's easier to hold when holding a company you really enjoy its products than holding some reddit stock in a downturn.

And do you really need to 5x your money in X years? Slow and steady generally wins the race. You don't lose anything by missing out but you can lose everything by having a huge bet work against you.

(Note: I hold AMD, Microsoft, and Google for longer term plays on my 'speculative stock account')

10 No idea and don't care.

11 I fell into the reddit hype of RKT after making massive winnings from GME event. I am still much positive but I have since then quickly exited most of my reddit speculative positions (e.g.: Pltr at break even).  I still hold very little RKT because it's still a solid company but I hold just enough for my risk tolerance now.

Don't fall for hype. Be rational. And don't get cocky over a win.

12 99+% of my equities are just index funds of US and International: ITOT:IXUS

I don't really care. I believe by the time I retire, the global stock market will have gone up and if the stock market no longer exists by then, eh, I can worry then.

13 You invest in yourself. Your greatest investment when you are young is your own income and health.

Pick up some books in a field that you are fine working on that at least pays you enough to treat yourself as a human being in a first world country.

[bls.gov](https://bls.gov) has a lot of information about different jobs out there and the requirements/pays/job outlooks/etc.

Other investment to look at is I Savings bonds. It's a great bond for emergency savings. Inflation and deflation hedged.

14

Don't be too careless with money. Understand that money is an abstract representation of time. If you made $100, that's $100/$7.25 (minimum wage) \~= 13.8 hours of labor you got for literally doing nothing but seeing a number on the screen go up. A few thousand dollars is not ""nothing"". Think of how many Ben n Jerry's ice creams you can purchase with the money you 'play around' with. Also, learn to budget and hold a long term view. I know it seems everyone is getting rich tomorrow right now but understand that's not true: short term tends to be close to a zero sum game meaning there's probably a lot of fortune that is lost on the other side that you don't notice.

Also, don't try to time the market. It ain't worth it. I just consistently bought all throughout last year (and this year) regardless of what I thought about the market. Meanwhile, I know peers who regret not putting money in last year cause 'market looked like it will go down more' and now it's 'market is too high'. You are in it for the long haul. Stocks are always going to feel overvalued. If they were undervalued, others would have bought the stocks up. I know there's P/E ratios and all but do take into account all asset class returns are based off the risk free rate. And even then, don't try to time the market (although I pretty much predicted the bottom of the drop last year as risk free returns were near 0% while stocks were projected to have 6% long term returns \[made no sense mathematically outside irrational fear\], I didn't really care much and just invested like a robot \[have a plan and stick with it\]).

The peers I know who bought into 'hype' many times bought stocks after the prices went up without much thought. AMC/PLTR/BB/NIO/ARKK. The stock market is ruthless in which even professionals struggle. Don't throw your hard earned money without much thoughts and don't be so naive to believe 'GME will hit $500,000'. Be realistic. You are competing against flocks of people with Phd in Mathematics from Harvard/Princeton/MIT/etc. Beating the market return is incredibly difficult and it's best advised to put your serious money into indexing. And have very low expectations (yet optimistic). I put money into stock market assuming long term, I will barely break even to inflation. Any more and that's just a nice icing on the cake."
2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Wash Sale (per share) - Different Question Hey everyone, I know, another tired wash sale question but bear with me, this is at least a little different than the average wash sale question, and probably has an extremely simple answer.

Scenario: buy 10 shares at $32.00, sell at $28.85, realize a loss of $3.15 per share, or $31.50 total.

A few days later, buy 6 shares of the same stock at $32.86. Cost basis of 6 shares is: $32.86 + $3.15 loss per share = $36.01

So here‚Äôs the question: when I triggered the wash sale and re-bought 6 shares, only $18.90 of the total $31.50 loss was allocated to the 6 shares (because I only bought 6 and not 10). What happens to the loss from the other 4 shares of $12.60? I would think that:

1) if I buy 4 new shares of this stock in less than 30 days from original sale, it‚Äôll add to the cost of them.
2) or, if I buy no more of this stock, and assume I sell my new 6 shares at a gain, the $12.60 can be used as a true loss to help offset.
3) if I don‚Äôt do any other trading with this stock or other similar company stocks, the $12.60 loss would simply help negate other gains in my portfolio?"

2021-04-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Managing Emotions When Buying Into a Stock Hello,

I'm a new and young investor who is interested in making long-term buys of companies I think will do well long-term. I've read The Intelligent Investor and I've really taken to heart the idea to buy stocks for the long term. 

I understand that compound interest is the best way to go, but once I'm interested in a stock, it's hard for me not to immediately buy and wait for a good price. I think ""oh, I don't want this stock to increase in price before I buy it, so I'll buy it now."" With compound growth, even a 5-10% difference in the short term doesn't make much difference in the long term. 

For example, if I find a stock I like and conclude from my research I like it, even if the stock is on a big up day, I'll buy it immediately. 

How do you manage your emotions when buying and make plans to buy into a stock you like? Is a short term DCA (over something like the span of a few weeks) a good idea?

Thanks!"

SFDs and MFDs are going for insane prices now and that means some of these REITS have an asset on their books that's actually worth more than they may be accounting for even just within the last couple quarters.

2021-04-08 22:58:47,stocks,"I believe some reit sectors tend to do worse as rates rise like those considered to be bond proxies. However, we have to keep in mind rates on an absolute basis are still extremely low. Not to mention real yields are still negative. So a triple net lease reit like WPC with a yield of around 6% is still attractive because inflation expectations are slightly exceeding the rise in rates so far. What I mean to say is, we‚Äôre in a bit of uncharted territory, and higher yields may still be attractive going forward considering real rates are still extremely low. 

Secondly, REITs that can reprice rents or otherwise have pricing power like residential or manufactured home can serve as a decent hedge against inflation. MH has historically been sensitive to rate changes but, again, rates are still really low and annual rent increases can soften the blow. 

All in all, pick strong management that is prudent with financials and accretive with acquisitions. This gives you the best shot to hedge against inflation."

CPUs are massively complex beasts that require extensive debugging to root out bottlenecks and wring out as much performance as possible.

EVGA sells peripherals and PSUs, but not memory.

Im not saying HD and lowes arent a good or safe investment. Just that if youre looking to invest in companies that reap the rewards of a surge in limber prices, they ain‚Äôt it. They don‚Äôt make their own lumber. So they have to pay those same high prices which they pass to the consumer."

When lumber starts going down,  the trend of a cyclical is to go down with it. Cyclicals tend to tank right before their last best earnings. Q1 wont be the last good one. 

But also these stocks have been sitting at very low rates from low lumber for a while. The hard question to answer is what that normal runrate will be after the summer.

Softwoods like pine, which are what's used in home construction and are the subject of this post, are generally grown and harvested in rotation on private land like a crop. In a lot of places, particularly the southeast, that land is even owned directly by the timber company and managed for consistent production. There are some exports, but even at the absolute peak before the trade war in 2018, the US sent roughly 5% of softwood production to China. Even if all that was coming right back to the states as lumber or plywood (and it's not, China's domestic demand is insane), it wouldn't be driving the market. Here's the USDA trade tracker for Ag Exports: https://apps.fas.usda.gov/GATS/default.aspx"

Softwood lumber (for construction) is cheaper in Canada because you can easily get it from Crown lands (gov owned). This was the source of that big US/Canada tiff a few years back before the US/China trade war. Softwoods in the US are essentially grown like a plantation crop on private lands and then harvested at regular intervals in rotation. 

Plywood, furniture, and some flooring comes from China because they have the largest production capacity in the world by far. Lumber - boards like what you can buy in Home Depot, does not come from China."

For context, 600$ lumber translates to about 140 ebitda a quarter (see q3 and q4) so 560 EBITDA a year. Now imagine 900-1000$ lumber. And Thats just lumber. Pulp is surging and paper is also shooting up. So the price target which assumes 250 ebitda for the whole year from the whole company is multiple times below what they will get this year.

My biggest concern with the opening up of the market is in regards to interstate trading.  That will make or break the large corps from dominating the small ones.  Theres also a lot of existing state level regulation that can lend itself to the little guy's.  One thing about cannabis though, is that its largely grown in controlled commercial spaces, unlike tobacco, so where things like farm land are a massive barrier to entry (which in part led to the current oligopoly in tobacco,) commercial space is widely available in all shapes and forms.  Lastly, marijuana has pretty low switching costs, but dont under estimate the power of marketing and branding -- just look at those life long pall mall smokers."

2021-04-09 08:13:03,stocks,I think a lot of people don't realize that hydrogen fuel cell cars don't last as long.  Hydrogen bleeds off cause it's small andescapes. Also the fuel eats away at the engine and the welds from the inside.  I mean if they get fusion working then we might have a huge demand for it but thats unlikely in the next 5 years and by that time the EV market will be the norm.

Lets say you buy 100 shares of a stock XYZ for 50 dollars and you sell an option of lets say 75 dollar expiry. If you then went out and bought another 100 shares of the stock XYZ for 50 dollars, would that mean that essentially if the stock price reaches the strike price, you would bag the difference between the original price the strike price and the premium, if it doesn't reach the strike price you bag the premium on the contract?

If you invest 1000 a year and get 15% returns annually for 10 years you will have invested 10,000 but it will now be worth 20,000.

The pattern of the year so far is for the market to be weak and prone to a large sell around and after when monthly options expire, which is the 3rd Friday of each month and at last check the 3rd Friday of this month is not until next week.

Nothing is going to actually happen tomorrow. It's VIX crush Friday, and that's likely to play out."

2021-04-09 03:49:07,stocks,"Buying another 100 shares would do nothing. Then you'd just have 200 shares and be short a $75 call. It doesn't matter if you have another 100 shares. 

But yes. If you bought XYZ for $50 and sold a $75 call, if XYZ went up to $76 by expiration you would have to sell 100 shares for $75. So you would make a profit but you'd miss out on some additional profits in your worst case scenario. 

More drastic example: if XYZ went up to $200 by your expiration, you'd still make $2,500 (plus whatever premium you got paid for the call) but if you just held you'd be up $12,500.

This actually isn't the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is that the underlying stock dumps hard and you get stuck bagholding because you're short a call (but in this case you can simply cover by buying back the call you sold for cheap to release the shares you own from being held up as collateral so this isn't all that bad either)"

And there you go. No matter how old you get, there will always be kids, and it's not outlandish to think kids will continue to like Disney. When the pandemic really falls in the rear view, where do you think parents are going to want to take their strung-up kids who can't stop watching Frozen after school's out?"
2021-04-08 21:43:26,stocks,"Bro you realize how many people have kids? D+ is a guaranteed full time service at my house until my kids go to college. They are knocking it out of the park with marvel and Star Wars shows too that appeal to more than just kids. You can have your anecdotal dislike of it, but the subscriber growth + surveys showing high loyalty (less people plan to cancel than Netflix) you can begin to see how Disney is both a growth stock and a legacy blue chip."
2021-04-08 23:44:27,stocks,Two kids. Disney+ is easily the most-watched of our four (grumble) streaming services.
2021-04-08 20:35:36,stocks,"I don‚Äôt really like any of their stuff and don‚Äôt care at all about sports, but I have been buying the shit out of it since it got into the mid $180s.

Netflix, HBO, and Disney+ are essentially required for entry into pop culture at this point. As much as I don‚Äôt like to say that.

Also, I think all Marvel stuff is baby shit for idiots, so I‚Äôm deeply conflicted about my investments."
2021-04-08 21:10:51,stocks,"I'm not the one disliking btw, but that isn't really a good reason to sell. I only sell if the fundamental story behind a stock has changed. But of course it's your opinion and if you think that's the best choice then more power to you."

2021-04-08 21:57:02,stocks,"People didn't like RT bc it was a nerfed version of windows. I don't think it had to do with it not being great with ARM. They were trying to be like apple.  But like you said they already have decent software. 

I disagree. 

They've already done tests with superior power/speed chips in PCs and the apple computers do outperform in the tasks you've mentioned but it's not due to the chip itself. I disagree with their chips being amazing or going to be amazing bc apple has no interest in that. Their chip speeds are lower than the competition.  The point is a Mac doesn't have to have a great chip to outperform. It's optimized for it.  There's also the cost. You can get some crazy level pc with more memory, disc space, ports, etc, that will perform just as well as the apple for cheaper. 
Me mentioning supercomputer chips is simply to make a point that the tech apple is after is not cutting edge and it's okay that it's not. So I completely disagree they're going to leave other chip makers behind bc they have demonstrated they are not interested in that race. That's a good thing. 

Apple WAS notorious. AR has been successful for commercial use but consumer use is eh bc it just doesn't replace a phone I guess. I'm not sure.  But if apple wants to put a new coat of paint on it that's fine"

I don't even care about the ETF. It might be fine. But you act like anyone not interested in a random person's speculative holdings is a moron, despite the literal broad market matching it throughout the last month.

2021-04-08 22:46:48,stocks,"I'll definitely agree with you on that one, that's why I've stayed away from most of these hot stocks trading at skyhigh valuations. I've kept myself to industrials, materials and utilities. AAPL is my only tech and I believe they truly are undervalued even now."
2021-04-08 20:53:55,stocks,"Nothing wrong with that. It's easy to get tripped up in today's market, but 15% returns is a solid years worth of gains."
2021-04-09 15:37:04,stocks,"Lol, your the one making this out as me saying people are morons for not investing.  I just made the point it outperformed other stocks that people post non-stop about.  
As you say it ""tanked"" at 2.5% drop then a 2.5% rise would moon.  So get your criteria right and don't be so one sided and biased to make yourself feel better."

At least with GME, there is a chance that institutions continue to pump and dump it for a long time, allowing you to take advantage of volatility. 

With BABA, you have no chance of making profit off it in the long term because it's based in an ultra nationalist dictatorship. At some point, China is either going to invade Taiwan, or the US/UN is going to sanction it and delist all it's companies, at which point your stock becomes worth exactly $0.00.

What you described with local hospitals and community centers etc is patchwork. It'll work at the localized level but this decade will be ruled by data, of which TDOC is winning hands down. Teledoc has global reach and with the Livongo merger it's a top to bottom solution. 

Also, don't discount their mental health services. As time goes on this area is ripe for growth. This is again where experience and data help guide their decision making towards continued growth.

EDIT: to add their NPS is 95. That's higher than the likes of Netflix, Amazon or Costco."

2021-04-09 05:22:53,stocks,"I agree mental health services is lacking and I believe this is their strength in the market.  But I just can‚Äôt see them gaining ground in primary care nor in urgent care services with the industry adopting telehealth en masse.  The U.S. system is set up to be a patchwork because it‚Äôs insurance based. Until we get to a one-payer system, patchwork will dominate.  Even if they have Aetna on board, Teladoc still doesn‚Äôt accept Medicare/Medicaid FFS (which is the bulk and growing), unless I‚Äôm misreading their info.  I am not familiar with their impact internationally, so they may very well dominate there.

Plus, I just can‚Äôt get past the fact they had a $506,000,000 operating loss, a $485,000,000 net loss and negative cash in 2020...the year they should have done extremely well.  I guess time will tell who is right on this company.  Wishing you the best with Teladoc.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong (I usually am) and you make a lot of money on it."
2021-04-08 23:52:39,stocks,"You're right, you don't. Teledoc has a net promoter score of 95. To put that in perspective Apple is 47, Amazon 69, Netflix 78 and Costco (with over 90% renewal rate) is 79. They're obviously doing something right."

2021-04-09 10:13:10,stocks,This has to be a long term play as no real recovery expected for a couple of years.
2021-04-09 10:14:55,stocks,"It was a long term recovery play at sub $15 dollars. Preferably closer to $10.

2021-04-09 01:39:59,stocks,"Passive funds are LESS risk. Active is managed by people who trade for the fund, and with activity comes risk.

Passive ETFs that track broad markets are inherently neutral. They typically track an entire index ""weighted"" by market cap. Take  look at DIA (tracks DOW,), QQQ(tracks NASDAQ), SPY(tracks S&P500). Look at the holdings. It's a market wide hold based on market caps. Whole market goes an average down, these go down too. WHOLE market averages up... they did too.

I never said you won't win going this way. You WILL win, but you won't win as much, and you have to wage slave inputing as much as possible  for 30-40 years.

Look, you put 10k in any broad market ETF now, in 10 years you will have more than 10k. Look at any chart and that is A FACT, but you will not get rich..

So you would invest in whatever you felt like within/through the Roth IRA if that's what you choose.  I suggest researching the topic a bit more to fully understand the advantages and restrictions of choosing a Roth IRA over a standard IRA or even an individual brokerage account."

2021-04-08 23:40:22,stocks,"Bonds in general are off the bottom of last year.

The Fed has repeated it will keep its rates low, but it only lends to banks.

Bank rates have risen.

Therefore bank spreads and profit margins have risen.

Banks are using new loans at high margin to fill their reserves, after nearly a year of being allowed to operate at nearly 0 reserve.

The Fed is encouraging this, since it takes liquidity from the public and it improves bank stability.

When the banks' reserves are at nominal levels, the Fed will reinstate the reserve requirement and will start to raise its rates.

It will also be looking to offload its record assets, but it will only do so in a way that moderates inflation. Which could take a long time if economic growth takes care of it. Which is no issue. The Fed can collect the payments on the mortgage-backed securities it bought until they mature."
