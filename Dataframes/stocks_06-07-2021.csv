2021-06-07 19:57:48,stocks,Wealthsimple if Canadian. I use questrade. But I do alot of USD so it makes more sense.
2021-06-07 19:57:57,stocks,"Thanks! A quick look into Fidelity and it seems pretty reliable. May I ask if you know how it compares to the app I was looking at in Wealthsimple? They seem rather similar, however Fidelity does seem to have a more known reputation."
2021-06-07 19:59:30,stocks,Noted! May I ask why Wealthsimple is good specifically for Canadians (which I am one of)?
2021-06-07 19:33:55,stocks,"Peter Lynch ""worked at Fidelity"" is putting it lightly hahaha"
2021-06-07 19:00:31,stocks,"I love how much he weighs on fundamentals, since that’s the difference between a good and a bad company. That can make or break your investment."
2021-06-07 19:48:02,stocks,"His book was one of my key training materials early on. I don't necessarily follow him like a sheep, but there are some good lessons that can be learned right there."

2021-06-07 19:14:12,stocks,1st bullet point reminded me of COIN
2021-06-07 18:28:52,stocks,First *U.S. listed* psychedelic ETF (not the first globally).
2021-06-07 18:29:41,stocks,"Yes true, I’ll edit to say first US listed one."
2021-06-07 18:32:31,stocks,"Seems one thing that’s different from PSYK is that this one has more cannabis holdings, which is interesting and at least to me seems like a bit of a different space."
2021-06-07 19:12:56,stocks,"Id stick with low cost vanguard etfs. Here some to name a few. VOO, VTI, VBK, VOT, VGT, VUG."
2021-06-07 19:20:40,stocks,Vti vxus your done
2021-06-07 18:45:49,stocks,VXUS? Some more broad market exposure. QCLN may be in for a bit of a rough ride still.
2021-06-07 19:21:40,stocks,"I should then do only VT, or should I 60/40 VTI/VXUS"
2021-06-07 19:25:15,stocks,Don’t listen to me I don’t want to give you bad advice.... it will be something to research
2021-06-07 18:25:18,stocks,"If you no longer work for the employer you may not even be entitled to said shares, check your contract or contact your employer to sort it out."
2021-06-07 18:08:03,stocks,That a question for your employer. I was in a similar situation and they just bought us out without the option to keep them or convert them.
2021-06-07 19:20:36,stocks,What is the company?
2021-06-07 17:29:47,stocks,"If you're just buying stocks because you hear them on reddit/news sites, I'd go with an ETF.  Beyond that, if you want to actively track your investments and make changes based on quarterly reports, 3-5. If you just want a sampling of stocks from different sectors and you want to pick names that you think might win against their competitors, diversifying is fine"
2021-06-07 19:06:53,stocks,"You can't diversify too much. You can diversify *incorrectly*. Broad diversification should be done though ETFs, to *properly* manage a portfolio of 20 individual stocks you're basically committing to a lot of work. Possibly even as much as a part time job. If you were to replace 60-75% with broad market ETFs, then you have the time to do the research to find better quality companies to put that remaining 40-25% percent in. How big you make those pieces of the pie is determined by your risk tolerance and your willingness to do the initial DD to find positions and the time your wiling to spend to follow the companies to ensure the health of your investments."
2021-06-07 19:28:47,stocks,I'd be very careful to do my homework before investing in any stock hyped on Reddit or other social media. Plenty of times it's just a pump and dump scheme designed to take advantage of your FOMO to get you to buy in near the peak instead of the dip. They'll sell as soon as you buy in and then the price dumps.
2021-06-07 17:39:36,stocks,I would say buy the stocks you are willing to follow.
2021-06-07 17:40:32,stocks,"Don't buy every stock you hear about in reddit, or at least if you do do research first and come to that conclusion. Right now what is happening is a lot of stocks that are very beaten down/heavily shorted are rebounding and due to the nature of volatility, they're rebounding very fast. It's also easy for the rebounds to crash very shortly after.

Don't chase the money, you wouldn't have wanted to buy into any of these stocks 2 months ago when they were all down 40+% but now that they're jumping up you want in. If you did buy into these stocks that are all shooting up rn, you'd have wanted to get in about a month ago."
2021-06-07 18:07:25,stocks,"I diversified too much, and my Schwab IRA account was down 0.04% today and my TD Ameritrade account was up 0.04% today."
2021-06-07 18:22:50,stocks,"If you want stocks and are just getting started buy stocks in large companies that have little chance in disappearing in 10 years.  Buy the stocks.  Then forget about it.  Log in once q quarter and see how they are doing.

Look into dividend stocks.  Look into dividend reinvestment.

Don't look to get rich quick. 

It takes money to make money in the stock market.  (Plus time)"
2021-06-07 19:59:25,stocks,"3-5 is too few unless you're variance seeking (most people are variance averse). I think there are scenarios where it makes sense but I can't recommend it in general. 

If you're going to own more than say 30 you might as well buy a broad ETF.

If you want to assemble a portfolio I recommend targeting owning 12-24. Personally I'm in the lower end of that range."
2021-06-07 17:14:31,stocks,"Concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves wealth. Figure out what you're looking for and adjust accordingly."
2021-06-07 18:44:03,stocks,"15-30 holdings max with a 60% US stock holdings, 25% foreign stock holdings and 15% bonds/ETF's is my personal strategy."
2021-06-07 18:15:39,stocks,"I have a bunch of stocks that are doing relatively well but they're in smaller quantities. I think for now it doesn't matter if you diversified too much, just slim down and increase positions in companies you've really liked and are doing well. That's what I'm doing at least."
2021-06-07 17:30:22,stocks,"Modigliani and Miller had a take on this one. I’d however prefer an highly diversified ETF (e.g. MSCI WORLD, ACWI,...) over single stocks and look into the core satellite strategy if your portfolio is larger than 30k USD or equivalent."
2021-06-07 17:32:57,stocks,I add about $5-800 a month and am investing in small positions as you described but also putting some in ETFs for bonds. When I want to make a big investment in a concentrated sector I’ll sell the ETFs first. The ETFs go up when the market goes down and I get monthly dividends. I did the concentration for EV chargers and it’s finally paying off but I just wish I didn’t do it all at once. My goal is to be able to concentrate my investment closer to the floor without loosing gains in the mean time.
2021-06-07 19:34:55,stocks,Ray dalio has a few videos on diversification
2021-06-07 19:51:59,stocks,"It’s hard to keep track of everything if you’re not doing it full time. I was swing trading like 30 stocks earlier this year. Sometimes I’d see that something spiked for an hour or so (I’d usually sell at a spike) but I completely missed it because I can’t sit there and watch all my shit all day. Alerts help, but when you have that many, sometime they go off too often and go ignored.

Now I’m down to 5 or 6, plus an ETF for my long term holding. It’s much easier to track and trade like that throughout the day. I’m doing everything from my phone though. If I had a desk job when I could have my portfolio on a separate screen all day, maybe I’d do it differently."
2021-06-07 19:59:02,stocks,"Stop buying the stock that has gone up +5% every day for three days.   Consider stocks that have suffered for 3 days.  Look for good value, not popularity.

I honestly don’t trust Reddit at all, but I do trust the fact that if Reddit isn’t talking about a stock much or at all, it may be very good value."
2021-06-07 18:12:42,stocks,">If you're just buying stocks because you hear them on reddit/news sites, I'd go with an ETF.

what /u/PM_Me_Things_Yo_Like isn't saying but should be said, is that if you invest like an idiot you're better off just going with a safe ETF because you WILL get burned"
2021-06-07 19:56:38,stocks,"Concentration *can* build wealth. It can also make you poor.

Lots of people have built wealth through investing in widely diversified index funds."
2021-06-07 17:29:19,stocks,"That is just not true.

Diversification is very important and has a huge effect on risk-adjusted returns."
2021-06-07 17:33:36,stocks,You might factor in steadiness and things change again. Everything is just funny money until it’s hard cash or sitting on your bank account and sadly after tax.
2021-06-07 17:34:42,stocks,I see on your avatar that you are a man of culture as well. I also agree on your take.
2021-06-07 19:56:33,stocks,"Yeah, go and pick 30 stocks to diversify your $3,000 stock portfolio. You will grow that to a billion dollar in 1000 years.

Diversification only matters more once you build your wealth to a more respectable level where risk of losing a large amount is impactful. As of most new young audiences on reddit, they should be focusing on honing their skills to earn more incomes rather than to invest."
2021-06-07 19:59:05,stocks,"Risk-adjusted and total returns are two different things. Every academic and professional study unanimously confirms diversification to dilute total returns. None of that is to say diversification isn't important, but it's not the best way to build wealth."
2021-06-07 17:35:36,stocks,"Haha i’m not on WSB, i enjoy the madness over there though. Like the avatar"
2021-06-07 17:42:57,stocks,Couldn’t agree more!

2021-06-07 17:25:45,stocks,Are you sure you have a cash account?  Many brokers have margin as the default account type.  This is a special kind of margin that allows them to give you instant deposits and instant settlements etc but don't let you actually take out a margin loan or day trade.  Robinhood is one broker that does this.  Technically it is still a margin account and is subject to the margin agreement which allows them to loan out your shares.
2021-06-07 16:56:56,stocks,"What broker?

I am on Fidelity and they do not loan shares unless you have over 250K and approve the lending out!"
2021-06-07 17:01:12,stocks,"Who cares if they lend your stock?  If you have to worry about the few shares you own in a stock being shorted and you have to watch the daily movements, you're not doing this properly."
2021-06-07 17:31:30,stocks,"That sounds likely, I can’t buy on margin with my account at all, but given that they can loan my shares out that makes a ton of sense."
2021-06-07 17:02:18,stocks,"Stash, told me I was automatically enrolled."
2021-06-07 17:09:22,stocks,"Uh, clearly the OP? Doesn't matter how many shares he has, if he had not intended for them to be borrowed, then why would he be okay with it? Not only that but OP doesn't say how many shares he has or how often he looks at them, so I don't know how you make those assumptions."
2021-06-07 17:15:19,stocks,"I did mention I am a new investor, I’m still learning the ropes. I’m mostly bothered due to being automatically enrolled and then not informed about it. 

I was under the assumption that cash accounts couldn’t have their shares lent. I thought I’d ask here to check and see if I was wrong or not."
2021-06-07 17:22:09,stocks,"Move over to Fidelity is all I can recommend!

I am not familiar with Stash but if they are lending your shares out to potentially short your position they are not your friend!"
2021-06-07 17:13:25,stocks,"Obviously he is,  the point is that only someone who doesn't know what they are doing would worry about the day to day movements.  Sorry,  but my time is way too valuable to worry about whether my stocks went up or down every single day, and I would never spend even more time if I'm worried that it is being shorted. If that's the case,  I wouldn't be cut out for the market.

I would also consider it a safe educated assumption that he's not talking about having hundreds of thousands of shares of a particular security on a cash account without knowing the interworkings of the market.  When it comes to shorting, 100,000 shares is generally HTB if that's all that is left. If the security has more available short shares than you own,  again a waste of time worrying about. 

I didn't call and check to see if my house was worth more today either."
2021-06-07 17:25:51,stocks,"I transferred over to Ameritrade over a week ago, I was going to pick Fidelity (heard a lot of good things) but they don’t cover the Transfer fees. Unfortunately, the majority of my shares are still stuck behind in Stash due to them still being borrowed."
2021-06-07 17:15:38,stocks,Your time is too valuable yet you're here on Reddit. The OP asked a simple question and you're here trying to brag about yourself and not adding anything valuable.
2021-06-07 17:18:32,stocks,"Actually, my original post didn't even mention myself. I'll let you get back to watching your after hours tickers now."
2021-06-07 17:20:21,stocks,Except your second comment did. Notice how you again made an assumption when I didn't specify. I'll let you get back to your reading comprehension class now.
2021-06-07 17:32:12,stocks,"That company is Canadian and its share trade primarily on the TSE with the symbol WELL (or [WELL.TO](https://WELL.TO)). In the US, shares are only available on the OTC pink sheets market (sometimes referred to as PINX), and many brokerages don't cover pink sheet stocks and/or will charge additional fees for trading in this market."
2021-06-07 17:34:07,stocks,I see. That makes sense. I'm still kinda new to this and was unaware. Thank you for your response!
2021-06-07 17:11:28,stocks,"Maybe a stupid question, but why dilute to just rebuy?"
2021-06-07 19:12:09,stocks,"$120 cost basis here, really didn’t like overpaying for depop and now this…Do i dump on open tomorrow?"
2021-06-07 17:30:22,stocks,The cynical thought is they're trying to blunt the impact of the news release. The more optimistic thought is they consider their share price cheap and are willing to take on debt to buy back now. I'd guess the future price will ultimately dictate that narrative.
2021-06-07 17:33:42,stocks,"well only 150million is for buybacks out of 1billion. They think the stock is cheap and will go up in value, at which point they can sell them again if they please."
2021-06-07 18:04:37,stocks,"Despite their intentions, offerings always have a negative undertones and sensitive shareholders typically react bearishly.

2021-06-07 16:38:07,stocks,"Read title read first sentence, confused. If you know it’s not good to time the market why are you trying to do it?"
2021-06-07 17:08:17,stocks,"I have some fundamental questions on what you are hoping to achieve but just to get to the point and answer your question

If you have shares that are over 1 year, then you should sell those out in FIFO order. This is especially so as you said you hold these stocks and it would be a trimming or rebalancing event. That gives the newer shares a chance to become older shares."
2021-06-07 16:52:54,stocks,"Same as u/funpolice99

Why you want to rebalance if you invest long term?"
2021-06-07 17:20:47,stocks,"If you had many shares, which you started buying many years ago and continued to buy every year, why wouldn’t you want to sell the shares just older than a year, so you would only pay long term capital gains, in order to pay less taxes this year? What is the benefit of using FIFO if you’re going to continue to hold as much as you can? Why wouldn’t you pay the least taxes possible now? (Sorry - this stuff easily confuses me! Thanks for any clarification)"
2021-06-07 17:31:48,stocks,"What I described is minimizing taxes. Anything over 1 year has the same tax rate so it doesn't matter if it's just over 1 year old vs 3 years old. If you use normal brokerages, you have the choice of FIFO or LIFO for your sales"
2021-06-07 17:36:05,stocks,"But everything over 1 year doesn’t necessarily have the same cost basis. If you chose a tax lot that was more recent than the oldest, but still older than 1 year, it would reduce your capital gains tax owed this year compared to selling FIFO, no? Because the cost basis of the more recent shares would be higher (maybe - obviously this could not be the case as well, I guess I’m assuming a near constantly appreciating stock, however slow, so maybe that’s not right,) or I have some other misunderstanding."
2021-06-07 17:44:17,stocks,"Your understanding is correct. So it really isn't so complex - theorically you can choose which cost basis you are selling if you do your taxes manually. Otherwise, its usually FIFO. Its up to you.

For taxes for long term, although the net tax amount will be higher for lower cost basis stocks, in the end whether that is next year or 10 years from now, it is tax you will have to pay. The assumption is that the total outlay of tax will remain the same for all long term stocks"
2021-06-07 17:49:14,stocks,"That is true, you do have to pay it eventually either way. I guess I’m thinking of it from my age, early 30s, and wanting to pay the least amount I can this year in order to preserve as much net worth as possible and gain time in the market but maybe that’s purely emotional with no rational reason. But maybe the tax hit won’t be as big if your income/net worth is higher then that it is today? Or it still doesn’t matter? I really can’t come to a conclusion haha"
2021-06-07 16:22:51,stocks,You could roll it and collect the premium. Also it might go down below 11 later on
2021-06-07 16:48:39,stocks,"If you don't want to exercise  your call, you can make a 'buy to close' for the same price and date you have your covered call open for.  You'll pay a premium, but if you really want to keep the shares and don't want to sell them, it's an option."
2021-06-07 16:35:59,stocks,"I saw the clov pump yesterday. Two separate bullish DD posted within an hour of each other. My advice: don't invest in anything you see pumped here, just use it for general finance news."
2021-06-07 17:44:38,stocks,I’m in the same situation with $11 Covered Calls but I’m happy to get exercised and take the free cash. This is the downside to selling Covered Calls but a win is a win. He is right though a roll out is what I’m gonna do if it’s not exercised. 90% of my monthly income is from selling Covered Calls and I rarely get exercised. It’s just part of the game. Plus $2 per share on a $9 stock is a fantastic return plus premium.
2021-06-07 16:53:52,stocks,"“, it’s an option”. Well played sir."
2021-06-07 17:48:58,stocks,His issue is that he won’t be able to realize the full gains from the pump you mentioned not that he lost money. In other words your advice is counterproductive here.
2021-06-07 16:46:25,stocks,Please can I ask where you’d recommend people go to get investment ideas?

2021-06-07 16:09:19,stocks,As a long term holder I wouldn’t worry at all. This is just good for you. If the company have exceeded your price target just sell it. If not this will probably just strengthen the company for the long term.

2. No I’m not a broker, I have an actual brain. Do you even know what payment for order flow is? Sure seems like you don’t. You’re assuming that retail people haven’t already started leaving crappy brokers such as Robinhood, etoro, Webull, and every other nonsense one out there that doesn’t actually buy your stocks, and doesn’t have the liquidity to give you your money if you did actually become a millionaire.

3. Banning payment for order flow would actually fucking help retail, and curb 10,000 trades a second algo computers that routinely dip your precious holdings when you yolo and FOMO into the stock of the moment you hear about on CNBC. So would putting a one cent per trade tax on any buy and sell order. That wouldn’t hurt retail traders, but those crooks working the algos? 

4. Nothing in my post said anything about YOU shorting anything. Learn to read.

You make this stupid post claiming erasing payment for order flow is going to wreck the market because retail will leave when they have to make $6 a trade, and that’s completely false. Plenty of first time traders have made a lot of money in the past year, and more people are learning about the stock market than in any time in the last 40yrs. The only reason payment for order flow was even allowed in the first place was because it was hidden in very fine print in people’s Robinhood agreement (and any other crap broker). It was a devious way to make money and let hedge funds see trends unfairly, and to jump in ahead of the crowd and out ahead of them as well. No different than insider information, which usually nets prison time.

2021-06-07 15:28:51,stocks,"If you're getting hired into a startup that claims they're going to be IPO within two years, then you should check the facts especially since you're getting such a large stock option.

Employees that join a late stage startup usually do not get that much shares unless they're joining as a very high level employee (VP / C-Level)."

a) You need to know how much of the company that represents. If it is 0.01% that means that if the company IPOs for 1 billion dollars, you get 100k minus what you pay to exercise the options (7000 * 3.5). Keep in mind an IPO/exit for a company is rarely that high. Moderate success unknown companies often get bought out for 10s of millions or maybe low 100s of millions -- and we are talking tech here.

b) The above percentage might be decreased if they raise more funding. If company is doing okay, you won't lose too much. If it isn't and they have god forbid a down round, you might lose a ton or all of it."

Edit- and yes there is taxes of course like someone else mentioned"
2021-06-07 17:46:24,stocks,"I have worked at a few start-ups where they offered stock and I have two pieces of advice:

1. Don't drink the kool-aid. Start-ups are exciting but a lot of them fail. Sometimes the communication about how close to profitability they are is opaque, sometimes they lie about it. I worked at a start-up that was 'on track to be the future of money' then one day they ran out of funding and I didn't get paid for months. If you are going to hit it big you will find out eventually but the best thing you can do is just keep learning new skills and NETWORK with your coworkers/business-partners. It is very possible this start-up will fail but someone you meet at this job will hire you at another start-up that makes it. 

2. Don't exercise the options until you have to. The way it typically works is you can buy the shares you vest at the quoted price up to 90 days AFTER YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY. So just hang out, vest those options, see if you think the company will make it - you have plenty of time. If they IPO or get bought out it won't be a surprise so it is better just to wait."
2021-06-07 14:24:57,stocks,"Taxes can make a big dent in the amount you ultimately realize (especially if you start to consider exercising and holding at different fair market values and have to consider AMT). Problem is despite confirmation bias not all startups make it public (could stay private forever, could be acquired at any point during your vesting schedule for a different valuation)  nor do they reach huge multiples that would take the price from 3.50 to 200+ in your example. But yes in general that’s the incentive for joining start ups and potentially compromising on areas like base salary/liquidity."

2021-06-07 15:24:40,stocks,"It's definitely possibly but the issue is that your strike price of $3.50 a share is super low for it to hit $200 a share in 5 years. The growth would have to be absolutely insane. As others have mentioned, your stock options agreement also has a date in which you must exercise or at least buy the shares and hold until you ever want to sell them. 

I have a friend that's company DPO'd last year and they had about 250K shares at a strike price around $5. The stock hit the market at about $7.50 a share and now is in the mid 20's. My friend has since left the company but made a few million from them going public so its definitely possible the difference between my friends situation and yours, his he had 243K  more shares than you which helped them achieve the few million mark. My gut feeling is that in order for your company to hit $200 a share strictly based on your strike price (unless you been with the company a very long time and they has since issued additional shares at a higher valuation)

You may want to look into what the current valuation of your shares are at now based on company info that has been given to you or recent private market transactions for the companies shares. Also understanding how many shares have been issued by your company is a important thing to consider."
2021-06-07 14:36:28,stocks,"I mean yes that’s the idea as to why the offer this as an incentive. Sure you could get lucky and strike it rich…..or a thousand other things could happen instead. As others said, it could fail, it could be bought out, it could go public and trade side-ways forever. 

Being honest, if you were hiring for your own start up what do you think is going to attract more interest, saying that you “plan” to have the stock trading at 200 within 5 years or that it might trade at 5$ by then. I mean it took Facebook close to 5 years from going public to break triple digits. 

Do some research into publicly traded companies that are in the same market as your start-up. See what their market caps are, look at their stock trends, profits and earnings, etc. It’s not perfect but I might give you some sense of where your company would fit in, and what room it has to grow."

you say their goal is 200$, what would the market cap be at that price? does that seem plausible to you? chances are they didn't even tell you the number of outstanding shares.

approach startup equity like you would with an other public company to attempt to figure out its value and upside, then use that as a part of your internal compensation calculations.

2021-06-07 18:46:54,stocks,"Adding a couple things having just gone through this:

* The option pool will likely be diluted. And then further diluted with each additional funding round.

* Going public is one of a couple possibilities. You could be acquired in which case your options would be last in line. Or you could go under.

* If you leave early you're taking a big risk with exercising options. Not only are you putting cash up, but you may have to pay taxes on that according to AMT. And you may get nothing out of it. So if you're factoring it into your decision be confident that you're going to be there for awhile. 

* What valuation is that $3.50 figure based on? What would the $200 figure be based on? You have to understand that's a huge jump, by 58 times, which means that you have some sort of info that the last series investors did not. For me personally, it was confidence that the space was growing, and that the company had a talented team that would facilitate that growth. 

* Before it reaches $200, would you sell? Most people would and diversify, and that would be the correct strategy. Else you're just yoloing a large portion of your net worth into 1 stock. I'm sure many Tesla people sold at $12 when it initially IPO'd. 

* We're a year into a bull market and growth stocks (especially via spac route) are getting insane valuations. I imagine once this dies it will have ripple effects, and billion dollar valuations won't be as normal. 

The best advice is to treat it like it doesn't exist unless you have a substantial amount of options. $25k is not substantial and about average, and probably not worth factoring into your compensation package. Startups will always try to sell you on this, but unless you have actual equity, don't even factor it in."

2021-06-07 12:58:37,stocks,"Well, since they're already long term, if you have no intentions of selling the shares in the new brokerage in the next year it makes no difference. You'll just have to pay the taxes on the gains up to this point next year. 

But your assumption about the ""limbo period"" is wrong. You won't be able to trade until the process is done but your cost basis information is part of what gets transferred over."
2021-06-07 12:55:56,stocks,You might not get all your shares/value back

2021-06-07 13:02:32,stocks,"> But your assumption about the ""limbo period"" is wrong. You won't be able to trade until the process is done but your cost basis information is part of what gets transferred over.

to clarify, what i meant by that is lets say ABC is trading at 100. and closes at around 100. i initiate the transfer from RH (literally 7% of my portfolio atm) to TOS to just consolidate my portfolio. what happens when ABC drops to 80 tomorrow at open? (or whenever the transfer clears to TOS).

will the shares be ""bought back in"" to the new brokerage at 100, its new price on that day, or is it still considered ""being in the market"" through this transition period?

will"
2021-06-07 13:08:48,stocks,"When you transfer shares from brokerage to brokerage, they aren't sold and re-bought. They are just transferred.

Your cost basis remains the same. If you owned 10 shares of XYZ at $10 a share purchased on 1/1/2020, that information remains the same in the new brokerage after the asset transfer process is complete.

If those shares were worth 100 at close yesterday and 80 at open today, well, then that's what they are worth. Your shares don't have a value other than what people are willing to pay for them. Being untradable due to transfer process doesn't mean their value isn't fluctuating with the rest of the shares on market. They are all the same."
2021-06-07 13:10:13,stocks,"ah i get what you're saying.

then it seems like its different compared to how 401k's are handled?

i remember being told that 401k's have this issue during a rollover."

2021-06-07 13:20:31,stocks,Tax advantaged accounts have special considerations. I've been assuming you've been talking about taxable accounts
2021-06-07 13:21:22,stocks,"yup this would be for taxable account.

so for taxed advantaged accounts (such as a 401k), the situation i described would be the case?"
2021-06-07 13:31:46,stocks,I'm not sure. I've had the same 401k and Roth accounts since I opened them. I'd seek out advice from an actual accountant when it comes to info about tax advantaged accounts.

2021-06-07 13:21:17,stocks,"You aren't buying (or selling) the shares. You are buying (or selling) the ""option"" (or ""right"") to buy (or sell) the shares at the strike price on or before the expiration date. You do that (buy or sell at strike price) by ""exercising"" the option."
2021-06-07 14:09:07,stocks,"I've been trading options for quite a while now and I can generally understand most questions. I have no idea what the fuck you just asked here. I'm going to assume a lot of things in trying to answer your question:

You're asking of a stock at 300 and what would happen if you bought a 200 put. The price you pay initially is the premium times 100. Since a 200p is 33% otm I'm gonna guess it's not more than a dollar so 1 * 100 is 100 upfront cost. If it's a very long dated option, it'll be more expensive cause you're paying for time. If the stock drops from 300 to 200, you will make 0 profit by expiration. You need it to drop past 200 and with momentum if you want to profit. Just becusee a stock goes down does not mean a put will go up in value"
2021-06-07 15:10:39,stocks,"Options can be financially dangerous.  Make sure you inderstand the process before dabbling in it.  Or, have a lot of money to cover losses should they occur."
2021-06-07 13:33:29,stocks,"You would BUY to open the put position. You will SELL to close the position. If you exercise your put on expiration day, you will SELL 100 shares at the price they are on expiration day. If you buy one call option then you will have the option but not obligation to buy 100 shares at a set price, on a set day called the expiration date."
2021-06-07 18:06:48,stocks,Look up InTheMoney on YouTube to answer all your options questions. You’re welcome.
2021-06-07 12:37:40,stocks,I’m right here waiting on answers too 🤔
2021-06-07 14:34:06,stocks,"Thanks, another question I have is whether it is possible to set it up so that it automatically buys back at a certain point."
2021-06-07 14:38:23,stocks,When exactly does it expire? Do people wait until the expiration to act and exercise the option? If it expires on friday what time exactly? End of the day?
2021-06-07 15:18:35,stocks,"Yes, you can set a limit buy to close, limit sell to open etc. When I sell to open covered calls on my shares, for example, I set a buy to close limit order immediately after for $10 because fidelity doesn't charge a commission for closing option trade values for $10 or less of value per contract. But you could set it up for whatever price you wanted it to trigger at"
2021-06-07 15:01:19,stocks,"These are incredibly basic questions. Look up option basics on YouTube or investopedia. Otherwise, youre just learning random information when you should be understanding options. As a whole.

Options expire for the date you buy it for. Specifically, 530 Pm EST. Most options are not exercised and almost none are exercised early. There is no option that exists that would give more profit exercising early than just selling the option itself. If you don't know why that is, look up option Greeks after learning option basics."
2021-06-07 15:10:07,stocks,Oh I see. So people sell the option when they are in the money before it expires.
2021-06-07 12:15:02,stocks,They seem overvalued at 43.37 P/E. Not to mention the company is slowly dying out. I just don't know many people that have them anymore.
2021-06-07 12:20:14,stocks,"I honestly am not educated enough to know how to determine under or over valuing, but cricut has made recent innovations and has a new machine coming out this month as well! Me thinks they could be making some good moves :) but it’s all just speculation on my part."
2021-06-07 12:22:23,stocks,"Other companies in the household tool range have P/E ratios around 10, meaning Cricut is trading at about 4x what it should be. If they can manage to get a 3-4x revenue bump with this new machine then it'd be a good buy."
2021-06-07 12:31:28,stocks,"You cant tell if a stock is overvalued because you looked at similar stocks? It depends on how many shares there are, KGV, etc. Im not saying that you’re wrong since i didn’t look at this company. Im just saying that you can not say that company A is overvalued because Company B is active in the same sector and has 1/4 of its share price."
2021-06-07 12:42:27,stocks,"So the P/E ratio is essentially how valued the type of business is in general based on the average between the companies within it vs the individual company’s overall value?

I definitely am taking a positive outlook on their future! Especially with the rise of small businesses and artists and how positively this company is received in comparison to the competition."
2021-06-07 13:24:07,stocks,Share price is different from a P/E ratio.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Check out Enthusiast Gaming, a huge player in the gaming industry (NASDAQ: EGLX) (TSX: EGLX)

Wanted to shed some light on a huge player in the e-sports industry. Enthusiast Gaming Holdings is doing amazing things when it comes to reaching the younger generation with high-quality social media and e-sports content. They have numerous revenue streams and are truly a force to be reckoned with within the e-sports and media world as a whole. They have an amazing team lead by CEO Adrian Montgomery, who brings lots of invaluable experience in media, sports, and finance to the table.

Enthusiast separates its business operations into four main pillars. While these pillars all focus on gaming they are each unique and offer a significant competitive advantage to Enthusiast. These pillars are;

* Media and Content - this includes several extremely popular websites and Youtube Channels including WiseCrack, The Escapist, and Nintendo Enthusiast. All in all, they have generated over 1 billion views on their websites and over 3 billion from their youtube channels.
* Talent and Influencers - They have partnered with major influencers such as XqC, Muselk, and Chica. This portion is made up of over 550+ different influencers and streamers.
* E-Sports - They own and operate 7 professional e-sports teams including Luminosity Gaming and the Vancouver Titans.
* Live Experience - Their largest in-person and online experience is ELGX, which is the largest gaming convention in Canada and they additionally put on other events such as the Pocket Gamer Event.

This company has cast its net extremely wide and is able to make a name for itself in the e-sports market sure because of it. Some of its recent numbers look great as well;

* 49% YoY growth of paying subscribers
* 433% Revenue growth from 2019 to $73.7 Million dollars in LTM.
* 120% YoY growth of gross profits!

These guys are honestly killing it and capturing the attention of Gen Z at rates similar to other social media giants like Facebook and Snapchat. Additionally, they are dominating the game compared to the Sports Media Industry.

Overall, I'm very impressed with Enthusiast Gaming and would definitely recommend checking them out. Their current stock price is $8.13 which and has displayed significant growth YTD. I think with the growth the e-sports industry as a whole is displaying, this company will follow suit!

2021-06-07 16:26:36,stocks,"Not sure if you're being woefully ignorant or just replying in bad faith. Every single insurer covers Humira or similar TNF inhibitors, meaning that list price of $60k a year isn't representative of what patients are actually going to be paying. And to remind you, insurers only cover Humira and other TNF alphas because it has clearly demonstrated clinical efficacy in a number of different diseases (RA, PA, etc.). 

The problem with aducanumab is that most insurers probably won't be covering it because WE DON'T KNOW IF IT EVEN WORKS. Look at what happened with Eteplisen from Sarepta back in 2016. Anthem (the largest insurer in America) and a number of other insurers REFUSED to cover the drug because, like aducanumab, it didn't show clear clinical efficacy, only improvements in a biomarker (in that case dystrophin concentration). So what this meant is that patients desperate with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (which typically kills the patient by the age of 30) had to pay out of pocket cost (which is ~$300k a year) and financially ruined hundreds of families for a drug that WE STILL DON'T KNOW WORKS TODAY, but has serious side effects (like aducanumab). Do you understand the difference in scenarios between Humira and Eteplirsen/aducanumab?

So what does this mean for your average patient and family? It means that a decent number of them will be paying out of pocket for this drug that may not even work. That's where the sticker price is actually going to come in. It's clearly a political move from the FDA to approve this drug, afterall the FDA's own Advisory Committee voted unanimously to not recommend approval of aducanumab in November. It was a political move by the FDA and Biogen from advocacy groups and investors who wanted a return on their investment (nothing wrong with that if the drug actually works). Again, I'm not against pharmaceutical companies or investors making a return on investment and I admire that Biogen, among a few others, has remained committed to searching for a cure for a number of debilitating neurodegen. disorders, but we have to have a moral backbone and say it's not good for patients or families to potentially bankrupt themselves just to see if a drug may work. And to your point about desperate advocacy groups, I recognize the desperate nature of Alzheimer's, same with countless other neurodegenerative disorders, but that doesn't mean we should lower our scientific standards for drug approvals and push the burden of proof on patients, families, and other Americans for a drug that, again I sound like a broken record, MIGHT NOT EVEN WORK."

To think that this didn't weigh into the FDA's decision is uninformed and frankly arrogant.

Tesla sold 18,788 cars in Q1 and is now at 7532 cars in Q2. However, it should be noted that Tesla sells a large number of cars at the end of the quarter, for logistical reasons.

– In a coordinated approach, Cigna International Markets and Teladoc Health activated local and global telehealth capabilities in less than 24 hours and brought much needed care to many people who desperately need help from the global community.

– Together, both companies delivered an agile solution that empowered hundreds of thousands of locally-based individuals to connect with a health care professional who could then safely and securely manage their care and write prescriptions as needed. Other solutions deployed included a dedicated emergency hotline, providing needed local ground support with an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and associated behavioral health support and grief counseling.


Does this help Teladoc's dwindling stock price or is it a pipe dream that'll be gone once the pandemic subsides in India?

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/07/21 Good morning everyone, I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* PTON: Appears to have bounced off the SMA(50) from Friday's trading. Could see more upwards movement today, especially if PTON holds over the 104 level. 
* LEDS: Seeing continued momentum from last week. Premarket high of 26.24 at the moment.
* MGNI: Gapping up right around the SMA(9). Could see more upwards movement if it gets above and holds over 30.
* TLRY: Premarket high of 19.47. Potential support around/just below that 19 level. Worth watching for a breakout if it gets over \~21.40 (daily chart).
* MIC: Should be opening up near a resistance level around 40-41. Could provide good shorting opportunities if it fails, I'll be watching for a further breakout though.
* QTS: Up after being acquired by Blackstone, at $78/share. Might be priced in at the moment, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. 
* USCR: Up after being acquired by Vulcan Materials, at $74/share. Might be priced in at the moment, but I'll be keeping an eye on it.

Gapping DOWN:

* PGR: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. If it fails to get back and hold above 99, there could be some shorting opportunities. 
* WYNN: Pretty significant support level around 120 on the daily chart. Could provide opportunities to go long if it gets back and holds over 128. 
* MGI: I'll watch for a potential short below 10. If it holds up, there could be more upwards momentum. 

**Momentum Watchlist**

* RMED (+51%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Seeing strong volume and price action in premarket, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues. Has showed potential for intraday price movement in the past couple days of trading.
* LMNL (+44%): Up after FDA approves genetic disorder drug. Seeing decent volume and price action in premarket. Potential premarket support around 5.54-5.55. 
* NEXT (+28%): Up after an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. Premarket high of 3.35.
* BBIG (+7%): Up on momentum from Friday. Seeing decent volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if it continues.
* CLNE (+10%): Up on momentum from the past couple days of trading. Seeing decent volume and price action in premarket. Potential resistance levels at 10.50 and around 11 on the daily chart, with potential support at 10. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open this morning, after finishing off last week with some strength. SPY is trading a bit under 423, and will likely test the ATH levels as resistance this morning. There could be some indecision in the morning; if it fails we could see some shorting opportunities, if it breaks through, we could see a push further up. DIA is trading just over 348, and still has some room before reaching ATH levels (just over 351). Could test 348.65 point as resistance. Tech stocks are down a bit this morning, and they'll likely be testing a resistance area today (QQQ testing \~336 area). Gold, silver, and crude oil are all down a bit this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 36,700, after a relatively uneventful weekend. Ethereum is up a bit over 2% at the moment. Crypto-related stocks are mixed in premarket. Marijuana stocks are up a bit in premarket, and I'll be watching them throughout the week. Meme stocks seem to be showing some strength this morning, and will be worth monitoring. 

In high-inflation environments, we have traditionally seen strength in healthcare, energy, real estate, and consumer staples, while we typically see weakness in materials and tech. This will be important to follow in the near future, as people are watching inflation rates very closely at the moment.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"

The trial results on the 9th will make this explode. If we have WSB here this can go to 100$+, FOMO should be considered"

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+."

Without that, this is just a bubble that will inevitably collapse (my personal belief).

Don’t underestimate the 5.5 trillion dollar fiscal stimulus effect, and lack of normal outlets for consumer spending (travel, dining, entertainment) over the past year.

Americans have a lot more money in their pockets and stock trading is more accessible and commonplace than ever before.

Uber and Lyft are massive companies with tens or hundreds of thousands of employees with enormous revenue (though it remains to be seen if their business model is actually profitable). Peloton exploded in popularity and its sales were through the roof due to the pandemic. 

Conversely AMC lost money in 2019 before the pandemic, lost waaaay more money during the pandemic, and is part of essentially a dying industry. However its worth like 10x today what it was worth in 2019 because of a ""short squeeze"" despite a relatively small short interest (~20%)."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"France fines Google $267 million for abusing ‘dominant position’ in online advertising  France’s competition watchdog has fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry.

The French Competition Authority said Monday Google had unfairly sent business to its own services, and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog said.

The investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said.

Isabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.”

She added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on both advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize ad space on their websites and mobile apps.

“These very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,” said de Silva.

“This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.”

Google announced in a blog on Monday that it will be making a series of changes to its advertising technology.

“We recognize the role that ad tech plays in supporting access to content and information and we’re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms,” wrote Maria Gomri, legal director of Google France.

The investigation comes after U.S.-based News Corp, French newspaper Le Figaro and the Belgian press group Rossel filed a complaint against Google.

Regulators across Europe are clamping down on the major U.S. tech giants amid concerns that they wield too much power on the bloc’s 700 million plus citizens.

Last week, Facebook was hit by two antitrust probes from regulators in the U.K. and Europe.

The European Commission has launched probes into Amazon, Google and Microsoft over the last few years, while the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority has also launched probes into Google and Apple since it became an independent regulator in its own right in January following Britain’s exit from the EU.

However, calling the IRS means more than 1+hr of wait time with no guaranty that I won't get disconnected.  I tried and had to hang up at around 1hr to do something else.  $104 is less than 0.1% of the tax that I paid so I just roll over and pay the darn fine."

2021-06-07 17:12:50,stocks,Google: Is that one banana?
2021-06-07 09:44:23,stocks,😂 what if Google decided to not let the French log on to any of their sites? IMO that’s a L for France
2021-06-07 10:40:34,stocks,Google could not afford to have lunch that day - they took all it's pocket money /s.
2021-06-07 11:38:49,stocks,WON'T SOMEONE THINK OF THE GOOGLE
2021-06-07 09:21:23,stocks,We just call that an expense.
2021-06-07 10:24:07,stocks,"Exactly. It's almost like the gov is saying ""alright, here is a BS fine so people get off your case for a while, and see you again in 4 years when we'll pretend to fine you again to keep activists off the scent"".

This type of news should be a boost to the stock. A confirmation that the gov has no plans to get in Google's way."
2021-06-07 10:40:18,stocks,"Not really since Google only makes ~$500 million revenue per year from France. So $200 million is a significant chunk, it will have Google be reluctant to invest in other markets"
2021-06-07 11:14:33,stocks,Is the payout in full ? Damn 200 million is such a big number.
2021-06-07 13:17:37,stocks,And it seems like every other country in the world is giving them this fine every month for the same bs reason. Just because google makes a lot of money doesn't mean it's okay for france to fine them willy nilly. They're just trying to tax google and leech off their revenue because Europe is so behind in the tech space and can't compete.
2021-06-07 10:24:51,stocks,*thousand dollar bills
2021-06-07 09:06:55,stocks,Does it maybe mean underpayment as in not paying taxes in quarterly installments? You can overpay in some quarters and underpay in others
2021-06-07 11:55:56,stocks,">  $104 is less than 0.1% of the tax that I paid

Sneaking in the little humble brag there at the end, very nice"
2021-06-07 09:08:27,stocks,France fines germany gives
2021-06-07 18:23:05,stocks,"TBF, taxation, subsidies and antitrust fines are three completely different matters. And you should remember that the German competition authority is currently also investigating Amazon (as well as Google and Facebook)."
2021-06-07 17:25:43,stocks,"No, 99% not. These big tech names (Google, Facebook as an example) are so ingrained in our daily lives that society cannot go without them, giving them the power position. I’d even argue that if Google / Facebook would get banned in a developed country, protests would break out lol."
2021-06-07 14:54:09,stocks,"That’s not quite what’s happening. A company is paying through Google’s services to run Display advertising and the algorithm is supposed to identify the best possible placements and SSPs. By prioritising their own placements so they can make more money there is an ethical issue as the client, who has paid Google to run media for them, is being mislead."
2021-06-07 12:53:39,stocks,So... Business as usual for France?
2021-06-07 13:34:29,stocks,It's France. It's all they do.
2021-06-07 10:43:28,stocks,Nah bruh. We just don't dig that ***savage capitalism*** shit.
2021-06-07 08:40:50,stocks,No
2021-06-07 09:27:04,stocks,"It’s always just a slap on the wrist, it’s mostly symbolic so they can pretend like they are actually doing something about it, if slap them with a 10 billion dollar fine, let’s see if they repeat the same thing again then.."
2021-06-07 10:43:40,stocks,Dude France will have no way to collect anymore than this amount on a US company. They will just do business elsewhere. Google ain’t bound by a small country with only ~$500 million revenue. If UK/EU as a whole or US starts fining Google then they will actually be able to collect a large fine
2021-06-07 08:45:59,stocks,No.
2021-06-07 09:28:40,stocks,"Maybe maybe not, could also be seen as a positive bc one less legal issue to deal with moving forward."
2021-06-07 10:43:47,stocks,Only you man only you lol
2021-06-07 15:52:38,stocks,I assume you are talking about the apps that give you a free trial and then charge you when its over. At least you have the option of making apps that dont do that on android. On ios you have to make trials that way or your app wont be published/would be removed
2021-06-07 08:53:30,stocks,Source on that please. [VW was fined one billion EUR in Germany alone.](https://www.dw.com/en/vw-ordered-to-pay-1-billion-fine-for-dieselgate-in-germany/a-44211594)
2021-06-07 12:07:28,stocks,Fines like these are basically a weekly occurance in the EU anymore.
2021-06-07 18:44:33,stocks,Because it's insignificant
2021-06-07 08:05:46,stocks,\*quarter of a billion
2021-06-07 12:02:35,stocks,At this point the EU can basically list fines on American tech companies as part of their GDP.
2021-06-07 08:27:54,stocks,Poor Google.
2021-06-07 13:01:23,stocks,"They'll never recover from this! Quick, subsidize them before it's too late!"
2021-06-07 19:08:04,stocks,"[They “only” had $6B in net income in 1Q.](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/20210428_alphabet_10Q.pdf?cache=5a1a556)

But they’re sitting on $136B of cash so this is about a quarter of a percent of that."
2021-06-07 10:28:50,stocks,"Reminds me of an Onion headline from a few years back: ""Google disables it's search for two hours as a show of force to make mortals realize their weakness"""
2021-06-07 11:03:05,stocks,SACRE BLU!!
2021-06-07 10:28:02,stocks,American tech companies should do that. It’s crazy how many countries think they’re calling the shots when a big chunk of their population is dependent on their services. Imagine if Google and Gmail was pulled from France for a mere 24 hours because of French policy. That would be a PR nightmare for the French government.
2021-06-07 09:27:36,stocks,Straight out of the discretionary fund!
2021-06-07 09:57:20,stocks,Damn affordable one too
2021-06-07 10:41:17,stocks,A footnote inconvenience.
2021-06-07 09:27:29,stocks,"""Cost of doing business""."
2021-06-07 10:04:17,stocks,"That's what I think it is but the IRS has a lot of power to make those calls but in general they don't have the details on when I make the money.  In general, you should pay tax with the 1040ES as you go.  Realistically I can make $500 in the first 6 months and nothing in the last 6 months and pay the tax in 4 equal payments.  The IRS doesn't know that in the first 6 months, I underpaid and then overpaid the last 6 months (and that shouldn't matter).

I want the IRS to tell me why there was an underpayment penalty when at the end, I ended up paying more than I supposed to.  I just can't get anyone on the line."
2021-06-07 12:18:02,stocks,"It's not about bragging.  Initially, I called because I figure spending an hour waiting on the phone (while doing something else) is totally worth it to save $100.  But on the other side, the percentage is small enough that I won't change anything in my standard of living so it's not worth it in that point of view and the 1 hr waiting got me nowhere initially."
2021-06-07 09:11:07,stocks,">many paid Amazon about the same amount last year instead of collecting taxes

and germans pay\^\^"
2021-06-07 17:31:41,stocks,Agreed.
2021-06-07 15:14:33,stocks,"So the question becomes, was it in the fine prints and is Google allowed to prioritise their own ads if they say so in the fine prints?

Because if they sell 'the best ad placement' without disclaimers and then not give the best ad placement, that's obviously wrong."
2021-06-07 13:21:51,stocks,We all need to learn from France
2021-06-07 11:17:02,stocks,Half of Google’s annual revenue from France seems significant to me.
2021-06-07 13:57:19,stocks,"I mean, the EU fined Google $9B a few years ago - for the same thing, anti competitive practices."
2021-06-07 09:41:36,stocks,"Yeah if your acting on this information now, you might as well do the opposite of what you were planning. Your the last to know; might as well be the first to change direction rather than last in!"
2021-06-07 09:09:54,stocks,"He's talking out of his ass, it's easily verified in a couple minutes of searching that they paid in the tens of billions in fines in the US alone."
2021-06-07 11:09:49,stocks,"Thanks, done. I had a million instead of a billion in mind. Mea culpa."
2021-06-07 18:45:34,stocks,267 million bucks! I dream of a day where I can blow that much and not feel it.
2021-06-07 11:54:52,stocks,Your right thats my bad with the typo. However it still doesnt change the context of the comment
2021-06-07 15:24:52,stocks,US companies have a hard time in the EU. They make billions of euros yet very often no profit so they don't pay taxes. Poor corporations
2021-06-07 10:48:53,stocks,Let's do a fundraising to help Google get over it.
2021-06-07 12:37:38,stocks,NOT !!!!!!
2021-06-07 14:58:47,stocks,They’ll just take even more of your digital footprint and make up the loses.
2021-06-07 13:19:48,stocks,Not today at least.
2021-06-07 12:51:04,stocks,"I tried to find this on their site, was it maybe a tweet? I want to save that link if you can find it please!!"
2021-06-07 10:35:30,stocks,The onion is the only news source I trust. Specially when Brooke Alvares is reporting💀
2021-06-07 12:40:54,stocks,😂 🤣 😅
2021-06-07 10:32:46,stocks,"""hey let's give the megacorps that already wield more influence than most states *even more* power"" yeah great idea that'll totally not end in corporate neofeudalism"
2021-06-07 10:47:35,stocks,Is Google the only tech company in the world? I live in the US and I don’t use any Google products. I think the French would be ok too.
2021-06-07 15:09:22,stocks,"It's France lmao, if Google does this, there will be a gouvernmental-backed copy cat of Google, but subsidised to the extreme (well, Qwant but with more funds) with no business model first, and when it has secured its monopoly thanks to politics, will go private and beat Google in rentability. See the SNCF, see EDF, see Areva, Dassault ..."
2021-06-07 15:34:21,stocks,Call 8335585245 (irs) I just got through in less than five minutes (holy hell right ) couldn’t believe my ears
2021-06-07 13:48:44,stocks,Never let $5 sit on the ground.
2021-06-07 18:31:32,stocks,"Your last statement is correct.
Google’s Display platform (DV360) is supposed to leverage multiple placements and SSPs, including non Google, to get the best placement for your campaigns needs. But if they found the algorithm isn’t fair then that’s dishonest and unethical to both the advertiser and the other SSPs.

Really impressive they actually dug into it, the inner workings of programmatic are complicated and often these things are never looked at by government agencies as they’re not up to scratch on the tech"
2021-06-07 17:08:04,stocks,I agree. It is good to learn from other country's mistakes.
2021-06-07 17:16:14,stocks,Right?! Everyone here is posting google's global revenue/earnings figures but we're just talking about France here.
2021-06-07 09:52:32,stocks,"This, but I would’ve said it more harshly and combative. You’re more kind."
2021-06-07 16:24:57,stocks,Agreed.
2021-06-07 15:58:24,stocks,"I have no sympathy for these corporations, but to me that sounds like there needs to be a fix to the tax system, not a shake down for money every other month."
2021-06-07 12:46:36,stocks,After school bakesale?
2021-06-07 13:30:37,stocks,Go fund me!
2021-06-07 18:42:53,stocks,"Good idea, the go fund me for AOCs grandma did pretty well recently. I bet we could raise 10x that to help save google!"
2021-06-07 12:40:07,stocks,No.
2021-06-07 15:49:34,stocks,"Here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntICHMV-WMA

It's the second story of their weekly roundup."
2021-06-07 10:55:44,stocks,"we’re in r/stocks not r/politics or r/whatithinkcompaniesshoulddo. I think google can make more money and avoid future fines and taxes if they held their ground and leveraged their products to get better positions in foreign countries. Many countries bully American tech companies into complying when they could just as easily fight and win. I am simply speaking about google and how a certain decision could benefit its stock. 

Also in a side note, I don’t really dislike the idea of living in a “corporate neofeudalism” if that means I’m free of government overreach and can live to be own devices."
2021-06-07 10:49:07,stocks,What browser do you use to browse the web? Which search engine? Which email client? YouTube? Also many French content creators and companies depend on Adsense for their careers.
2021-06-07 16:16:57,stocks,"The number on my notice is 800-829-8374.  Eventually, I was asked to enter my 6 digit caller ID (notice ID) on the letter.  After doing that, I have an option to ""question about the amount you owed"".  Picking that option gets me ""we are sorry, due to the high call volume, we can't serve you right now, please call again in the next business day"".  Either that or the long wait time and getting that same msg."
2021-06-07 14:46:17,stocks,Well if you lose $300 worth of your time to get back $5 on the ground then I'd say it wasn't worth it.
2021-06-07 16:35:41,stocks,"This is not a tax issue, they abused their position. A tax reform should be coming as well, but it's important to understand it's unrelated."
2021-06-07 17:56:16,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-07 14:10:54,stocks,Car wash with IT
2021-06-07 19:24:17,stocks,you can sell them their tracking cookies
2021-06-07 16:43:32,stocks,Google is about as far from “Poor” as one can get ......
2021-06-07 11:03:35,stocks,You think people are going to respond positively to Google refusing to follow French laws? I'm sure the French people will be rallying around using Google then! State of this sub sometimes.
2021-06-07 11:05:56,stocks,"Sorry, but with the amount of influence corporations - especially massive multinationals like Google - wield over society, you can't pretend they're not political actors. Economics and politics aren't separate on any level, but the link between the two is at its most blatant with these behemoths.

And yeah, replacing a government that's at least nominally democratic with a bunch of corporate executives is ***definitely*** gonna improve the amount of freedom in your life lmao"
2021-06-07 11:40:28,stocks,"This fine is a joke to Google. They'll pay this one and a new one each year as the simple cost of doing business while maintaining a monopoly in these countries and pulling in FAR FAR more in revenue. At this level, businesses will stick to whatever the most profitable pathway is and won't act on pride and emotions."
2021-06-07 11:36:13,stocks,"LOL yes nothing more beneficial for an undertaking's position than exiting giant markets and letting competitors take it over.

Maybe give a call to Google's business strategy team, they're gonna love this!"
2021-06-07 14:03:21,stocks,">!American tech companies should do that.

>we're in r/stocks not r/politics or r/whatithinkcompaniesshoulddo. I think...

🤔"
2021-06-07 10:57:44,stocks,"YouTube wasn’t originally a Google product, it was just purchased by them but ok I get your point. But to answer your question I use safari or Mozilla and Apple’s email client. And there’s plenty of others out there like Bing, Edge, yahoo, Duck Duck Go. IE is also still around I believe. So yeah I think we would all survive"
2021-06-07 15:01:29,stocks,But if it had 3 $100 bills glued to the back it would be.
2021-06-07 19:04:25,stocks,It kind of is a tax issue though. France can’t/won’t tax them so they fine them instead.
2021-06-07 17:18:19,stocks,"That's literally what I said. I think you responded to the wrong guy. I never made the connection to taxes, it was the guy I was responding to that brought them up."
2021-06-07 18:06:16,stocks,"Yeah, the sarcasm was obvious. Hence why I said if they're shaking down companies to compensate for lost taxes, they should fix the root of the problem."
2021-06-07 19:49:51,stocks,"My ""no"" wasn't disagreeing with the sentiment, it was in regards to the cringe that I felt at you saying ""NOT!!!"" in response to the other guy."
2021-06-07 11:00:19,stocks,"Yes, we can survive. I use Safari and Firefox, and DDG and iCloud email. However, my point is many cannot. There are people whose livelihoods depend on google through Adsense revenue and companies that use google as their entire marketing department. In addition to many companies and people that depend on google tools for their business."
2021-06-07 11:04:14,stocks,"This guy uses BING!  

Oh wait, he just says you COULD use Bing! hahah"
2021-06-07 15:26:31,stocks,Never let $305 sit on the ground.
2021-06-07 15:31:58,stocks,Not sure if it would still be legal tender at that point.
2021-06-07 11:15:21,stocks,But how would Google benefit from flexing on France? Let’s remember that it is the European Union and I doubt that They would allow Google to pull their services as a show of force. By disrupting French businesses they would also disrupt businesses in other countries. Yes they could do it but the EU would make them pay heavily.
2021-06-07 19:35:13,stocks,How about a tree fiddy?
2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Q: CHPT announced redemption of all it's public warrants. How will this affect the share price? My question is: How will this event affect the share price, when company redeems all of it's public warrants?  
*""On June 4, 2021, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (the ?Company?) mailed a Notice of Redemption in respect of the redemption of all of its outstanding public warrants to purchase one share of the Company?s common stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement, dated as of July 25, 2019 (the ?Warrant Agreement?), by and between Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation (?Switchback?) and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, as part of the units sold in Switchback?s initial public offering, and that remain outstanding following 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 6, 2021 for a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant. ""*"
2021-06-07 06:34:06,stocks,Lots of people make money by shorting CHPT back to 20$. When the news are dry and market conditions are uncertain this tends to have severe corrections
2021-06-07 08:29:14,stocks,Redeeming warrants sounds a lot like share buy back.. They dont want their stock to get diluted or for people to get it on the cheap when they grow over years. If they're redeeming ( EVEN AT A LOW PRICE) that means they have the money.. I think its good news. In any event.. If CHPT craters.. I'll average down. Ive seen their stations in several national and state parks.. I'm not sure how bullish you can be other than federal and state governments buying your product.
2021-06-07 08:05:25,stocks,It may tank
2021-06-07 06:46:47,stocks,Sever correction to which way?

I buy a call option contract (100 shares per contract) at a set strike price, for a set future date, and pay the seller a premium up front for this right. I can then exercise the option at any point between the initial purchase and the expiration date? I could also turn around and sell the contract at any point before the expiration?

So for example, I buy a call contract with an 8/1 expiration date,  $5/share premium ($500 paid to call seller) and a strike price for stock XYZ of $15.00. Stock goes up, so I am in the money, and I decide I want to take some profit. Stock is trading at $35/share, and it's only 7/1. Could I then sell the contract for its fair market value ($3,500) and realize a gain of $3,000?"

Finally took the plunge with DIY investing this in what ended up being an absurdly zany and frothy market so it was a struggle with all the mistakes I made and having to stay determined enough to stick it out and wait for the holdings I consolidated into to break even. This is the best I've felt about my portfolio since starting it so hopefully by continuing to the let the market roll and not get jumpy with my money things will just further improve from here.

I placed a limit for $102 to give a bit of extra padding for this first buy and just to get my feet wet.

My question:
- am I correct in assuming if I put a open trade with a limit of $102 on a target index fund, they will buy whole stocks up to that set price and no more?

The others haven't hit their ATHs. They've traded above their last closing ATHs a couple times, but not to their ATHs. 

If my gut feeling is correct, I at least know what's going to happen though. The Spooz and Dow are likely going to trade down to the lower part of the range they've been stuck in for close to two months now. And they likely bounce...again there."

The share price is $10 at market close and increases or gaps up to $12 at the open of premarket. If you can only execute trades after 8am your limit sell should be filled at the better price than the order was originally set for.

If the gap happens during the normal course of trading, instead of at open, most brokers will take the opportunity to fill your order at the original price."

2021-06-07 15:32:42,stocks,"Fintech, the growth in the area will yield better returns in the short term (assuming you invest in solid companies) and long term either they become the future of financial transactions on their own or they are bought by the big banks and your investment gets rolled into those. Brick and mortar banks are history, the biggest ones will transition more towards fintech (either by developing their own or buying existing companies). I haven't set foot in a bank in years and as that financial methodology expands/provides more access to the larger world the bigger banks will have to adapt or die."

2021-06-07 08:38:55,stocks,Not really.
2021-06-07 09:11:06,stocks,look at forward P/E.
2021-06-07 11:06:03,stocks,12 month trailing P/E ratios are super depressed right now because they cover the time of the pandemic/lockdowns. That’s also why you’re seeing so many crazy revenue growth in Q1 earnings. Pretty easy to grow YoY revenue by a massive amount when the entire country was shut down a year ago. Look at forward P/Es right now instead. Most companies should get revenue back on track as we come out of the pandemic and P/E ratios will fall.
2021-06-07 07:12:07,stocks,I wouldnt say I'm worried per se but it does make me glad only 23% of my portfolio is in the S&P. I don't think there will be a crash or anything but I do think it will be slow growing for the foreseeable future.

Spent the past few months revising my vision with my holdings and dumping off the things I didn’t really care to go long and stay engaged with while consolidating into things I cared about or did proper homework on. And I progressively learned to stop being jumpy and be willing to just let things ride or roll until I feel the moment is right. Today 2 penny stocks I had that I consolidated into after dumping a ton of other ones finally helped push my portfolio back into the green."

2021-06-07 15:21:23,stocks,"How long did you intend to hold when you brought it? Continuing to average down is a good plan if you have a set plan for it, i.e. ""For every 5% the stock goes down, i increase my position by 5%"". That way, theres no emotion telling you to sell, or making you average down early and watching stock go down further. 

For what its worth, TSLA seems to be consolidating near current levels. It's dipped to 550-ish a few time recently, but always bounced back to 600. TSLA is pricing in all the ad news right now - declining china numbers, bitcoin, anti-elon sentiment, lawsuits, crashes etc etc. Some of those issues are transitory and the stock will likely rally once they pass.

Until they do it consistently again, I am going to assume that this is another fake out.

It honestly sucks even though I'm not in names like these because that 29%+ rally by the Nasdaq, where names like these really had it going over November to mid-February was so much fun (last summer was as well, but this was too). But I just don't think it's going to happen anymore."

2021-06-07 14:44:30,stocks,it went up like 500% last year tho.....

2021-06-07 14:40:40,stocks,It went down went the virtual currencies did but still trading sideways 😞
2021-06-07 18:11:28,stocks,"That's not really surprising. A volume of 1.4k is very very small. For example, Apple has an average volume of 79 million. 

You were basically trying to buy up 3% of the shares that were on the market on any given day. Which is a big purchase. And since a lot of trading is done soon after trading opens, your 1 pm buy order was probably just too late in the day. The fact the price remained flat is further evidence of this. Prices change when trading happens. If the price didn't change, then it's unlikely much trading happened. Robinhood can't find you shares that no one is selling, you know?"

More likely to simply get another full on market selloff like May 11th-12th, which I would not be shocked if that was the case, I really needed to see the S&P and Dow follow through after a nice Friday considering how long they've taken in this range and they failed. That was the last chance for me, I think they're going lower again, but will likely bounce at some point instead of dipping harder, as per usual."

Dollar weakening, inflation, possibly rate increase. The hits are coming from everywhere.

For example if company has tens of billions in cash, take all of these accounts, their loses from these ''nature'' forces are in billions. Just like that they are billions of $ poorer because their money lost value in faster rate than it should.

On an every great company, how exactly do you price in the billions in natural devaluation ?

That is the reason why some stocks are doing so sadly, and other ''value'' stocks have known nothing else but direction up. You could buy entire countries with loss of value some of our favorite companies have suffered.

2021-06-07 09:05:52,stocks,"That's always a nice surprise to see your limit order filled at a significantly better price at market open. Well, for sales at least, it's bitter sweet when a bid gets filled cheap because a stock you're averaging down on dumped, lol.

I've noticed IBKR let's you manually toggle 'outside regular trading hours' for GTC limit orders. I've been wondering when that's wise to keep a limit order active during all hours. You'd think it would be wise to do for stocks with less liquidity during pre/post-market trading, as there's been many times I see a stock trading at +/- 4.7% pre-market, beyond my order price while it isn't on the books, then it's back to the previous day's range after market open & my order remains unfilled. But those same lower liquidity stocks tend to be lower market cap & more likely to see large intraday moves, thus increasing the odds of a favorable fill for orders that are only open during regular hours.

Maybe it's mostly a wash in the long run, but what I'll probably do is include extended hours for stocks that are less volatile & tend to bounce around in a broad price range (like a dividend payer with a mostly horizontal price chart), so my orders can benefit from those extended hours deviations. Conversely, I won't include extended hours for more speculative stocks that are likely to see large sustained price movements (an example being RIDE, I had an order fill substantially above my ask price at market open when it surged last week). It would be mildly annoying to see a stock go from $10 one day to $14 the next, & see that your $10.50 order got filled during the move up in pre-market trading. I build & trim positions in small batches, so the disappointment would be offset by the rest of the position being more valuable, but still."

2021-06-07 12:07:59,stocks,Try not to invest every stock reddit tells you to.
2021-06-07 13:32:29,stocks,why does it say £0.016? that times 2.5 million is £40k.
2021-06-07 08:18:23,stocks,"Sure people and funds could buy and sell 1000s of shares instantly. Such volume in an instant could wipe out a significantly wide range of prices. Then Algorithms and timid investors could see this info and react with it creating an amplifying feedback loop that can make huge fluctuations.

The price of 1 share is only worth as much as the lowest price being asked.

The price of 10 shares is only worth as much as the average cost of the lowest 10 prices being asked for and so on.

The price of a share reflected on a brokerage app I'd imagine must reflect a somewhat average price of all transactions occurring.

Still there's no way the price for a share reaches all the way to $12 without a single $11 share remaining available somewhere first being bought."
2021-06-07 08:29:32,stocks,"Even if the price surges like crazy buyers will still need to clear your ask at $11 to move beyond that. That's if the surge happens during the trading day, your GTC limit order will be on the order book at $11 waiting to be hit. 

A common exception is when the big move happens outside normal trading hours, because most GTC orders are replaced by your brokerage every day at market open, & removed at close. I've had it happen many times where say the stock price closes at $10.60 on Friday then that evening there's a good earnings report, Monday morning the stock is trading at $12, you check your order status & see ""$11 limit sell filled @ $11.83 9:31am."" Limit orders are indeed orders to fill at X price OR BETTER, so all the lower asks got filled first that morning followed by yours, all at the newly elevated price.

Some brokerages allow you to keep your GTC orders active into extended hours. An advantage of this is that your limit order may be filled by random fluctuations because the order books are much thinner after hours. So the stock price may close at $10.60 Tuesday, your $11 sell fills at 7:48am EST Wednesday, then you see the stock trading around $10.50 after market open Wednesday. A disadvantage is you are less likely to benefit from the price surges I mentioned in the previous paragraph."
2021-06-07 11:28:34,stocks,No problem! Yeah I still gotta look at those some more. Just been in the same boat as you trying to add some boomer to my tech. Also been adding to JPM and a REIT called O so defense and health are what I started looking at next

I'm looking at 5+ year investments in these though."
2021-06-07 07:24:54,stocks,Out of the top 10 holdings only AMZN and TSLA have a P/E above the average of 44 though. They have to be the biggest culprits.

I just think commercial banks in general are positioned well in an inflationary environment where the Fed will inevitably begin tapering and eventually raise interest rates again.

I like pipelines, down stream, and companies who have already drilled."
2021-06-07 15:19:19,stocks,"Why dont you try on a paper account?

You have to consider that closer to the market price, the premium are higher and also the higher the IV, the higher the premium you will be paying. And a stock needs to ""moon"" for it to be worth it. And those meme stocks have ridiculous IV (high premium).

Im not sure what expiration will be the best. I find that buying further away are better for buying calls for at least a month, some do 3 months. Buying weeklies call options are too risky.

But also you have to consider the IV, you dont want the IV to suddenly drop and you get IV crushed (implied volatility).

There is a lot to consider and dont just go into it for a yolo because you will end up not even understanding why you are not making money even if the contract is in the money."
2021-06-07 14:57:43,stocks,so one month flat means jack shit.
2021-06-07 18:48:45,stocks,"Oh, never mind. Haha. I found it after clicking around Robinhood a bit. Bring up the stock you want, make sure your on the 1 day graph, and click the candle graph button on the bottom right of the graph. The candles can be useful, but what you want is the little bars across the bottom. That shows the volume for each 10 minute period of time.

For example, on Apple's graph today. 1 to 3 million shares were traded every 10 minutes for the first half hour of trading. Then by the afternoon that was down to half a million per 10 minute block. Then near the end of the day there was a big jump again back into the millions. (Which also isn't unusual. 3 to 4 pm is often called power hour.)"
2021-06-07 15:02:19,stocks,"Honestly if you need to put a stop loss on a meme stock, you shouldn’t buy it at all. Those stocks are **WAY** too volatile. No telling what a bottom or peak is so stop losses are bound to kick you out sooner or later. I would only use them if you already secured a massive profit and want to get stopped out quickly if things start getting hairy."

2021-06-07 13:15:15,stocks,"Oh its definitely working to an extent, working more than one would expect it to. But I imagine it'll keep working until it won't and a lot of the people who ""got rich"" buying and selling meme stocks will lose a lot of that money betting on garbage stocks that just never pop

In other words its like gambling. Some people can do it really well and get rich, most people however wind up losing money in the end even if they're up big at one point or another"

2021-06-07 13:20:13,stocks,"> I’m too afraid to translate it over because I’m afraid to lose real money.

There's a saying in gambling that you should never play with scared money. If the things you're doing you wouldn't do with ""real"" money then you shouldn't be doing them. 

Your best bet is to invest most of your funds in safe stocks/etfs and then to make riskier bets with just a fraction of your funds (maybe 10% or less). That way you aren't at risk of losing it all, but you can benefit from riskier plays that work out in your favor"
2021-06-07 13:23:48,stocks,"A 300% return in 3 months can only be done if you are gambling. Nothing wrong with that, but if you think you will be able to replicate this consistently with just doing refined DD as you say, the only person that you are fooling is yourself. It will be much harder to do with larger sums. If you can beat 10% yearly you are doing well."

Hi everyone - I have a 401k and more recently an IRA (late to the game). I also do some light day trading, mostly credit spreads and a couple option plays a week maybe.

To preface I’m (36) single so no kids/wife to consider in this. Live in HCOL area (Seattle/Bellevue). Anyways, I realized today my original condo I bought late 2015 which I now rent out has almost doubled in value. My townhome I bought late 2018 has increased ~35% as of now. So I now have ~$730k net equity sitting in my rental condo and my primary. 

Would it be more beneficial to slap that profit into the market and hopefully make a nice return or hold the real estate?"
2021-06-07 00:53:15,stocks,"Personally, if my rental property has a positive cash flow, I’m sticking with the rental property over the stock market almost every single time."
2021-06-07 00:34:25,stocks,Depends on your portfolio and your risk aversion.
2021-06-07 01:02:15,stocks,"[Google is your friend](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052015/which-has-performed-better-historically-stock-market-or-real-estate.asp):

> From 1968 to 2009 the average rate of appreciation for existing homes increased around 5.4% per year.6﻿ Meanwhile, the S&P 500 averaged an 7.5% return; small cap stocks averaged 11.5% per year.7﻿ 8﻿ The rate of inflation was around 4.6%.9﻿ We don't expect real estate investments to grow much more than inflation.

> But numbers don’t tell the whole performance story. You also have to look at the impact of tax advantages, income yield, and the fact that real estate investments often allow for significant leverage (you can finance a home purchase, putting no more than 20% of your own money down, for example). Of course, if you buy real estate directly, you also need to factor in your time in managing the property and maintenance and repair costs. Comparing the rates of return has to include all these elements.

If you don't add in the rent income, the mortgage leverage benefits, and the tax reductions, then real estate under performs the stock market. If you do, it probably equals out. What's certain, though, is that real estate doesn't quite crash like stocks do."
2021-06-07 01:45:23,stocks,I sold my real estate and put it all into stocks but it was because I was tired of being a landlord. No regrets at all. My stocks are almost all low cost index funds.
2021-06-07 03:39:03,stocks,"My personal opinion, if the rent checks keep coming in.... Don't go poking the bear. Leave things alone if its working out well. Even if RE dips, as long as the rent checks keep coming in you will be fine.

I personally feel stocks are TOO hot right now, like they were in 1999. I have no idea when it will happen but the cycle always ends with a massive fall and everyone wondering why no one ever saw it coming."
2021-06-07 01:16:57,stocks,"Cash-out refinance it. Will the rent still cover the mortgage payment? Now you still have the property, a tenant paying for it, and your money in stocks.

2021-06-07 15:29:02,stocks,"First of all, don't sell real estate when we're just beginning to have serious inflation.   You'd have to be a stock picking savant to beat the the appreciation you get from real estate.

Second, since this is a rental and you didn't say how long you lived in it before renting it out - do you have to pay capital gain tax if you sell the condo and move the proceeds into the stock market?   If the answer is yes, definitely don't don't sell the condo."
2021-06-07 04:17:04,stocks,"I 100% would never sell a rental if it's positive cash flow. Hell even if I'd take a small hit id not sell. There are more and more people on the planet, but only so much space"

And while they may be correct that stocks outperform real estate, you should consider that inflation is a possibility in the near future, which would result in that not holding true (generally speaking)."
2021-06-07 14:06:31,stocks,"First bought real estate in Bellevue in 2005 on 108th, and I would rather hold real estate in downtown Bellevue than risk money in the stock market.  Companies are fleeing the mess now that Seattle is, so Bellevue is great.  I'd try to find a cheaper property out towards Crossroads or Factoria to buy."

2021-06-07 19:57:35,stocks,"If I were you, I will do a cash out refinance on the property to free up some of the equity in the home. With the proceed, I will use it to buy some low risk ETF (like utilities or consumer staples) on margin, the key to high return is leverage, with interactive broker charges less than 1.5 percent per year on margin and mortgage interest rate hovering around 3 percent for thirty years, there’s no reason not to borrow"
2021-06-07 08:50:22,stocks,"You're getting a lot of answers from people who were never in your shoes and only see rent as net cash flow, net of work, net of worries and net of risk. That isn't accurate. You have to maintain your property, you have to carry a liability insurance in case your tenant sues you. You pay property taxes... Like someone in the comments mentioned, it is work. You may also face a tenant who stops paying and won't leave. Not only do you no longer collect rent, you also have to pay attorney fees to evict. Don't expect to retrieve your property in good shape when the sheriff kicks the tenant out. Been there, no fun.

Also, the argument that you shouldn't sell to avoid paying taxes seems like a weak one too. You won't pay taxes on the same gain twice if you switch to stocks, and you're not going to escape taxes by holding on to those properties. Your goal is to build wealth to improve your lifestyle or build a retirement fund. So you will have to sell eventually because you can't pay your kids' college tuition or buy yourself a boat when you're 50 with a townhouse in Seattle. Besides, if you need to sell your property, you have to do some repair to make your property look good, contact your realtor, list the unit, wait for a buyer, go through inspections, etc... It may take months until you actually receive the funds. On the other hand, you can buy stocks today, sell tomorrow, withdraw the funds the next day. The idea is liquidity.

Now the argument of value. Let's see where you'd be if instead of buying that property, you would've invested the same amount of money in Apple for instance, and not even look at your investment until now. In January 2015, AAPL was $26. It was $44 in January 2018. Today before open, it's $126, i.e. +484% from 2015 and +286% from 2018. You can use a Vanguard ETF like VGT if you prefer: +353% since January 2015, +225% since January 2018. Compare this with your +35% and your rent, deduct your mortgage, insurance, repair, realtor fees, property taxes, taxes on your rent, the time you spent dealing with issues...

That being said, stocks are a completely different animal. For starters, it's more volatile. Company performance dictates stock price in the long run, but short term price is very unpredictable. So if you think you'll need the money in less than 6-12 months, don't invest in stocks. But if you won't need the money soon, pick a few solid Vanguard ETFs for instance, you can literally buy today, and not look until 2035. You can also generate some income stream for yourself with covered calls. If you pick your stocks well, you'll see that some can be used for that purpose only and generate more money than rent."

Then you could sit pretty with your 401k/IRA invested in less risk-averse assets (VTI,QQQ,etc.) and focus on your career and early retirement. You've pretty much won from where I stand. Why risk that on the next potential bubble pop/financial crisis/whatever the future may bring?"

Maybe I sell the condo and keep the primary and see how that goes. Sounds odd to sell my main home, but I expect to once again be in a long term relationship/married. And for my friends at least - it seems as though if one had a home before they opted to get a home together for the both of them so that’s why I don’t feel too attached to holding onto property as a single guy."

2021-06-07 01:20:43,stocks,I did consider refinancing but I could no longer finance as my primary property so rates were higher - I have a sub 3% rate now on a condo and that wouldn’t be the case if not owner lived in. Thank you for the advice!
2021-06-07 17:43:45,stocks,If I’m waiting until at least 2023 then I’d have to pay tax on the sale unless I move back in - I suppose is doable since it’s only 3 miles from my other place. You think to hold forever because of tax? Tax is unavoidable even for stocks though…

2021-06-07 17:03:34,stocks,"This right here. I think you nailed all the aspects that go through mine and maybe many others heads when thinking about this.

Maybe it’s a little confusing thinking about the 35% gain on the townhome. That is on the overall purchase price, but my net equity over that 2.8 years has actually tripled. Which puts it more on par. But you are right that having a home in Seattle does not buy a boat, education or whatever else like liquid assets do. Having more liquid assets for that reason along with all the hassles that go along with renting a poor petty like you mentioned.

Well, primary home is excluded from cap gains tax on the first $250k at least. 

For the rental, I’m coming up on the 2/5 rule to exclude $250k. I’d likely sell the condo first if anything. At this point the townhome being new when I bought it and larger seems to be in higher demand after Covid (people want more space)."

2021-06-07 09:26:26,stocks,"I think that's the price we pay for getting into real estate though. It's a grind to get that mortgage paid off especially if you did a 15 year. But when you finally do, it's just a pure cash cow. Keep the property."
2021-06-07 13:53:47,stocks,"I'd figure out the overall net appreciation including the payments and capital gains due to appreciation of the property.  Because while you're cash flow neutral your equity in the property is increasing, and at 2-1 on the going rate.  


On the other hand, you could realize the entire appreciated sum if you could sell it, and then make a percentage off that in the market. Assume you're no warren buffet and just peg it at say 7%.


I'd model out the two scenarios and see if one is significantly better than the other.


I can tell you that most portfolios have not doubled since 2015, but of course some have, and some have done much, much better.  There's also no actual work involved, which is another big plus.  Personally, I've been investing for 20+years, and I'd feel comfortable cashing that out and rolling it into the market.  I don't really like real estate as an investment vehicle because of the legwork.


The other aspect is taxes you'd pay on the real estate transaction."
2021-06-07 18:29:47,stocks,"I don't understand, if the property value has doubled since you purchased it, it seems that the rent value should have also doubled and this should be a money maker.

There is high demand and low supply for rentals right now because everybody is asking less than what the market will bear...  Quality rentals at a decent price get multiple people interested.

The reality is, even breaking even, you're making a profit because the principal on your loan is getting smaller."

2021-06-07 02:38:58,stocks,"I had two rental properties. I sold one in July 2020 and the other in April 2021 so yeah pretty recent. I'm paying pretty hefty taxes on the sales too but it was worth it to me. That is one thing I dislike about real estate, you can't sell just a bit of it to optimize taxes like you can with stocks. I had a property manager and every time I would see their number on the caller ID my heart would skip a beat. It was always bad news. They never once called to say the tenant wants to pay double this month. My properties were on the low end so I had pretty bad tenants. It might be a different story with higher end properties. 

I have to admit the real estate has been a good investment though. One house I bought in 2012 for $53k and it sold for $290k this year and it was rented all those years for about $900/mo. Houses were so crazy cheap around here after the great financial crisis it was a no-brainer to buy. I regret only buying two but whatever, we can't predict the future."

2021-06-07 18:15:28,stocks,"I'm not the kind of person who say to hold anything forever.  But we are in the beginning of an inflation and very few asset holds value better than real estate in an inflationary environment.  You'd essentially be selling something that is an easy-win for something that is much more risky.

If you hold cash, you're guaranteed to lose.   If you hold stock, you may win or my may lose.  If you hold real estate, you are guaranteed to win.  So why wouldn't you hold real estate?

I wouldn't sell if I were you.  I'd ride this inflation wave and see how high it goes.   My guess is anyone who sold now are going to look back in five years and said to themselves, ""I really wish I had hung on to it."""
2021-06-07 00:47:02,stocks,"What are the downsides to both?

1.  You sell your condo and invest at a market all time high and there is a recession and you don’t break even for another 2-4 years.

2. Amazon backs out and everything you just listed doesn’t happen.

Is 1 or 2 more likely?  By how much?  It sounds like both have a great upside but one has a more probable and larger impact on your net worth."
2021-06-07 16:01:04,stocks,"With this being the case, I would hold onto it at least until the Amazon facility opens and the demand rises. Right now you just have speculators bidding up prices but that is nothing compared to actual demand spike of employees looking for a place close to work."

2021-06-07 18:50:51,stocks,I didn’t start renting out my unit until 2018 when I bought my current townhome. So it had already gained quite a bit of appreciation at that point when I started renting it. It’s an older building in a fast growing city so rent won’t grow as much comparatively.
2021-06-07 00:53:14,stocks,Values are very high here but I don’t think it’s quite the frenzy it was in 2018 and such for example - even though prices are higher the 20+ bids are not in effect. Are you in Arizona? I’ve heard it is pretty insane out that way if so.
2021-06-07 01:28:18,stocks,"Understood. The stat I always default to:

Had you purchased a home on the very last day before the housing crisis in 2008 (the worst day possible), based on national averages if you held on to the property, in just over 1 calendar year later you would have already been back to break even value. Then you saw what happened the next 13 years.

Right now the housing “bubble” is healthy because it’s driven by demand and lack of inventory in most places. Not crappy mortgages being given out like candy."
2021-06-07 07:44:21,stocks,"This. People on here totally neglect how stressful, demanding and unrewarding it can be to deal with tenants."
2021-06-07 10:50:22,stocks,"If I could sell out portions of the properties like stock, I’d be a happy guy! 

Wow, that is some insane appreciation. Of course looking back it’s easy to say that but at the time we may never know. I say the same about various stocks - even from last year.

Thanks for sharing your story, this is great stuff. I do manage my one rental myself since it’s very close by. It’s a “higher end” area so I’ve had little to no issues with the 2 sets of tenants over the last 3 years or maybe I just have good tenants? But I very much understand that skipping a beat feeling if you anticipate something wrong or costs."
2021-06-07 08:52:31,stocks,"“They never once called to say the tenant wants to pay double this month.”

Genuine question - have you ever in your life given twice as much money to someone that has a zero return of investment? There is absolutely no point in paying double to RENT, because there’s no financial incentive to do so. Do you know anybody that does this?"
2021-06-07 01:23:52,stocks,In the stock market*
2021-06-07 01:27:44,stocks,"That’s a good point. I suppose my overall thought is that property is older and while it holds good value because of location, it will be needing some interior remodels and the building itself is coming up on some larger expenses likely within 5 years. So I kind of wanted to take my profit - I guess around 2023 or shortly after and then either put that in the market or possibly other real estate but likely not in this area. Long story short, I didn’t want to deal with closing costs and all that for a short term of cash flow."
2021-06-07 18:43:09,stocks,I think holding through 2023 will at least give me an idea of how inflation goes?
2021-06-07 00:51:32,stocks,"Thanks for bringing that perspective. I’m not a market or real estate pro, but If the market went to a recession after I dumped money in it would hurt more. At least with housing I’m likely still getting rent to cover the mortgage on the condo and living in my primary. Not sure which is more resilient if each crashes though: stocks or housing."

2021-06-07 19:00:03,stocks,"Buying is almost 100% of the time cheaper than renting a place.  So renting out a place that you purchased as an owner occupied dwelling, I would think would have a big positive cash flow.

I know you said that you have a 15-year loan, but that also means that you have a low interest rate (especially since you purchased it as an owner occupied dwelling).

I purchased my rental property as rental property. So I pay between 4.128 and 6% interest on them.  I still turn a profit on all of them, to include the one I just purchased in November.  That one is the 4.128%, had to put 25% down to get that rate, 30-year loan.  I make almost twice what the payment is in rent. 

Different areas I guess, cause different situations. I know my kid up in Oklahoma City said that if she rented her house she would break even on it. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-07 19:08:04,stocks,"Buddy of mine, who's also a landlord, contacted me the other day to ask me for my input on the rent for one of his units.  I believe it's supposed to go empty this month, he had been getting $1,150 a month for it.  I told him with the way the market had turned, that it should bring a minimum of $1,300 a month.  He said he was going to list it for $1,250, I told him he would have multiple people interested in it.

He listed it for $1,250, and was swamped with interest in the property.  

He talked to a realtor, and the realtor told him what they believe he could sell the property for, so he was looking at selling.  I think whether or not selling is an option depends greatly upon the situation, no one size fits all.  I told him if he plans on liquidating sometime in the next couple years, then now would be a great time to sell (he's older looking at retiring soon).  I told him that I really don't expect there to be a housing bubble that pops here. Even in the 2008 crash, our market just stagnated for a long period of time, no big crash.  My point, is I don't think he's going to be able to sell now here, and then purchase back in a couple years for cheaper. 

Our market is going nuts, one of the houses that I purchased a couple years ago...one just sold down the street from it for about 250% of what I purchased mine for (similar stats, and from what I can tell from pictures of the inside, it's dated).

Again, everybody's situation is different, and as I mentioned I plan on trying to get mine paid off before I retire, allowing me to turn the property over to a property manager, and go travel."

2021-06-07 09:08:12,stocks,I think he was making a joke
2021-06-07 12:31:46,stocks,"My point is when people ""run the numbers"" on a rental property that is the best case scenario. But the risk of less cash flow than expected is huge. 

I've had the fire department shut off and lock out the gas meter to my 4-plex in the middle of winter because they said my gas pipes were under sized, even though they have worked fine that way for the past 40 years. $10k later the gas is back on with new pipes. Emergency plumbers are not cheap.

I've had a tenant flush a towel down the toilet, backing up the sewer and making a stinky lake out of unit nextdoor. $10k for that one too and the tenant is judgement-proof and actually in jail so no chance of recovering anything. And I did the rehab myself so 4th of July weekend is spent cleaning up shit. It would have been $20k had I hired it out. Run the numbers on that.

Burst frozen pipes, pipe burst under slab, tenant fights, it just never ends and I could never relax when going on a trip because some emergency could happen and sometimes did. I would imagine tenants pouring grease down drains, unauthorized pitbulls chewing through doors, all kinds of bad things and it was coming true. PTSD just thinking about it. So glad to be done with all that."
2021-06-07 01:32:37,stocks,"If it gets to the point where you do ultimately have to sell, you can. But your money would have already been working elsewhere between now and 2023, plus you still own the asset in the meantime. Even if you don’t cash flow much, you’re still having someone else pay that additional appreciation in the interim.

You’re also protected because on a cash-out you can only pull out up to 80% LTV. So, let’s say worst case the market does “crash”…do you think it would drop 25%? That’s the only way you end up in the red."
2021-06-07 01:14:15,stocks,Sounds like your house will only continue to rise with all that’s happening.  I’d hold that until a year or two after everything is built finally.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Spotify (SPOT) worthy of my investment dollar? I am pretty much torn over SPOT. I have used Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. I have to say that playlists and recommendations from Spotify are the best. Even though I love using Spotify, I am not sure whether I should put any money into the stock.

The main issue I have with SPOT is it is the only company in the music streaming game that needs to make money off of music streaming. All the other companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG) don't have to make a penny from their music streaming services because these companies have way more profitable lines of businesses. Besides, music streaming does not have any economy of scale to speak of. The more users you have, the more music is getting streamed, the more royalties you have to pay out.

Any thoughts on why SPOT should have a spot in my stock portfolio? Am I missing something?"

That's just stocks going to where they belong, do you have any idea how important Uranium is going to be to the future of our collective civilization? I remember reading DD that some Uranium stocks would go 10x-20x no problem in the next 10 years, maybe 100-1000x in the next 20-30. You think i'm joking?  Do you have any experience in the mining, energy, or resources industries?

Uranium isn't like solar or wind, it's not abundant, and if you want it then you have to pay someone to go mine it."

Clean energy is big and China and India will fuel their countries growth with nuclear facilities which means they will also need a reserve. 

The U.S. will need to create a reserve as well to ensure we do not fall behind as well as invest in what I see new nuclear reactors in the U.S. to meet carbon free energy goals by 2050. 

Also the U.S. will have to fuel the old fleet of reactors still as it’s what props up our green energy numbers. Very different from coal.

There’s only about 100-120 years supply of uranium and that’s without factoring in a massive increase in its use. Now will this be a good investment for 5-6 years probably not as it’s cyclical;however, in 1-3 it should be."

A 2017 patent by Igor Usov and Milan Sykora, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, discusses using the depleted uranium from nuclear reactions to create solar cells. The authors wrote that depleted uranium oxide was abundant and cheap as leftovers of the nuclear fuel enrichment process and could be optimized for use as solar cells by controlling the thickness, uranium/oxygen ratio, crystallinity, and doping."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,Planning to help my little bro start day trading Looking to help my little brother start day trading. Thinking about sending him $25k so that he won't have to worry about pdt rules because I know that was a hard hurdle for me when I started trading.  Is there any IRS thing I need to do? I think I read that I can only gift $15k per year or something like that.  Not trying to get a write off or anything just wondering how would the legals work if I did this.  I know he has a lot to learn so the $25k is just to so he doesn't have day trade limits(won't allow him to spend it).
2021-06-06 22:52:26,stocks,Just throw it all in the trash and save your brother the frustration and anxiety of losing all of it.
2021-06-06 23:14:23,stocks,"This is, in entirety, a terrible idea."
2021-06-06 23:22:09,stocks,"The best thing your little brother can do, assuming he’s of a young age, is stick his investing dollars in a broad index fund and let it ride for many years. It should yield far more than he would ever make from day trading."

2021-06-06 23:00:19,stocks,Give him a loan.
2021-06-06 22:39:13,stocks,"How does the 25k equity work?  Do you have to have 25K settled in the account? Or can you pattern trade with just 25k+?    

So if you buy 30K to open a position at market open and sell prior to close, that’s a round trip.   If you do that 3 days in a row, so you get flagged as a day trader and the 4th you get shut down?  Or, because you still have >25k does it just get tossed?"
2021-06-06 23:34:55,stocks,"The limit you're referring to is the federal gift tax, which currently states you cannot gift more than $15k in 2021 without paying a tax on said gift. This isn't something you can ""write off"" and gifting anything over that limit per year would technically trigger a taxable event for you. To what extent, I'm not sure. I am not a tax advisor and I would rather just avoid that scenario. 

More importantly, why would you want him to learn on the fly with real money? I'm sure there are ways in which he can paper-trade and lose his fake money before losing real money. 

I hate to be a pessimist, but this sounds like a bad idea that won't end well. However, sometimes people have to learn the hard way."
2021-06-07 10:36:38,stocks,The money isn't for him to trade with.  Its just there so he can bypass pdt.
2021-06-06 23:54:51,stocks,"Crisp. Concise. A+

Edit below as I decided I need to provide feedback rather than sound like a 1-liner jackass:

OP - Have him earn the 25k while he is learning how to trade. Part of trading or investing is discipline, so he should easily have the discipline to earn 25k first as part of the process. Another part of trading/investing is understanding that you are the one responsible for both the gains AND the losses, not the person who told you X or the lady that said Y. By him trading his own money, and earning the 25k, it will be more valuable to him (you'd hope).

This is very nice of you to help him though, because I agree that 25k is the barrier to entry if you want to be active."
2021-06-07 10:41:27,stocks,I have thought about this for a while and I believe it isn't a bad idea.  He isn't trading with the 25k.  The 25k will be floating while he trades his own money.  It's basically going to be a bank account that holds my 25k.  He will lose/gain money with or without pdt.  I personally think pdt is just the rich making it hard for little guys to trade.  I made it but not many do and I honestly believe it was needless worries about 3 day trades....
2021-06-07 02:52:44,stocks,Amc can go up as much as these funds do in years within a few days.
2021-06-07 10:16:53,stocks,I would but I keep detailed info on my own trades and I am teaching him the same.

2021-06-07 10:19:38,stocks,Yup as long as your margin account adds up to $25k you are good to trade as much as you want.
2021-06-07 00:20:19,stocks,"Yep program we used in high school Econ class.
You don’t give a damn about the money if it’s gifted to you. That’s a dumb idea. Can’t learn like that. And don’t start with day trading..common. There’s a reason you have to have $25k in the account.
1 bad trade and then the lesson is over. Lol. No more day trading."
2021-06-07 10:28:03,stocks,"He has been paper trading for 3 months and I think he is good enough to start day trading.  Honestly, day trading above $25k is really different from trading below.  The fact that you don't have to worry about pdt changes the way you trade. I have traded myself from literally free Visa stock to 250k in 1 year while I was not actively trading for 6 months and my gains became exponential after $30k but that was the transition in trading style from 25k to 30k.  Personally looking back, I stressed so much about pdt that it was needless.  Of course I got lucky from trading meme stocks as well. I feel its just needless.  He can lose his money but the same can happen if he didn't have that 25k."
2021-06-07 10:15:15,stocks,"The issue that I found was the fact that when I was trading up to $25k myself, my style significantly changed pre and post the $25k mark.  There are a lot of things I learned pre $25k that is useless now. Honestly if I had someone lend me 25k I would have done it from the very beginning myself. He has been paper trading for 3 months now so he isn't a complete noob with trading."
2021-06-07 04:49:52,stocks,And it can go down even more.
2021-06-07 07:48:09,stocks,Yeah and if you don't sell within the correct 10 minute window you're left holding bags for years.
2021-06-07 07:09:30,stocks,"Right.  But for me at least,  the true test is when my actual cold hard cash is on the table."
2021-06-07 10:17:27,stocks,He has been paper trading for 3 months.
2021-06-07 10:37:12,stocks,"Your welcome.  An option i just thought of is, to structure it so that you only collect from the account. That way if he loses your don't get all your $ and can deduct your loss as a bad debt.  And maybe as a  kicker you get 1/3 the profits. And that way if he is a world class trader you could get real money. 

Just an idea and while I'm an accountant I'm not a tax accountant or enrolled agent. So you might want to check with your tax guy.  Or some people do what they do and ask IRS  for forgiveness later."
2021-06-06 23:06:47,stocks,"So round trips don’t matter as long as you have 25k where?   Does it have to be settled?

Let’s say I have 50k in stocks.  1800 in cash.  I day trade the 1800 for 5 days.  So I won’t get flagged and banned for day trading?"
2021-06-07 02:29:14,stocks,"I agree that trading with paper-money is not going to truly challenge someone to learn and improve their method of investing. In this case, I'm suggesting paper-trading first so that they may safeguard themselves from unnecessarily losing money. It probably won't work though."
2021-06-07 10:33:50,stocks,"He won't be actually using that 25k. He has 3k atm and that is what he will be trading with.  The 25k will just be floating in the account or stocks of my choosing. He will be keeping 2 spreadsheets; his trades and my trades.  I told him if he touches the 25k, I'll be taking it all back.  

It took me 35 years to finally dip my toes into trading stocks and honestly would have been awesome if I learned earlier. 20 years of gaming in with auction houses and market places prolly helped me along the way."
2021-06-07 11:16:26,stocks,ah well the next logical step is 25k in cash. Godspeed!
2021-06-07 10:49:37,stocks,Yea I will definitely look into it.  I am trying to setup a lifestyle for him and he won't be losing my money. I will be keeping tabs on his trades randomly multiple times a week.  He won't be touching the 25k so unlikely for me to lose money. He is 20 atm and going to UCI. Just trying to make it more comfortable for him to nudge into the game.
2021-06-06 23:10:46,stocks,"Correct, as long as you have a margin account it doesn’t have to be settled and you don’t get flagged."
2021-06-06 23:17:06,stocks,That's right as long as it's a margin account.
2021-06-07 10:34:53,stocks,He has paper traded for 3 months.  Money will be lost with or without the 25k.  He isn't touching my money.  It will just be in the account so he wont have to worry about pdt.
2021-06-07 13:35:59,stocks,That's great.  It's always good when family helps out.
2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,stuck and don't know what to do I recently started reading about stocks and stock market matter fact I understand all of the basic fundamentals but I feel like I am stuck I don't know what to do next can anyone recommend anything to help me dig deeper and thanks in advance
2021-06-07 00:53:15,stocks,"Here's my 2 cents:

&#x200B;

You won't learn how to ride a bike by going to a seminar or watching a video or asking a friend. You can learn a little bit, but eventually you just gotta do it. That doesn't mean be in a rush to spend, but don't be afraid to give it a shot.

&#x200B;

If you don't know anything and have the worst luck in the world, the worst thing that can happen is you lose 100%, right? So pick an amount you are willing to lose and split it amongst 5 stocks. Invest evenly in those stocks. I'm telling you right now, when you have actual skin in the game, you will follow those stocks like a cheap tattoo on a Walmart shopper. You are so much more 'invested', even with just a couple hundred dollars here and there, than if you paper trade or simply watch stuff. Your learning curve will accelerate tremendously.

&#x200B;

You might make money, but you will probably break even or lose 15% when all is said and done. And this is called: the cost of tuition. Cherish it, because the more you learn, the more you will make later on. My ""cost of tuition"" was $40,000 and that was in the year 2000. In the past 6 months I have turned $13k into $55k, and now that my divorce is done my financial future looks very bright.

&#x200B;

Okay, so anyway, onto the next subject, which is what to buy. As a former stockbroker I will tell you that there are 4 basic types of investment philosophies, and many times 2 or 3 of these will overlap. The philosophies are: Contrarian, Momentum investor, Value investor, and Fundamental Growth investor. Just about everyone who puts money (in a serious fashion) into the market follows at least one of these philosophies. The first step in knowing what to buy is determining what kind of investor you think you are. Breakdown:

&#x200B;

Contrarian --> When everyone says sell, you buy. When everyone says buy, you sell. Stock skyrocketing means avoid like the plague. Stock falling off a cliff means potential opportunity.

&#x200B;

Momentum --> Find something that's moving and ride the wave. Doesn't matter what the name is, or what they do, or whether they are profitable. If the stock is going up, buy calls or stock and sell it when the ride is over. If the stock is going down, buy puts or short it and cover when it stops dropping. Day traders often fall into this category. Successful ones, anyway.

&#x200B;

Value --> Find something that is worth a lot more than the stock is trading for, buy it, and be patient. This is where doing your DD is extremely important, because people have different definitions of ""value"". I find that cash flow, earnings, undervalued assets, etc are good ""value"" items, but that's just me. If you don't know shit about accounting, then don't trust earnings reports and P/E ratios, because they can be easily manipulated.

&#x200B;

Fundamental Growth --> Find a company that is growing (organically) AND the stock has not yet 'taken off', and buy it before wall street recognizes that potential. This is usually a very long term endeavor, and is horribly frustrating when you are wrong. But when you are right, you can make 5x, 10x, 20x your money over a period of years.

&#x200B;

NOW. If you can find a stock that fits into three of these criteria, your odds of success are pretty damn good.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, and good luck!"

2021-06-07 00:37:14,stocks,"Avoid penny stocks. If your concern is price per share, many brokers offer fractional shares.

If you simply can’t decide on an individual company to invest in, consider an ETF, which allows you to buy a single stock ticker that represents several different companies. Some ETFs I have are VBR, VFMF, FNDF, ISCF, VOE, VTI, FNDE, EMGF, VOO, VWO, and VEU. These eleven different ETFs provide exposure to thousands of companies worldwide meaning my investments aren’t completely dependent on the growth of the US economy and certainly not on a single company.

If you are not sure when to buy, it’s okay to try to time the market. Just recognize that you’re probably not going to time it well. It’s good to get at least a portion of your money in right away. You can invest 50% of what you have available right now and then additional amounts each week until you’ve invested the amount that you like. Keep some of your money in cash for emergencies and to give you freedom to buy into dips without selling something else."

TBH if you aren't willing to put the time into reading these two short books then I would just throw your money on an S&P 500 ETF or buy lottery tickets."
2021-06-06 23:39:12,stocks,"I think there’s a primitive skill that you have to develop over time with stocks. It’s managing fear and stress when faced with the unknown and making decisions. Most jobs are secure from these types of risks so not a lot of people have experience balancing this. 

If you hate what you do and are slaving away to earn $2000, the fear of losing all of that hard work can affect your ability to channel the skill I mentioned.

Passively and blindly yoloing your life savings into SPY is usually more chill since it’s programmatic and if you’re fucked, so is everyone else so 🤷‍♀️

2021-06-07 00:57:49,stocks,Yes play with house money you don’t care to lose. You only truely learn from experience and I’m guessing you are stuck cause your not willing to test the money you’ve earned so far. What I did was save tips from my job for a whole year then I opened up a brokerage account and started w that. It’s a different feeling cause I felt I was ok w losing that money since I didn’t technically need it just saved it. Once I did that the ball got rolling. Hope this helps

* What do you want from your investing?
*  Do you want to speculate or develop a constant income stream? 
* What risk appetite do you have? If you want an income stream then it is probably low to mid risk tolerance for your portfolio. 
* What sectors do you wish to invest in for a diversified portfolio? 

There are many more such questions to ask yourself and then list in an orderly manner so that you can craft a trading strategy. The importance of this sort of research is to allow you to enter the market confidently and trade  without great emotional upheavals.

There are some great educational materials out there which will help you to craft a suitable strategy for yourself. Good luck and God bless you!

2021-06-07 08:28:26,stocks,"I have had the best luck looking at the political action. Examples last year oil stocks were down due to Covid-19 and pressure from the left and I bought oil company stock because I knew the economy would come back and have done great. The progressive democratic party is pushing their green plan and I am now investing in Electric and Hydrogen Semi truck and charging network stocks because President Biden wants to put billions in charging networks and EVs. I believe Bank stocks are about to start making a bigger move in the second half of the year because of increase interest rates. I say this because Janet Yellen has talked about higher interest rates several times and I believe she is preparing us for the increase and not a shock.  The fed says it want be for at least another year but I do not think so. The latest comment from Janet Yellen below. I try as the saying goes buy low and sell high so I watch the stock for a while to create a buy point.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, former U.S. Federal Reserve chair, said in a Bloomberg interview that President Joe Biden’s $4 trillion spending agenda would be positive for the country, even if it leads to a rise in interest rates. “If we ended up with a slightly higher interest rate environment it would actually be a plus for society’s point of view and the Fed’s point of view,” Yellen said.

So I tried it it all. Never try on margin. My account looked like:

25% speculation in high growth
5% call options
5% put options
50% Blue chip dividend 
15% dividend with growth

Found out quick. Options are quick to make money. And lightning quick to lose everything. I don’t touch options at all now. 

The others, I tracked the percentage of gains (dividend and stock increase; overall yield)

Found out I like trading more than investing. Found out I could never do ETFs or any group fund. I enjoy looking for the needles in haystacks. That’s the fun. I do fairly well and enjoy it. And that is the most important part to me"

2021-06-07 12:56:46,stocks,">Contrarian --> When everyone says sell, you buy. When everyone says buy, you sell. Stock skyrocketing means avoid like the plague. Stock falling off a cliff means potential opportunity.

Just wanted to add to the discussion. Certainly agree with the commenter that there is lots of opportunity as a contrarian, but this is a tough kind of investing to do right. Careful being the contrarian.

It requires an immense amount of both patience and confidence. You need to be able to look at a company's prospects and financials, and truly understand that the company will come out okay. Then you gotta be alright with being wrong for a long time before you are ever right.

And be warned, what goes down does not always come up!

The other thing is that I am not sure contrarian investing is a great approach in this current market. There are ALOT of companies that are down and out, but in my opinion, most of them have already priced in a full fledged recovery - to infinity and beyond."

2021-06-07 01:32:55,stocks,"Okay, it’s good you’re looking into simulators.

Your “strategy” is basically the reason you make certain decisions. What you need to answer is the question of “what is your goal for getting started with the markets?”

Are you looking to make multiple trades over the course of days/weeks/months? If so, I won’t provide advice on that.

Are you looking to put in a few dollars every paycheck towards the markets in order to grow your money in the future? If so, great!

I understand you don’t have a big wallet. Don’t let that discourage you — I don’t care if all you can spare (responsibly) is 10 bucks a paycheck, you can still benefit from this!

I also realize you don’t know everything, and you want to find companies to buy. Well, the good news is that there are organizations that actually handle all of that for you! These are called ETFs, and there is an entire world of them for you to explore!

Let’s say you want to just invest in the overall S&P or NASDAQ or whatever. Or, you really feel good about renewable energy. Natural resources. Online retail. Machine learning. Social media. You name it, there are probably multiple ETFs out there, each with their own strategy.

You can find and learn about these at ETF.com.

While I would recommend you explore the filters to get an understanding of the various industries and sectors available to you for invest in, you can also start your search by individual stock. (So let’s just say you got the Pfizer vaccine, and you think the pharma sector might be worth investing in, so you see what ETFs PFE is part of.)

Literally, just start by finding 1 ETF that sparks your interest, and start putting money into it as you can, gradually over time. During that time look for another ETF that looks compelling, and then start buying into that one as you can.

Seriously, if you find 1-4 ETFs to sprinkle your money into over time, I have a feeling you will not regret it 5 years from now."

It's like a training tool to get you used to trading without the losses that comes with the experience. Simplest method could literally be pen and paper recording what you would have bought at what price and what you will end up selling at, and keeping track of those trades. Personally I had used investopedia's simulated trading when I started and it's free to use web based program. I like it because it also has the same controls and functions as the generic online account/app for trading, so you learn the tools as well as getting trading experience.

BBBY Bed Bath and Beyond because they do 9 billion revenue, and are turning the ship to be profitable. Market cap is only 3 billion with 100 million share float. 98.4% institutionally owned and 2.7% insider owned (increased by .8% in the past 6 months). It is also >30% short interest right now, with the interest rate on the shorts slowly increasing by the day.

Mark Tritton (new CEO) is the special sauce imo. His Nike and Target experience will shine here.

This is a company that everyone recognizes. The short interest thought it was a dead store and would succumb to the fate of toys r us, sears, hertz etc. , but that assumption is far from the truth now.

Due to the short's greed and being nasty vultures, they have over extended and now with the high short interest, this company is rising from the dead. They cut the fat during the pandemic (brands and stores that were failing) and remodeled stores while traffic was down, while recently announcing vertically integrated brands that will hopefully increase margin.....

Pent up demand for kids going back to college. People having parties at home now rather than restaurants (BBBY has a focus on kitchen as part of the ""beyond""). New home market and the new things needed for the home. Post-Covid Summer baby boom for their Buy Buy Baby brand. All aligning nicely.

Mark is also focusing on the omni channel sales aspect and integrating the personalized data for customer experience online and in store. Whether they accomplish this is to be seen, but they are starting to have meaningful data, and Mark's track record as Chief Merchandising Officer at Target and listening to him present shows me that he knows where he needs to focus in order to become the apex Karen destination for their home necessities.

The juice is worth the squeeze on this one!

Oh... ""I want to start making investments based on whether if it's going to change people's lives""

**PROS**

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US, employing over 20 million professionals in 2020. Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15% for all healthcare professionals vs. 4% for all occupations. Men on average represented 25% of the US healthcare workforce in 2019, while men’s business represented only 17% of net revenues of 2020. In 2020, the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated $12B in the US and $79B globally, according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned. The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.

FIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community.  In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships.  Through the #FIGSLOVE program, FIGS aims to be part of a professional's career by sending special gifts to them after career milestones like graduating from school or opening a new practice.  Among US healthcare professionals and medical students, FIGS has aided and unaided brand awareness of 55% and 22%, respectively.  From 2017 to 2020, FIGS grew net revenue from $17.6M to $263.1M with a 146% CAGR. Of the customers acquired from 2017 to 2019, approximately 50% returned for a second purchase.

&#x200B;

**CONS**

FIGS relies heavily on word-of-mouth advertising which can be a blessing and [a curse](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/us/figs-scrubs-video-women-do-trnd/index.html).  FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth, and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time. Shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations.  There is reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain.  FIGS also operates within a highly competitive market with 202 employees and [will be focused on the healthcare community](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/figs-will-focus-on-medical-scrubs-now-but-could-set-its-sights-on-other-industry-uniforms-in-the-future-11622215256) for the medium term. [Some competitors](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/figs-inc/357446828) of FIGS include:

* *Uniform Advantage*: $105M in revenue, 390 employees
* *Jaanuu*: $36M in revenue, 172 employees
* *Nixon Medical*: $82M in revenue, 400 employees
* *Barco Uniforms*: $25M in revenue, 225 employees
* *Careismatic Brands*: $221M in revenue, 730 employees

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

Given the recent IPO, I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks.  I will wait for a better reentry price.  With that said, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand.  FIGS has room to grow over the next 3-5 years and I like it as a longer term investment.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"How should I liquidate a part of my portfolio Hi guys,

I have about 70k invested right now in various stocks. Some are winning, some are losing. About 20k of those are long term, and the rest are still under short term capital gains.

I'm about to sell some stocks to pay for a down payment on a home. I'd probably need to liquidate about 30k. I'm wondering if there are any rule of thumbs to consider.

Which of these make sense?

1. Prioritize selling the stocks that are currently losing so I can take advantage of tax write offs.
2. Prioritize selling the stocks that won big, because I can say I made a profit on those investments.
3. Prioritize selling the stocks that I think don't have much growth in the future, to maximize the returns of my existing portfolio.
4. If selling at a loss, prioritize the short term stocks first. If selling at a gain, prioritize the long term stocks first."
2021-06-07 08:20:22,stocks,"You need to do a few things:

+ First, you need to find out how much of a tax bill you are willing to pay.  Many people want a neutral position by the end of the year.
+ Then find out which one of your winners is about to run out of steam.  
+ Determine which one of your losers has no future potential

Depend on where you are in the first bullet, you trim the winners and cut the losers the appropriate amount.

If you know the second and third bullets then you already have the holy grail and don't need any inputs from anyone.  So, bullets 2 and 3 are the best guesses at best.  

So, you may as well trim enough of the winner and cut enough of your losers to come up with $30k and a net-zero tax bill at the end of the year.

Anyone who gives you a definite answer on what to do is not in the market long enough to see the loser recovers and the winners traded sideways for years."

FSLR is the largest utility grade solar company. They're swimming in cash and their solar panels are US-made, which gives them isolation from Chinese stock and has helped them repeatedly when other suppliers run short. They fund and maintain and support their own installations and are the big boy of the group.

CSIQ is the next biggest utility grade solar installer. They have a great supply chain and are very similar to FSLR except they use chinese-sourced panels, for the most part.

SEDG is an inverter, battery, and storage company. They're the big boys of that industry, with ENPH as the upstart trying to take market share. SEDG is pretty much unbeatable in the space right now, but ENPH has lots of growth potential as long as interest rates remain low (debt).

Lastly, RUN is the best of the best for residential installs. They recently completed a merger.

2021-06-07 00:31:29,stocks,"I like MAXN. It is an interesting spinoff from sunpower...a sort of 'made up company'. If it was pre-IPO or a startup seeking Series A, it might indeed be called attractive. However as a publicly listed firm, there are certain reasonable concerns and deficits not overlooked in the above writeup.

&#x200B;

1. They have a structural polysilica (ingredient to make the panels) supply contract (expiring in 2022) which is more costly than current market rates.  \[Dunno if this is a holdover from SunPower relationship with the Chinese investor or what..but it  seems on face an extremely bad contract\]
2. The contract seems to be designed to be market+ pricing -- I guess to assure supply? -- but in the past few months the market price of polysilica has risen significantly. 
3. So basically with combined points 1+2 -- their cost of goods is rising and will continue to rise for at least a year (contract plus time it takes to make new polysilica factories), if not longer (polysilica prices). Can they raise their product pricing (best technology) to preserve margin? Answer unclear.
4. Their technology seems to currently be the best but their supply chain (see contract) is shit/questionable. While seeking market sharing within a growing market, they still don't have any positive EBIDTA. 
5.  Which brings me to my final point -- they are burning cash quickly; the recent SPO is all being used for production of the new panels; a reasonable analysis suggests they will need ANOTHER SPO to cover G&A within the next 12 months\* based on their current burn rate.

&#x200B;

\*Their cash on hand is less then their burn rate. At the end of 2020 they had 209m, currently they have 131m. So lets call that 80m every 6 months....by this time next year they would in theory be bankrupt unless they can earn lots of cash from their new product lines OR raise more money via SPO. 

tl;dr there is a valid market reason the stock price has gotten crushed."

Today, they transformed into a cell and panel producer (Swiss engineering, production in Germany). They are using their own heterojunction/SmartWire technology as their USP. They stopped selling the machines to the chinese solar companies. So, the chinese cannot use SmartWire.

MBs technology creates modules that generate up to 20 percent more electricity than comparable standard modules on the same amount of roof space. The performance for all modules will still be at 92 percent after 25 years

Otherwise I agree. For an immobile battery I would prefer something like a vanadium flow battery. Longer lasting, runs cooler and safer chemicals at the cost of space. Not an issue for the home but again... they just cant keep up on price point or trust. 

You can get a Powerwall for half the price per kWh than a flow battery and on top of that, there is also the issue whetehr or not a flow battery company will still be in business 5 years from now (aka trust). The major Li-ion makers are pretty safe long term and will likely still be around 10 years from now to service your battery...

I don’t know what the weather in Canada has to do with them producing and selling solar panels globally. I think it’s six continents they participate in:

“Notably, Canadian Solar has one of the world’s largest utility-scale solar project development platforms, with a track record of bringing into commercial operation more than 5.6 GWp of solar power plants across six continents, as of Sep 30, 2020. In 2021, the company expects to ship 18-20 GW of modules”"
2021-06-07 01:30:07,stocks,"Although we have short days in the winter they are usually still very bright and sunny days. Solar combined with battery storage is very viable up here and there are provincial programs encouraging it.

Conversely, in the summer, when you'd want to run expensive AC systems we get very long days with lots of sun so there's gonna be a lot of savings there.

Latitude really doesn't matter, distance from the equator might affect how long the days are at certain times of year but the amount of day and night time over the course of the year is still exactly the same as everywhere else."

When it comes to the sellers and installers, most of them are using the same panels and same inverters as the competition. So it comes down to sales force and the ability to cut costs.

On the other hand, if a power company is paying to replace batteries every 3-5 years, I'd assume any business would look for an alternative if there was one available.

[This video](https://youtu.be/-PL32ea0MqM) goes through the issues of using lithium ion batteries and proposes that liquid metal batteries are a better option.

Look at the funds holdings and the sector it is focused on. Note the weighting for the top 10 holdings and you will figure out where most of the returns are going to come from.

next evaluate the companies themselves. Are they companies that you would invest in personally?

lastly look at the expense ratio. keep in mind that will come off your account in fees every year regardless of what the market does.

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"AMC Stock Holders - Pitch for AMC Subscription Service - Cable and Streaming - Your Thoughts. As we the investors and are now owning 80% of the shares, I wanted to toss an idea out to the group.   


I think that the Big Ten Network or HBO, serves as a great example of how AMC could create a market that requires cables services that gives people a theater experience at home and could really bring a great experience to streaming services. So here is my idea. I am a game dev, so I would like people closer to this industry to take hold of the idea, and drill into how good or bad the idea is and take control of it and see if a pitch could be taken up for review. We could form a team to present and bring it up in a share holders meeting.  (Be actual adults who hold shares, be apart of the process to fix the company)  


So here is the service.   


What do you watch on the service?   
I think we follow the same setup standard TV channels follow with a pattern style of movies at exactly known hours. So people are never surprised about what movies will be on and what time.   


M-F you know exactly what genre of movies come on around what time. TBD what those are by research. During the morning it could be cartoons and then as the mid-day pushes in more old time classics and then I feel every night at 9pm having the prime-time movie.   


Before each prime-time movie you have exactly what you have at a movie theater. Previews of what is coming out at the movies and on our channel on release dates.   
I also did like at Almo draft house they had themes of previews or movie skits before the movie based on the movie that was going to be watched. So for example before It they showed a bunch of really scary clown, old movie clips and cartoons and it was really cool to have this before the show. Could do this before Prime-time, to really give it the attention it deserves.   


Weekend Prime-time moves get more focus and but release movies, the ones that get released the same day as movies in the theaters, get a big half hour of just really pump'd up time before the movie just like in the theaters. With previews and these little skits.   


This is a paid service with cable providers and online streaming services. There is an App, their could be a few channels, AMC Western, AMC Prime and AMC Sci-Fi etc . The idea is to make it a premier channel like HBO.   


Anyway, just an idea, wanted to float it and I am sure someone else has thought about it. But wanted to spin it and see if someone inside that industry could take a hold of the idea and see why this legally or functionally would or wouldnt work.

&#x200B;

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

&#x200B;

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

&#x200B;

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

&#x200B;

Now lets get into it, shall we?

&#x200B;

Some upcoming events this week to keep an eye on: Earnings from **COUP, MRVL, MTN** on Monday, followed by **CPB, GME, RH** Wednesday, and **ADBE, CHWY, PLUG**, on Thursday.

&#x200B;

Also happening are key reports on core inflation, consumer sentiment/expectations, job turnover rate, and G7! Will proposals to tax multinational persons/corporations make any big changes in the market? Long term- I do not believe it will have any significant effect on valuations of these companies.

&#x200B;

Player 3,297 has entered the EV game.  **Rivian** is working with advisors to set up their IPO and have reportedly selected their underwriters.  This will be very interesting to me. I have a close friend who is working for them and they have been giving him great opportunities which gives me a lot of optimism because he is 1 of 2 people I have met over the last 3 decades that I would trust to work for me, regardless of the industry, just because of what a solid and smart person he is.

&#x200B;

Conservative Investing News, who I have spamming me constantly, is shilling Kraft Heinz **KHC** as the number 1 income stock of 2021. They cite the dividend of 5% at current valuations and the stock decline of 50% since 2017. I’ve been holding **KHC** since pre-merger so I have seen this decline and not sure I agree with them that this stock is ready for a major comeback. May be a decent dividend play but then again so is **AT&T**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So it’s been a wild week of meme stock pops and dips.  I will admit I am still holding some **GME** but prematurely sold my **AMC**. Thought double was good enough but this week proved me wrong considering could have done 7x. Oh well, if you look at my massive loss from last year I have learned to make my peace with taking profits, even if they aren’t as maximized as they could be.

&#x200B;

I just wasn’t as convinced for the **AMC** thesis as I am for the **GME**. I like to look at them both and think about them as if there is no MOASS in the wings and when I look at them like that **GME** is a good value buy for me even at the current market cap.  It’s got a great digital transition team lead by RC and others that are the top of their game.  The amount of publicity they have received is also beyond what anyone could have paid for and they have capitalized on it wonderfully.

&#x200B;

I did enjoy **AMC** CEO showing us his naked shorts, and have been selling cash covered puts on **AMC** in the 15-20 strike range earning 30-60+% APY when projected out for a year.  He is doing a great job of harnessing the movement and keeping shareholders interested and engaged.  Will see if he continues to roll out things like the AMC Investor Connect, but if he does I think the shareholders will reward him.

&#x200B;

My cash covered puts and stock secured calls I have been doing for about two months have been doing well.  I stick with what I know and only sell puts on stocks at prices I wouldn’t mind being long in, and then I sell calls to continue generating current income on the blocks.  Averaging about 30% interest last I checked a few weeks ago.

&#x200B;

**TSLA** jumped 4.6% on news that it was looking to expand to India. Don’t know if that alone is good enough news to justify a pop like this alone, especially with rivals coming from every direction.

&#x200B;

**American Airlines** dropped 2.4% when it released a lack luster 2Q revenue forecast this week.

&#x200B;

**TGT** continues to attract attention of hedge funds and investors with an impressive target of 211$ from Credit Suisse and a total of 78 hedge funds holding.  It has a 1.23% dividend as well so huzzah.  Wish I had held more of the shares I bought in the mid to high 60s a few years back! 

&#x200B;

**OPEN** came on my radar and bought \~200$ of each.  Found it in a stock gum shoe article deducing it as the likely teased stock from MF’s new real estate trailblazer big bucks subscription. Seems like a very interesting real estate disrupter. The market is ripe for disruption as buying/selling a house is far too cumbersome given all the technical tools at humanities fingertips.  This company makes cash offers on houses, do necessary renovations, and resell them. Instant gratification is the Achilles heel of modern Americans so this type of business that scratches that itch I think will go far. Just a matter of what companies take the space first and service the customer the best.

&#x200B;

Long **Disney** until the IP laws change in this country. The amount of IP they own, from Marvel to Star Wars is just insane.  And they are continuing to churn new content in these hot spaces.  The Star Wars Disney+ offerings have proved popular, and Loki is right around the corner!  Consensus 1 yr target avg from Yahoo Finance is $207 which presents decent upside from current levels.  Wish they would bring the dividend back but they are sufficiently pushing growth initiatives that I won’t complain too much at this time.

&#x200B;

Let’s end with the question, what do you guys think of **Upstart**, a fin tech company? Are they sufficiently unique to distinguish themselves in the crowded market and get ahead of the primary players? Seems like loans are ripe for disruption given the archaic roots of the industry players, but will **Upstart** be a lead disruptor, or will it fall behind?

I also have a Roth IRA account that I’ve been maxing out (6k) for the last several years during my full time employment.

Are these two contribution limits completely separate from each other? I’m reading things that say something along the lines of “You can have as many retirement accounts as you wish but the combined contribution limit of 6k remains”. Do I assume the 401a/403b is exempt from that? Also from reading it sounds like when I switch employers I would likely be rolling over my 401a/403b into a 401k, and am wondering if the contribution limits I have now would mirror that once rolled over into the 401k while still investing in my roth.

A turkey is fed every day for years and then one day, a few days before thanksgiving, it gets slaughtered.

Apologies in advance if this is a dumb question. I have been following $ECOL since they suspended dividends. Picked up 60 shares recently with an avg of $38.50 as I figured a reinstatement of dividend would yield solid returns. 

Anyways, I was reading their SEC filings and they are showing a strong recovery in revenue despite the pandemic, taking advantages of event cleanup for covid. I saw they plan on leveraging targeted acquisitions which makes the recent share dilution seem a little more reasonable. However, why would 9 different directors scoop up a significant amount of shares right before being diluted? Can somebody who’s more experienced in the business world explain what this might imply? Are the directors taking on risk to buffer the dilution? Again, sorry if this is a stupid question :) thanks all"

Hey all, I got into investing a bit over a year ago and it’s been quite an interesting ride to say the least. I’m going to preface this by saying that yes, I do hold a position in $GME but I want to talk about the broader market. Everyday that goes by I feel like I’m seeing more and more statistical data that is in the simplest of terms, pointing directly to a scenario similar to the housing crisis but on an even broader scale. 

I know that sentiment on Reddit generally wants to believe that bear markets aren’t a fact of life but I can’t help but feel we are headed toward one. Whether or not you buy into GameStop going to millions of dollars or an “infinity squeeze,” things like the reverse repo market being at all time highs and the obvious corruption relating to short selling pointed out in the house of cards DDs that are cited and peer reviewed have to instill some sense of worry. At least it does for me. 

So I guess my question here for all of you that are traditional and seemingly level-headed investors is, at what point do we go “holy sh*t 2008 never really ended and Wall Street has created a nuke ready to detonate?”

Again, I’m not trying to spread fear but I can’t help but feel there comes a point where data just doesn’t lie and it points to a clear, albeit depressing and frightening outcome.

Approximately 8 years ago I was sure there would be an housing market crash. I was holding off buying. I finally relented a few years ago. The market went up so much that I doubt I will loose anything even if it crashes.

According to the actual, you know, **squeeze** theory, the short positions forcibly bought out will buy it from them.

Now you can believe or not believe that this will happen, but if they are forcibly bought out, and nobody is selling for less than ridiculous prices, then the over leveraged investment funds will be bought out at these ridiculous prices and the way the market works supports the whole thing. Completely dry up the liquidity, create great buy demand (more than the entire float is estimate) and the price will move real easy. The problem is getting to that point.

Also the alleged danger isn't just gamestop's 20 billion market cap (if it does squeeze that will go higher, what's the market cap at even VW squeeze prices?), it's that to pay that off, they will be forced to close liabilities, aka all the other less valuable stocks they have shorted to reasonable but still significant levels. 

Also, it's all about liquidity, no, not the stock market liquidity, the cash liquidity. The total markets are 80 trillion. How much of that can they instantly convert to cash and pay into my bank account? What will happen to the stocks they sold to get that cash out. A chain reaction of lowering the US stock markets market cap, a chain reaction of options suddenly out of the money, ETFs scrambling to rebalance. I'm not saying it will wipe out 80 trillion, but you physically can't take out 20 billion, or even 100 billion if we take VW prices, out of the market in a single day. Never mind the consequences, it's just not physically possible to do it that quick for that amount."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD) **Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

&#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans."

As for individual stocks, I like to invest in profitable companies I understand and overlap with in my daily life like Microsoft. Depending on your profession, you may have insight into certain industries and which companies are growing, losing customers, improving products, etc. If you're confident in an industry or theme, you can always invest in an ETF to get exposure without having to choose a specific company. For instance, I believe that global demand for lithium will increase, but I don't know enough about mining to pick the right one. An ETF would be a better fit for me. 

Good call focusing on your financial future! I'm 25 as well, and I love hearing about other people my age making smart money moves. Best of luck!"

With a Traditional IRA, I kept much of the governments tax money - AND ALL THE GAINS OVER THIRTY YEARS :)  A Roth IRA would have cost me six figures.

But the standard investment advice on Reddit is ""buy a Roth"".   Great call - if you're going to have more income after retirement.   Not many people are in that position.

Yeah you can invest in both, but if you have extra money, just put it in a non-retirement brokerage account."

With a Traditional - I waited and now pay much fewer taxes.  And I keep all the gains I would have lost with a Roth. 

Losing money with a Roth to get liquidity isn't smart.  If you want liquidity, just make a parallel investment in a brokerage account.

Let’s say this time of extreme need comes when:
  
There’s a market correction or downturn and your investments are all negative. Or your forced to sell some investments at cost or a loss and you didn’t want to, knowing that good catalysts are around the corner and would benefit from it.
  
Or even worse if there is a crash or bear market and that’s the time you should be buying but instead you need to liquidate a portion of your portfolio to get money out and you sell a huge chunk at a loss.
  
You can ALWAYS sell and withdraw from brokerage, but will you ALWAYS want to? 
  
That is the big question, and when you need money for something and not enough cash in saving... you might not have a choice."
2021-06-07 07:27:47,stocks,">But as i said in my post, even if all of these worries are true, you could simply cashout from the brokerage i am not seeing the issue.

That's entirely your choice based on the level of risk you're willing to take. 

The odds of your investments tanking at any given time are very low. But if you need any reminders, just look up videos of the 2008 crisis, where the Dow dropped 800 points in one day, or the s&p 500 dropped something like 40% yoy. And it wasn't until ~4 years later (iirc) that the stock market recovered to it's previous peak. 

So sure, you could use your investments as an emergency fund, but you should be aware of the possibilities, and know that it's nobody's fault but your own if you fall into a perfect storm where you need that money during a recession or crash. 

Having cash on hand is always a safe bet. Especially if you hold it in a savings account that can make up for, or at least get close to matching inflation."
2021-06-06 20:32:45,stocks,"Yeah, so put into a Roth the first few years until you get into the higher tax bracket.   Then DEFINITELY put it into a Traditional.

It was a good bet that taxes were going to be lower than that in addition to taking a smaller income in retirement.

You say you’re in the 12% bracket in retirement so at most you’re pulling out $40k. In 1980, the lowest tax bracket (besides 0% up to $3,400 1980 dollars) was 14%. So obviously if a Roth IRA existed back then, you would have wasted money putting into it.

Tax law changes through the decades. Who knows what it will be like 30 years from now. I have a hard time believing I’ll still be able to pull $40k equivalent for 12% or less 30 years from now.

There’s nothing wrong or bad about contributing to a post tax retirement account today with how low the current tax brackets are. It’s best to hedge against it by having both. Congrats on retirement and guessing right."

2021-06-07 00:00:00,stocks,"CLOV discussion  

I am going to try and give a full picture of what is going on with CLOV and why it may or may not be a buy right now. There are pros/cons and risks/benefits to both sides of the argument.

**First lets start with the possible positive catalysts on the horizons.**

CLOV is being added to two significant indexes including the MSCI global small cap index and the russell 3000. There is I believe misinformation and debate on when and how this will effect the price going forward, particularly with the timing of the russell 3000 addition. The moral of the story is that ETFs tracking both indexes will have to rebalance their portfolios at some point and buy some shares of CLOV which will provide further upward momentum for the stock. The current argument is whether these ETFs will be purchased before or after the June 25th addition ( I believe the rebalancing and purchasing of shares would be after June 25th).

**Now lets talk about the squoze**

Most up to date short information I have found is

\- short interest is $417M 46.67M shares shorted

\- 41.38% SI% of Float 29.27% S3 SI% Float 1.42% fee.

\- Shares shorted up +1.82M shares, worth $16M, +4.1%, last week. Shorts up +$88M in 2021 mark-to-market profits; down -$3 million on today's +0.7% move.

You might look at that and say Wow why on earth hasn’t this squoze yet? Because….

$CLOV shorts are still up $3 million in mark-to-market profits for the month and up $90 million for the year. Even though they are down big over the last week, shorts won't cover in size (short squeeze) until they are deep in the red.

Source : Ihor Dusaniwsky from S3 partners analytics

This is one of the criticisms of CLOV vs AMC/GME is that shorts are still sitting pretty laughing their heads off massively in the green. This really has no squeeze potential until it surpasses the $12-13 range. Is this the most shorted stock in the market right now? Possibly. This and WKHS are the top shorted stocks based on short float % and there is definitely a ton of potential here being locked down. It won’t see that potential until some catalyst pushes the shorts into the red. As a squeeze play I wouldn’t see the point in buying in till it starts the battle over that key $12-13 range which is when the original short attack happened.

**CLOV as a company**

Clov is a company that has had consistent growth in members, revenue, and is debt free but here is why some may not think that is enough. These are comments taken from CLOVs last earnings.

* Medicare Advantage membership is expected to be in the range of 68,000 - 70,000 by December 31, 2021, a growth rate of 17% - 21% as compared to year end 2020. This is consistent with our previous guidance that we discussed in our year-end 2020 earnings call on March 1.
* For the Medicare Direct Contracting program, while the Company expects to have access to up to 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries through its contracts with Participating Providers, we believe we will end 2021 with between 70,000 - 100,000 total aligned beneficiaries. Voluntary alignment will occur quarterly, and the majority of voluntary alignments are expected to become effective in the fourth quarter.
* Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $810 - $830 million, inclusive of a preliminary estimate of approximately $20 - $30 million of revenue generated from Direct Contracting. GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021.

The part that is most controversal is the line about Medicare Direct Contracting program. Hindencuck and other shorters are quick to point out that Clover mislead investors by stating they already HAD 200,000 lives under contract in this program. However, this is overall a very small portion of their revenue as highlighted in the third section. What matters most is Medicare Advantage membership growth which has been steadily increasing year after year.

My hesitation is that these increases are still fairly insignificant on the grand medicare stage and that while CLOV has been granted access in other states, it is still significantly limited geographically in where they operate with I believe most of their members only in New Jersey. They have “access” to many other states and counties but really haven’t made any footprint into these areas.

They have consistent growth, but with the amount of market available to them I believe it should be better. Until these numbers have a dramatic increase it limits investor interest and catalysts against the current short interests.

**Conclusion**

This company has some positive catalysts with the index additions and consistent albeit slower than I would like growth/revenue increases. It also has massive squeeze potential, but it has a heavy heavy battle ahead to get there.

The potential is there, but it currently needs a lot of help and YOLO apes to get it to $13 to make things go BOOM.

2) Looking at their financials and/or most recent earnings report. YahooFinance is a quick and easy app to use to look at income statement and balance sheet. For a quick review, I like to look at gross margins, how fast revenue is increasing relative to SG&A, asset turnover, and long term debt. 

The recent ER report (can also be found on YahooFinance under news) showed me what I pointed out, though as another poster pointed out, I only looked at one quarter so for a deeper review would be best to look at FY results."

2021-06-07 01:08:17,stocks,"I'll agree to disagree here. 40-70 years ago, high inflation was the norm. Not the entire time, but for many years during that stretch. We've been in an unprecedented low interest rate situation for over a decade now. 

In 2009, when rates fell to zero, if you said ""my investment strategy doesn't change because of this"" then... you probably still made money. But if you said ""oh shit, zero interest rates, time to go into all-in on tech/growth"" then you would have absolutely killed.  

This is the first time we will have potentially raised rates, and we *definitely* haven't had any serious inflation for over 10 years. Changing your strategy now if you think inflation won't be transient, might be as impactful as having been like ""I'm going all in on tech and companies losing money"" 10 years ago."

I think this gives a great mix of resources, growth stocks and more blue chip type stocks, but this would require active management to make sure the fundamentals of each company remains strong.

I don't understand why you all talk about index fund while nobody in this thread has mentioned the investment

The argument of keeping your investment there for the long run is sometimes weak given that life conditions may require you to sell and you want do you knowing the you won't loose money. Of course you can keep your investment up for 80 years, but I wonder what we invest for in the first place, in 80 years I'm definitely dead. If everyone uses this metric to do their investments we won't have any sell off and movement in the market lol

The best investors of all time are the one who died and never close their brokerage account. Ask to fidelity.

But this gets to the heart of my and other's argument, this is the answer MOST of the time.

You're right, but Michael Burry is a savant and managing portfolio(s) that are incredibly large. He's shown the ability to accurately shift investment focuses over the last few decades, something that a normal investor can't replicate.

You can certainly try your hand at it. You may come out on top, but for most investors a short-term dramatic shift in their investing focus likely isn't going to be favorable."

Couple the increasing revenue per user with the fact that they’re adding 30-40% more users and this flywheel starts really turning.

2021-06-07 02:45:07,stocks,"A few follow ups:
- corporate taxes are usually flat taxes, ie you pay x% of your net profits (adjusted for special items like eg donations), so that should make you happy already ;) 
- taxes do not hurt the successful. Taxes ensure that public services that cannot or are not provided by privates are available. You could think of roads, water, the military, firefighters, laws etc. The less tax revenue is available, the fewer of these services can be provided (assuming that a country cannot loan money indefinitely as interest would increase exponentially). Therefore 10% seem too low to me to finance a healthy society. 
- you could also see taxes as a contribution of the successful to the community. To avoid freeloaders, the taxes are mandatory. 
- last but not least, taxes do not automatically get passed on to the end consumer. If you want some arguments for that, please look at “price elasticity”, “substitution products”, “porters 5 forces” or similar concepts. Agreed there are cases in which taxes can be passed on, eg in monopoly situations, but that is something the state should control to avoid as much as possible.

Here is the bottom line. Glass, aluminum, plastics, copper and cells which are mostly silicon and some misc metals. Thats it. Thin film is different so lets leave that out.

Please explain to me why such a brilliant recyclist like yourself, cant use your incredible skills to remove the glass (mill it or whatever), aluminum and cables (copper + plastic) from panels and recycle those? Ill wait...

And then, once you have arrived at this grand explanation utilizing your super human wisdom, see if that doesnt basically follow the reasoning in prior comments. All you have left is cells which dont take up a lot of space, do not weight much and are much easier to handle and arent toxic either (not at that stage).

The fact that recyclers arent set up for it doesnt justify your entire thesis; that panels are bad for the environment.

Its like saying, back in the day, that we should not use aluminum because most recyclers were only set up for glass and some steel alloys. Still think aluminum was a bad idea give how much safer, more environmentally friendly, and easier to recycle than the alternatives?

And as an aside, you are incorrect about solar being unable to power everything. If most assuredly can in terms of power generation. The problem is storage, not power generation. But that can resolved in many ways that are then, very environmentally friendly. But I digress."

I heard a certain stock has a huge short interest hidden through the privileges of Marketmakers (e.g., Citadel) that created OTM puts (extreme put interest on 7/16 (40m shares) and 1/21 (36m shares)), ITM calls, shorted through ETFs by a major hedgefunds (Citadel) being a Authorized participants (AP) in those very ETFs (e.g., ETF XRT, major SI/FTDs), and Failures-to-Deliver data skyrocketing in ETFs containing GME (GameStop) the very same day the squeeze in January was forcedly stopped). I have the feeling the something is happening there, as the price of GME has been steadily increasing the last weeks. Any opinion? Any rational counterpoints?

It's rather small, and i do not have that much invested, since it's all i can spare atm. Started ""investing"" about a year ago, got into the S&P500, as a safe bet, and some solar-stocks like enphase and solaredge.

Since then i sold it all, and got into the so-called ""memestocks"".

At this point my portfolio is about 80% GME and 20% AMC.

Does /r/stocks see these stocks as a solid investment, or just a hype that everyone should get out of as soon as possible?"
2021-06-07 04:41:41,stocks,"Since i myself am ballsdeep in GME my opinion might not be as valluable as some of the other investors on here, but this is what i think.

GME is not just a hype or a memestock. The DD on /r/superstonk have shown how deep the rabbithole goes. The price has been steadily rising for about 3 weeks now. Shareholder meeting is in 2 days and, as you've said before, the short interest is probably way higher that reported on FINRA. Every bit of DD points towards a massive short squeze and i have yet to stumble across some good counters to these DD's that actually make sense. 

My opinion is this; when you're going in with money you are willing to lose there is an insanely asymmetrical risk-reward in play. The risk; it not rising, falling back to $100/share and you lose about $150/share. If however this insane short squeze actually happens, you could actually 100x, maybe even 1000x or more, your investment. 

Not financial advise ofcourse."

Walmart is great since it's a defensive stock (defensive stocks are stocks that will most likely benefit from panic) I have no idea for MGM or zfe but I think you should check out AMD, they're currently facing chip shortages and you can probably nab a couple of stocks, once the chip shortages end (December? Maybe 2022) they will be able to fill a lot of demand very fast, normally I'd say check out Nvidia too but Nvidia is near its price target and I've already make 100+ per stock so they're not going up, keep on the lookout my dude"

2021-06-07 19:09:48,stocks,"AMC would be going bankrupt sooner than later if it hadn’t already diluted shareholders tremendously. The CEO is essentially conning retail shareholders by stating that they need your guys’ permission via shareholder voting rights to sell more shares of the company in order to pay off a portion of their debt. In either scenario, you will lose out in the long term by the company going under or you continue to get diluted to oblivion. If nothing else, I would spend time researching the effect share dilution has on you as a shareholder and how negatively it can impact your investment.

GME’s current business model is outdated and their plans to revamp the company are still shrouded in mystery. Retail is a bad place to be for gaming with or without public health concerns, and their aspirations to increase their presence online is going to be met with stiff already-existing competition.

I’m approaching you with a qualitative approach in assessing these stocks intentionally, as I believe you have not scrutinized their financial statements or applied any rigorous quantitative means of evaluating the businesses. Where it’s discounted cash flows, P/E, P/S, whatever metric you want to use, they’re blatantly overpriced. 

Tldr; your meme stocks are just memes. This is not a prudent investment, but maybe you can swing a trade and make some money. But that’s gambling."

It could end up being a great investment, but that doesn't make it a good portfolio. A good portfolio has a some diversity in both industry and risk level. Yours is all high-risk, and I guess somewhat industry diverse (but not really)? You also didn't provide any info about when you bought in, so it could either be great, or awful. Considering it's been six months since the initial blowup, and you're still looking for confirmation bias, I'm gonna assume it's closer to bad/awful.

But from a typical investor's standpoint - your portfolio is shit. From a gains standpoint? Who knows. Clearly you, apparently.

First of all, i wasn't aware that /r/stocks was meme-stock averse. That is why i was expecting something other than ""Your portfolio is shit"". I got in right after the first squeze, when the dip was about $40, so i'm not really in the bad/awful category.
