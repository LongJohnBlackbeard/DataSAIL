2021-06-01 18:43:40,wallstreetbets,How much do you anticipate owing in taxes? I’m wondering if the tax implications I have to face short term are worth the constant buying and selling. At some point I want to be able to make enough to set aside for more comfortable long term plays

2021-06-01 18:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Likewise. I find that Yoloing right now works given the hype it’s gotten, but it’s not a good long term strategy"
2021-06-01 18:45:58,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but that's 7 days away so there's potentially some run up still ahead?  Idk tho I'm ass at predicting anything"

2021-06-01 19:19:13,wallstreetbets,"No, they would want it down for the next week :)

Then theyd get more shares

but then yes theyd want it way way way up"
2021-06-01 19:18:08,wallstreetbets,Theoretically quite the opposite lol
2021-06-01 19:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Asking the real questions here lol.

During a daily discussion thread I posted asking everyone to help upvote “boobs” to the top comment so we could literally go “tits up” and then later a mod bestowed upon my this lovely pair of double D’s for my flair"

2021-06-01 17:28:19,wallstreetbets,"I got you, be on the lookout soon"
2021-06-01 19:28:26,wallstreetbets,They do cyber security and another big hack on US industry. So there is a growing need for BB products and services
2021-06-01 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,Uk?
2021-06-01 18:40:27,wallstreetbets,Because its not a cell phone company anymore. They literally make Tesla now and provide Israel’s iron dome. Didn’t you hear?
2021-06-01 18:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Don’t give up hope, BB coming to rescue y’all"
2021-06-01 19:41:01,wallstreetbets,Ill shart for 100 😜🚨

2021-06-01 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,After hours market closes at 8pm. Pre-market opens at 7am.
2021-06-01 19:25:10,wallstreetbets,"after hours bruh, in TD you can choose EXT as a trade time which allows your trades to go through premarket if before open or AH if after close."
2021-06-01 18:12:59,wallstreetbets,True retard
2021-06-01 19:19:02,wallstreetbets,if BB gets to $40 I can put a down payment on a (small) house
2021-06-01 19:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh nice, that was a good move, wonder how high amc will go , it’s shorted pretty intensively right?"
2021-06-01 18:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Good luck fren, I'm rockin 700 shares at 9.50ish avg"

2021-06-01 18:00:33,wallstreetbets,As soon as it hits 14.25 im selling and buying more GME
2021-06-01 18:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes. That’s true. There is some who will sell before me. But most of them will buy BB or buy back AMC when it goes down after the squeeze and will help for another squeeze in 6 months. I think this is a big game and history repeats itself. Look at GMe. It’s back and more predictable now. AMc will be back also I think in 6 months. Also check MVIs and SNDL, all recovering. Some sell early than me but goal is to buy when it dips."
2021-06-01 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,"We as in, my shares. Not group of animals. My shares have personality and they do fuck!"
2021-06-01 17:42:20,wallstreetbets,I’m a bi.  Both Bb and Amc. But more on amc due to current short interest and high option calls.
2021-06-01 18:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Just like when someone calls me a mfer, yes I am 😬"
2021-06-01 18:53:27,wallstreetbets,"so if Palestine keeps yoloing 🚀🚀🚀, bb goes 🚀🚀🚀???"
2021-06-01 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,wow that explains the after hours thx man
2021-06-01 19:04:45,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they are a security company right?

2021-06-01 19:21:27,wallstreetbets,"I had the curve in like 06, the physical board and BB messenger were so amazing back then"
2021-06-01 18:11:46,wallstreetbets,That’s retarded imagine leaving BB gang
2021-06-01 18:33:39,wallstreetbets,":) it works every time until it doesn’t.

I myself am surprised about GME, but I don’t know if anything can quite replicate it.  I bought some BB because I think it probably has some future.  AMC wasn’t that bad of a company before pandemic and will have blow out year to year numbers, I wonder if this will mess up the algorithms.


Anywho I don’t have a point, but good luck out there"
2021-06-01 18:11:12,wallstreetbets,"Kk. Do you, and I wish you luck.  But I really hope people understand that there isn’t a we, and those claiming there is only want to sell before you"
2021-06-01 19:27:56,wallstreetbets,"5d chess by Palestine. Yolo BB and AMC calls to defeat Israeli regime. 

Scientists hate them"
2021-06-01 19:41:55,wallstreetbets,Now palestine has my full support
2021-06-01 18:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Lucky bastard😂

2021-06-01 18:49:11,wallstreetbets,I'm not gonna do an amc this time and sell super early God damnit
2021-06-01 19:30:47,wallstreetbets,"I did the same..sold AMC way way too early. But I'm still down 1500 in one account since January... I got another 200 at 10.50 on us account as well....
May all the holder go to moon . 35+ let's go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-01 19:00:38,wallstreetbets,Only wish I bought more when it was $3
2021-06-01 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,When I saw John Doerr owned 1/3 of Amyris and is his biggest stake I knew this was a good buy and hold long term.  That is some conviction from someone who knows how to pick winners way ahead of the field
2021-06-01 19:56:13,wallstreetbets,"This is a great company with tons of potential, been in about 2k shares since $2.80 holding until $40."
2021-06-01 17:56:45,wallstreetbets,"First things first, I hope you understand we are all, in fact, retarded."
2021-06-01 19:01:44,wallstreetbets,AMC about to hit $38 post market… hmmm
2021-06-01 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,Green dildo or naw
2021-06-01 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Certified autist
2021-06-01 17:34:55,wallstreetbets,Lets go BBnauts!
2021-06-01 19:25:28,wallstreetbets,AMC literally over $39 in after hours as I type this so...you wrong
2021-06-01 16:59:13,wallstreetbets,Umm huh what
2021-06-01 17:18:44,wallstreetbets,GME was cut short when brokers stopped buying. Use Volvo numbers
2021-06-01 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,"BB short interest is way lower compared to even AMC also. So, to the moooonnn, but the rocket needs more fuel."
2021-06-01 17:42:29,wallstreetbets,I THINK HE SAID BUY AMC GUYS!
2021-06-01 18:37:04,wallstreetbets,Blackberries are back on the MENU
2021-06-01 19:41:17,wallstreetbets,"This assumes there was a rational reason behind the   height of GMEs market cap. Given BB has enormous potential in its pipeline, should it not have a higher potential market cap to GME?"
2021-06-01 16:53:54,wallstreetbets,Leave my baby ASO out of your squeeze nonsense.
2021-06-01 18:16:40,wallstreetbets,So youve been trading for 4 months?
2021-06-01 19:46:28,wallstreetbets,AMC hit $38 after hours did it not?
2021-06-01 16:55:05,wallstreetbets,"im too smooth brain for this

is this guy right?"
2021-06-01 19:16:37,wallstreetbets,Closing in on 38 and rising
2021-06-01 19:03:19,wallstreetbets,"OP WE BOUT TO SEE IF U RIGHT OR WRONG
IF IT GOES TO $38.71 
I PAINT UR FACE LIKE TENDY AND FEED U TO MY CHILD"
2021-06-01 18:55:17,wallstreetbets,You wrong
2021-06-01 17:00:17,wallstreetbets,Disagree
2021-06-01 16:58:52,wallstreetbets,Me ape now me mad cuz me thoughted AMC go $1000 a stonk now me want ASO cuz have 2 lil apelets to feed tendy
2021-06-01 18:41:32,wallstreetbets,Have I missed a squeeze forecast on ASO. I hear it's a good buy based on its fundamentals but I will expand my position if we see a squeeze coming.
2021-06-01 17:10:37,wallstreetbets,Can't find ASO stock on etoro 😒
2021-06-01 18:17:53,wallstreetbets,"Even I'm smart enough to know that other relevant factors, like different short interest and different company fundamentals probably make this analysis flawed, and I'm a complete moron."
2021-06-01 16:57:55,wallstreetbets,So when AMC hits 38$ it is time to sell or have I misunderstood?
2021-06-01 17:07:07,wallstreetbets,Me having 50 shares of AMC and a 39c for 6/4 means AMC won’t squeeze and won’t hit $39 or anywhere close this week. Lol sorry
2021-06-01 17:04:29,wallstreetbets,"ASO seems like an actually viable company with a stock price that can be expected to go up for good reason, not due to any sort of Reddit-fueled nonsense."
2021-06-01 17:35:36,wallstreetbets,is ASO actually gonna moon or not?
2021-06-01 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic call out on this one, looking at the impact of share price on Market Cap helps explain the trend we are seeing."
2021-06-01 19:10:59,wallstreetbets,"Weird.   Almost like AMC will hit that price right now in the aftermarket with ZERO shares covered.

Might want to rework the math."
2021-06-01 19:25:14,wallstreetbets,AMC just hit 39. So another false prophet
2021-06-01 17:03:24,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget in order for AMC and BB and ASO to hit your price targets all at once we would need 3x the # of retail investors. Can you provide a calc with spreads equal to the pre-jan 28th #'s? The spread was between gme amc bb Nokia spce bbby sndl and tilray, perhaps the weed stonks were seperate."
2021-06-01 17:02:02,wallstreetbets,So you figure AMC won't gain any more value?
2021-06-01 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,MVIS had returned from the ashes of shorting
2021-06-01 18:51:53,wallstreetbets,sir this is a cadino
2021-06-01 19:22:32,wallstreetbets,He said buy gme
2021-06-01 19:20:58,wallstreetbets,I’m wondering what that means for open market tomorrow
2021-06-01 17:09:26,wallstreetbets,shrek noodle confirmed
2021-06-01 19:58:58,wallstreetbets,See if it stays there for you tomorrow..
2021-06-01 17:36:59,wallstreetbets,That will be a good project tomorrow in-between  loan committee meetings.
2021-06-01 18:37:52,wallstreetbets,We’re going to squeeze your ASO wether you like it or not.
2021-06-01 18:42:22,wallstreetbets,"It's OUR baby now  


apes learn ""sharing"""
2021-06-01 19:43:06,wallstreetbets,"No sir, I have been on here for 4 months probably."
2021-06-01 17:27:59,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-01 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,DIE OP U LIE AND CONVINCE ME BRETHREN TO NOT HOLD NOW U BECOME FOOD FOR MY CHILDREN
2021-06-01 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,why
2021-06-01 17:28:28,wallstreetbets,It can go that high if you remember the short interest
2021-06-01 19:55:43,wallstreetbets,"Of all the stocks, it is the most primed and ready!"
2021-06-01 17:35:17,wallstreetbets,😳 time to change💯
2021-06-01 17:02:35,wallstreetbets,"No, hold till it hits 400 




/s"
2021-06-01 17:13:43,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, all variables the same as GME, it can't go any higher.."
2021-06-01 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,Or sell before that and get into the next one pre-launch. Then repeat
2021-06-01 19:37:29,wallstreetbets,Thoughts now?
2021-06-01 17:07:47,wallstreetbets,Is that academy outdoor sports?
2021-06-01 17:40:57,wallstreetbets,"If reddit got behind it, it will absolutely go nuts. If not, it will still have better growth and earnings than AMC, BB, or GME before any squeeze."
2021-06-01 19:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Nah, aftermarket isn't for retards."
2021-06-01 19:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Dude, why yall believe in aftermarket is beyond me!!!"
2021-06-01 17:14:45,wallstreetbets,It has just a few dollars left in it..
2021-06-01 19:28:38,wallstreetbets,Usually a big drop to open right? Everyone sees high gain and sells.
2021-06-01 18:53:10,wallstreetbets,Bet.
2021-06-01 17:31:52,wallstreetbets,Explains like OP with munbers
2021-06-01 18:17:16,wallstreetbets,But gme hasn’t squeezed yet...
2021-06-01 19:22:40,wallstreetbets,All variables is a bit of an overstatement
2021-06-01 19:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Shorts haven't covered. $40 call options are ridiculous. It's one thing to think it won't break $35-38 over regular hours, but if it breaks $38 in regular hours that is

1) An all-time high
2) Triggering some delta hedging (even before $40)
3) A big psychological level. Massive FOMO.

There's a decent chance we don't make it past 38, and a decent chance that this thing just flies, possibly triggering the start of the short squeeze at $80.

There's basically no chance this stalls out between $38-80 if we see a real break of that."
2021-06-01 17:07:33,wallstreetbets,Maybe a sell at 35/36?
2021-06-01 19:42:55,wallstreetbets,"After hours isn’t shit. When I can sell my option at the $39 price, then we’ll talk lol"
2021-06-01 19:38:15,wallstreetbets,He's a moron.  A true one.  Don't bother asking
2021-06-01 17:17:33,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-01 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,Is AMC in a worse current financial value situation than GME was at this point? I feel like GME also had close to nothing left and the price still surged from the popularity/volume
2021-06-01 19:57:03,wallstreetbets,"Post market may never become reality though. I'm not saying I'm accurate to the penny, but within a dollar or two for sure."
2021-06-01 18:33:06,wallstreetbets,Wake up my friend
2021-06-01 19:25:23,wallstreetbets,This is bot fud. Nothing has squeezed amc and gme are still heavily shorted. Forget the other noise.
2021-06-01 17:08:13,wallstreetbets,I like to live dangerously. So sell at $37.95
2021-06-01 19:43:34,wallstreetbets,I’m a retard what can I say? Everything I’ve ever bought/invested in went to shit. Why would this be any different? 😂
2021-06-01 17:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Financially, they are very similar. The problem is that AMC has like 8 times the shares issued than GME. The more shares of a stock are outstanding, the less it fluctuates when they sell. In short, it is much much harder to get a stock to increase when there are 580 million shares vs. 70 million. True story👍"
2021-06-01 19:36:39,wallstreetbets,To higher prices every day...yes.
2021-06-01 18:08:00,wallstreetbets,"So when the official share count is released after the vote is processed, the number of outstanding shares will be far less, so AMC does technically have potential to mirror GME"
2021-06-01 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen squeeze was about 500%, GME already had a squeeze of around 1500%, although hard to say because unlike most short squeezes in history, it wasn’t instantaneous it was gradual at first jumping 50-70% in price then a squeeze. Please look at some DD from places other than Reddit if you think it’s seriously possible for it to squeeze higher than 1000-1500%"
2021-06-01 19:42:30,wallstreetbets,"No sir, it would have to be off by 390 million..but still a 3.5 times investment return is nice if you got in at 10$.."
2021-06-01 17:48:45,wallstreetbets,Got in under $4 and sold enough today at $42 to take out my original investment.  NIO has been very good to me.  Can't wait til I can buy one here.

2021-06-01 16:59:47,wallstreetbets,I invested in NIO in February and it lost money for months. I finally broken even and got out.
2021-06-01 17:10:02,wallstreetbets,Seems like a really bad time to open a position on this
2021-06-01 19:47:29,wallstreetbets,All these bots
2021-06-01 17:27:44,wallstreetbets,No it’s not
2021-06-01 18:13:00,wallstreetbets,"You can't compare Nio to Tesla.  Once Nio puts a car in orbit in space, then you can use it in the same sentence as Tesla."
2021-06-01 18:14:04,wallstreetbets,Prepare to be diluted into oblivion.  Battery swap is a fail and charging is costing them dearly
2021-06-01 17:28:10,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. NIO is never hitting 500
2021-06-01 18:46:00,wallstreetbets,Trash
2021-06-01 17:42:20,wallstreetbets,Fuck China and fuck Apple. They’re two peas in a pod
2021-06-01 19:03:19,wallstreetbets,You forgot your poms poms

2021-06-01 18:42:05,wallstreetbets,LOL RIP
2021-06-01 18:29:16,wallstreetbets,anybody asked them already if it’s possible to buy with boomercoin or eth? 🦧🐼
2021-06-01 18:27:00,wallstreetbets,They were recently hiring for their HQ in California if that makes you feel any better. Been in NIO since last year 🤠
2021-06-01 17:39:58,wallstreetbets,"I sold, I'm not supporting Chinese companies for various reasons."
2021-06-01 17:27:17,wallstreetbets,"You shouldn't, China is #1 in fraud & scam even when you shop at their stores. I once read they don't mind to rip you off because they will see you once."
2021-06-01 17:12:29,wallstreetbets,the proper nomenclature is you are going to “little people” nio. so rude
2021-06-01 17:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Same here, but I’m staying in. Long term Nio and  xpng will explode. Once they bring cars to Europe or US -> boom"
2021-06-01 17:08:13,wallstreetbets,"That is a shame. Should have held long term. This is China's big chance to enter the global car market, during the transition to electric/renewable energy cars. They will not fuck it up.

Your timing was unfortunate, nothing more. Should have asked yourself why you invested in the first place if a few months changed your mind."
2021-06-01 19:44:53,wallstreetbets,What? They offer charging and BaaS on all models. Charging is part of their revenue.
2021-06-01 19:44:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm the opposite, I try not to support US companies and their capitalists too often, lol."
2021-06-01 18:41:44,wallstreetbets,Especially because of the propaganda you have been feeding by the medias.
2021-06-01 17:55:58,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-01 17:31:06,wallstreetbets,You probably think you’re not racist.
2021-06-01 17:15:13,wallstreetbets,Ima oompa lumpa the shiiit outta nio
2021-06-01 18:15:25,wallstreetbets,With the restrictions on trade coming from Eu and USA I don’t see much success for nio
2021-06-01 19:48:30,wallstreetbets,I support American corporations but this isn’t the place to list all the reasons why. It would basically open the door to uncivil dialogue etc.
2021-06-01 17:56:33,wallstreetbets,Woo dude wtf! Not cool at all.
2021-06-01 18:28:15,wallstreetbets,What was racist that he said? I’m curious.
2021-06-01 19:06:13,wallstreetbets,"You actually for real? How is that racist? ""Made in China"" has been a joke in the western world since globalization took off for real."
2021-06-01 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-01 19:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Hi curious, I'm dad"
2021-06-01 19:24:02,wallstreetbets,"Your iPhone and Macs are made in China, dipshit."
2021-06-01 19:27:51,wallstreetbets,"That's relevant how?

(Apple isn't Chinese, genius)"
2021-06-01 19:35:50,wallstreetbets,"You are really retarded and not the good kind either. Their factories are in China, genius. Every apple phone has a ""Made in China"" sticker on it, dumbass."

2021-06-01 16:55:35,wallstreetbets,AMC is being talks about in wsb. Woah they usually block and ban you for the mentioning of it.
2021-06-01 16:40:42,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised NIO wasn’t mentioned more.. both NIO and BB were being boosts in my portfolio today
2021-06-01 16:40:59,wallstreetbets,BB has been a “long” play for a long time

2021-06-01 18:30:46,wallstreetbets,SNDL is cheap enough for every Ape to appreciate.

2021-06-01 18:31:52,wallstreetbets,$28..thousand.
2021-06-01 17:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Gme has its own sub with more members online than wsb has right now, that's where they are"
2021-06-01 16:58:52,wallstreetbets,"AMC has been on fire and BB got its time in the spotlight, it all makes sense; but what's interesting is that GME talk remained low, even though it had a great move today, as if this is now biz as usual."
2021-06-01 18:51:29,wallstreetbets,“You guys can only talk about the stocks that I want you to talk about 🥺”

2021-06-01 16:57:51,wallstreetbets,Did you actually do some DD on BB ?
2021-06-01 19:47:19,wallstreetbets,I like seeing fewer mentions. Means I'll likely be able to increase my position soon at a lower cost basis before it really takes off again.
2021-06-01 17:13:36,wallstreetbets,WSB are like the friends and relatives that don't care about you but once they find out you have money they want to be your best friend.
2021-06-01 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban.
2021-06-01 18:39:09,wallstreetbets,Only long time in ape time units
2021-06-01 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-01 17:02:15,wallstreetbets,Ofc. Imagine gme is the only stock they really way too much naked shorted. Now they try everything to get gme holder to sell. not 1 mention of DFV tweet today on whole wsb
2021-06-01 16:37:33,wallstreetbets,Good for you. Just sayin its a company that has a bright future. To each their own on amc and gme and bb i know y’all are making good money and im glad for ya. But NIO is legit and has a strong defined path of success ahead IMO. Do your DD but ive been in it since 4 per share
2021-06-01 17:03:01,wallstreetbets,"I got roped in by the convincing DD a few months ago and bought in at $18 like an idiot.

From what I can now tell with this company is.... A catalogue of 20 year old patents potentially for sale thats probably not worth shit.

Has its software in millions of vehicles...in other news winrar is installed on millions of PCs and still isn't worth several billion dollars.

Some other shit that no one in any industry actually cares about"
2021-06-01 19:19:07,wallstreetbets,It’s been many moons in ape years have a tent set up outside to see all of them 🌝
2021-06-01 16:52:48,wallstreetbets,Get off train. Enter the other train. Nio was looking good but it passed. It might come back but right now is not it’s time.
2021-06-01 16:51:19,wallstreetbets,Bro you ever think hmmm maybe I should just buy bb like now? Instead of hating understand I’m tryitn to let you know what sentiment chart and ticker are saying is most talked about. You want to make money with us? Come on. Promise I will buy nio right after bb if it makes the ticker
2021-06-01 17:02:55,wallstreetbets,"Im not hatin’ i thought that post was pretty respectful. I get your point. I think ya might be missing mine. Im just more comfortable investing in companies long term based on their outlook and ACTUAL management performance. Believe me I understand the draw to buying these meme stocks, and if you have enough faith in your ability to analyze short interest and naked shorting good on you . Its just not My game thats all. Yes yall are making good money. I sincerely hope it works out for the majority of holders . But i prefer companies that have management teams that make the stock valuable, instead of looking for over crowded short interest which only exists BECAUSE management abused debt leverage and lacked vision to bring their company into a modern market. Thats all. Listen people are making money , good on you guys! Seriously, thats life changing stuff right there..., the way you do it is also valid. I just think you can’t in good conscience have faith in AMC’s management. Look what the management team did to companies’ balance sheet man. Im not hating you. Im hating on the company. I wish you all the best of luck. Also i think these monster short squeezes are transient and only around in current market conditions, a lot of people in meme stocks arent going to know how to invest their capital in a more nuanced market with less volatility. Thats going to be a problem ...i just like to put my money in the hands of competent teams. Thats all. Good luck to you sir"
2021-06-01 16:16:07,wallstreetbets,take my wife
2021-06-01 18:43:20,wallstreetbets,I'm a little pissed because I burned 50% of my portfolio on MVIS as it did fuck all after I held like a retard at 28. As soon as I accept that I lost on it and start moving on to other investments it starts climbing.

2021-06-01 17:41:32,wallstreetbets,What was your premium on that bitch?

2021-06-01 19:00:20,wallstreetbets,What’s the EPS? Earnings Per Stadium?
2021-06-01 16:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Fuck I was confused at first. Thinking no way a new LA stadium was undervalued. 

But after looking at this DD. Sofi calls at open tomorrow obviously"
2021-06-01 16:08:22,wallstreetbets,Great DD here! Potential upside of SoFi should be double since the stadium is home to TWO NFL teams!
2021-06-01 18:06:23,wallstreetbets,This is the retarded logic that I keep coming back for.
2021-06-01 16:17:16,wallstreetbets,Love it. Buy OTM calls. Got it.
2021-06-01 16:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Nice, calls it is"

Already up 15%.

And yes I agree SoFi will be absolutely massive in the future. In for 5 years minimum."
2021-06-01 19:42:42,wallstreetbets,"1) Read the title (only)
2) Buying calls tomorrow. 
3) ????
4) What can go wrong?"
2021-06-01 19:37:51,wallstreetbets,I spit my wine all over wife’s BF - 10 claps to the Autist who came up with metric
2021-06-01 18:07:09,wallstreetbets,"The real value in SOFI are the WARRANTS today. SoFi trades at $23, warrants are redeemable at $11.50. That means warrants should trade at $11.50, today they trade at $8. That is 40% discount to stock price. Once the SP settles you should see warrants catchup quickly. This is VERY easy arbitrage play."
2021-06-01 16:09:44,wallstreetbets,"Was ready to roast your silly ass, but you stated that this is a stupid way to value a company, so I won’t.

That’s interesting to see tho, thanks"
2021-06-01 19:43:42,wallstreetbets,Isn’t this stock shorted?
2021-06-01 17:06:44,wallstreetbets,What’s the name on the market? SoFi has like 5 listings
2021-06-01 16:11:04,wallstreetbets,*WoKe shirtless selfie has entered the chat*

2021-06-01 16:09:21,wallstreetbets,Oh shit I didn’t even think about that...
2021-06-01 19:55:46,wallstreetbets,I’m YOLO’ing every dollar I have tomorrow into far OTM options because of this
2021-06-01 17:00:10,wallstreetbets,This is not DD

2021-06-01 18:45:35,wallstreetbets,How to buy warrants?

2021-06-01 17:29:42,wallstreetbets,"It's a stupid way to value a company outside r/wallstreetbets, but I'd argue I've seen stupider here."
2021-06-01 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah baby it’s shorted to the moon
2021-06-01 17:52:42,wallstreetbets,SOFI

2021-06-01 17:48:42,wallstreetbets,Actually not a blank check company
2021-06-01 18:10:45,wallstreetbets,it's a joke are you some sort of mentally incapacitated
2021-06-01 17:15:19,wallstreetbets,Fuck that upstart gave me a loan over sofi.

2021-06-01 16:11:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes I was watching SNDL’s order book, there is always a mega buy order of approximately 500K shares supporting $1.00, my only concern is the ceiling, too many sell orders waiting above I guess we will see, I might jump in and buy more LEAPS"
2021-06-01 18:48:19,wallstreetbets,Got in @ .50 call with a 1.00 strike out till the 11... I wanna say
2021-06-01 16:27:26,wallstreetbets,"It’s inevitable, get in while you can 🚀"
2021-06-01 17:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Legalization is going to happen, SNDL Will definitely be a player once that happens. The question is management up to the task ahead. I’ve got a few hundred and I been picking up a few more here and there"
2021-06-01 16:19:42,wallstreetbets,I was hoping it would go back sub $1 so I could grab some more $1 LEAPS. No luck today.
2021-06-01 16:48:20,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-01 18:28:54,wallstreetbets,SNDL is an absolute piece of garbage man. Save yourself and sell and then buyHITI on the NASDAQ tomorrow.

2021-06-01 18:50:08,wallstreetbets,Bluish hue ?
2021-06-01 16:14:51,wallstreetbets,Honestly looks kinda like a high frequency box trade buying the 1$ and selling at 1.02$. Who knows...
2021-06-01 17:58:59,wallstreetbets,"Legalization doesn’t affect the company’s product or value brotha...

I wish they’d already research and start supplying its product to medicine on a large scale. 

They just grow this shet that no business except retail wants.

I wish that their product would have some more value to it that way, we can have some nice fundamental trading going on - Which obviously brings about better technical trading."
2021-06-01 18:34:37,wallstreetbets,IPOs are not my thing my man. Too much insider nonsense.
2021-06-01 16:41:38,wallstreetbets,"Not if you hold up until the point where legalization happens. Then, yeah I highly doubt this could possibly go tits up. Even if it only doubles to two dollars, well I’ll have that sweet, sweet 100% in green crayon."
2021-06-01 17:09:15,wallstreetbets,"My thought is we won’t see SNDL breaking 1.05 this week, I gained some profits from 6/4 $1 and 6/11 $1.5 calls, I think I would bet on 6/25 $1.5 calls, surprised to see those $6 calls written, too bullish!"
2021-06-01 18:12:34,wallstreetbets,"Rnd is so expensive and legalization will definitely help them..... how would it not. 

People order beer from other countries,  weed is gonna be the same"
2021-06-01 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,Actually retarded
2021-06-01 18:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah def crazy some of the ones written today...   


The stair-up continues though into AH. Very strange price action still."
2021-06-01 18:15:56,wallstreetbets,"Then, why not just open a branch over there and grow in that country where it is legal. Instead of being bog down by USA.

I want them to do good. But legalizing the product doesn’t change the product or it’s value as it is currently. See what I mean?

Sure maybe legalizing will draw in some buyers. But I want them to gain institutional investments and money that is invest for like a 3-10yr period.

Not just a slim rally for people to make chump change."
2021-06-01 18:48:37,wallstreetbets,You think I’m retarded for wanting SNDL to be above $1?
2021-06-01 18:45:21,wallstreetbets, 🦧 🦍 🦍 🦍
2021-06-01 18:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Just the part about legalization not affecting value. Should have specified, my bad. Legalizing brings in more buyers of both their product (by supply and demand) and the stock due to volume surges when big headlines come out"
2021-06-01 19:59:56,wallstreetbets,This and also credit card companies will be able to safely process cannabis transactions.
2021-06-01 18:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, at best more buyer but Like I want something to make their freaking value and stock explode 🤯!

I’ll admit it’s a bit vague what I describe yet my sentiment is with the apes 🦍"
2021-06-01 18:18:08,wallstreetbets,"$20 avg for BB since January, you guys have came back to save me much love you autistic fucks"
2021-06-01 18:49:41,wallstreetbets,"All you BB and AMC bastards deserve these tendies. Godspeed. No skin in either, only a lil in GME."
2021-06-01 17:10:10,wallstreetbets,I'm old enough to remember that day when BB hit $28.

2021-06-01 18:40:21,wallstreetbets,Amc 50 bucks baby
2021-06-01 18:42:11,wallstreetbets,"Here is the handbook for making money as an institutional investor:

1. Come in here and comment with a  bunch of rockets attached to specific tickers that people are familiar with on a ""household name"" type understanding. If you are too busy get a programmer to build a bot. It is best if you do so a couple of days in a row and even more profitable if you can do a DD/Technical Analysis on said ticker. It doesn't even matter if what you write has any credibility. Make it bright and shiny with lofty expectations. You just need to plant the seed.
2. When you are ready and the hype/hope is spreading, drive the price up to a double digit percentage gain upon opening. Dangle it for a day or two and really get the hype going. At this point interest will be at an all-time high and the echo chamber will be deafening. 
3. Now here is the important part. Let it tank down to where it was and even a little lower than when you started as this gets people interested even more bc they think they are getting a deal on something they cannot value. This is where you will also get the most profits due to people exploring the options market and gambling with real money. Speaking on valuation of the company, it doesn't matter. Fundamentals do not matter. 
4. Now its on to after hours. This will really pique interest and be beneficial to you as little volume is needed to raise it 3-5%. When the market closes at 4pm, sky rocket that shit and let it mellow, wait an hour and do the same thing. Now dopamine is ripping and they are all aboard the hype train in the AM.
5. Next step involves playing off the after hours from the previous night. When pre market opens raise it even higher. It could be 2-4 percent or 1%, it doesn't matter. When the market opens, you tank that fucking stock and scalp your profits.
6. Rinse and Repeat."

2021-06-01 16:53:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m out here designing houses in a big city. You’d think they’d pay me more. But nope. I get paid shit. 

Found a girl. Stopped paying rent. Throwing my paychecks at the market. So far, after that nasty inflation dip, I’m only break even. 

I hate my job. They’re making me design a house in 2 weeks. It’s bullshit. Mediocre houses at best. I have designed multi-million dollar homes in the past and I’m just totally depressed now. Covid fucked my career. These cunts just want to flip their home. They don’t realize if they doubled the design fee, they could triple the profits. Whatever. 

I’m patiently waiting for the next GME. I sold my GME calls for 200%. I could’ve held for 2000%. Oh well. These things happen every day. Just gotta find the right one."

2021-06-01 19:13:57,wallstreetbets,For those of you pussy apes that do not have the balls to play BB AMC or GME then I could suggest buying in to VIAC and TSM as an undervalued long term play
2021-06-01 19:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hell. I’m still pretty new to options, and I thought I learned a lesson about theta and holding OTM calls too long after the March GME spike. 

This morning I sold one of my two AMC 6/18 36c’s for a small loss because they expire soon and I thought theta was going to keep crushing them. 

This afternoon I sold two of my three BB 7/9 12c’s for a 100% gain when it was at 11.50 because I wanted to make sure I took profits before it tanked again. 

Seeing AMC over 39* and BB over 13 in after hours is fucking bittersweet. Whether I hold my calls til they expire worthless or paper hand I still always lose"

2021-06-01 19:20:31,wallstreetbets,Well I sold my AMC shares to be safe and it shoots up. At least Ford isn’t down yet. So that’s a lot I have going for me. If F hits meme status I’ll be able to quit fucking Target.

So what if they are putting themselves in perilous financial situations for not only themselves but also their loved ones including potentially helpless children and elders?

Only thing holding BB back is a  stupid decade old  grudge. 

Its not about the past, its about the future. Look at Apple, they used to make shitty computers and were down bad before they made phones, headphones, and stylish laptops  or whatever. Now Apple on top of the world.


BB is involved in IoT, Vehicle data platforms, OS software for the cars of the future, and cybersecurity. A lot of these sectors are connected and will play an important part of the future. 

BBs reputation for security is top tier too.


And working with AWS  and Andy Jassy loving them? BB us destuned for the moon. Low teens is a steal, this is easily a $30 stock.

Way undervalued compared to similar companies who trade at huge PE ratios.

And finally,  BB has the same Market cap as NKLA. BB is stupidly undervalued even with it rallying this week"

2021-06-01 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Until the shorts truly give up, cover, and stay the fuck away from AMC, it will keep rising.  Simple as that.  There's too much money waiting to pounce on new shorts.  In this sense, they simply cannot ""win"".

Their black swan is that no matter how high it goes people will keep buying as long as short positions exist.  ""It can't keep going up"" is false and a belief in that will crush anyone that bets on that thinking.

The black swan for longs is if shorts unexpectedly give up en masse for some unforeseen reason (large liquidations? prime brokers margin calls? etc.) and they don't get out in time if the squeeze is very brief."

2021-06-01 17:17:44,wallstreetbets,"I've been part of this sub for years, so I am old-school WSB. I've seen the rise and fall of many memes, and I  am concerned AF about this new ape movement. SHAME ON YOU APE FUCKS for pushing this shit on the vulnerable as a ""get rich quick"" scheme at these prices. People are struggling enough and don't need to be led to slaughter by you bastards.

For those APES who may fomo, here's the bearish argument at these prices:

* AMC has never been more overvalued in its history;
* Movie-going will improve, but the world has changed (streaming, releases direct-to-stream), upgraded home theaters during pandemic). AMC never reached 1B in revenue before, so you're looking at a revenue ceiling;
* Avg analyst rating is just over $5.00... or 80% lower than the price is now.
* Apes are emotionally fused to AMC to the point that they will never sell... but guess what, smart traders, institutions, will sell. Guess who will be left holding the bag?
* The catalyst for today's rise was purportedly Mudrick's big purchase @ 27... yet then he sold for a \~40M profit, called the stock overvalued (which it obviously is), and apes lapped it up
* AMC themselves have stated in filings that buying at these prices is a significant risk if things revert to their previous valuation.
* 500M volume, which admittedly is fucking phenomenal, hasn't driven this thing over $35, so it's not likely to go much higher. Apes would need to sustain and build momentum to attract more buyers than sellers. At 500M volume, that's just not likely to happen. 
* AMC continues to dilute, has stated they will issue stock as necessary, so you aren't whittling down that float unless you recruit half the world's population.

***THIS*** **is the moon**. Those who bought in before last week won the game. DO NOT FOMO INTO THIS SHIT AT THESE PRICES. Caveat Emptor.

EDIT for the idiots DMing me: I don't give AF what you gamble on. This sub is all about gambling. My issue is with the cult mentality. Go to any old thread from WSB and compare/contrast to the ape subs/threads. Tell me that the apecult isn't a real thing. If you guys are smart and have great DD, why downvote dissenting voices to oblivion? Doesn't make much sense, does it?"

But with BB it actually has really good fundamentals and a long term growth value. Atm it has 4.5 billion market cap and with its QNX software for EVs that’s only being implemented now would definitely be a great stock for long term.

2021-06-01 16:42:08,wallstreetbets,Welcome. Be prepared to hold long term and don't get discouraged if we see BB under $10 again in the short term. Major catalysts are the release of QNX and IVY sometime this winter.
2021-06-01 16:22:35,wallstreetbets,Exactly. We can see clearly now! It was the call before GME even blew up. Then robinhood rug pulled it.

2021-06-01 17:01:08,wallstreetbets,The price target for all meme stocks is $420.69. There is more upside in BB.

2021-06-01 18:25:28,wallstreetbets,"GME has/had a bull case though. AMC's bull case is that if they issue 2x the total outstanding shares without dropping the price, they can finally get out of debt. But then they have negative net rev and they're not a growth company, so even with no debt they're still fucked."
2021-06-01 19:46:03,wallstreetbets,Also so many more young people will lose it’ll balance out. Someone has to buy at $30 and $250.

I personally download a lot of the data myself though, and run some custom calculations with python/excel and sometimes matlab even for more advanced regression models.

2021-06-01 15:16:56,wallstreetbets,This is an interesting angle
2021-06-01 15:24:58,wallstreetbets,If you could figure out how to borrow or get a loan in Yuan you could then sell it and buy back at a lower price and you would get to keep the difference but I don't know if thats possible.

2021-06-01 18:40:08,wallstreetbets,There's a guy here who has posted a few updates to his USD short via Yuan so I guess you'd just inverse him.  Find his posts!

2021-06-01 16:34:18,wallstreetbets,"This kind of question is what hedge funds used to be there to answer. They were originally supposed to provide a hedge against all sorts of risks, including inflation/currency devaluation. Now they're just price manipulators trying to decide which companies get to live and which ones don't. 

Forex for currency. Precious metals are always good to hedge against inflation. Platinum and silver are undervalued IMO, but probably not for long (especially silver, with all the attention it's getting)."

2021-06-01 17:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Easy. 

1)Take out loans in various currencies

2) use said loans to buy goods or when not practical futures on goods used to determine inflation

3) When the value of currencies goes down the futures and goods will sell for more of that currency.

4) Use money from sale to pay off loans.

Rich people do this all the time with properties."

2021-06-01 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,Whats the logic behind dollar dipping more? All signs indicate that the Feds are aware of the economic recovery and are going to tighten up the “easy money” policy they are currently on meaning dollar should start rising?!

2021-06-01 16:56:24,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand your logic as to why China would want the yuan to be weak to the dollar for exporting. What? Why would a country’s treasury want their currency to go down in buying power? What

2021-06-01 18:51:26,wallstreetbets,It’s not hard to see dollar will weaken more looking at the White House spending agenda.
2021-06-01 19:49:18,wallstreetbets,"They have been saying this for 12 years. We now have 8 trillion on their balance sheet. When they remove 8 trillion from MBS’s, stop propping up the junk bond market, the repo market (though there is too ouch cash in the repo market today), we see a 70% haircut on the index’s. They are never going to let us return to nominal valuations."
2021-06-01 17:17:53,wallstreetbets,The more the dollar goes down and yuan goes up the more expensive it is for companies to do business with China so they would look somewhere else where currency is worth less kinda the same scenario here in Canada we don't like our dollar higher then the US dollar

2021-06-01 16:11:15,wallstreetbets,Sounds like he should sell because he can't handle it. Holding what you can't handle is literally the worst thing you can do.

2021-06-01 19:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Margin rates really only matter before you get access to portfolio margin. Any broker with support for that will allow you to sell Box Spreads so you only need to pay market rate interest (normally t bill +.2-.5).

Make sure you understand what you are doing and are using Euro style options (SPX) to do this. I've been using TDA mostly for the Think or Swim platform but really any of the classic guys are fine. 

TDA has margin around the same ~9% but I pay less then 1% via this method. It also makes taxes easy since your box spread losses (replacing margin interest) get automatically counted against your capgains so you don't need to do anything fancy to get margin interest off your taxes.


Here is a write up:
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/

Lots of random people who've probably never seen a portfolio margin account gave him shit for the factually post just ignore them.


TLDR: the listed margin rate is for the poors and uninformed"

LNG is in big demand for Europe so this is a good way to get back on track... This contract also helps to keep Russia from having a complete monopoly on NG and blackmailing Europe (that’s my opinion!!!)

“ Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, at about -260° Fahrenheit, for shipping and storage. The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state.”"

2021-06-01 14:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Mudrick already sold them - read the news. In fact, it's a good guess that they shorted as soon as they locked in the purchase price. Easiest money in the world.

This is just the beginning. The CEO is going to dilute this to hell and back through more and more share issuances and sales. Nevermind what he promised the idiots, now is the time to cash in. The CEO is in cahuts with his hedge buddies and they play the meme traders like a fiddle."
2021-06-01 18:49:47,wallstreetbets,"Just saying that Arons said IF we pass the vote for 500 million shares AND the vote was never held SO any plans to without further dilution were moot at that point. 
Also, AMC needed cash on hand and after this and the Wanda sell off they are well positioned to increase their services provided which ultimately increases stock value. I also speculate that these dilutions will help incriminate the make shorters."
2021-06-01 14:40:23,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of that is what sold in the steep dropoff at 12:44.
2021-06-01 19:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Adam Aaron talked about the additional shares that AMC would be releasing this year in his interview with treys trades on YouTube earlier this year. He was very transparent that they had previously approved shares that they would be releasing. The promise to not release shares was if 500m additional shares were approved, which the vote was pulled before the last meeting. This information is not relevant to the stock that was released. The price is up over 20% today, shorts have not been covered, unless new data is released by ortex showing they have, I have not seen any information about that. The 8.5m shares got eaten up quickly, retail buying at crazy levels, volume was 492m today and you are saying 8.5m shares is damaging the squeeze. That's 1.7% of the daily volume,  I don't think we should be overly concerned. AMC wants extra cash for growth opportunities.

Edit: Originally put wrong days volume in"
2021-06-01 17:45:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah all 8 million were sold. Which is a fart in the wind to us apes.  Fud fud fud
2021-06-01 19:35:16,wallstreetbets,"But the 500M shares were never even voted on, they decided they didn’t need them. They already had some previously approved shares that had not been used. I’m guessing these were some of those shares. So this story is a lie please remove it."

As you all say ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"". There is no short squeeze, over 2bil shares traded hands last week alone, there are only 90m shares short... with that much liquidity shorts could have already been margin called and you wouldn't know for another 2 weeks.

Mudrick bought and sold for a nice 40m, AMC got their money with a premium and our share is sitting nicely.

2021-06-01 16:52:34,wallstreetbets,"So there are a couple of things to note I guess. It is not inherently bad for a firm to sell more shares, assuming that the expected value from the additional capital is greater than the dilutive effect. There are a few caveats with AMC, and other stocks which have had run-ups. 

First, is the optics issue. Mudrick pushed for no lockup period, and immediately sold the stock. That is basically egg on the face of management. If it was an institutional investor who took a legitimate long position and held, the sale would look much better. Instead, the sale is basically a huge advertisement for how big players think the stock is overvalued (it probably is, but you don't want to put out a press release saying that). What I bring up in my post also adds to how the optics are bad, even if the firm never technically ""lied""

Second, the fact that the shares made there way to the market so quickly also potentially draws SEC scrutiny. There was a lot of discussion earlier in the year with AMC and GME on how the SEC was paying attention, and something like this is going to make the SEC take a closer look. Basically, one could argue that the fact that Mudrick sold immediately and made a huge profit means that AMC didn't do their due diligence and sold at a price that was too low, basically screwing current shareholders out of the additional cash that could have otherwise been raised. It might also raise concerns that there was some sort of backroom deal. I mean, the fact that they were sold BEFORE the company announced the offering is suspicious to say the least.

Finally, there are two ways for companies to raise money (generally), debt and equity. AMC's debt rating has strengthened considerably, and so debt issuance was a potential way to get cash without any dilutive effect. They also state in their press release that they are looking to make acquisitions. In theory they could have done these acquisitions as stock deals too, and still gotten to make use of their increased equity prices.

Ultimately, I am not trying to make the point that selling additional shares is bad. Rather my point was that we may want to be a bit skeptical of the hype train where executives are involved."
2021-06-01 15:55:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah let's not talk about 1.5 BILLION they've lost since last Monday.

2021-06-01 15:43:15,wallstreetbets,"no, no, no

The purchase price was 3% above the Friday close. That does not mean they bought them on Friday.

Noone from Mudrick or the company has said WHEN they actually bought them. If they bought them Thursday for instance, depending on the time, they could have bought them far lower than the market price at the time. In fact, all direct sales happen at lower than market-price (why would anyone buy higher? just buy at the market...besides, as Aaron said the dilution was minimal so buying at market price wouldn't have affected the share anyways, right?? can't be one way but not the other)

Also, since Mudrick sold the shares right after they bought them (that's what they said - Bloomberg article), it's not a stretch to say that they negotiated a lower-than-market price precisely to flip them. They have not disclosed the timings of the purchase or sale, but given that the company was in communication with the CEO to organize all this, and Mudrick explicitly stated they made a profit on it, then it goes without saying that Aaron screwed his investors."

2021-06-01 19:01:25,wallstreetbets,"There's no need for it to be illegal. There's already a check and balance for this: the stock market.

If a company is diluting shares and clearly exiting their own business for quick cash, then investors should not invest in the stock.

It's really that simple. It doesn't make sense to say ""well I want to like AMC so it should be illegal for AMC to suck!""

At any other time in the stock markets history, AMC's moves would crash their stock, and that would be that. But this whole ""ape"" thing has made everything wonky and has allowed big corporations and hedge funds to basically do whatever the fuck they want, because there's an endless stream of dumb money."

2021-06-01 18:55:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean.....who do you think is responsible for driving the share price higher on news of dilution? 

Might want to take a look in the mirror on that one. Mudrick (correctly) guessed that this move would incite retail, driving share price higher on the news (when asset pricing theory states that share price most certrainly should go down), giving them an easy opportunity to exit their position. 

They bore a fuckton of risk (of the market behaving rationally, diluting price per share, and would be holding the AMC bag to the tune of $27/share), bore that risk (albeit for a short period of time), and they were compensated for it. That's how finance works."

2021-06-01 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,Everytime I get close to being drawn in the CEO dilutes the shares and reminds me that not all meme stocks are created equal.
2021-06-01 15:25:50,wallstreetbets,"Same.  I told my friends that went all in to not get too greedy because when it crashes it will crash hard; & they do not care about their investors.  Unlike GME, AMC is not fully reinvesting in the company or paying down debt, instead they are giving huge exec bonuses & diluting shares.  They are shady AF"
2021-06-01 16:11:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah I sold my $1k worth of amc at a 10% loss for that reason. It still stings a bit but I don’t think I was unjustified in being worried that the AMC ceo was greedy and didn’t care about the retail investors except for profiting off them as much as he could.
2021-06-01 17:26:55,wallstreetbets,Why? The conversation isn't about them
2021-06-01 17:23:58,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you've been here before ...

But if you look at outstanding shares, it used to be like 120M, now it’s 450M in a matter of months... I think he’s just buy himself better bonuses 

I have been holding them since Jan, prob gonna sell sooon idk how much higher this will go, especially if the CEO dilutes at every chance he gets

2021-06-01 17:42:13,wallstreetbets,"You're allowed to buy shares directly from the company and then sell them.

If half the people here now put any thought into it, the news would have caused the share price to go down (or stay steady), not go up. *Typically* announcing that you'll be diluting investors' shares doesn't cause a stock price to go *up*, so I can't imagine it would be easy to try to claim that it's a P&D.

It's basically just arbitrage, really: buy directly from the company for cheap and then sell on the market for way more."
2021-06-01 16:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Shady, I guess, in that he is a liar.  

But from a business standpoint, this is exactly what he should have done.  The business has more debt than assets, it makes a lot of sense to raise capital through sale of equities, if people are willing to pay for them.  He's not concerned about your short squeeze or whatever, he's just happy to play the part, so that the business can survive.

I dont think people realize how much AMC is dancing on the razor's edge.  They are not just a meme stock, they're a business that is still in deep shit after the pandemic."
2021-06-01 17:22:30,wallstreetbets,I’m still holding. I don’t have problem holding with my cost basis. But that’s it.

2021-06-01 19:37:11,wallstreetbets,I just don't like the stock as much :/
2021-06-01 17:52:04,wallstreetbets,"1.7% isnt much of a dilution, but purchasing shares at a premium to spread M&A / positive news to boost share price so you can dump the shares... hmmm..."
2021-06-01 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Correct, but they do still make questionable business decisions with the $ they’ve recently made in hopes that retail investors will continue to rally for them & keep them afloat.  While this may have started to “save them”, lets be honest that most people jumped in because they thought they would get rich.  Technically, AMC should be bankrupt by now.  I don’t think a short squeeze is even possible if they continue dilution, which they’ve done several times since this started.  If it happens then great for everyone who believed in it but I just don’t see it ever getting there with this one🤷🏻‍♀️"
2021-06-01 17:26:07,wallstreetbets,I just didn’t believe in the stock. Amc as a business has an uncertain future with people becoming more and more apt to elect streaming services over seeing a movie in person. That with the CEO liquidating shares multiple times really made me think I was looking at a sub 6$ stock eventually. So as soon as it came close to $12 again in March/April I dipped out. I bought gme and still am holding though. But glad for the others that amc is working out
2021-06-01 18:04:50,wallstreetbets,Also amc now has enough $ to last for a year or two if you recall. So why not. Meme stock push it higher. I don’t have issue holding my low cost basis shares. But no all in. I’m not adding a single share
2021-06-01 19:24:15,wallstreetbets,Clearly I do.
2021-06-01 16:13:36,wallstreetbets,I'm not in friend. I don't own any AMC shares. I'm good.
2021-06-01 14:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Some of these folks forget the object is to make money. I'm al about some ""common cause"" ventures (GME), but at the end of the day we are here to make money so we can hopefully live a more fulfilling life."
2021-06-01 17:54:51,wallstreetbets,I'm not following though. How is it positive news for investors? The only way I can see it being positive here is if they did it to avoid bankruptcy but they've already used up that excuse this year.
2021-06-01 16:50:36,wallstreetbets,"It's appropriate for the business to pay down debt so they can operate in a stronger financial position going forward. If we are just hyping up the stock to profit and upset that AMC is taking necessary steps to survive, then we are no different from short sellers. Invest in AMC for the turnaround potential. 

Why would anyone think there could be a short squeeze on this stock with the amount of shares trading though? I'm in it for profit of course but for the long term."
2021-06-01 16:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Oh i agree 100%, I'm not really disagreeing.  It's good for the business, but in the way that is not helpful to investors.  It literally makes their shares worth less.  This is a company with negative book value and a sunsetting business model, with no strategic plan to become more relevant."
2021-06-01 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,I don’t think movie theaters will go away completely —- doesn’t mean I think amc is doing good. And I don’t go against the trend like the current one. But I won’t go all in.
2021-06-01 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,Great move to be honest. Never hold anything for the short term that you wouldn't feel comfortable holding for the long term. You will save yourself a lot of losses this way.
2021-06-01 16:17:21,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know you, but I’m glad you’re good brother!"
2021-06-01 17:01:19,wallstreetbets,They will probably be taken over by Disney and show only Disney movies. Each AMC will be a mini Disneyland with characters and video games
2021-06-01 17:54:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah I could see that happening.  Or Amazon.  They're a pretty cheap acquisition target once the price settles down.
2021-06-01 19:28:06,wallstreetbets,Not easy as it would fall foul of the vertical integration constraints imposed during the breakup of the Studio System https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system.  The other majors would likely be able to challenge a Disney purchase of AMC.
2021-06-01 19:49:00,wallstreetbets,Last year in October that was repealed.

2021-06-01 13:32:09,wallstreetbets,"It's not going to the moon in the sense that term is used, their IPO was in December and they hit over 200 during the pandemic. Sure it's a good buy probably maybe a great one, but you aren't going to make 1000% profit buying into ABNB at $140 at least not for many years with good execution on the company side. 

We only do dumb ape shit here."
2021-06-01 13:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Already in on this, it was definitely hit by covid and in no way has it made its recovery yet"
2021-06-01 13:46:17,wallstreetbets,"ABNB has alot to gain in the next year, seems like a great price point. Earnings could be a bit more solid though, they pretty much need to see consistent improvement every quarter."
2021-06-01 13:59:14,wallstreetbets,"I think it’ll have some good earnings reports the next few quarters. Economic recovery + a pent-up desire to travel = good news for the travel industry for a few quarters.

But that’s some r/investing bullshit, I’ll see you all in the FD line"
2021-06-01 18:40:48,wallstreetbets,Yes it is 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-01 13:42:33,wallstreetbets,"I think by this time next year ( if there are no new pandemic issues ) this stock could double. Dependent though on ... no new Covid strains, no economic hiccups like a stock market crash / terrorist event etc."
2021-06-01 13:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Airbnb got the same issues Uber and etc have. Scammers and criminals are learning to game the system. People are renting spaces that look like great deals that end up being foreclosure or eviction properties and having vacations ruined or interrupted when they arrive. Properties aren’t the same as the pictures (one photo showed a apartment that had an extra window that didn’t exist in the unit they ended up in!) Airbnb tells you to “work it out with the host” first but if the host doesn’t respond and you spend a night there you suddenly don’t qualify for a full refund. It takes hours or days to sometimes get someone who will do more than “we’ll escalate and get back to you” and then they get off shift and you never hear from them again.

The internet is full of Airbnb horror stories and you can find shell companies run literally by convicted felons who are renting/buying properties with staged photos who take your money and run leaving a property in foreclosure or eviction (apartments that don’t allow short term rentals) and for you to sort out the mess with Airbnb.

Airbnb isn’t the second coming of Tesla. They’re going to run out of investment capital if they keep having to eat costs and refunds for hosts that cheat their customer base. Treat Airbnb investment like Uber, there’s potential, but a massive number of issues under the surface threatening their business model that aren’t adequately addressed today."

2021-06-01 14:39:46,wallstreetbets,mods ban this podcast promoting trash
2021-06-01 18:00:14,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people are increasingly disillusioned with the product. I actually disagree that AirBnB can kill hotel business at this point, especially now that so many ridiculous fees get tacked on the price of an AirBnB. If anything, AirBnB is the worse value, because you often get little to nothing in the way of amenities and service (and despite obscene cleaning fees, many AirBnbs expect you to clean up after yourself). A lot of people would rather stay at a hotel and actually get service and amenities instead of just a place to stay if the price is going to end up more or less the same.  I know I would, and I travel a lot. 

Not to mention all the creepy/obnoxious shit you have to deal with when it comes to AirBnB - weird hosts, cameras/lack of privacy, insane restrictions on what you can or cannot do...

Also, we don't care about your podcast/self promotion."
2021-06-01 17:12:23,wallstreetbets,"How about no…fuck AirBNB. It’s a shit company with shit service that is no longer a good alternative to hotels or resorts. 

Also, promote your podcast elsewhere. Nobody cares. You deserve a ban for that."
2021-06-01 18:05:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah $ABNB is going to skyrocket. Here's the reasoning:

* People have been cooped-up forever and the vaccination plan is cooking along swimmingly. 

* Anyone who can afford to rent another house/apartment will do so out of just *being sick of starting at the inside of their present one*.

* It's safer to rent an AirBnB than stay at a hotel.

* Summer is starting and after a solid year of working from home people are desperate to get a real vacation (and also anyone with a job has probably saved a good deal of money from not eating out, commuting to work, etc. so they have the cash to go to a really *nice* AirBnB)."
2021-06-01 17:52:12,wallstreetbets,"I think the bnb market, while still in its infancy, has limitless upside. Real estate prices won’t go down long term, and it’s a ridiculously convenient product."
2021-06-01 15:04:52,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s trash and will be shorted into the ground."
2021-06-01 16:04:51,wallstreetbets,Look at $abnb revenue and market cap. Now look at $hlt revenue and market cap
2021-06-01 18:13:00,wallstreetbets,No there is no inventory.  Been trying to book in California and there is no ABNB inventory
2021-06-01 14:44:35,wallstreetbets,You truly belong on WSB
2021-06-01 16:47:30,wallstreetbets,Is there a publicly held hotel chain that is only in the USA & is remotely similar to AMC or GME? ‘Cause that’s what I’d throw cash at
2021-06-01 18:08:03,wallstreetbets,I think/hope post covid that working vacations become a thing e.g. take a month off from your snowy middle of nowhere to go and work on your laptop in a cheap Thailand apartment sipping coconuts for a month. If so then I would expect Airbnb to be the main winner and tbh I think they are too massive to be taken down. So I've also been looking at getting in.
2021-06-01 18:32:42,wallstreetbets,In some countries like Germany you cannot rent your apartment in big cities like Berlin or Munich. So the business model of AirBnB doesn’t work here. It’s kind of the same situation as with UBER. You need a special driver license and a lot of other permits and don’t get me started on all the regulations in Germany. So in Germany the AirBnB business model is in a kind of a grey area and the AirBnb experience is also a mixed bag. Sometimes it’s fine but you’ll often get a better hotel room for the same price.

2021-06-01 16:13:27,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say it's a great buy. Any time, one of the many countries they operate in can legislate them out of existance. Boom, an entire country's worth of marketshare gone.

And they don't even do anything or own anything. They are a broker. Another app comes along and does what they do even seemingly better, they're gone, again."
2021-06-01 14:48:21,wallstreetbets,agreed. I like it as a long term play - I don't come to WSB for long term plays.
2021-06-01 19:46:26,wallstreetbets,"There's also the massive problem of the impact AirBnBs have on neighborhoods. Rentals are bad enough, but nobody likes the revolving door of potentially shitty neighbors who just want to party and ruin quality of life for everyone else. Plenty of areas are implementing increasingly restrictive policies against these kinds of properties."
2021-06-01 16:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Not going to lie - I was on the AirBnB train until these last two weeks when I used them. The first time the host didn't give the right address and we were in a rough area. The second time was over Memorial Day weekend when our host cancelled on us the day we arrived. Both times, AirBnb was garbage at helping. We would have literally been better off begging random people for housing with how little they helped us. 

Fees are now outrageous, they're significantly less reliable and there is no consistency in experience / service. It makes more sense to stay in hotels at this point. Additionally, with the housing supply completely wiped out right now, cities will start cracking down."
2021-06-01 18:01:24,wallstreetbets,All of this.
2021-06-01 16:15:10,wallstreetbets,"Locals don't like airnbn. If I could, I'd kick them out of the country."
2021-06-01 14:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what? 1) How is what you described an actual issue in terms of the company’s long term viability, and 2) that most certainly is nothing like Uber’s issues

I don’t doubt that what you describe with ABNB has/is happening (there has been reports of that for years, as long as the company has existed), but there is no chance that it’s impacting the share price of an $80B+ company.

Uber’s problem is literally just money, whether or not they can ever be profitable while paying their drivers enough money/benefits without having to charge customers too much."
2021-06-01 14:45:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure that problem exists but I think you're blowing it way out of proportion. I did an entire trip through Europe booking only Airbnbs. They have a feature to limit the searches by ""Superhost"" and you'll feel like you were scammed. They also do ""verified identity"" and you can legit just look at reviews."

2021-06-01 19:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Pent up demand was alleviated last summer when infection rates dipped. Anyone who could travel did. This year is more about a return to normalcy. 

Also, there was plenty of consumer spending last year, it was just redirected so it's not like people are sitting on mountains of cash. Hell, car sales were a lot stronger than expected and that's with people not having to commute to an office."

2021-06-01 17:42:12,wallstreetbets,"reputation of the company is what drives repeat business and revenue, profit for hosts also guarantees quality of properties available. BOTH are threatened by the  ""race to the bottom"" driven by unethical and sometimes downright criminal hosts who are taking advantage of airbnb's lack or inability to police their own platform. similar to what happened to ebay, at some point, reputable hosts will abandon the platform as service fees and cost competition make it unprofitable to be a ""good host"" without compromising profit or quality.  uber has this same issue, driver and car quality are on a race to the bottom as people realize that uber doesn't pay well enough to justify using their nice vehicle and their time to be good drivers, instead you get garbage cars and bad drivers."
2021-06-01 17:43:36,wallstreetbets,"when we use airbnb we also use superhost only, BUT the non-superhost properties vastly outnumber superhost, and if you're price shopping the non-superhost properties are going to be much cheaper. non-savvy users don't know this or are gambling. i don't think i'm blowing anything out of proportion, do some searches on airbnb complaints."

2021-06-01 14:49:53,wallstreetbets,And your point is?
2021-06-01 17:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Both of your info is incredibly wrong. If you want to know how a bank is doing go to Google type the bank name and then type in investor relations. From the March 31 2021 quarterly report on the balance sheet gs has 1.302 trillion of assets and 1.204 trillion of liabilities. Also AUM/AUS does not belong to the bank/shareholders it belongs to the banks client. All that ""trading"" you hear about is the bank trading/investing on behalf of it's clients. They list AUS as 2.2 Trillion. For context MS has AUM of 5.6 trillion and BLK has AUM of 9 trillion. Furthermore notional values are never to be used as an actual at risk number because actual at risk number is always a fraction. Example: you buy an option contract of xyz for 5.00 (x100 multiplier) at $100 strike. You get leverage of 100 shares of xyz.  100 shares of xyz gives you $10, 000 of xyz stock. Is your risk $10, 000? No, your risk is the cost of that contract  which is only $500. Big banks will be growing healthily for the next 7-10 years"

Jpm, BAC, Citi, GS, MS, COF will all continue to grow and take market share for cyclical and secular reasons. These banks are healthier than ever before, only people ignorant of the fundamentals say otherwise"
2021-06-01 15:10:39,wallstreetbets,It’s always only ever been about the money. I could care less about how many people GS has fucked over if they make me money. You must be new around here.
2021-06-01 12:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes BBrother. 11,000 points for Gryffindor"
2021-06-01 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,🅱️🅱️
2021-06-01 15:42:33,wallstreetbets,Still holding over 100 shares here and happy to have diamond handed through this with my faith in BB apes. Wish I would have bought options on it last week when I wanted to.
2021-06-01 14:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Me and my 3,400 shares + June 18 calls are watching with great interest"

Congrats on the comeback!"
2021-06-01 17:49:59,wallstreetbets,"Been holding @ 12.74 avg. in the negative, this afternoon is the first time I've been in the green for total return since February 13th. Praise be!"

2021-06-01 19:02:02,wallstreetbets,I bought shares at $24 😭😭 I started to lose hope when it dropped to 7 something but I don’t got bitch hands I’m holding this shit till I make atleast 1k😂😂
2021-06-01 16:58:50,wallstreetbets,I just bought my first call options today on BB. It's working so well I'm afraid risk any more on it!
2021-06-01 19:14:16,wallstreetbets,"[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/BB](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/BB)

So on 5/27 Over 2m shares were shorted. The next day they covered those shares at open, causing a $2 spike in price. Today 2.3m shares were shorted and they did NOT cover those shares throughout the day. After hours is crushing them. BB calls were dirt cheap, $20 calls were $.2. This could short squeeze and gamma squeeze into the stratosphere."
2021-06-01 13:30:54,wallstreetbets,Legggo team got you back

2021-06-01 15:26:59,wallstreetbets,"I sold 20 $11c 6/18 contracts, my average buy in was $13 I think I'm boutta get boned"
2021-06-01 15:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Strike is at $11, market price at $11.21, cost of contract is $0.0136 per share? I don't see how these numbers work.

I'm guessing you're holding shares and the call is just a small part? I'm still an apeling"
2021-06-01 16:11:28,wallstreetbets,"You came in like a wrecking ball man, respect!"

2021-06-01 17:58:42,wallstreetbets,"I've never done calls before, I bought 1 long call 12.5c Jan 23rd for the hell of it.

Still down -$70. Do these values not update till market open, or because my call has such a long expiration date does it have less gains?

Just trying to figure out wtf to do with this call when the time comes. I'd like to just sell it for profit."
2021-06-01 18:30:21,wallstreetbets,Nice goal on overtime!

2021-06-01 16:59:22,wallstreetbets,"fuck, if this happens, may the APE GODS bless you and help to pay off any debt, mortgage, and live a debt free, positive income lifestyle."
2021-06-01 17:55:50,wallstreetbets,By 6/25 or 6/28 is a better target. Today is a T+35 FTD day which is why all the “meme” stocks are up today.
2021-06-01 17:00:29,wallstreetbets,based on what
2021-06-01 19:03:52,wallstreetbets,I read this in Cardi B’s voice
2021-06-01 19:50:00,wallstreetbets,"Damnit, if it hits that I’m going to have an extremely hard time not selling. I haven’t seen a positive number in my portfolio since the first time I bought a stock, it’d just to too good to be true."

2021-06-01 14:17:43,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry I was down 40% at one point and had to avg down. Have faith or cut losses quick
2021-06-01 17:12:16,wallstreetbets,This is a phrase I needed to learn about 3 months before I learnt it.

2021-06-01 14:23:40,wallstreetbets,Staying on for options platform. Everything else I agree gtfo lol
2021-06-01 14:22:30,wallstreetbets,Must have faith to avg down like I had to do.
2021-06-01 17:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes and BB to, both undervalued"
2021-06-01 18:18:43,wallstreetbets,People here really are brain dead still using robinhood and downvoting you?! Lmfao
2021-06-01 13:24:24,wallstreetbets,I like it for options user interface compared to my other platforms
2021-06-01 15:52:07,wallstreetbets,Its based off my avg option premium vs what the option premium is currently selling for (in this pic its selling for $1.36. I bought avg around 68 cents
2021-06-01 17:51:05,wallstreetbets,Nope its at $13 now :)
2021-06-01 19:56:49,wallstreetbets,Lol ya

2021-06-01 19:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Youtube how to enable options on robinhood, its free to do"
2021-06-01 15:47:08,wallstreetbets,what was the contract price?
2021-06-01 19:19:19,wallstreetbets,"We'll be waiting to see that porn. It's porn enough for me to see green on $BB, this is like 35% of one of my portfolios and it's been down 30%+ for the last few months."
2021-06-01 17:29:34,wallstreetbets,God damn I would love this. Been holding $14 6/18 calls for a while.
2021-06-01 18:19:31,wallstreetbets,So they covered them all today?
2021-06-01 17:09:36,wallstreetbets,the stock was trading higher than AMC for a while. AMC ran up to 36. The news is saying BB is trending more than AMC now.
2021-06-01 18:24:53,wallstreetbets,based on the fact that anything below $140 is a dip
2021-06-01 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,EOWWWWWW
2021-06-01 19:52:16,wallstreetbets,It's hard to be optimistic. I am clinically depressed as it is.
2021-06-01 14:24:05,wallstreetbets,I held but didn’t double down. Mostly because I’m neck deep in TMO. Will probably sell it and join the apes soon.
2021-06-01 14:37:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-01 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,6/25
2021-06-01 14:20:28,wallstreetbets,It's in plain sight in smaller text
2021-06-01 15:46:35,wallstreetbets,🦍 🚀 🌝
2021-06-01 12:55:41,wallstreetbets,"I would compare it to wkhs, not fundamentally sound since their earnings reports always expose the issues they have, but potential is good if ev sector continues upward trend. Both worth 1.1B mkt cap making them good value if there are more catalysts"
2021-06-01 15:32:36,wallstreetbets,My advice to you is buy $BB
2021-06-01 13:06:42,wallstreetbets,Would guide you to WPP now only way it is going is 🆙⬆️🚀💎🙌🏻🚀🚀🦧🦍🦍🦍
2021-06-01 17:23:35,wallstreetbets,I needed this confirmation bias. Thank you. Holding strong!
2021-06-01 17:15:59,wallstreetbets,And this is how you go broke...
2021-06-01 17:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Too many AMC, BB, GMC. 
Too many we might not have enough Amo😬"
2021-06-01 17:18:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe we should just focus on 2 sticks the most???
2021-06-01 16:22:47,wallstreetbets,So from those 100 options you're getting unrealized profits of $1.36-$0.68 times 100? or is that per share per contract?
2021-06-01 17:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get me wrong im the first to celebrate bb going up. Just saying every time I get out of the gulag, 30secs and I’m dead again."
2021-06-01 19:58:16,wallstreetbets,~0.67 when I loaded up on them
2021-06-01 18:28:20,wallstreetbets,The theory so far is that they’re hiding their massive short interest in deep OTM puts so about every 35 calendar days after option expiry there’s a forced buy in on failed to delivers. And every 21 trading days there’s a forced buy in on FTDs from shorts as well. Essentially they’re adding to their short position while kicking the can down the road. The T+35 and T+21 were back to back last week which combined with fomo caused the huge push we saw. Next T+21 is 6/24-6/25. This puts us on an overall upward trend line where shorts r fukd
2021-06-01 17:17:45,wallstreetbets,"Because it used to be higher than a different meme stock, and now it's trending again, therefore the company will triple in value from $5.5B to $16.5B... Don't you think that's a bit silly for your justification? Any DD or analysis at all? Why $35? why not 50? or 100? Sounds like just throwing out random numbers

I own 1800 shares atm but I'm not making any baseless claims like ""$35 EOW"" which just sounds to me like hype/manipulation.  Feel free to correct me"
2021-06-01 15:56:55,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-01 14:34:59,wallstreetbets,He’s not talking to OP
2021-06-01 16:20:56,wallstreetbets,Truly retarded
2021-06-01 17:31:16,wallstreetbets,"fool, you know where you are at?"
2021-06-01 17:19:14,wallstreetbets,Amc and bb are the top 2 most talked about stocks on wsb right now. I chose BB because amc took off without me. Not missing BB!
2021-06-01 17:04:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah each contract you buy is 100x so at $1.36 premium its really $136 per contract you buy. 

Share price is irrelevant in calculating. Where shareprice matters on calls is that it must go up for your call option premiums to go up. The pricier the stock price the pricier the call premium"
2021-06-01 17:25:09,wallstreetbets,$12.47 now :)
2021-06-01 18:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Hence the $1,000,000 per share."
2021-06-01 18:40:04,wallstreetbets,"AH is up on BB, GME, and AMC. \*edit maybe not GME"
2021-06-01 18:34:33,wallstreetbets,So.. would the next t+35 be July 6th? Or July 20th?
2021-06-01 17:25:57,wallstreetbets,You know what subreddit you are on right? Take that shit on over to r/investing
2021-06-01 17:31:33,wallstreetbets,I live in AZ and gas prices are almost 3X higher in some parts of CA. Silly? In some ways.

2021-06-01 17:32:10,wallstreetbets,You could've clicked on my profile to know that I do. Some of us like being rich 😂😂😂
2021-06-01 19:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Technically it should happen every week since options expire every friday, so if the theory holds up then 6/8-6/9. The buying pressure isn’t equal though. Last week’s was a big one because it was the T+35 following the 4/16 expiry where a shit ton of their puts expired OTM."

2021-06-01 17:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you must be one of the new breed of WSB'ers who just yell ""$1M/share floor!!!"".  There was a time when people here would at least have some sort of base for their outlandish claims."
2021-06-01 17:43:32,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing though, it's not silly if you back it up.  Using your example, CA has extremely high gasoline taxes (almost $1 per gallon) plus a bunch of other regulations that drives up the cost. So if that was your justification then I would agree with you."

2021-06-01 17:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino, please sit down and place your bets"
2021-06-01 17:58:41,wallstreetbets,"True, but what I did not mention is that it isn't even uniform throughout the whole state. Some cities in CA are even higher than others."
2021-06-01 18:03:35,wallstreetbets,"i am sure he knew what DD is, we just don't practice that here. We operate on a frothy mixture of hype, fomo, self immolation, and bad choices."

2021-06-01 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,This used to be a casino full of card counters. Now its just tourists.
2021-06-01 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,"You sir are an ape the other sir has evolved into something that WSB is not used to. Please continue to throw your shit through cracks in the cage and scream bloody murder you glorious monkey! I love you WSB gorillas with no thought, just action. I envy this. I eat too many crayons"
2021-06-01 18:37:44,wallstreetbets,usually there used to be at least SOME DD mixed into the hype/memes/fomo/etc.
2021-06-01 18:10:46,wallstreetbets,Any real card counter will tell you tourists are an important part of his strategy.
2021-06-01 17:43:21,wallstreetbets,"I like that analogy, I respect good DD and only really throw down on a likely sure thing... I only invest what I can lose, unlike some people here lmao"
2021-06-01 17:53:07,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, the tourists love to buy FDs, and I love to sell them.  Kinda win-win."
2021-06-01 18:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Why it is useless with the stocks discussed here. Just think, I am riding a dead Smartphone OEM stock to 200% gains, after riding a dying a movie theater's stock to 500% gain .... lol. If I want true DD, I can find it here. then do the exact opposite of it, and come out ahead, lol"
2021-06-01 19:57:27,wallstreetbets,"This stock has a positive EPS. So actually by your logic, it must not be going anywhere."
2021-06-01 12:54:11,wallstreetbets,You shorted 750 shares at 13s? Why would you do that?!?!

2021-06-01 17:11:01,wallstreetbets,-131% 😂
2021-06-01 15:33:20,wallstreetbets,What do we learn from this post? An ape can hold a short position with a 131% loss. It is safe to assume Citadel can also hold. Especially when they can continue to sell infinite stock with the blessing from the SEC...
2021-06-01 18:13:44,wallstreetbets,Bro what is u doin
2021-06-01 18:27:26,wallstreetbets,hes trying to start the short squeeze himself

Like, wtf would you do if it shot to $100? You would owe like $80k LOL"
2021-06-01 18:16:59,wallstreetbets,I'm cumming

2021-06-01 13:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Man buy a call, hedge and wait it out"
2021-06-01 13:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Stop quitting you APES, get these short sellers, we can push it further the more we stick together!  Lets put WSB on their radar so they know we're still here!"
2021-06-01 15:29:00,wallstreetbets,Why are you guys mad at him? To buy puts you still have to buy the stock. Also we like losses.
2021-06-01 12:34:33,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-01 14:00:27,wallstreetbets,Trying to call tops eh. Didnt want to hedge with a call either lol

2021-06-01 16:23:00,wallstreetbets,That is a game that shouldn't have been played.
2021-06-01 17:00:37,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-01 17:22:33,wallstreetbets,Gotta remember these apes will be retarded longer than you can be solvent. 😉

2021-06-01 18:21:21,wallstreetbets,Sell the reverse dip.
2021-06-01 18:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Why didn't you just buy a PUT?  That would have been a lot cheaper, and have a similar reward...if AMC went down."
2021-06-01 18:33:03,wallstreetbets,"\*Bonk!  

Now what have you learned?"
2021-06-01 18:41:24,wallstreetbets,"Eh just sit on it, will come back around eventually. I'm sitting on -2000 shares @ $10 lol.

PS. I learned the hard way also never short, only buy puts. Lesson learned. :)"
2021-06-01 18:54:06,wallstreetbets,“May lose money” 😤😤😤
2021-06-01 19:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, why would you short a meme stock with hundreds of shares and not buy at least a few calls to protect against a wild run up? Would have cost all of a few hundred bucks to have insurance against thousands of dollars in losses"
2021-06-01 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-01 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,You are a true retard. Better get out before you go bankrupt. AMC will only go higher
2021-06-01 17:54:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly what happens when ape fights fellow ape. The goal should be to fight together.
2021-06-01 13:14:24,wallstreetbets,Read the caption

2021-06-01 19:49:56,wallstreetbets,At this point he's gotta conserve electricity.
2021-06-01 19:41:57,wallstreetbets,lol. I thought that was my phone. I am damn retarded.
2021-06-01 19:12:15,wallstreetbets,They can't.  They need the cable to hang themself.
2021-06-01 17:28:49,wallstreetbets,I wish I bought more.
2021-06-01 15:18:32,wallstreetbets,32 and then moon!
2021-06-01 19:30:21,wallstreetbets,"A half intelligent person would protect that risk by buying cheap calls. If OP shorted 700 shares, and bought 7 calls on a down day for cheap with a strike at, say, $14, OP could have dramatically limited their downside in the event of a meme stock mooning. 


Also, could just not be retarded enough to short a meme stock that’s been popular on wsb for months."
2021-06-01 12:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Looks like a short sale. IE he borrowed the stock and sold it. So as it goes up in price, his loss increases because he needs to buy back the stock to repay from whoever he borrowed it from"
2021-06-01 12:47:34,wallstreetbets,"If he made puts on the stock then he deserves to be crushed like all the other hedge funds

2021-06-01 16:30:52,wallstreetbets,At least you didn't hit the infinity button and got out.
2021-06-01 15:47:20,wallstreetbets,It must have fallen over onto its side
2021-06-01 15:26:51,wallstreetbets,So puts makes you bad now? Holy fuck I hate this cult-like shit.
2021-06-01 15:01:38,wallstreetbets,"Get outta here with that fuck shit, this sub used to be about making money"
2021-06-01 17:26:42,wallstreetbets,I’m dead 😂
2021-06-01 15:26:58,wallstreetbets,"Why? Deep OTM calls + IV spike in case of an even bigger short squeeze will help him not get margin called and ride it out until the AMC saga is over and it falls back down to the 3-4$ range

Its definitely not too late lol"
2021-06-01 16:53:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah OP is clearly not ready to be a HF manager
2021-06-01 16:27:05,wallstreetbets,"More like it fell on its back and broke it, thus the m having no backbone to show. B = m"
2021-06-01 15:38:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean, entering uncovered puts definitely makes you bad. He should have had calls for say $15 in order to limit his losses (or whatever price where he was willing to lose that much). 

Plus, if he had properly hedged, he could have post BOTH gain and loss posts."
2021-06-01 17:23:51,wallstreetbets,Why make pennies when you can make millies
2021-06-01 16:30:40,wallstreetbets,"Wanting a company to fail for the sake of profit is kind of bad, in terms of good verse bad. We should all want every company to succeed. Bet on success."
2021-06-01 18:22:47,wallstreetbets,Still fits here tho
2021-06-01 16:13:05,wallstreetbets,How the fuck are naked puts bad
2021-06-01 19:25:31,wallstreetbets,Why make when you can lose
2021-06-01 16:39:32,wallstreetbets,You can expect a company to fail and bet on that but not want it to. Obviously you want to be right but you're literally just placing a bet.
2021-06-01 16:23:43,wallstreetbets,Because there are a lot of new people here who don't have a clue how any of this works.
2021-06-01 16:53:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh I understand that, but it makes more sense in a perfect world to bet for every company to succeed and that they do succeed. That’s all I was getting at, and I know there’s no way that is possible in this hell hole of a place. (I know peoples ideas can be stupid, their management may be lacking, etc etc.) It would be pretty interesting though, stonks only go up, right?"
2021-06-01 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,That alone cannot make something bad. “Your ignorance is OUR undoing!”
2021-06-01 16:30:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah no shit. This sub is just a meme stock cult now. pUtS aRe BaD
2021-06-01 17:19:41,wallstreetbets,"Except the world is not perfect and there are many companies that take advantage of their retail investors like credit cards. Companies that do this do not deserve success and should be drilled into the fucking ground.

If the above 5 adjectives describe a company best believe I'm taking a short position for free scrilla."
2021-06-01 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,That’s better logic than the hedge funds use. I like it.

2021-06-01 14:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing, I've like what, quadrupled my money I think now? I wouldn't even know what to do with it if I did sell. 

I'd look at the cash and be like, well shit, I should buy some GME/AMC/BB"
2021-06-01 14:41:28,wallstreetbets,"Nope, only have 10 shares so I really don’t have much to lose"
2021-06-01 14:49:21,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t bag hold since January just to break even,  to the moon and beyond!"
2021-06-01 14:48:19,wallstreetbets,my wife’s boyfriend said i’m not allowed
2021-06-01 15:12:25,wallstreetbets,Just a reminder BB hit $28 in January because of short sellers bailing. Don't bail before they do lol
2021-06-01 14:24:17,wallstreetbets,"I do plan to sell, but only when I am making 6 figures off it, considering I only have 10 shares at $174. May take awhile."
2021-06-01 13:04:37,wallstreetbets,"Fuck short sellers, apes stronger🦍"
2021-06-01 13:17:59,wallstreetbets,"I think I'm gonna go with fuck yourself for today

Also I may go with calls on BB"

2021-06-01 14:51:55,wallstreetbets,The two instructions provided to the Apes are very simple. 1. Buy 2. Hold.
2021-06-01 15:13:58,wallstreetbets,Selling today? Did it hit $500k a share?

2021-06-01 12:58:38,wallstreetbets,Are we Apes or do we have paper hands?! Where is AMC or are you apes going to let the short sellers win?
2021-06-01 14:14:32,wallstreetbets,I try to use this line anytime I get the chance. Which is very rare so I fuck it up with a shit eating grin when i do say it. God i love this movie. I also flinch a little everytime I'm in an elevator and the doors open

2021-06-01 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,I placed an order over the weekend for AMC.  AMC sold shares to Mudrick.  Price shot up and my order was still pending at 10am.  Cancelled.  Not gonna make me wait until it’s maxed out for the day so they could sell and make a quick profit off me.  I’ll wait for them to go back to shorting and then buy.

2021-06-01 17:56:43,wallstreetbets,"But really though you could put it in a total market fund. I threw all of my money in a Vanguard total market etf right before the Pandemic and after the dip it grew by about 25% not counting my personal investments. It's not risk free since it just follows the market in general but after the pandemic dip I can safely say it's pretty good at bouncing back at a profit. It's pretty much the best way to make money completely hands off.

Edit - why all the downvotes? I have what I think is a very strong reason to believe their sales will be way down. Looking at their expenses and having a significant drop in sales after major growth, their profits will go way down and perhaps they will have a loss. Not saying they are not a good company or that they will not grow the business, but the current price is based on assumptions of retail traders that sales will remain high as they were this past year, which clearly seems factually incorrect."

2021-06-01 18:49:40,wallstreetbets,I sold mine today too when it started dropping.  Made a small profit.  I know some people say to keep with it but I’m not seeing a lot of good reasons to right now.

2021-06-01 19:13:20,wallstreetbets,👎
2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Okay you fucking apes here's why you need to buy SPCE All right you fucks **SPCE** is dipping and here's why you need to buy it now. I'm going to lay this out for you.

First of all the stock went to **SIXTY FUCKING US DOLLARS in February** based on two key factors: speculative hype regarding a successful test flight, and Cathie Wood's ARKX fund buying up massive amounts of shares. Let's forget about the test flight for a second and focus on Cathie Wood.

Well Cathie DIDN'T tell you was that she was also loading up on SPCE shorts. Check out that short interest buildup in Q4 and early Q1.

So Cathie Wood et al load up on shorts, then manipulate SPCE all the way down to its fucking 52 week low of $14. Delays on the test flights and a bad earnings call don't help.

https://preview.redd.it/u39wyzkl5o271.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6846668b16da51b8c8b3d7e31f1aac022f82bc9

In a classic buy high sell low move that I know you fucking apes can appreciate, Cathie proceeded to slowly sell off over 600,000 shares at lower and lower prices, breaking through retail buywalls and costing ETF investors as well as Robinhood cucks a shit ton of money.

Now with the stock this low, it's a rocket set to take off. Everyone saw it. It was all over WSB last week and the week before. Then of course we get the successful test flight, a little bit of media buy-in, and boom the stock jumps over 100% in a week.

Well guess what you fucking morons the test flight was successful and the stock **IS STILL BELOW 30.**

We also just had a very healthy **20% correction**.

Oh and the short interest is up to **33%**

What does this mean, apes?

**It means if you fucking buy and hold SPCE this shit will shoot into orbit and hang there for approximately 60 seconds at apogee and you can experience ZERO GRAVITY GAINS**

**BUY THE DIP.**

We have room to go all the way up to ATH and MORE. Remember, this stock is in uncharted territory now. We have a successful test flight. Branson flight is coming up soon.

Fucking buy the spaceship stock, thanks."

2021-06-01 11:59:16,wallstreetbets,Fuck it im all in. I see the potential at this point i missed out on the first test launch but didnt it just got listed on moex? And i think branson is gonna try and beat blue origins july 7th date. If he does im rich if not im broke either way i believe in branson after the hot air balloon thing so fuck it.

2021-06-01 11:57:01,wallstreetbets,Something no one on this sub seems to get is that massive gain causing squeezes don't just happen. Yall seem not to realize that GME(which also did not just happen) is not normal and that's why so many people made so much money on it. Virgin Galactic has done fuck all in the last decade and their big hurrah is getting a funky plane to fly. They are not going to be making money anytime soon and there is no news I am aware of coming up that will generate enough hype to get a price hike going to start the squeeze. The institutions will do whatever they can to keep a stock they have shorted from rising. What exactly is changing in the next few weeks or months that is going to motivate SPCE  rocketing up enough to get the shorts to rush to cover?

2021-06-01 12:09:25,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying that the stock won't moon. But am I understanding that you are banking a huge gain on Richard Branson flying in Unity in July? The stock doubled and stayed up because it's previous valuation was due to the last major test flight SPCE resulting in the destruction of the prototype and the death of one of the pilots. They transitioned from 

A company who wants to send people into space but the last time they tried someone died and the plane blew up.

To

A company who wants to send people into space and has tested a really pretty plane that didn't blow up. 

Their current valuation is based on the fact that they have done nothing but successfully test one plane. They are a very long way from performing the hundreds of flights annually they envision

This is, at best, a long play. You may see jumps based on hype but the value of the company as a whole is not going up until they demonstrate progress towards actually having a commercially viable product."

2021-06-01 12:53:58,wallstreetbets,I read a similar comment guffawing at a user who said this about GME back in 2019...
2021-06-01 11:44:32,wallstreetbets,"This stock has such a small cap for what it can do. Imagine sales in 2025

Went from 14 to 35 on one test flight

PREPARE FOR LAUNCH"
2021-06-01 12:09:27,wallstreetbets,It's a joke
2021-06-01 12:22:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking for a mid term play, factoring in 33% short interest I think we just need one good news item (successful Branson flight, for example) to pop this baby. Sell in July."
2021-06-01 13:39:47,wallstreetbets,Realistically if branson does do a flight himself the price is definitely gonna fly. There wasnt many factors causing the price to 60 bucks. It just listed on moex today branson will be on that flight in the next month or so and once that happens they can announce a time for the start of commercial flights. This stock is bubbling right now but will pop in the next month or so.
2021-06-01 12:31:11,wallstreetbets,I resent that remark and fully support at 7 of my half Thai children.
2021-06-01 12:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Where’s the proof that Cathie Woods is short SPCE? Also, just because SPCE was $60, does not indicate it will go higher. You included really nothing fundamentally to support your thesis claiming it will “moon”. By that claim, tulips should be mooning since they were at all time highs in 1630. Everybody buy tulips before they explode. /s"
2021-06-01 12:25:30,wallstreetbets,I doubt that.... The admiration of DFV is felt amongst many.
2021-06-01 14:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Personally, against the general sentiment on this sub, I do not believe in AMC. I understand why people invested in it beforehand as restrictions for the whole pandemic was winding down a bit and AMC could open back up and start generating revenue again. But let’s be honest here, AMC still isn’t making more money than they did pre-pandemic, and yet they’re valued higher now? It doesn’t make sense to me.

That being said, it is now a meme stock. It will be worth whichever side wins and that is completely unpredictable in my book. Either not enough people buy and hold and the shorts push it down, or enough people buy and hold and the shorts have to cover. I applaud people that make money off of the shorts, but I won’t be gambling any of my money on it. 

Best advice I can give you when investing in a meme stock: invest only what you can afford to lose. Plenty of people have learned this the hard way..."
2021-06-01 12:18:53,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck are they even going to launch enough people in one quarter to match their current burn rate? Show me proof they can rapidly reuse their hardware, and I’ll look at buying back in. 

The surest bet right now? Puts after Branson flies."
2021-06-01 12:06:49,wallstreetbets,Dead stock
2021-06-01 12:18:28,wallstreetbets,Like your dd
2021-06-01 12:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a reasonable play, but it's a he'll of a lot riskier for someone who gets in now. Stock could stay flat or drop a bit and you'd walk out with 100% profit. Someone who gets in now needs that spike to make anything at all and I personally don't see it as a good investment. That being said, I could not understand wtf happened with GME until after the fact so you do you."
2021-06-01 12:28:47,wallstreetbets,"I think his point is that one positive news story is not going to make this thing squeeze. Counterpoint to your argument with Branson: Plenty of businesses have positive earnings calls and then you see their stocks plummet. Ever hear of buy the rumor, sell the news?

I think your reasoning is pretty fast and pretty loose, but I do agree SPCE is cheap rn if anyone wants a long play."
2021-06-01 14:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Nah they still need FAA approval and in reality, there is no precedence for commercial spaceflight. There will likely be regulatory mazes that need to get worked through. Additionally, you assume that the flight is going to succeed."
2021-06-01 14:06:20,wallstreetbets,Damn you must be my Thai papi that was only half there
2021-06-01 12:07:16,wallstreetbets,Do tulips have a test flight with their founder coming up in July? Do tulips have massive expectation of profit while being valuated based on 0 profit? Do tulips have a tiny market cap relative to their industry?
2021-06-01 12:21:03,wallstreetbets,"You said it yourself though, puts AFTER he flies. Until he flies its calls calls calls"
2021-06-01 15:13:40,wallstreetbets,Theyve been working on this for 10 years. I think theyre figured out how they will approach faa approval and IF the flight succeeds it will be massive. I feel as though it will and of course am wishful thinking on that.

2021-06-01 12:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Again, your giving just words with no fundamental insight. Can SPCE be a replacement for flour or onion?

Edit: provide proof Cathie Woods is short. You can’t make a claim without valid proof."

You’ll also have to call your brokerage and request the cover sheet. Plus now even if the stock change happens you’ll get screwed because you won’t have ownership of your shares. 

After you get all that done call your brokerage again and tell them you want your stocks back in your name not under the street name. You’ll need to fill out a Form 714 and have that ready to send to them beforehand. Hope that helps"

2021-06-01 18:48:02,wallstreetbets,Yes sir
2021-06-01 16:50:02,wallstreetbets,I don’t think there is going to be significant downward pressure. That’s just me though. Anything could happen. If they get the bank charter we will go up way more.
2021-06-01 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree that warrants get a price advantage. This is especially true if you plan on exercising. I don’t like warrants because:

1. They don’t help the stock price move. In case of calls the mms need to buy stocks before they sell us calls. ( not exactly)
2. The price difference always exists. Calls update immediately.
3. There are too many strings attached and we need to be on top of all the information."
2021-06-01 19:15:09,wallstreetbets,So true!
2021-06-01 17:44:18,wallstreetbets,Yup. Should fly soon
2021-06-01 18:12:08,wallstreetbets,Sofi will buy me so many bagels
2021-06-01 14:59:05,wallstreetbets,Amen. I hope this gets some traction. A shorted stock with great fundamentals is dangerous.I have about 250 contracts in play.
2021-06-01 19:06:05,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-06-01 16:04:03,wallstreetbets,I like money. Sofi=money
2021-06-01 16:29:24,wallstreetbets,[Here's a good reason...](https://i.imgur.com/jxBm07w.png)
2021-06-01 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,This was not on Sofi
2021-06-01 18:44:20,wallstreetbets,"I had the same problem with my TD acct early in the morning. Later on I then saw I had the option to buy call//puts. 

I chickened out at the last minute to buy five 1-month calls at strike $25. lol"
2021-06-01 10:50:43,wallstreetbets,great arguement..
2021-06-01 18:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Look at me, I’m the boss now"
2021-06-01 14:56:22,wallstreetbets,What makes them awesome?
2021-06-01 12:51:42,wallstreetbets,Still not too late.
2021-06-01 12:33:00,wallstreetbets,Same. But at the same time the more I read about SPACs the more I chickened out. Plenty of growth for SoFi in the future. Choices choices choices lol
2021-06-01 19:48:26,wallstreetbets,Got 10/15 calls at 15$ strike that I bought at 2.17$
2021-06-01 15:12:20,wallstreetbets,Great idea!
2021-06-01 16:08:17,wallstreetbets,I hope she doesn't....the shorts are after her right now.
2021-06-01 12:51:02,wallstreetbets,Agreed!
2021-06-01 17:18:55,wallstreetbets,"Pot, meet Kettle."
2021-06-01 17:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that is true, I hope they let option trading be a thing soon.  I also want to buy more Sofi shares on my next paycheck.  :)"
2021-06-01 12:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Ya. I think spacs were frowned upon here

But now that it’s no longer a spac...

It fits the wsb meme criteria so well

* anti robinhood play

* tons of “short interest” (although short squeeze very unlikely)

Granted independently of that it’s a great long term investment on its own merits. Which is why I have LEAPs and shares and am long. Could easily see SQ like growth 

But if it were to become a meme stonk in* the short term I certainly wouldn’t complain..."
2021-06-01 14:04:49,wallstreetbets,Volume is low because not all platforms van trade it yet. I own shares at $16 but can't sell them today on my platform. I Believe the short position is not as large as it seems though since I think some pipe investors has cashed out their long shares by shorting and will be flat once the lockup period is over. Some spacs allow for this I understand.
2021-06-01 18:46:07,wallstreetbets,I am debating to do it 1 month out or Oct/Jan.
2021-06-01 14:08:46,wallstreetbets,"SoFi is so strong. Anthony Noto in combination with Clay Wilkes of Galileo, this is a company diversified in the FinTech area. There are so many positive catalysts— bank charter and Galileo expansion into South America are the biggest currently."
2021-06-01 11:04:44,wallstreetbets,Thx Chamath
2021-06-01 13:13:11,wallstreetbets,Despacd today.
2021-06-01 18:54:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks meng
2021-06-01 16:58:57,wallstreetbets,"For sure. Agreed on only term hold for sure. That said, 80m float PLUS 120m of pipe shares, which are ALREADY up 100%+, might lead to some sell off. We’ll see. Would love to get in again."
2021-06-01 19:02:16,wallstreetbets,"agreed on all accounts, this is just a short term arb opportunity as I suspect the warrants will catchup to the SP."
2021-06-01 15:05:26,wallstreetbets,I plan on holding the stocks for a long time and I hope the calls cover the cost of my stocks and taxes. That’s the plan. I have more calls in my fid account. But fid is broken today for SOFI.
2021-06-01 16:07:26,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe you like money, too."
2021-06-01 17:13:23,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what you mean, when it says SoFi $17 call"
2021-06-01 15:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Everything. Rates, customer service, ease of UI portal, ease of applying and closing. I have literally every loan with them. They have my student loan refi, my wife's student loan refi, my primary mortgage, and a couple of my investment property mortgages."
2021-06-01 15:35:07,wallstreetbets,My student loan rate is 6.1% lower than my previous fed loan albeit I am more aggressive in my repayment now.
2021-06-01 16:26:00,wallstreetbets,what do u think of all the fintech competition that faces Sofi tho including companies like Square who are starting to add more banking type functionality. What is your price target on Sofi?
2021-06-01 13:21:56,wallstreetbets,Let it hit 15$ again and ill put my  whole again in Sofi
2021-06-01 13:07:34,wallstreetbets,"SPACs are only as good as the company the merge with. 

SoFi is the best company that has SPACed so far, it's certainly no GOEV, lol"
2021-06-01 16:12:05,wallstreetbets,We will go up regardless.
2021-06-01 17:38:08,wallstreetbets,Can’t go wrong at these prices
2021-06-01 13:14:21,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-01 14:08:15,wallstreetbets,I hear this a lot but I don’t see why the pipe investors would want to pay 260 percent interest to short this. Either way there should be a lot of buys coming in soon.
2021-06-01 18:56:01,wallstreetbets,What's the cost difference? Could do a little of each
2021-06-01 14:09:54,wallstreetbets,Agreed! Sofi is going to be huge in 5 years.
2021-06-01 11:05:51,wallstreetbets,"He is long gone, this is Anthony Noto's baby now."
2021-06-01 19:02:50,wallstreetbets,Got you
2021-06-01 16:26:43,wallstreetbets,"but what about all the fintech competition including power houses like Square? Square I believe has a lot of new banking type functionality recently released or to be released. 

BTW, are there interest rates better thank other options with regards to your investment property mortgages? I have an investment property too but used more traditional financing."
2021-06-01 19:57:11,wallstreetbets,You have multiple investment properties and two student loans that you’re repaying? Tf? Sounds like a financial disaster waiting to happen.
2021-06-01 19:46:59,wallstreetbets,"I have a student loan refi at 5% with sofi; and I completed a debt consolidation loan with them; got nothing bad to say about them.

5000 shares long at 18 average + some call options."
2021-06-01 16:41:54,wallstreetbets,It should trade at 27 to 30 for now. I am going to be in it for the long run. Easy 100 plus in 5 years.
2021-06-01 13:25:08,wallstreetbets,I hope it doesn’t go that low again. Will hold either way
2021-06-01 13:58:38,wallstreetbets,"I think SPAC’s are only as good as the deal. It’s important to pick good management that has experience in making deals come together. Chinh Chu and UTZ is a great example. Bill Ackman has my cash, hoping for a huge elephant"
2021-06-01 14:10:28,wallstreetbets,Hmm.. true. Honestly I don't see why anyone would pay that much to short this. It seems like a solid play.
2021-06-01 15:51:26,wallstreetbets,I just joined this community in January. I have 500 shares of SOFI at $18 average. I am thinking about selling call contracts. I am curious...are you buying calls for 1 month out? I am still debating about writing a call but I am not sure for 1 month or until Jan 2022.
2021-06-01 16:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Sofi might have first money advantage in this area.  Get people hooked in for life to use their services.  Since the target is 20s and 30s, that is a long tailwind."
2021-06-01 17:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I shopped the fuck out of these loans, and they were 100% the best market rates.

Edit: I saved .25% on APR and 50% of fees vs. Rocket by going with SOFI. I even looked at strong local lenders like thirsty community banks and credit unions, and SOFI did better."
2021-06-01 17:17:46,wallstreetbets,and what about the competition? Why do you think Sofi will beat all the fintech competition?
2021-06-01 14:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Bill has the other 75% of mine. I hated to diversify away from him, but I couldn't miss SoFi"
2021-06-01 14:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Just a random theory, maybe the shorts all have calls and want to propel this to the moon anyway. Complete  speculation here."
2021-06-01 16:07:26,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure you will regret writing calls at these prices. I am waiting for it to hit 30 before I even consider writing calls on my position. Your call though. I am in it for the long run.
2021-06-01 17:56:15,wallstreetbets,"interesting, what's your rate? I currently have a good one at 3.85 but i feel like it probably has been even lower than that at times in the last few months? Any point in me looking at re-financing thru sofi in ur opinion?"
2021-06-01 17:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Think about it this was. They are famous for student loans. They get 10s of thousands of people signing up each year for loans. All these kids open up the Sofi money account, just because they have a loan, when they want to invest, there is Sofi invest for you, when it’s time to get a car or a house Sofi right there. They offer very good rates if not the best. I don’t even want to get started on Galileo."
2021-06-01 14:12:54,wallstreetbets,"😂 both are strong positions, but Pershing is definitely more speculative. Take a peek at PRPB, It’s like a baby Pershing with a better entry point"
2021-06-01 18:24:46,wallstreetbets,"I mean, my rate won't be your rate. Different loans.  My last close was 30 year 2.85%. 

Edit: If you are at 3.85% the costs will likely make you break even at best. You do you, but I wouldn't pay the cost of a refi at 3.85%. I think rates ticked up since my clast close too, but if you are interested, it's certainly worth investigating."
2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Palantard no more (June 2021 capitulation) 
2021-06-01 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be lame, hold these bags with us until 2044. They will break even about then."
2021-06-01 09:23:03,wallstreetbets,"If you bought too much, buy more"
2021-06-01 10:55:53,wallstreetbets,I must admit this has held up better than I was expecting.  Figured this would be about $14 a share by now.  Then I thought the ten year bond would be close to 2%. Waiting and watching.
2021-06-01 10:48:17,wallstreetbets,so.. calls on PLTR?

2021-06-01 15:01:50,wallstreetbets,Karp reminds my of Steve Madden. Specifically when he started selling stock immediately after an IPO lmao. It’s free money. Putting money in PLTR isn’t even retarded. I think of it as a bigger shit stain than SNDL. But who am I? Some of you dumbs fucks keep pouring money into that as well. Godspeed
2021-06-01 15:45:42,wallstreetbets,Thanks for selling me your shares!

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$OPEN - House selling, Stocks buying? [Warning, bad Londen in post] Ok, I'll do a DD without too much text, numbers we want!

**$OPEN** sells houses. Simple.They got hit hard by the pandemic and had to cut 30% of the people. Right now they are recovering, growing and gaining marktet share. I don't want to do much of a TA, don't feel like i'm spot on with thise things. But I do recognize a company what's worth the investment!

You can see that they had a loss of revenue and profit but they acctually managed to get a **better ratio of revenue/profit**. (2019 was 6%, 2020 was 9%)

&#x200B;

[32&#37; free float, not bad.](https://preview.redd.it/6gtg4fqfdn271.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa328f9a384b5fb5f4c0c88d656e81d83d2e4cf)

The last 3 months $OPEN dropped big, from $35 to $15. The last 2 weeks it has been stabilizing with some days om small greens and a few small red days.

[Interval = 1D](https://preview.redd.it/4n7phug6fn271.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b0a90df1eaf099e9d8339323179dd24dafdddc4)

If you look at the bigger picture you could also say that there is a -chance- for a cup forming since 4/20 (hihi) **wich indicates it can go back up to $20 this month.**

*""In early 2020, Opendoor expanded services to more cities in partnership with Redfin. Later, the company laid off 600 employees, which made up 35% of its team, partially due to business impact from the Covid shutdown.""*

So let's say in 2020 they had 1800 people working at $OPEN, that was in the beginning of 2021 somewhat around 1200. The amount of vacancies right now is around 200, this ain't that much **but it indicates that there is grow** again.

If you don't agree, please tell me why **$OPEN** is shit."

Houses selling way over market and quickly, so little to no reason to sell to OPEN.  Hard to see how they can improve market share and revenue like that."

One hour ago, with the Memorial Day weekend now in the rearview mirror, we got the answer: it was indeed the latter, with the company announcing the sale of another 8.5 million AMC shares (this followed just three weeks after the company raised $428MM in share) to Mudrick Capital at a price of about $27.12 each. The offering price was, strangely enough, a premium to Friday's close of $26.12 and suggests that Mudrick is now also in on the joke, and is hoping to buy more stock at a higher price while squeezing shorts in the process boosting his existing holdings"

But retail needs to see this for what it is. They don't give a fuck about you and this could backfire for them as people start waking up or there are millions holding bags.

Not a financial advisor and never advice, but AMC isn't worth it unless you day trade call options. GME understands they would be nowhere without retail. And that their new business model will go nowhere if they betray what got them here. AMC has the general populace that will still go to the movies perhaps and they know they can fuck with the people that got them here with impunity."
2021-06-01 13:21:37,wallstreetbets,"At this point if y’all think AMC is still the play, y’all out of y’all mind. While retails are promoting this, suits, executive, and board members are profiting from selling shares and diluting the stock more"

AMC getting a cash injection of $200m+ is also clearly bullish.  Concerns of dilution are just FUD.  Even if it was dilution it is 2% so discount that you mofos.

2021-06-01 11:12:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm certain this has all ready been discussed but I doubt AMC's management would sell directly to a HF to cover their shorts.

&#x200B;

They sold to a long HF and this is bullish news.  It's dilution but it's dilution to an interested party that wants to see the company succeed.  So they got a mint of shares without placing a block trade on the open market and AMC got cash."
2021-06-01 11:13:02,wallstreetbets,Still surprising to see amc as high as it is with that level of sell off. Way too many questions with this market right now.
2021-06-01 11:18:06,wallstreetbets,What I can't wrap my head around is who in their right mind shorts a movie theater stock right before covid restrictions are lifted!?!? What if this is a trap to short the stock once the squeezers inflate the value?? Lol...

2021-06-01 08:49:27,wallstreetbets,"If AMC raises a trillion dollars and diluted the shares to $4 a share, this would be a good thing because AMC would have a trillion dollars and survive for decades. People need to stop complaining. Amc should do what is best for survival of the brand and company. Your greed is selfish of if all you care about is your money instead if the company and the employees that work there. If all you care about is money and don't care if AMC survives in 10 years, what makes you different from wall street? Dilution is good if it means a better chance of survival. If your stock goes to $1 and AMC survives for a hundred years by raising capital and dilution, isn't that better than your stock going to the moon and AMC bankrupts in a year without raising capital?

So what if some shorts somehow buy shares from AMC to cover.  The long game is AMC has funds to help survive.  Stop being selfish."

2021-06-01 13:05:46,wallstreetbets,Interestingly the big red candle at 9:44am corresponded precisely with the release of Money Stuff (the very popular Bloomberg newsletter) in which Levine suggests that this is exactly what happened.

Another at the market offering from AMC would have been better IMO. Now AMC will buy some more theaters and we will moon anyways. Stay focused 🦍

Edit: I’ve done further DD and found out that the deal has been signed in late December 2020 already. Mudrick sold for a quick cash grab now but they helped AMC with equity debt back then. Still very suspicious that Mudrick is partly owned by Kenny G. Adam Aron needs to address this topic soon. Hold 🦧"

2021-06-01 18:51:24,wallstreetbets,I cancelled my order.  I knew that was the game when it wasn’t processed shortly after market opened .  I wasn’t letting that fuck get my money.

2021-06-01 17:26:16,wallstreetbets,That’s a definite FACT!!!

2021-06-01 14:14:11,wallstreetbets,Shit profit tbh for a hedge fund and now muddy dick is not only getting his own hedge fund shit on (-13% rn) but he’ll also face death threats and harassment for the rest of his life. $AMC 🚀
2021-06-01 15:59:46,wallstreetbets,"Why do you people keep posting lies. “theater chain sold more than 8 million shares to Mudrick Capital Management. AMC said in a securities filing that it raised $230.5 million through the stock sale and would use those funds for potential acquisitions, upgrading its theaters and deleveraging its balance sheet. Mudrick also invested in AMC in December.”"
2021-06-01 13:39:47,wallstreetbets,"Ordinarily selling your own stock to raise capital causes a price decrease because it dilutes existing shares and presumably says something about the poor condition of the balance sheet that the company can't find debt at a reasonable price. This was conventional wisdom basically since the beginning of investing.

But now some cases like what we saw with Tesla last (?) year, ""growth"" stocks (hate that term tbh but best I can think of right now) selling into a strong market to raise capital can paradoxically lead to price increases. Probably there are a lot of reasons for this but it is a source of essentially cost free capital for the company and if investors really believe the stock is on a hot streak and has smart projects to fund with the capital it can be seen as an intelligent move by management which boosts confidence in things being bullish."
2021-06-01 12:17:01,wallstreetbets,Naked shorts just got 8.5 million chances to cover.
2021-06-01 14:30:56,wallstreetbets,"MUDS is a SPAC to take Topps public. That stock movement is not because investors in Mudrick Capital ""are not impressed"" by them flipping a ton of AMC shares for a profit.

Just a heads up so you know what you are actually buying with those calls."
2021-06-01 13:59:16,wallstreetbets,"It is just to get around ATM regs and since the shares went up after the sale, I bet Murdick already bailed and took their profit. Very risky play though."
2021-06-01 12:40:10,wallstreetbets,"It makes perfect sense that a capital company would inject capital into a business to help the business grow (providing funds for AMC to purchase closed theaters from other companies in this case). If all goes according to plan, AMC revenue/profits grow with the new properties and Mudrick then owns all those shares that will have likely increased in value at which point they can sell at a profit (just like all the rest of us shareholders). This is literally the business model of private equity companies like Mudrick Capital.

Edit: Aaaand Mudrick already sold for the profit. AMC got cash, Mudrick made money, share price has surged for us all. Sounds like a win for everybody right now."
2021-06-01 18:13:57,wallstreetbets,"There is no wait time for a company with an ISDA master agreement. 

Yes they flipped it.

No they didn't turn a profit.

2021-06-01 11:08:35,wallstreetbets,"So, explain to me what I'm missing here. AMC is near an all-time high for a stock price while shareholder dilution is also at a high. Combine this with one of the most challenging market conditions both macroeconomic and socioeconomic. Kudos to you guys for being able to be so bullish despite all this. I guess it's all about the short squeeze."

2021-06-01 11:27:05,wallstreetbets,It's the second time this go around. They also diluted the shit out of it in december and january. Like 450%
2021-06-01 08:33:24,wallstreetbets,They’re diluting the market at a ATH and a very large investment fund didn’t even flinch to pay it.

2021-06-01 09:45:03,wallstreetbets,Market must hate the deal. Probably be up 50% this morning instead of a measly 15%. Guess we’ll just have to wait another hour or so for the fuckery that follows opening.

2021-06-01 14:07:46,wallstreetbets,Just because the stock is up 1000% doesn't mean AMC need for cashflow disappeared. They were able to raise with sub 1p0M shares what would have required 100M shares at the beginning of the year. They did it in the most investor friendly way possible.
2021-06-01 15:05:57,wallstreetbets,Amc has no control over what investors do after they buy. AA probably doesn't even give a shit cause it was littlerly 8 mil.
2021-06-01 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,They did not create more shares. The shares were already part of the float per Adam Aron's Twitter post. I would link If I knew how.
2021-06-01 13:50:31,wallstreetbets,how is it AMC's fault? they are allowed to do private placements especially at $28 per shares. AMC needs the cash - it was a good deal for AMC.

2021-06-01 18:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol that's still not enough.

Their short positions are in the 100Ms of shares. Known.

I'm unsure what this deal was about but of AMC had any foresight or backbone. Its to give its guardian angels (apes) an extra $5 per share this week and an extra $200 per share next month.

In all honesty tho I truly hope AMC understands the full picture of what they're doing. After all. They got themselves into this mess and WE got them out. Continuing to keep them out."

2021-06-01 12:10:55,wallstreetbets,"> They think Mudrick was short

So they profited on their bonds and on short calls. They *were* short.

>In exchange, Mudrick received a commitment fee equal to about 8 million AMC shares.

>The deal also called for the firm to exchange $100 million of AMC bonds due 2026 for about 13.7 million shares. Mudrick sold those shares when they were trading at $3 to $4 apiece, the person said.

So they sold those shares at $3 or $4 a piece. They didn't make bank from this squeeze by being long equity."
2021-06-01 14:41:54,wallstreetbets,More likely Mudrick is helping AMC raise funds and sticking it to the shorts in the prosess. Money raised at premium is always better than discount 👍

2021-06-01 12:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Dug into it, we never removed his thread. 

He got confused by the general bot message when posting a news thread (""news posts must be recent and market moving..."") which does *not* remove threads.

And then deleted his own thread."
2021-06-01 13:39:02,wallstreetbets,"But if I don't have more imaginary internet points, how will everyone else know that I'm better than them?"
2021-06-01 09:06:26,wallstreetbets,WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE KARMA
2021-06-01 09:06:48,wallstreetbets,Shares are diluted even further. Good for AMC execs. Bad for retail investors.
2021-06-01 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,"It means we might have a Whale long term AMC holder (🦍💎). x,xxx,xxx tendies ready for moon.  

Stock is so hot that the price went higher. 

These 8 million tendies were voted on previously and were not made out of thin air- they were there since 2017 I believe. Anyway, I fucking love the stock and I will be purchasing more when it dips a bit.

I see you shrills working hard to down vote DD and up vote fear, anxiety and shit filled comments. I guess I would be desperate too."
2021-06-01 08:37:02,wallstreetbets,It means they bailed out a fund that was short.
2021-06-01 08:44:13,wallstreetbets,It also means that they will dilute shareholders to enrich their hedgefund buddies whenever they feel like it.
2021-06-01 08:34:22,wallstreetbets,Try $27.13 a share. 4% premium above the current price at Friday close. Don't make this so easy douche
2021-06-01 08:35:18,wallstreetbets,"It also means that the value of the company is now divided by a larger number of shares. 

So it's worth less per share."
2021-06-01 08:45:25,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my shares back when they raised the first time because I don’t liked how they use us retails. Bought back in because trey and the statements the company made now I am back to were I was before .. I don’t like the company, still holding for the apes but not sure how to go from here"
2021-06-01 09:21:28,wallstreetbets,They have already done that numerous times! The company was on its knees and they done it to fill the board members pockets instead of reinvesting back into the company
2021-06-01 09:23:16,wallstreetbets,Well this stuff gets diluted. Mudrick might not directly be short on AMC but they probably have a buddy who is. They now hold a few million shares that they got quite cheap considering the market price so they will either save another HF who went short or else they are bailing themselves out
2021-06-01 10:07:16,wallstreetbets,Volume and float are different
2021-06-01 10:14:31,wallstreetbets,"cause its a good call, when the company makes good decisions investors rewards them, same reason why CRM tanked, cause they paid too much for that company they bought"
2021-06-01 10:04:42,wallstreetbets,It’s a meme stock.
2021-06-01 09:23:31,wallstreetbets,Hard to prove but I wouldn’t rule it out
2021-06-01 11:45:08,wallstreetbets,Aren’t they 11b in debt? This measly amount won’t go a long way towards that. Calls can be bought an executed to offset short positions
2021-06-01 09:11:13,wallstreetbets,Always have been 🔫
2021-06-01 09:00:19,wallstreetbets,They didn’t create new shares. Shares already existed
2021-06-01 15:38:00,wallstreetbets,Why do shorts need help covering? Short interest ratio is 22%. It's trivial for them to cover
2021-06-01 15:34:44,wallstreetbets,That's not very cash money of AMC
2021-06-01 09:58:03,wallstreetbets,"DFV and others had good DD regarding Game and unfortunately the memed BB also had some convincing DD since mid 2020. (Wasn’t hard to find IMO.)

Haven’t  really stumbled upon anything with AMC other than they were also in danger of being left behind by modern times.

I guess NOK getting better as well since it was  also regarded as shit 2+ years ago after suspending their dividend."
2021-06-01 10:44:28,wallstreetbets,Same here. AMC price has risen dramatically but management keeps making questionable decisions. I hope those riding it make some money in the end.
2021-06-01 13:45:12,wallstreetbets,Its what I've been thinking this entire time. GME and AMC are not in the same boat but that doesn't mean they aren't riding the same waves. The 2 companies are setting different courses.
2021-06-01 16:50:06,wallstreetbets,AMC Literally does not give 2 shits about retail investors lol
2021-06-01 16:55:53,wallstreetbets,why would the SEC do anything? Do you think this was illegal?
2021-06-01 09:46:01,wallstreetbets,"Exactly
+600mil traded on Friday
+88mil traded already today
Drops in the bucket"
2021-06-01 09:53:32,wallstreetbets,8 million is a ton
2021-06-01 11:45:41,wallstreetbets,My options would make an insane return if it happens EOD 😎
2021-06-01 13:08:27,wallstreetbets,Baby steps. Who knows. It could get there on a major squeeze.
2021-06-01 11:45:08,wallstreetbets,Bet has already been put in action bud. Up up and away she goes.
2021-06-01 13:07:49,wallstreetbets,Squeeze away!!
2021-06-01 13:07:39,wallstreetbets,I am perfectly happy with that too hahah
2021-06-01 18:04:55,wallstreetbets,"The fact that people on this sub don't even understand what share dilution is, and legitimately think it's a net positive, really shows how much this sub has gone into the shitter"
2021-06-01 11:14:55,wallstreetbets,A fuck dont tell me 😂
2021-06-01 10:38:08,wallstreetbets,">Mudrick wasn't short AMC before this, they already owned 1.7%.

Who the fuck is short AMC then? 

Even Citadel owns 1.8% stocks [https://finte  l.io/so/us/amc/citadel-advisors-llc](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc/citadel-advisors-llc)"

2021-06-01 18:44:24,wallstreetbets,I agree but in the grand scheme of things who fucking cares.  Look at what happened to them. They made a quick 40mil selling amc and buy the end off the day they lost 80mil. Lol. You can't make this shit up. Look up there stock price. It got crushed.
2021-06-01 09:55:12,wallstreetbets,Dilution. Idiot.
2021-06-01 09:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Pure idiocy

They just covered their shorts outside the market"
2021-06-01 15:13:00,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I just saw. The guy you were talking to was arguing “it’s not dilution” and you were saying it technically is even if it’s a small amount. I thought you were talking shit. My bad."

2021-06-01 08:50:08,wallstreetbets,I can afford a Lambo but I keep spending all of my money on these stocks
2021-06-01 09:26:35,wallstreetbets,It should be a short short short term invest. I will cash it out tomorrow maybe. Just to get the 15-30% extra
2021-06-01 09:41:41,wallstreetbets,"I did, now we have to wait. Already 6% down but i am a diamond hand bitch 🧊"
2021-06-01 12:15:57,wallstreetbets,What is your average price?
2021-06-01 08:39:50,wallstreetbets,"This happens in a squeeze. They got to enter below Friday's opening price/today's opening price. Better way for them to exit their short than paying full value.

It also sends a message that they will be willing to continue to dilute as long as the stock is above $27"
2021-06-01 08:40:13,wallstreetbets,"So what you're saying is that any price above $27.12 is ripe for more dilution? Interesting perspective, thanks!"
2021-06-01 08:38:27,wallstreetbets,They bought at 13.07 stop spreading lies
2021-06-01 09:28:28,wallstreetbets,Mudrick bought at a premium of+$1 from Friday's close
2021-06-01 09:56:46,wallstreetbets,It sold at $27.12 p/s
2021-06-01 10:04:56,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 5 days

2021-06-01 19:06:29,wallstreetbets,So why not sell directly to market for that extra 3.8%?
2021-06-01 08:47:45,wallstreetbets,So we should see an amendment soon right?  Even in the prospective it says the price has fluctuated between $12 and $36 a share. How is 13.07 an average?
2021-06-01 08:32:30,wallstreetbets,Oh according to the media or the CEOs tweet?  Or the sec filing that’s a legal contract?
2021-06-01 11:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Legit reply:
Two fold:

AMC was cheaper
I believe in the theatre industry far more than I believe In Gamestop as a company.

2021-06-01 15:36:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry correct me if I'm wrong, but judging by other users it seems as if Mudrick sold all their AMC today."
2021-06-01 11:54:15,wallstreetbets,"Most of it is on our subreddit, but check out CEOADAM on twitter, the AMC CEO.  The same info can be seen in a sec filing I believe.  The 8.5M shares did not even dilute the market one bit, company shares were directly sold to Mudrick Capital at market price, thus causing buying pressure on the volume.  My only speculation is why did Mudrick ask for company shares?  Is it that there is not enough shares in the float for Mudrick to buy like all other institutional buyers since we own many synthetics in addition to the float?  Who knows, all I know is I’m not selling and the plan is still the same AMC500K."

2021-06-01 10:32:38,wallstreetbets,Wrong.

2021-06-01 13:44:42,wallstreetbets,Buy in at $28 and immediately sell at $31 because of overvaluation? Seems more like a quick cash grab and momentum killer.

Well what do you expect from an entity partly owned by citadel"
2021-06-01 16:25:33,wallstreetbets,If Mudrick is owned by Citadel it falls in line with an opinion i read some time ago that Adam Aron is a plant by the manipulators

2021-06-01 13:47:38,wallstreetbets,Well if they covered any significant amount at 30 they would likely skyrocket the price and trigger their own squeeze.

2021-06-01 17:13:50,wallstreetbets,"No, the point is instead of needing to buy from retail, they buy a fixed price without riding up the bid ask spread. This is why Adam Aron doesn't give a shot about YOU, and my boy Ryan Cohen does."

edit: part of the article that explains how they can be sold

""Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock, or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short. Due to various loopholes in the rules, and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems, naked shorting continues to happen.

These short sales are almost always done only by options market makers because they allegedly need to do so in order to maintain liquidity in the options markets. However, these options market makers are often brokers or large hedge funds who abuse the options market maker exemption."""
2021-06-01 14:52:21,wallstreetbets,"I respectfully disagree. Do you think there are actually a bunch of retail investors out there who already owned MUDS and are now dumping shares of an unrelated stock out of angst about AMC?

I see zero actual evidence in that article about the two things being related in any way. He even calls it a “non-event” for the SPAC at one point.

“If that wasn't enough, now I'm seeing AMC holders on social media get mad at Mudrick for selling AMC, so they are calling on people to short MUDS.”

Maybe this is why you think the things are “likely” related, but I’m not sure I buy it. He’s just looking for clicks."

2021-06-01 12:14:18,wallstreetbets,CPA here. The $240 would be considered unearned revenue AKA a liability on AMC’s balance sheet. It’s not revenue until you use the gift card.

2021-06-01 10:35:30,wallstreetbets,I did. They had a ‘buy $100 get $20 free’ so I bought $200 and got $40 free.

2021-06-01 15:22:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm okay with the overall trajectory as well.  But claiming ""Murdick is long"" as part of your reasoning and that anyone suspecting shenanigans is ""panicking"" is what didn't age well.  

Did the move ultimately help AMC's bottom line and trajectory? Probably.  But did the sale turn out to be a quick money-grabbing flip by a hedge rather than a long investment.  Looks like it.  It's just a blip in time, but retail investors are justified in being a little annoyed IMO."

2021-06-01 09:15:54,wallstreetbets,"What a lot of people seem to miss about share dilution... AMC got the cash from selling the shares, and the extra cash increases the overall value of the company by around the same amount that the shares were diluted.

eg. Say you own 1% of a company worth $100 million. They sell 10% more shares for $10 million. You now own 0.909% of a company worth $110 million. Share dilution only happens when they sell a chunk in private for well below market price, which happens sometimes, but not here."

2021-06-01 12:53:16,wallstreetbets,"$5b as of February. Paying off the debt now would mean diluting a lot more though, and would only weaken the company in the long run. The healthy way to pay it off is through profits, but that won’t come in 2021. I don’t think any of this $230m is going towards their principle debt. It’d be smarter to secure bigger long term profits once theaters open at full capacity, and buying out competition is the best way to do that."

It still seems as though this isn’t a big deal to me for the squeeze overall. Do we think they will offer new shares for all shorts to cover?

2021-06-01 10:56:21,wallstreetbets,Yup. AMC is paid a bunch of their debtors in stocks and the debtors turned around and sold them during all of this. I don’t understand how this isn’t known.
2021-06-01 13:47:11,wallstreetbets,I was one of those delusional people. I’ll admit it. I sold once I found out AMC was paying their debts with stocks. I was 4 days early to the $30 price tag but I got out with a profit. Otherwise I would have been HoLdiNg until the price hit $0

2021-06-01 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,"AMC didn't just dilute their other shareholders for free. it's a dilution in exchange of cash (at $28 per share which is very rich). AMC can then use cash to reduce debt load and optimize their capital structure. Some of the second-lien AMC bonds are paying 10% coupons (high end of junk-rated companies) and was trading at 20 cents on a dollar just a few months ago, suggesting a heightened bankruptcy risk.

This transaction should immediately be accretive to AMC's book value per share."
2021-06-01 14:27:26,wallstreetbets,"It gives them more cash to not go bankrupt? Regardless of their rocketing share price the company is still bleeding money. The main way they actually see benefit from a rising share price is to sell more shares.

From the SEC document:

On June 1, 2021, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Mudrick Capital Management, LP (“Mudrick”) pursuant to which Mudrick purchased **8,500,000 shares of Class A common stock (the “Selling Stockholder Shares”) for $230,500,000.** The Purchase Agreement requires the shares of Class A common stock contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence to be “freely-tradeable” and this prospectus supplement is being filed, in part, to satisfy this obligation. The agreement by Mudrick to purchase the Selling Stockholder Shares for the consideration described herein was entered into on a private placement basis pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act. The purchase obligation is irrevocable, subject only to the registration of the Selling Stockholder Shares under the Securities Act.

230 500 000 / 8 500 000 = 27.117

Aron added, “Given that AMC is raising hundreds of millions of dollars, this is an extremely positive result for our shareholders. It was achieved through the issuance of only 8.5 million shares, representing less than 1.7% of our issued share capital and only a small portion of our typical daily trading volume. This transaction underscores the real value of having some authorized share capital available for us to opportunistically capitalize on shareholder value creation possibilities as and when they arise.”
 
Aron concluded, “With our increased liquidity, an increasingly vaccinated population and the imminent release of blockbuster new movie titles, it is time for AMC to go on the offense again.”

‐---------------

Looks like they issued 8.5m shares? Small dilution I suppose? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Also $27/share per the numbers... $230.5M / 8.5M = 27.11

Added the bullish paragraph following. AMC going on offensive and mention of new blockbusters upcoming. Who else but AMC would have that info."
2021-06-01 08:53:30,wallstreetbets,So 8.5m more shares in the market available for trading isn't dilution? Interesting outlook.
2021-06-01 09:19:17,wallstreetbets,DIfference between AMC and GME was shelf offering and outstanding shares.  I'd be surprised if AMC hits $100.   AMC will keep dumping shares at the market to raise capital. They DGAF.

2021-06-01 09:13:03,wallstreetbets,Yes 8.5M shares at current prices WOULD represent that value.  Doesn’t mean that’s what was paid.  By the looks of it AMC just handed them $100M
2021-06-01 09:42:14,wallstreetbets,Um no.  When I see BS ima call it out.  According to the filings the investment company agreed to pay a maximum of 13.07.  Why would they then agree to pay double?  This deal was filed Thursday why would AMC put the filing way below market price?  As a maximum? A shelf offering isn’t the same as a ATM offering.  When an ATM offering is finished usually there’s statement stating the aggregate price average as all the shares wouldn’t have been purchased at the same price.  There’s just so many things wrong with the current news that don’t add up.  Believe whatever you want.

2021-06-01 18:00:16,wallstreetbets,"I haven't read up on AMC as much as I have on GME, but I think it's comparable. The hedge funds took a big short position in the stock. When the risk to keep the position open became too big due to the rising value, they decided to double down instead of buying back the shares and accepting the loss. 

Now they have to keep the price low so they won't get margin called, the only way for them to effectively do that is by shorting more shares (which makes the problem bigger for them). The only way for them to get out of this is when AMC/GME goes bankrupt, but since that won't happen it's only a matter of time before the hedge funds are out of money for shorting and get margin called. 

I think GME has more potential though, it seems sus that AMC short squeeze is all over the media while GME is widely ignored. Feels like AMC is more of a distraction but I could be wrong."

2021-06-01 12:08:30,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree and I've wondered that myself. I can only speak for auditing and reporting up to the regional level. Gift cards are only reported as revenue for a store when they are cashed in. That revenue reporting rolls up to the districts (usually a large area within a state or even crossing state lines by metro area) revenue, which rolls up to the regional (multi-state) revenue reporting. Maybe beyond that, corporate accountants ""wash"" the gift card revenue from the reporting and add back all of the sold gift cards in the reporting to The Street? Idk."
2021-06-01 12:19:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. Sure, there is money to be made by people not using gift cards. However, muuuch more money is made by the fact that a)person receiving gift card may not have purchased from retailer if not for gift card, and b) most gift card spending is well over the dollar amount of the gift card. When Joe Shmo gets a $20 amc gift card, he goes and sees a movie he wouldn't have before, and spends an extra $30 out of pocket for snacks. It's the same deal with retailer credit cards."

2021-06-01 17:28:44,wallstreetbets,He is not diluting because more shares aren’t being created. Shares held by AMC was sold. He is raising capital for the business.

2021-06-01 13:31:50,wallstreetbets,"This math is completely wrong and will lead to you making poor decisions. 

A simple thought experiment can show you that your math is wrong, without having to get into any complicated workings out. Let's say your average was $8, then you did really really well, sold at $38 and bought back in at $30. Does that mean that your average cost per share now is $0? 

This matters because you want to think in terms of % gain not $$ and you are conflating the two. Going from $8 to $24 is a 300% gain, whereas going from $6 to $24 is a 400% gain, big difference.

So doing the actual math, you reduced your DCA by (31-29)/31 x 100% = 6%, meaning your new average is around $7.5.

You got lucky today, and made a quick buck. I'm not here to advise you on your strategy, but I would counsel you to think about whether attempting to time the market like this is a suitable risk profile for your aims."

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BLINK Charging and the EV Market Hello degenerates.

EDIT: Seems like more info has come to light in the comments.  [https://twitter.com/culperresearch/status/1296074976328548352?s=21](https://twitter.com/culperresearch/status/1296074976328548352?s=21)

I've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and ""Experts"" say this sector should see nothing but growth!

I've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest.

Now when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:

*""The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020""*

[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)

Deloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  ""Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years""

[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)

AND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging!

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f)

*“With the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,” the UBS report said.*

*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain’s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .""*

They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.

## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information (NOT SO GREAT AS POINTED OUT VS THEIR POTENTIAL MARKET CAP)

Blink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.

So in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted.

I'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions.

2021-06-01 07:16:18,wallstreetbets,"Quarterly revenue of $2.23 Million for a company with a market cap of $1.43 Billion is pretty dismal. At that rate, the average revenue (not profit) per each of their 16,617 charging stations is a whopping $134 for 3 months, or $44.73 per month. A panhandler can make more than this in a month. A lot more. The shorts are probably right on this one."

2021-06-01 10:54:46,wallstreetbets,"I have an EV and chargers are scattered.  There's no clear company that has any real type of market share besides Tesla and their super charging network.  I doubt Tesla builds those super chargers in house from start to finish.  Find out who they work with to install and maintain them and I'd bet you could find some money.

I remember when I thought I missed the boat on SBUX and they kept growing and growing.  Keep in mind that Tesla's super charging is not free.  In addition to generating revenue from selling vehicles (and service), they are going to have a continuous revenue from super charging fees.  The more vehicles they sell, the more people will be out there relying on super charging.

Of the places I've charged my vehicle, one was a chargepoint location that was free.  The rest are installed in private businesses or city parking lots, some company installs them and the business pays for the electricity ... and they have all been free to use.  The company installing them may make money doing so, but there's no ongoing revenue.  I have seen chargepoint chargers in my area that charge a fee, but there are so many free-to-use chargers around that I wouldn't use them."
2021-06-01 14:33:38,wallstreetbets,"their founder, michael farkas, is CEO of four companies, three of which have nothing to do with electric vehicle charging (take a guess what the name of the fourth one is)

https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-d-farkas-a0080026

so what though? you don’t NEED elon musk level talent or even a degree in electrical engineering to be a successful EV charging CEO (right?). what you do need though are working charging stations. 

“almost no one uses Blink’s charging stations, many of which are in utterly decrepit condition. Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers.”

they’re one of the short sellers you mentioned. conveniently, you forgot to show the reason they were short.

Blink denies it, because obviously they do. did they back up their denial? nope. so if you have the evidence prove culper wrong. and while you’re at it disprove this:


“This scheme mirrors Farkas’s previous involvement as majority shareholder in multiple companies that were tied to money laundering, drug trafficking, and stock promotion schemes.”"
2021-06-01 08:59:34,wallstreetbets,"The issue with these networks long term is they will be useless to anyone who owns a house or has an apartment with a charger ( most new ones are getting them ) .

It’s $500 for a home charger but most electric companies give them for free or subsidize + 500-1000 for install .

90-95% of drivers can charge at home every night and will never use the public networks unless they are doing a long ass trip . 

You pull into your garage and then you charge at night and have 200-300+ mile range for the day and that’s more than enough ."
2021-06-01 06:54:35,wallstreetbets,This guy said there's an ongoing fraud lawsuit? [https://www.markovchained.com/assets/view/BLNK?position\_id=1262](https://www.markovchained.com/assets/view/BLNK?position_id=1262)
2021-06-01 07:01:54,wallstreetbets,">The company had revenue of $2.23 million for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.

Wow more than 2 million in REVENUE??? 2 BILLION market cap here we goooo"
2021-06-01 07:47:08,wallstreetbets,"I remember when I bought shares at $6 and sold at $5, then a few months later it hit $60"
2021-06-01 09:40:41,wallstreetbets,Ive been holding 84 of this stock (BLNK) since $8.51.  Been a good profit for me so far but its been a few years 311% in ~3 years i think.
2021-06-01 19:45:02,wallstreetbets,https://twitter.com/greenfleetmag/status/1399872027322830857?s=21
2021-06-01 07:24:24,wallstreetbets,"I actually think the situation is even worst the majority of their revenue comes from selling chargers (for home and commercial installations, ie one off sales of kit) not from the charging network... so those revenue numbers per public charger are even worse... it’s pretty shocking."
2021-06-01 09:27:39,wallstreetbets,Can we incorporate panhandling ? Sounds like a solid investment.
2021-06-01 12:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Plus they count people's personal charging stations in the same count as their public charging stations, inflating the number of available stations by a shit ton.

Also, seems not all of them are even functional"
2021-06-01 07:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, who is there to fill this EV charging market if EV is going to see so much growth in the future? Will it just be the EV car manufacturers and there charging platforms that they install around the USA?"
2021-06-01 07:11:18,wallstreetbets,Now that it is some compelling info 😂 the drug plane in Mexico scandal
2021-06-01 07:34:28,wallstreetbets,They provide DC fast chargers for public spaces and level II for at home charging.
2021-06-01 07:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Worse, they pay someone else for their parking spots and attempt to resell their electricity. Also there’s about 30 companies currently doing the same thing. Blink is not even in top 10"
2021-06-01 09:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Basically, fancy sockets."
2021-06-01 12:50:42,wallstreetbets,I’ll do a follow up post later this week/next week and do some more looking into these other EV charging options.
2021-06-01 11:05:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure there’s a stock out there relating to the EV charging that is a gem waiting to shine that investors are still trying to find. 

I’m based in South Africa where EV is still years away. I don’t get to see what you do get to experience on the ground. 

Looking for long term investments in the EV sector."
2021-06-01 13:39:17,wallstreetbets,There's plenty of people who do long trips and buy cars intending to do long trips.
2021-06-01 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Don't the electric companies still need to purchase the chargers from a manufacturer? Even if they're providing them for free or they're being subsidized someone is paying for them. 

&#x200B;

Not saying BLNK is the one to grab this market, but I don't see how your point is relevant."
2021-06-01 07:48:47,wallstreetbets,I feel your pain
2021-06-01 07:30:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah electrify America, chargepoint inc, EV box, Tesla superchargers are probably the winners in this space. Wouldn’t surprise if some of the oil majors got involved in the US as they are in Europe."
2021-06-01 07:29:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh. many residential, hotel, and even workplaces have an ev charger now. Not sure I would ever use a station.... especially if it takes 30-60 minutes. I wonder what portion of their spots are ""station"" versus attached to housing/workplaces."
2021-06-01 08:01:51,wallstreetbets,"I had a big investment there aswell, would've made me thousands lol"

2021-06-01 06:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures look to continue their rebound that started a couple of weeks ago. Dow Industrials and S&P 500 pointing to an open of about 0.5% with the Nasdaq up about 0.4%. That’s as of 0630.

Reopening stocks and cyclicals are looking good in the premarket: Cruise lines, airlines, energy stocks, etc. There’s now even talk that inflation concerns were misplaced, with Goldman Sachs’ Chris Hussey saying these were “exaggerated or perhaps even priced in” and that the inflation we’re seeing is “good inflation” (per CNBC)

There isn’t really much on the calendar that can upend this narrative. We have ISM manufacturing PMIs out today at 1000. Expectations there are for a 60.9 print, roughly equal to April’s 60.7. Couple of Fed speeches today too. Blah.

Non-farm payrolls are Friday, but that’s not for three days and anyway isn’t that useful of a gauge anymore (weekly initial jobless claims have become the more watched figure).

In the meantime we’re just 0.8% away from the S&P setting a new record. Looks like we may get there before too long."

2021-06-01 15:44:01,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is going to be like a fat zit about to pop. 

- Sold out in Q2 well before quarter finish
- top seller in US by not a margin, but no comparison other than they're in their own league for sales.
- Chinese public apology and acceptance of Tesla
- over 1M cybertruck pre orders...
- 500+ mile range as a standard
- chip shortage? Temporary. Not the first time a shortage has been around, nor does it last that long... (especially these days when TSLA has enough capital to start their own supply chain...) 
- well managed 
- plans for the future, success, and impact in the world. 
- more than just vehicles
- nearly $900 in January...

*just my perspective based on comparison of other companies, what Tesla does/is doing, what happens in the manufacturing world. Looking at how the media is trying to keep Tesla out of sight and out of mind with Ford. Selling a lot in Norway is great! Just remember that there are more people in 1 state than in Norway, but congrats to Ford at the same time. Lastly experience through the manufacturing world of parts shortages, supply/demand meets and expectations. The experience also includes the results based on those shortages through the cause and affect.*

Thanks for reading! Fun little add. 
I will note that I am currently all in for TSLA through this belief. Your decisions are your decisions, just my .02 of why I am a believer that TSLA will infect destroy the bear army. 🐂🎯

2021-06-01 13:08:14,wallstreetbets,"AMC really not looking that bad after Mudrick news - 

Intraday support around $29.85-$30 hasn't been tested yet, which can be a good sign. If that level holds, specifically on the 1hr, it's looking decent for a continued move up if there is volume. If support breaks, or volume fades, be cautious. Could still rocket one way or the other, but wait for continued entries until these levels clear one way or the other."

I don't pretend to be as smart as most of the people on this sub, or as successful for that matter. But we're talking about a stock with a 5 year high of around $35. I feel like it's natural for it to take a couple of attempts to break that level. TO THE MOON!"

2021-06-01 13:36:03,wallstreetbets,"Do yourself a favor and check out the 6 month charts for GME, AMC, and then BB. It sure looks like BB is about to make a run, especially as it's steadily growing in popularity and sentiment on this sub. Not only that, but it's a much stronger company fundamentally than AMC and so has a higher floor, i.e. less risk. Ask yourself this – if BB hits $15 by the end of the week, would you consider buying in then? That would be like buying AMC at $20. Those people are comfortable, but certainly not too comfortable right now. Get in BB NOW before the volatility begins and you don't have to worry about paperhanding and FOMOing back in, which you know you will when this starts to run."

2021-06-01 15:54:29,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight, news is released in the premarket that Mudrick Capital purchases 8.5 million shares at a 4% premium to Fridays closing price. Then in under 1 trading day they turn around and sell the shares for a 15% profit, effectively ending the bull thesis that a big institution is backing the stock. To add insult to injury they also claim the stock is overvalued.

So how the hell is the stock not tanking? Effectively 8.5 million shares just got added to the public float with no institutional buying yet this thing soars? The CEO said he wouldnt need to raise capital and breaks his promise anyways yet shareholders rejoice? If this isnt stock market mania what is?"

And if it were below strike, it'd just be $0.1207 * 2000 ≈ $400?"

2021-06-01 03:05:52,wallstreetbets,9 days so probably May 19 before SPCE spiked in IV the following day. Great play OP. You one lucky MF’er! Congrats!
2021-06-01 04:36:30,wallstreetbets,"His expiry was short dated and the IV was low when he bought and super high when he sold.

He probably couldn’t have timed his entry and exit any better. It happens, not very often but the force is strong with this one.

Congrats OP"
2021-06-01 10:48:35,wallstreetbets,I can't seem to find OP's original post.  This says update but not sure what it is update on.
2021-06-01 11:57:12,wallstreetbets,Lol how did you know ?
2021-06-01 17:12:40,wallstreetbets,This shit really really sucks.
2021-06-01 18:35:33,wallstreetbets,lol 🌽 y
2021-06-01 03:24:09,wallstreetbets,Bought 20 contracts and price to be 22+. Each contract covers 100 shares (if that's the right way to say it). Haven't touched options myself.
2021-06-01 07:29:46,wallstreetbets,"He bought 20 contracts for $12 each and they increased to $1240 each. 20x1240= 24800.

Strike price $22."
2021-06-01 03:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Wtf math are you doing lol, contracts bought cheap w $22 break even, stock went waaay over 22, contracts sold for a lot, that’s all the math you need (20 contacts bought for avg $12 each, sold for $1200 each)"
2021-06-01 11:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Isn't it something more like $400 ----> $25,000 only after  $67,660 (20 x 100 x $33.83) minus $44,360 (20 x 100 x $22.12)? 

So do you need to have about $44,000 in order to claim about $25,000 in profit? 

Or do the contracts get sold again immediately to someone else because it is only a right to buy and not an ""obligation""? So you don't actually need to have about $43,600 available beyond the $400 put in to claim your prize?"
2021-06-01 18:10:55,wallstreetbets,I did this already
2021-06-01 16:03:06,wallstreetbets,You must be new here..
2021-06-01 08:32:24,wallstreetbets,It’s called Sarcasm

2021-06-01 03:29:13,wallstreetbets,About the same way the lottery works
2021-06-01 12:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Ape explanation: you think a stock going to the moon. Somebody who owns it, thinks it’ll be flat. 

So you buy, for a small amount per 100 shares, the right to buy it a little above where it currently  is. 

They take your money, hoping it stays flat. 

Two scenarios: one, they’re right, you don’t buy the actual stock. Two, you’re right and you get the stock that’s maybe worth twice what you pay for, because they already contracted to sell it at an agreed upon price, at your discretion."

2021-06-01 09:51:24,wallstreetbets,"In a situation like this, don't you need to have the capital to buy the shares when you exercise or no? I'm new to options."

2021-06-01 13:02:33,wallstreetbets,These were two week weeklies.
2021-06-01 05:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Did it only cost 400 dollars to do the whole scheme tho?  Because I would have done a 20 dollar call on Virgin Galactic as of that date myself (I just bought the dip standard myself) as it was clear to be a flash crash, or at least nearly sure one to the extend it would pass quickly."
2021-06-01 15:11:41,wallstreetbets,“Literally can’t go tits up”
2021-06-01 08:41:09,wallstreetbets,What does short dated and IV mean? Could you send me a link to read up about this?
2021-06-01 11:58:18,wallstreetbets,The three buttons are on the right while u have a massive screen 😂
2021-06-01 09:14:14,wallstreetbets,Wtf made it become worth 1.2k each?!
2021-06-01 03:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Cost is $0.1207 per share right? or $12.07 per contract, and their value is market price ($33.8) minus strike price ($22) * 100 for each share, if I'm getting this right? Sorry I'm just trying to get familiarised with all this because I wanna bankrupt myself soon with stonks."
2021-06-01 11:07:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah from what I tell you can exercise the contract if you have the capital, or sell it off."
2021-06-01 11:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Rarely do options get exercised, the money is in the premium."
2021-06-01 16:17:34,wallstreetbets,No I'm not I just don't comment much
2021-06-01 16:36:58,wallstreetbets,"This sub has gone to shit! Oblivious to sarcasm and guys like the dude saying this is the best comment! This is verbatim the top comment in 90% of Gain posts! I liked it when we were sub 500,000!"
2021-06-01 12:49:24,wallstreetbets,So then you either lose a small amount or you gain a lot? Am I understanding that correctly? What's the downside?
2021-06-01 13:52:41,wallstreetbets,You need to have the cash to be able to buy the stock though right? Even at the strike price
2021-06-01 15:29:57,wallstreetbets,"yes, but where does the extra money come from

i buy a stock it goes up i sell it to someone else willing to pay that new price. right?

with options, i buy a stock, it goes up 800% in 3 days if i am right. So who is paying the difference to put that new profit in my accout? The broker who took my bet?"
2021-06-01 15:32:05,wallstreetbets,"despite all the retardation, ive learned a few things!"
2021-06-01 11:13:26,wallstreetbets,"He's not buying the shares, he sold the options"
2021-06-01 13:14:35,wallstreetbets,If you want to exercise you have to have the capital. In this case OP is selling the options contracts he previously bought.
2021-06-01 07:27:16,wallstreetbets,Everything you just asked is readily available in the post
2021-06-01 11:12:49,wallstreetbets,www.google.com
2021-06-01 09:52:34,wallstreetbets,There was a huge spike in IV the day after these were purchased and now the stock is trading at $29 so they're pretty deep ITM.
2021-06-01 10:01:40,wallstreetbets,"Short dated, far OTM and bought when IV was low. Far ITM and high IV when sold. 

Basically the share price went up really quickly."
2021-06-01 07:35:32,wallstreetbets,"What you're calculating is intrinsic value only. Since these were near expiry at the time of screenshot there wasn't a lot of extrinsic value left, but enough to add some value."
2021-06-01 05:07:55,wallstreetbets,😀
2021-06-01 03:57:04,wallstreetbets,Basically yeah but there’s that theta and delta shit too that could affect price
2021-06-01 17:10:14,wallstreetbets,This is a Casino! Take a seat.
2021-06-01 12:56:42,wallstreetbets," No. There’s a 99% chance you lose some money, if not most of it. Options is straight gambling and the higher chance of you losing then the bigger the payout."
2021-06-01 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,"No, us apes sell the call shortly before expiration so that the MM (your wife's boyfriend with actual money) then executes the option and buys the shares"
2021-06-01 17:04:11,wallstreetbets,"I think you misunderstood something here. If I have the right to buy 100 shares at $5, let's say the stock is at $4,75, then I would effectively lose money if I exercise the option ('use it').

But let's say the stock price rises to $5,50, so the price per share went up 10%. My option to buy at $5 still exists and is now worth $0,50 × 100 = $50. so the option price just increased insanely just because the stock went up 10%.

If the stock price doubles to $10 my option to buy at $5 would be worth $500. If the stock price goes to the moon... This posts here exists."
2021-06-01 16:54:33,wallstreetbets,"They’re selling it at a lower price than they would otherwise have. If you bought a call at 20, and the stock was now at 40, they sold it to you at 20, because you paid them a small amount per share to do that."
2021-06-01 16:27:44,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your getting back to me bro but I'm not skilled enough to figure it out, if you can hook me up I'd appreciate it."
2021-06-01 11:22:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks for wasting your time instead of helping:)
2021-06-01 09:13:58,wallstreetbets,"So if the stock goes down a bit before expiry, the extrinsic value would have been negative before it went down? Or am I seeing this wrong"
2021-06-01 04:04:03,wallstreetbets,One of those indicates volatility right?
2021-06-01 12:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but theoretically in his case if losing his $400 was inconsequential then there's no downside?"
2021-06-01 14:42:41,wallstreetbets,If thats the case then this OP isn't actually making 25k right?
2021-06-01 17:40:12,wallstreetbets,No skill required. Just look at the picture and read the headlines with their corresponding prices.
2021-06-01 19:02:39,wallstreetbets,"You gotta realize, if you can't do basic research on investing terms, you're definitely not going to be doing thorough research on stocks, and you will definitely lose all of the money you put into options."

2021-06-01 10:00:28,wallstreetbets,"There will always be extrinsic value prior to an options expiry. This is determined by the greeks.  Extrinsic value cannot go negative, but it can decrease and will ultimately arrive at 0 on expiry."
2021-06-01 05:13:29,wallstreetbets,I thought that was Vega
2021-06-01 13:01:53,wallstreetbets,Right. It’s a call which means the most he can lose is the amount he paid for the contract.
2021-06-01 13:18:21,wallstreetbets,Just like lottery tickets in a way.
2021-06-01 14:51:09,wallstreetbets,"You're incorrect - with the increase in the underlying stock price, the OP can sell these contracts for the $25k number. The MM will pay that much to buy the contract from OP because they have the $ to exercise the shares and potentially see even bigger future growth."
2021-06-01 13:05:46,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thanks for the info
2021-06-01 13:38:03,wallstreetbets,You can lose more if you are a retard and let it expire in the money at the end of the week and it auto exercises then over the weekend the stock crashes.
2021-06-01 16:23:14,wallstreetbets,"So in that case he has to sell, not exercise. Yes?"
2021-06-01 13:38:22,wallstreetbets,You can lose more if you are a retard and let it expire in the money at the end of the week and it auto exercises then over the weekend the stock crashes.
2021-06-01 18:26:09,wallstreetbets,"Unless he has the money to buy the shares, yes."
2021-06-01 18:38:02,wallstreetbets,"It won't cost him 25k though, just the strike price times number of shares"
2021-06-01 19:07:44,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks for answering my questions
2021-06-01 19:13:25,wallstreetbets,"Which is $44,000.00 right based on the $22 call price?"

2021-06-01 07:12:51,wallstreetbets,"Absolute retard here, what determines the cost of the contracts?"

2021-06-01 15:49:18,wallstreetbets,$40? I think you meant 4 MILLION 💎🔥🚀
2021-06-01 18:28:42,wallstreetbets,Sell short term calls against your long calls to benefit from a higher front end IV and faster theta decay do this at the same strike if you’re really fearful of another squeeze. Otherwise go beneath the strike price otherwise your probably fucked on these positions
2021-06-01 10:21:59,wallstreetbets,Won't happen lol
2021-06-01 04:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Amc has declining customers due to covid restrictions in past.  Movies are also being released on Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services.  Why the high $40 stock price evaluation?  If you analyze their P/E the company doesn't seem to be worth $40 a share today."
2021-06-01 07:12:22,wallstreetbets,You never sold at the top lmfao you’re definitely retarded
2021-06-01 09:03:06,wallstreetbets,Doing great! Maybe you might even break even today lmao..
2021-06-01 13:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Maybe both you of you can fuck and make the dumbest mother fucker that ever lived. Only then will one person be so retarded, they will buy the top after a 500% run"

2021-06-01 02:24:14,wallstreetbets,Retards use Robinhood. Not the good kind either.
2021-06-01 13:46:30,wallstreetbets,How are contracts different than just stocks?
2021-06-01 12:20:30,wallstreetbets,Thats boring

2021-06-01 18:14:31,wallstreetbets,He’s maybe up $8-10k right now but I’d sell tomorrow
2021-06-01 16:12:06,wallstreetbets,I have a 39c so it’s not breaking that price. You and I are both screwed lol
2021-06-01 18:17:50,wallstreetbets,You got it!!!
2021-06-01 05:48:53,wallstreetbets,Can't sell them til the market opens anyhow
2021-06-01 07:29:03,wallstreetbets,so much resistance at 30 tho
2021-06-01 10:36:05,wallstreetbets,This guy doesn't like money
2021-06-01 18:18:07,wallstreetbets,Yes sir!!!
2021-06-01 11:25:41,wallstreetbets,Fud spreading bitch mad he can’t buy any
2021-06-01 05:43:45,wallstreetbets,"Because it's worth 500k a share. I will never stop going to theatres, AMC to the moon!"
2021-06-01 06:44:41,wallstreetbets,"This has nothing to do with customers watching movies.

GameStop can barely keep stores open, explain that one."
2021-06-01 07:29:10,wallstreetbets,lmao I watched my contracts expiry last friday all day for some reason..was waiting for it to be  squeezed higher  was up like 10k. fell asleep before the bell. woke up pissed off and totally forgot about after hours on friday and couldn't sell my remaining +7/30C
2021-06-01 14:00:03,wallstreetbets,I got off my options today. It was a loss. But at least I salvaged what was left.
2021-06-01 06:59:51,wallstreetbets,You have the exact opposite of my position
2021-06-01 02:29:07,wallstreetbets,infinite
2021-06-01 03:03:30,wallstreetbets,He has no technical cap to profits. Buying calls has the gain loss of (-the amount your in for) to (+infinite)
2021-06-01 07:06:26,wallstreetbets,Alot
2021-06-01 10:42:20,wallstreetbets,No they won’t
2021-06-01 10:29:42,wallstreetbets,That’s the way it’s looking
2021-06-01 07:49:35,wallstreetbets,-21k so far
2021-06-01 08:43:43,wallstreetbets,He’ll be in the money at opening bell lol he’s good
2021-06-01 09:04:12,wallstreetbets,already at $31 in premarket
2021-06-01 19:12:40,wallstreetbets,It’s after hours. You really think this isn’t gonna tank when the market opens tomorrow? Lol HF shorted it all day and wouldn’t it rise.
2021-06-01 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,It’s going up so fast now after hours when I can’t sell my option 😂😂
2021-06-01 02:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Sir

We cordially welcome you to the AMC casino here on Moon Station APE sponsored in part by WSB and Wendy’s. Can we offer you red crayon flavored tendies?"
2021-06-01 12:56:53,wallstreetbets,He probably bought ITM or IV came down.
2021-06-01 12:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Math. Unless he sold at the crazy 12.40 spike, adding volatility, he's down 10k as of 12.58."
2021-06-01 11:38:15,wallstreetbets,Got to decide too before Friday. Did you sell eventually?
2021-06-01 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,"> I'm with you. Lets fuckin

Omg dude 37.21!!! O\_O   


  
LETS GOOOOO!!!!"
2021-06-01 18:21:19,wallstreetbets,God look at that after hour jump.. you made Atleast 30k
2021-06-01 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,That usually carries into open silly 😜
2021-06-01 09:09:37,wallstreetbets,What resistance? Lol
2021-06-01 16:47:03,wallstreetbets,Howd the resistance hold up at 30 ?
2021-06-01 16:15:39,wallstreetbets,Oh I hold a little amc. But CNBC is pushing it so I don’t trust it as much as GME. My xxxx in amc is currently doing ok though lol. But I’m so question it
2021-06-01 12:13:50,wallstreetbets,Nah
2021-06-01 06:15:40,wallstreetbets,Why is it worth 500k a share?  Why is amc going to the moon when there is no population to watch movies on the moon so why would they expand to the moon?  The logistics of building a movie theater on the moon with no customers there will most likely bankrupt them.
2021-06-01 06:49:18,wallstreetbets,Why compare one failing business to another?
2021-06-01 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,I give you credit for at least knowing that you can sell to close. Impressive sir.
2021-06-01 14:55:13,wallstreetbets,7 hrs later.......
2021-06-01 07:35:52,wallstreetbets,To infinity...and beyond!
2021-06-01 15:28:59,wallstreetbets,"So, the potential loss for the calls in this picture are about $10?"
2021-06-01 08:02:55,wallstreetbets,‘This is not even my final form’ someone asked me how I lost 98% on a ticker....it’s always an option.
2021-06-01 11:40:37,wallstreetbets,"This shit made me laugh. Reminds me of when Bart or Lisa said they had the worst day of their life. And homer said, “Worst day of your life… so far.”"
2021-06-01 13:14:13,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-06-01 11:00:24,wallstreetbets,What is it at now? Now he's zeroed out.
2021-06-01 19:55:13,wallstreetbets,As tradition it will open negative tomorrow because you own AMC and have contracts itm
2021-06-01 14:43:45,wallstreetbets,I see u everywhere G
2021-06-01 14:35:54,wallstreetbets,Still holding so far lol
2021-06-01 19:15:50,wallstreetbets,">that is a yolo and a half but I'm with you. Lets fucking gooooooo!  
>  
>Aftermarket price at $34.80 @ 6:02ET on

Dude you might cash in tomorrow if this keeps up! @ $38.24"
2021-06-01 06:20:30,wallstreetbets,I think now it's worth 1 million per share! Movies theatres > streaming services. To the moon!! There are millions of us!
2021-06-01 07:40:43,wallstreetbets,Why not?
2021-06-01 15:05:37,wallstreetbets,Lol after I sold the price went back up. Sucks to be me.
2021-06-01 14:56:46,wallstreetbets,😢
2021-06-01 15:41:14,wallstreetbets,no it’s about 40k
2021-06-01 16:35:42,wallstreetbets,"$3.63 on options is the premium for it right now, you multiply that by the option multiplier of 100. OP has 30 of those so it's $363*30 just for the $29 strike"
2021-06-01 14:01:53,wallstreetbets,It’s Bart in the simpsons movie after everyone saw his weiner
2021-06-01 14:16:50,wallstreetbets,"It's 31.40, still above his highest call contract."
2021-06-01 14:54:14,wallstreetbets,Me too. Waiting to see how things are going to unfold... Especially tomorrow with the count.
2021-06-01 19:21:05,wallstreetbets,$39!!!! It's so close...!
2021-06-01 15:07:05,wallstreetbets,"Even more impressive, sir."
2021-06-01 14:54:52,wallstreetbets,Here's hoping theta doesn't kill us too bad and this baby rockets tomorrow
2021-06-01 19:48:47,wallstreetbets,LOL ITS ALMOST AT 40 AH. GOOD CALL MY FRIEND!!
2021-06-01 14:57:02,wallstreetbets,I am fingers and toes crossed 🤣. I really hope for the baby to rise to the highest heights possible come tomorrow. I am an EU APE and eating crayons all the way :) 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🙌
2021-06-01 15:02:14,wallstreetbets,In the meantime I picked up 3 more shares since I decided im not selling the call today and don't have to worry about the day trade 🙃 🤣 only holding 5 shares but here we go!
2021-06-01 15:05:07,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha let's wish one another good f** luck!! Again, how many shares do you have in total? 5?"
2021-06-01 15:07:30,wallstreetbets,"6 now lol. Im poor, trying to get a little unpoor"
2021-06-01 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,Ok. I hope everything goes on well with you and worry not btw 6 is better than nothing at all. I have 443 so far and hope to get more when I sell my  30 calls . Yes I am retarded to have added 4 more calls ... Ooohh lawwdd!! I hope everything goes on well though. 💎🚀
2021-06-01 15:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I only really got into learning about stocks in February. Didn't even know what an option was back then. And you can clearly see where my portfolio took a deep nose dive when I discovered them 🤣🤣 I've just been playing around with a little of my stimmy and added a little more here and there. Not even enough to try for margin, yet. That's probably a good thing bc this whole stock things feeds my gambling monkey a little too well 🤣 just trying to learn from mistakes and Google every word I dont know lol"
2021-06-01 15:37:51,wallstreetbets,The pandemic has really paved way for people to learn new things. Being indoors pushed people to killing boredom the best way they could. I wish you good luck with trading. I also started trading actively this past year since I am working from home.. Had been doing it passively for quite sometime now bc of my 9to5 job. Plus I work for a Corporate and investment bank(capital market department) so you can imagine doing this actively in the office isn't possible. And so many internal issues because of the position I hold but so far I am compliant with the company's requirements. You can learn so much about options and other stuff online without paying a single penny. I personally have one of my accounts on margin but I don't mess with it... Not to get margin called... Especially at this point 😂😂😂
2021-06-01 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Seeing this after market action definitely makes me glad I held on to that call. And got up to 8 shares before market close lol. 
Now to sit in anticipation for tomorrow's open 🤣 another no sleep night?"
2021-06-01 18:27:45,wallstreetbets,Do you have access to pre and after market trading? I do but I won't sell nothing. It just hit 36 after hours and I wonna jump hahaha it's 00h26 and I am still up. Already halfway through my night.
2021-06-01 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,Gonna catch some sleep soon though!
2021-06-01 18:57:47,wallstreetbets,"I can just see the price movement after hours. I think i trade shares maybe 30 mins before and an hour or so after close, but I'm not thinking of selling those any time soon lol."
2021-06-01 19:02:09,wallstreetbets,I am still up. Excited to see 37.25 so far ooohh holy lawd!!! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-01 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,38.45 lol I need to fggn sleep but I am too excited to see 40 by tom'!
2021-06-01 19:33:42,wallstreetbets,For real! Let it keep going up! 🚀

2021-06-01 00:25:57,wallstreetbets,"AMD really gunning for NVidia in the car segment, in the same way they went after Intel."
2021-06-01 00:36:40,wallstreetbets,"That was the least amazing thing AMD announced today. Go see the 3D stacked chips they just revolutionized the chip industry with. https://youtu.be/gqAYMx34euU
  
  
r/AMD_stock for more AMD DD"
2021-06-01 10:58:40,wallstreetbets,"The big reason why AMD went after Tesla first was because all car companies are desperately trying to copy Tesla. Just look at Ford's big Tesla inspired tablet in their electric cars.

With this move, other car manufacturers will be coming to AMD to get the same thing in their cars so they can compete. AMD will not have to go to them. $$$"
2021-06-01 00:43:57,wallstreetbets,My $75 2022 calls gonna go brrrrrrrrr
2021-06-01 00:35:58,wallstreetbets,Basically more money for TSMC to which the fab they are building can't be made fast enough.
2021-06-01 00:40:36,wallstreetbets,And SAMSUNG.
2021-06-01 00:45:07,wallstreetbets,Thanks for DD getting calls on both AMD & TSLA at open 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-01 03:37:05,wallstreetbets,"85C 6/16, fingers crossed"
2021-06-01 13:11:21,wallstreetbets,I saw this coming and still sold lmfaoo I’m so fucking dumb
2021-06-01 04:42:42,wallstreetbets,100 @ avg $83. Come pick me up! AMD has been going sideways for way too long
2021-06-01 00:43:38,wallstreetbets,"So, now AMD won't be paid from that account."
2021-06-01 08:57:43,wallstreetbets,"As much as I love AMD and hold AMD stock, this affects nothing since they already sell everything they make"
2021-06-01 01:03:24,wallstreetbets,"TSLA 1,000 Dec 17 Calls 🚀"
2021-06-01 02:33:19,wallstreetbets,Hope so my 80c expires Friday.  Let's moon
2021-06-01 04:27:13,wallstreetbets,"Great, as if it wasn't hard enough to buy AMD hardware already >\_<"
2021-06-01 10:11:10,wallstreetbets,But yet we can’t get Ps5s 😂
2021-06-01 12:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Also Hanna power Samsung mobile graphics soon enough, was a light mention in yesterday’s presentation. So to me they r clearly expanding there reach with customers for there graphics, ps5 and Xbox powered my amd, soon Tesla and Samsung. This is great to diversify from just those who want PC Cards. Cpus killing it, server market what does intel have in the near term that is ganna compete, I don’t see a strong competitor there for at least a couple years so just a market for them to steel from intel. Desktop cpu freaken 3d stalking ups the cache a lot, which can give very large gains based on the application. 

From my point of view this is now a company that is letting there products do the talking. Personally I think based on how there newest gpus came out, unless nvidia has a very large uplift that is probably a market where they can start dominating."
2021-06-01 00:26:08,wallstreetbets,This has been known I think since last summer
2021-06-01 04:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Only for model S and X, 11% of current production, and sliding. This doesn't seem like a big catalyst for amd unless model x and model s come roaring. Most growth expected in model y and 3 which still use Intel."
2021-06-01 03:22:05,wallstreetbets,Fuck me I just reduced my AMD position last week
2021-06-01 07:55:28,wallstreetbets,But Tesla is a cum company.
2021-06-01 05:05:04,wallstreetbets,AMD is one of the best if they add Tesla as a customer
2021-06-01 05:13:00,wallstreetbets,Yessssssss
2021-06-01 13:23:07,wallstreetbets,Is this not like old news? Could've sworn this was announced like six months ago
2021-06-01 03:46:01,wallstreetbets,Better buy those calls then I guess
2021-06-01 10:43:05,wallstreetbets,I loaded up on AMD $140c 01/22 during the dip. Easy $150 EOY.
2021-06-01 13:23:00,wallstreetbets,lol. Tesla really putting the new XSX SoC into the new Model S/X HW4.
2021-06-01 17:01:21,wallstreetbets,once again burnt again by amd. Just cannot hold any gains.
2021-06-01 09:08:10,wallstreetbets,Fuck Elon

2021-06-01 13:11:12,wallstreetbets,Thats a TSMC technology though. Everyones gonna be using it.
2021-06-01 14:06:52,wallstreetbets,"It's not simply 'copying Tesla'. If that were the case everyone else would have ditched their gauge clusters too, but most haven't, because they put them in front of the driver for a reason in the first place. 

I'd hazard this is about saving an absolute fuckton of cash by not having to source a whole bunch of switchgear, levers, knobs, buttons, etc. for your vehicles. It also happens to have the effect of letting them charge a premium for having rid themselves of some massive costs.

Edit: agree with your conclusion, btw. Very long on AMD."
2021-06-01 00:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you, also congrats."
2021-06-01 01:29:57,wallstreetbets,jesus how much were those calls!?

2021-06-01 07:14:15,wallstreetbets,They got rain so that’s a plus!
2021-06-01 04:07:17,wallstreetbets,"Have some itm calls...with some 85 strike calls I sold against them.  Going to roll the ones I sold up, not trying to get called yet.

2021-06-01 13:01:55,wallstreetbets,I have a modest number of JUN 18 21 $80 calls that have been sucking. I  have been worried that they were destined to a lost porn post but maybe it will turn around.

Kind of how expanding any business works."
2021-06-01 03:06:23,wallstreetbets,Burry footing that bill for WSB 😁
2021-06-01 00:37:41,wallstreetbets,It has not been confirmed until now. AMD just spilled the beans in their computex keynote... https://youtu.be/gqAYMx34euU
2021-06-01 10:38:25,wallstreetbets,"It's in the updated model S and X, meaning when the Y and 3 get updated, they will move to AMD. Usual car infotainment upgrade cycle, most expensive cars get the newest gear first. Model Y and 3 will come."
2021-06-01 03:56:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your sacrifice
2021-06-01 08:35:36,wallstreetbets,Gotta sell them while they are cheap!
2021-06-01 10:31:03,wallstreetbets,All you have to do now is buy high to complete the ape initiation
2021-06-01 09:09:26,wallstreetbets,True.
2021-06-01 17:59:32,wallstreetbets,It’s the arb
2021-06-01 12:21:19,wallstreetbets,that is what you have been trained to think. good chance this is a head fake. waaaait for iiit...
2021-06-01 17:03:39,wallstreetbets,You called it. Any good news for and means drop in price. Atleast you can time puts?
2021-06-01 09:57:14,wallstreetbets,"If she wants to take over the world they should introduce AMD brand SSDs that just pack loads of SLC NAND modules into a 3.5"" box and sell it $10/TB and just wipe out the mechanical storage market.  I think the whole memory/storage space is rife with corruption and price-fixing, though, and Dr. Su might be wise to just stay out of that game... one can dream, though."
2021-06-01 12:47:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I have both an AMD gpu and cpu. They've been running without issue for 10+ years now! Not even noticing any serious performance issues after all this time. Only thing I needed to replace in that time was the powersupply. And I need to add some more memory sticks, because browsers are RAM-whores now. Sure as fuck got my money's worth I'd say."
2021-06-01 12:29:41,wallstreetbets,AMD GPUs are fine though?
2021-06-01 07:08:07,wallstreetbets,Scalpers taking advantage. Pretty fucking annoying when this company should be $100+.
2021-06-01 09:24:07,wallstreetbets,Gives me time to add to my position
2021-06-01 02:22:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean, AMD has already gone up big time over the past few years. It used to be a penny stock."
2021-06-01 10:45:38,wallstreetbets,Like Amazon

2021-06-01 10:02:34,wallstreetbets,toward the end. but the entire presentation is worth watching.
2021-06-01 14:43:34,wallstreetbets,"did you watch that video. Lisa from AMD said they helped develop the tech with TSM. that should mean some exclusive period for amd only, and also maybe some royalties when others use it.

edit:where the downvotes come from? have a look at hbm. amd had the exclusive on it when it was first released, as amd worked with tsm to develop it. at least the same will happen hear, and if amd is lucky, they had enough hand in development that they MIGHT even get royalties (prob not)."
2021-06-01 09:45:20,wallstreetbets,He probably bought them in like 2019 for cents
2021-06-01 10:56:39,wallstreetbets,Bottleneck is TSM right now... No fabs can keep up with demand
2021-06-01 10:48:59,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, maybe not - as you point out, x and s are premium, and it might be something they leave off the ""budget"" cars, the 3 and y. They did just remove lumbar support from 3 and y because people weren't using them, and they are under price pressure with supplies. 

However, if you're bullish on self driving, then it stands to reason that all cars would get the AMD chips due to the idea of gaming while being driven by your car. 

I'm a bit more bearish on self driving - I think the prospects for self driving from a regulatory standpoint have a long way to go. The tech might get there in a couple years, but if the laws and regulations aren't ready it doesn't matter."
2021-06-01 11:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Tbh mechanical drive business is already dying. That’s why STX and WDC shifted gears away from the segment, so there isn’t much of a return to made by killing the segment.

AMD should start be pushing to increase their product supply. That’s the biggest factor holding them back and they’re at the mercy of TSM’s fab capability. Perhaps a little corporate espionage might be beneficial in the future 😉"
2021-06-01 15:29:41,wallstreetbets,"You must be running R9 290s, classic."
2021-06-01 10:14:25,wallstreetbets,"give some time and it'll easily go up.

they are just doing everything right imo"
2021-06-01 02:31:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah been in and out since around $8. But last earnings were a grand slam by anyone's measure. WS crunched the price down because of the Xilinx deal.
2021-06-01 08:54:19,wallstreetbets,"AMD also has forward earnings of 35 and growing almost 2x YoY

If it stays the same price until 2022 it will have a forward earnings multiple in the teens. How can that happen to a company growing 40%-90% every year?

And it's not like the demand for GPUs or CPUs is dropping"
2021-06-01 09:30:55,wallstreetbets,"AMD 2020   
Revenue: $9.7 B  
NET Income: $2.5B  
Market CAP: \~$97B

NVDA 2020   
Revenue: $16.7B   
NET Income: $4.3B  
CAP: \~$400B  


AMD does not look overvalued, and most probably will pass +$200B in next years"
2021-06-01 11:18:07,wallstreetbets,For now.  So perhaps it’s a good opportunity to load up while we can.
2021-06-01 07:03:12,wallstreetbets,"Everyone keeps saying ""cause of Xilinx"" but nobody says why. Can you?"

2021-06-01 19:20:52,wallstreetbets,"It takes three or four years to build a fab. ASML is also behind on shipments. They already started new ones earlier, but don't expect much more volume until 2023."

2021-06-01 09:53:43,wallstreetbets,"So far, Intel shows no signs that it is willing to do what is necessary to catch up.  AMD still has a ton of market they're going to consume.  I don't know why you think demand will ever fall as part of people going back to offices.  Most of the high-margin growth is in cloud infrastructure and company resources aren't going to revert to on-prem datacenters that the companies have to deal with.  Third-party managed datacenters (cloud) will just continue to expand.  Investors should expect steady growth, as there's no real barriers in place and AMD are the ones doing all the innovation in the space while their main competitor is structured in a way that makes innovation as difficult as possible for them."
2021-06-01 12:06:56,wallstreetbets,"How will Intel catch up with TSMC? They might, but odds are they won't. TSMC has customers and volume to commit to massive capex, that even Intel will struggle to match."

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Housing (2007 again?) Just curious about what the apes think about the housing market? I work for a high end ($1m+) general contractor and I think you'd have to be brain dead to build or buy right now.


Housing is through the roof because money is cheap, but if you think there were TP and gas shortages, try to buy land right now. Then check insulation prices. Then check lumber. Then check literally everything else. You're 30% over the 10yr average for same home.


Why are homes flying off the shelf when they shouldn't be? Talk to anyone you know in construction, we are over balls deep in work and we can't sustain demand. Housing is in a state of emergency and when this bitch corrects itself it'll reverberate like it's 2008.


GME is/was cool and all, but US housing is about to remind the world what real movement looks like.

Edit: not saying we're repeating 2008, just that in 08' the US housing market swong a golf club at the world's ballsack/markets and we're winding up again. Maybe this time we'll use a lead pipe or a baseball bat, who knows. Won't be 2x4 though because they're too expensive."
2021-06-01 01:10:04,wallstreetbets,The cheaper the money (interest rate) the higher the price of the house because at the end of the day you are qualified to buy a house according to your monthly payment compared with annual income. Historical low interest means high prices. When/if interest goes back up the price of house will go down.
2021-05-31 22:38:57,wallstreetbets,I’ve been trying to buy and it’s absurd. Listings are going for 10-20% over listing price
2021-06-01 01:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Nobody has mentioned that people's income has remained flat. That means people are spending 50% plus on their home. People are looking at the house as a monthly payment and not looking at the cost of the home. 

The one thing the pandemic showed us was that the average person has no savings."
2021-05-31 23:36:45,wallstreetbets,"My parents bought and rehabbed a house a few years ago.  Just sold it for $150,000 over 2019 appraisal price.  They even get to stay in the house until they finish building their new home for a few months.  Cash now, move out later. It’s insane"
2021-05-31 23:30:56,wallstreetbets,Parts of New England you have offer $100k over asking to have chance to buy.
2021-05-31 22:36:27,wallstreetbets,There is also artificially held down supply by various COVID-19 regulations preventing evictions
2021-05-31 23:18:34,wallstreetbets,"The housing in my area has always been generally affordable. But after covid, most tech companies who realized that their workers could work remotely, ruined this area. There is big tech about 100 miles from here. Now there is a flood of people who moved here and surrounding cities. They got to keep their high wages from working in tech companies, but no commute.

2021-05-31 23:17:11,wallstreetbets,"its called asset price inflation... Inflation happens regardless of whether the CPI registers it. This is the cantillon effect at work. Also, don't count on the FED raising rates significantly until this reeeeaaallly gets out of hand because most companies are leveraged to high heaven."
2021-05-31 23:13:12,wallstreetbets,yeah its getting beyond insane. 500/600k houses getting cash bids 100K over asking. Came across one listing where the owners closed 3 months ago and just relisted it at 100k over what they paid—-this was a $550K house lmao
2021-05-31 23:13:51,wallstreetbets,"Not only buying/building homes. Rent is going through the roof as well. I live in Driggs, ID and I've seen a bedroom in a shared apartment going for $1800/month. I've been thinking an '08 scenario is definitely incoming for a while now"

Edit: should mention I’m in Canada, in a historically LCOL area"
2021-05-31 23:31:17,wallstreetbets,"Housing in 2007 was full of rapid speculation, fraud, non-existent qualifying measures In place.. I'm not 100% but pretty sure most of your rules around buying a home have changed since the crash. 

I'm from Canada where housing is even worse, and do mortgage underwriting there... we qualify ppl at 4.79% when actual mortgage rates are like 1.5-2.2% (qual rate changing to 5.25% tomorrow), not stopping prices from going through the roof here. 

Drivers:
- can't build fast enough/supply is slow to react compared to demand
- lack of land available to develop in key areas
- mellenials are entering key home buying years creating huge wave of new demand
- low rates
- fear of waiting even longer for prices to rise even more I.e. fomo

They've been saying we are due for a housing crash for years... but in reality, demand just keeps rising faster than supply can keep up."
2021-06-01 00:12:37,wallstreetbets,"Smart money knows inflation is already here and they're moving to hedge.   Real estate is being bought up by investment companies and overseas investors, commodity prices are soaring,  CMBS' are fraught with fraud like the residential mortgages of the 2000s.  Some kind of shell game is happening in the reverse repo market recently. My mind is already made up and my retirement accounts have been rebalanced.  The music is about to fucking stop."

2021-05-31 22:46:15,wallstreetbets,My wife and I were very fortunate to close on our house literally while the pandemic just started. Since then our homes value has shot up
2021-05-31 23:09:03,wallstreetbets,"I live in Austin and things are positively nutballs right now.  Around the end of last year, prices jumped like 25% overnight.   Every house was getting dozens of offers and people were going in at 100k over list and NOT getting the property.    People are foregoing eventualities and doing whatever it takes to get the house they want.

  
We've got a good economy, lots of tech jobs and rich assholes from California, New York, Chicago, etc are all selling for millions and coming here to throw money at houses that are cheap,relatively speaking.  


My realtor also tells me that while we usually have 1800 houses for sale, right now it's about 800.  Covid put building new houses behind and demand is through the ceiling.  


A terrible time to buy.  A wonderful time to sell."
2021-06-01 12:57:55,wallstreetbets,"Everyone going to say we're going to crash but down realize that your not only competing with other future home owners but also large hedge funds. 

Right now, more than ever - PE, HedgeFunds, Investors, and Joint Groups are taking stock off the shelves like never before. 

The individual owner is now the minority in the housing market. You best believe that housing is a commodity/investment and no longer a primary right anymore. 

Unless governments unilaterally oppose international funds, PE and Hedge Funds from purchasing property we wont ever see prices like this again. 

Renting will be the norm."
2021-05-31 23:19:42,wallstreetbets,Just sold my house a few weeks ago. The buyer’s mortgage company waived the appraisal. As long as the price doesn’t look outrageous it gets stamped through. This is the top.
2021-05-31 23:41:20,wallstreetbets,Posts like this let us know we still aren’t at the top yet. All the bears “I’ll wait a couple years til I market cools off” need to capitulate and buy before it goes tits up

2021-06-01 07:48:19,wallstreetbets,2008 is a lazy comparison. People with 500 credit scores aren't getting loans for 500k homes today. It's a very different environment. There could be a correction if commodity prices retreat and interest rates are increased. But we're not going to see every major financial institution go bankrupt overnight.

2021-06-01 03:23:09,wallstreetbets,"What’s going to crash the market this time is HELOCs. Mark this comment. Inflation is already at extremely unhealthy levels. The Fed is going to be forced to raise rates sooner than anticipated... this will fuck everyone who pulled hundreds of thousands on their HELOCs. Then they’re going to be forced to sell to get out of it, inventory is going to rise as a result, compounded with already higher rates, and you’re all of a sudden in a downward spiral. But never underestimate the power of tax payers bailing out the credit unions and banks who gave out these stupid HELOCs. Word of advice, if you can’t afford what you pulled at 5-6% per year and if you don’t have a plan to pay it back in 10 years, DONT PULL A SECOND ON YOUR HOUSE!"
2021-05-31 22:58:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m torn on this as you say builders are overwhelmed by demand but can’t meet supply. I see prices continuing to go up and would only see a pull back if inflation and market crash create an overwhelming number of foreclosures, even then it would take a few years post crash. I would love for you to tell me I’m wrong and it’ll come without a market crash or hyperinflation as I’m not currently a home owner."
2021-05-31 22:41:43,wallstreetbets,"The funny thing is that vacant, empty, unused land covers and surrounds our cities.

Can you say manufactured shortages?

We have a nation of empty dirt, we throw alternative building materials in the ocean and force the bottom 10% of our society to live outside sometimes.

Property ownership is hitting a new low in terms of monopolistic manipulation. What if HHI were applied to rental unit ownership and correlated with price increases and rate of homelessness?  


What would happen if large actors bought chunks of the housing market in every city, and then left all those homes empty? Would it take a bubble, and then exacerbate it further by restricting the supply of housing even more by taking homes off the market while not satisfying housing demand?  
Sounds like Goldman move to me."
2021-06-01 00:03:02,wallstreetbets,Phx housing is strong. Unless a major event causes people to not move here.....prices will continue. 2400 houses available as of right now under $1M for 7M+ people. No way you can crash anytime soon with those numbers.
2021-06-01 02:11:14,wallstreetbets,"You are thinking about this the wrong way, the crash of '08 was because the mortgage industry was handing out garbage ARM loans left and right to anyone they could get their claws on. The current boon is a demand based unstoppable force that won't see break until about 3 years from now when the homebuilders finally finish the projects they are now ramping up to meet the demand.  
I work industry, they haven't seen anything like what is happening right now ever."
2021-06-01 04:06:30,wallstreetbets,"I was an REO listing specialist for nine different banks/ asset managers from 2006-2012. I sold foreclosed properties for all those years, at prices cheaper than cars. 
IMO we’re at the same point in housing now that we were in 2006 pre-housing shit bomb. Houses were flying off the shelves then, too, for top dollar; right up until they weren’t. The house of cards that was mortgage backed securities imploded and you saw what came after. Did anyone go to jail? Hell no! They paid off politicians via PACs and government agencies via ‘fines’ aka ‘the cost of doing business’ and kept on keeping on. They got bailed out and continued like nothing happened. 

Money managers and hedge funds have been busy during the pandemic, fucking with the stock market and naked short selling companies into bankruptcy, while they raked in 🤑$$$, just like they did back then. They’ve made trillions of dollars while the little guy has gotten screwed. As per usual. 
Well guess what? The whole shit show is on the verge of collapse again. Stock and housing markets are fucked. Greed driven chaos is right around the corner. Again. 

Do your own research, don’t take my word for it. Info is out there if you care to look. 
We all need a place to live, so get something affordable and strap in. 
It’s a shame that poor people already hurt and will suffer even more. Look at all the homelessness. Violence. Despair. Look at the ever rising cost of living compared to the ever stagnant price we’re paid to work. 

The system is killing us. It’s time to revolt. I think the pandemic lockdown will be a blessing in disguise for many. We see what is most valuable to us and it isn’t money. It’s time. 

Stuff is going to get rowdy over the next two years. Get ready."
2021-06-01 09:28:31,wallstreetbets,"I keep thinking back to the start of the pandemic when people were like: ""Oh good the economy is crashing again, I'll buy a house for cheap."""
2021-06-01 12:16:13,wallstreetbets,"We underproduced homes for 10+ years, if you are in the industry you know this.  No only did we not produce homes, we didn't produce enough lots.  So we went into 2020 with a supply imbalance.  Now we have the lowest interest rates in history, and the fed is buying MBS.

We are also in a four year stretch where we have the most replacement buyers in history. 2020 to 2024 will be the best stretch in history for builders, as mellenials buy more homes and boomers are downsizing.

So you have those two facts, then you add a PANDEMIC, which fucked the supply chains.  Now you have record lumber prices, all other materials are increasing in prices but not at the same rate. Skilled Labor shorter (average plumber is 55+ years of age), lot shortage (it also takes longer to take Raw land through approvals then before).

Mortages are actually harder to get and the poeple who get them have rock solid credit.

2021-06-01 13:09:07,wallstreetbets,"Canadian here: in true WSB fashion we just paid $150k over the asking price for a house. The market is so insane at the moment where I am In Alberta. The house had 31 viewings in about 36 hours and there were 11 offers put in on the house. The asking prices are just where the bidding starts. We purchased the house without even having placed our current home on the market. After closing the new house, we put our tiny townhome for sale for 130k more than we purchased it for 4 years ago and someone paid another $50k more than the asking price with ZERO conditions. (Probably also a member of this sub) Not even a home inspection. We are currently living in the twilight zone everyone!"

2021-06-01 03:17:24,wallstreetbets,"The main issue is the easy money policy, but oddly I have seen same homes come off and back to market after 1 year and I’ve been tracking my area. Yes homes are flying off the rack but I’ve also seen some homes with wackiness in last 2-3 year span. It feels artificially manufactured:


1. There’s the rent moratorium - once that ends sellers might be itching to sell.
2. The forbearance and the foreclosure halt. 
3. FOMO and some throttling from the whale investments in real estate

Edit: adding a few more factors

4. Easy money - which affords people to keep multiple houses

5. Reverse repo - which means that there’s more cash and not enough assets

6. Family funds going bust - this is indirect but affects banks and lending


These things seem to prop it up and the question is how long? I think there is a huge bubble about to pop. If you study 1900s history you will see similarities to now. Artificial real estate boom caused by the war and the veterans housing back then was creating a frothy market. The populist movement which is now what’s happening with GME / amc and other meme stocks. Then finally the boom in investing in the financial markets. These were all equations in the 1929-1930 crisis. 

With that said lesson is that we’re headed for what you said a major crisis coming soon....not to create fear and panic but more to look at what the right actions are."

2021-06-01 11:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates are so cheap that weird things actually make financial sense right now.

Take a $650,000 home:

Out of your $3,000 mortgage, $1500 of it goes into equity (right back in your own pocket).  

Then you get to write off the other $1500 interest, giving you about $600 back through lower taxes.

Or, if this is an investment property, you get to depreciate it at 1/27th of the purchase price per year and use 1031 to never repay the make-believe depreciation. That's  $2,000/month.

If you are paying yourself $1500/mo equity and depreciating $2,000/mo on a $3,000/mo mortgage, who cares what the house sold for or rents for?"
2021-06-01 12:46:45,wallstreetbets,"Oregon is an insanely hot market ($20k-50k above asking getting turned down), where house values have way outpaced rent. Once the moratoriums are done, I imagine this bubble is going to pop, at least for the state if not the entirety of the US.

Houses going for sale in the morning sold in a few hours for $20k-40k more than listing price. That's in my less than desirable area, areas that are more appealing, closer to city or closer to things like shopping are going for way more. I just don't understand what's going on, tried to research but honestly it's not my background and I do not know what to research.

2021-06-01 00:13:23,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the industry. 

It's nothing like 2007. Back then, anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage. It's actually kinda tough right now. 

There's no way you'll see mass foreclosures. The federal government doesn't even allow them right now, but in 2007 the policy was the opposite. 

The reason for insane prices is that inflation is a reality. 

Government debt is high and banks are printing money. 

I doubt home prices will drop much in the future, Although 20-30% is possible in markets above $150/sf.

If prices go up another 25% then yes I'll be a little worried. But where i live, prices have been so low for years that they can safely go up some. 

I do think a housing correction is possible, but i think it'll be about 1/3 as bad as 2007 if even that."

All my nieghbors are shocked at how high the houses are selling 15% over asking price before the house officially hits the market is now common. That is not sustainable, especially since all the long-time residents say, they couldn't afford a house in this neighborhood if they were buying today. That's crazy! It's beyond a ""Supply Issue"". It's more like a combination of Speculation, foreign investors, and young buyer's FOMO. Young couples always have this fear, and it leads them to make impulse irrational buys. Especially, the fact that house prices never slowed during the Pandemic, that should be the first sign, that something is wrong. No amount of spin, can justify that."

No. In 2007, if you worked at Wendy’s you could get a 400k loan. Loan officers were giving out loans left and right trying to make that commission. It’s a lot stricter now. They check income to make sure you can afford the monthly payments."
2021-06-01 01:10:34,wallstreetbets,Idk I don't think it's really a bubble. You don't have anywhere near the same circumstances that you did in 2007. The housing boom right now is a result of record low interest rates and everyone hopping on that train. Even if you have a huge slow down in the market I don't think these people are going to start defaulting on their loans. It's fairly invovled to get qualified for a mortgage loan now.
2021-06-01 01:15:06,wallstreetbets,"Ok, everyone saying this shit gonna crash/correct but everyday I open Zillow and look at the historical charts. Housing prices has been steadily rising and rent alongside with it, I tried putting in an offer for a house and some fucker pays 15% over asking price or others waiving contingencies and paying with cash. The last housing crash was due to banks giving out NINJA (no income no job) loans to bums. Lo and behold those bums cannot afford paying their mortgage(s) and defaults. But with the reforms from Obama's era, banks are no longer able to do that again so I'm really not seeing the correction (maybe in California to tech boom) any time soon. So help me alleviate the FOMO and explain why right now is the wrong time to buy? From where I stand, there is always a high demand for housing (as from my experience with people paying over asking price and waiving contingencies just so they can snap up the house)."
2021-06-01 02:12:00,wallstreetbets,"2007 was about bad debt.  People were getting interest-only variable-rate loans based on income that they didn't really have which they had no hope of being able to continue to pay off they couldn't refinance at the same or lower rate.

2021-06-01 02:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh you didn't know about the housing bubble that's going to pop soon? Welp now you do. Big Corporations and Investment Firms, have been buying and building all the housing they can touch. Why? So they can rent it out to us.. which is a self fulfilling type of deal. We rent because buying is too expensive, buying becomes more expensive because corp and firms are buying in cash, to rent to us at higher prices than would pay in mortgage. And we will save and save and still can't buy the house because it's been purchased cash, not even a chance to bid."

2021-06-01 04:15:00,wallstreetbets,"I'll throw my two cents in even though it'll get buried here. I hate.

I don't have enough to put a payment down on a home and have money leftover to make continual payments and maintenance, even if it was pre boom. I have to rent an apartment, which is fine for the most part, aside from the fact that I can't rent a 1 bed apartment just cuz they're so damn expensive (getting up to $1500 where I live in Washington). This is both due to the housing boom and also due to a high military population. I can work around this a bit behaving roommates, which cuts personal rent to $800-900/month.

I'm currently going to school and paying out of pocket for it because financial aid sucks dick and won't give me aid cuz I essentially have 4 parents (divorced when I was young). I decided to start an account for stocks earlier this year and slowly put money into so I can help make passive income while I shuffle school, work, and bills. I've somehow survived this far into the pandemic, and dammit I'm not gonna stop now."

2021-06-01 11:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Housing is not just through the roof because money is cheap - many people saved a lot of money throughout the pandemic by not doing the leisure activities they usually do. It doesn't take $400,000 to buy a $400,000 house. It just takes $20,000 for a 5% down payment. What does this mean? Well, it could mean that people are getting into loans based on the cashflow they have during Covid. What happens when they now have a large mortgage and start wanting to go on vacations and to nice dinners again? They will use more debt to make both things a reality. Vacations and dinners will go on the credit card, but the mortgage will prevent then necessary cashflow to pay the credit card debt. Eventually, something has to give. When this will happen? It will likely take years."
2021-06-01 12:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Those buying or building right now will never make their initial investment back.

At some point the market will correct itself."
2021-06-01 12:30:11,wallstreetbets,"Inventory is low.  
This is not 2007.  At that time you had an exaggerated debt to income ratio.  People were borrowing 5x or more than their income (if they had income) and expecting the house sale to cover their expenses and income.  So as an example: someone with an income $50k borrowing $250k and hoping they can sell it for $300k just to cover.  When prices DIDN’T rise you had a whole lot of people who got screwed.  Some resorted to fire sales, others simply lost all they put in. 
Today while the ratio is growing, this time we have a much more conservative loan process that does not allow people with little to no income to get a house. Like I said inventory is low which is pushing prices higher.  Rates are lower so people can afford the debt maintenance.  Having said that I do feel we are reaching a breaking point.  Those ratios can not go up forever. So either incomes must go up or the market goes down. And any rate increases will cool this market.  
I don’t see a coming bubble, but I do see a correction.  Inflation might be the reason."
2021-06-01 12:33:29,wallstreetbets,"The difference between now and 2007 is on the mortgage side.  I work at a mortgage reit and we purchase Mortgage Backed Securities.  In 2007, banks were giving mortgages to anyone with a pulse. Mortgages approved by banks today still have high FICO scores, low debt-to-equity ratios, etc.

Any housing market correction won't be caused by the same things as in 2007.

Now the Fed Bank is purchasing Billions of mortgage backed securities every month. When they stop, mortgage rates will rise and housing prices may take a hit.  

Either way, there is a long-term housing shortage which needs to be addressed."
2021-06-01 12:43:43,wallstreetbets,"You said it yourself. Money is cheap and the Fed has said they aren't turning off the spigot for several years. Unlike the last go around however there is no fraud and no overbuilding. Big big difference. Don't expect another 08 style crash.

 In my area houses that were selling for around 100k four years ago were selling for about 150 to 175 two years ago and now sell for 250 ish and i honestly don't expect it to slow down anytime soon"
2021-06-01 12:58:12,wallstreetbets,"A lot of these houses get the landlord special. You can slap makeup on a pig and make it pretty but it's still a pig.

There are the wealthy folks who have by in large done very well recently and they want another house.  Then you have the folks who really wanted to buy a home but couldn't afford to before.  Some of those people have been able to cobble together some bailout money together to get their own place and stop renting.

There are probably a lot of people who were in the market but wanted to wait until covid slowed down before going out and wandering around a bunch of other peoples homes too.

There are probably a lot of people moving out of cities now that they can work remotely."

2021-06-01 15:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol look at Canada. They're up to a really bad time. They haven't had any of the major corrections to the same extent the US did, so they were kept overvalued, and the bubble never truly burst, it's just been growing immensely throughout 2000s. Govts on many levels did what they could to limit supply and foster demand, including that from foreign investors, making a large chunk of the market owned by speculators, and gdp driven away from productive branches of economy and increasingly into housing.  If there was ever a perfect storm threatening the entire national economy, and wellbeings of several new generations at the same time, it's there now.

SINCE THEN housing went to the moon, blowing past fundamentals to an extent that's right now beyond the biggest housing bubbles in history. People are mortgaging for their lifelong family incomes, with savings of multiple generations spent on mere downpayments on small apartments. Throughout this flight to the moon of housing the wages have barely increased, while the productive economy has been actually contracting.

The housing prices are so out of wack that as soon as the bubble goes, all of those people will lose their own, their parents and sometimes grandparent's money in one go. It's rare that you can see systems so fundamentally broken that they are at such a high risk of wiping out so much wealth in seconds."

It's the only way I can explain the house across the street from me, 300 ft from a project roomkey homeless shelter, just selling for 200k over ask (3.7 million dollars with a grand total of 1 day on the market) Granted its brand new, and also it's that annoyingly ubiquitous cape-cod farmhouse style that people who spend too much time on social media absolutely adore. but every other house on the street is 1-2million and the builder threw it up as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Building materials are probably not coming down until the end of 2022. Around that time or possible a year or so later we will see interest rates begin to rise most likely. By that time we could see another 8 to 10 percent appreciation in house prices , and that is a very conservative estimate. Then we may see prices start to fall."

There is an absolute blind eye in the NYC metro area to this growth and it is balancing the flight of people from the city area, otherwise the numbers would look far worse. Home prices are melting up, the value of money has always been the major factor. Watch for the real loosening of lending terms to know we are reaching the cycle price top."

2021-06-01 00:31:59,wallstreetbets,"it’s not the same since the housing bubble was in fact a mortgage crisis, and this is not the case we have during the pandemics.

the people buying houses are not reaching out to banks to make big loans and get their homes, instead they are spending their savings - more than observed in 2007. the impacts should be very different from the ones of 2008, for short is safe to say that a fiscal cliff is somewhat near and international interest rates are going to the moon sometime in the future. the crisis is not building up from the housing prices, just look at new Zealand, the economy is solid and the house prices are already on the moon 🌝"

2021-06-01 01:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Could see supply improving, but I don't see prices coming back down anytime soon. Yes, demand is outrageous at the moment and market is absolutely bonkers, but this is in no way going to lead to a housing crash anytime soon. You can google ""housing market bubble"" and read 3000 posts on why current lending is nowhere even close to 2008, and why demand is more than sustainable this time around, so I won't go into that. Instead, here's what I see.

1) Millennials are coming of age. Boomers are coming of age.

I'm one of them. Just bought my first home and it's way under the typical threshold of allowable income. A lot of my friends have as well. We're all buying homes (and thanks to dirt cheap rates) for less than 20% of our monthly take home. Rates are finally cheap enough for us to afford that starter home. Yes it's being reflected in home price, but an increase in supply will help drive prices back down into a reasonable range. Finding a healthy median and a 5-10% pullback (which I expect to see later this summer) is much different than a ""crash"" and much more sustainable. At the same time we're trying to buy homes to start out families, Boomers are trying to downsize.

2) The Great Reshuffling (credit Richard Barton)

It's happening, but nobody seems to give it much merit. Covid showed tech companies how efficiently they can operate without the overhead that is the office. Their eyes are open and it's two-fold. Not only is the absurd overhead of Palo Alto office space no longer necessary, they're now recruiting from a pool of talent that is the entire world. Sucks as a software engineer (me) as the industry will now approach more ""perfectly competitive"" salaries, but in the short term there is a massive gap to close between the bay area and the rest of the world.

Consider this. Along the coast housing is absurdly priced. Go anywhere inland and we've been hanging in the mid-2s to low-3s for a while now. The median cost of a home in Seattle is like 800K. Median price in Palo Alto is I think? 1.4M. Houses in the West-Midwest have a median cost between 250-350K. A good portion of the engineers/investors/what have you, hate being along the coast. At least the ones that I know. Not only that, a majority of these individuals are Millennials themselves with absurd salaries to afford the absurd coastal home prices. Tell these people they could leave the coast, retain their salary/career and you're going to see central US homes approach coastal median home prices. They could buy 3 homes and be forking over the same amount per month, especially at these rates. 

There's a million other reasons, but these are the two I see as the most important in driving continued demand. Currently were in a gridlock. Nobody is selling because they don't have anywhere to go once they sell. As more homes come on the market this summer and fall were going to see the dominos start to fall. Homes will start flying off the shelves and velocity of the housing market will go bonkers. Like out of this world bonkers. Prices may pull back a little bit, but there's entirely too much pent up demand (people living in campers searching for a home, all storage units completely rented with intermediary movers until something finally hits the market) for this shit-show to slow down anytime soon."
2021-06-01 09:04:03,wallstreetbets,"Dude where have you been? This was a hot topic to discuss like a year ago. You’re also a fuckin grade A retard for putting (2007 again?) in your title just for attention. 

Any autist with a Google box or the ability to read sees how this is nothing like 2007. Where are all the unqualified people getting mortgages they can’t afford? Oh wait, it’s the exact opposite where only the most qualified borrowers or cash offers are getting accepted. Homie over here asking where is all this money coming from after 1/3 of the circulating money supply has been printed in the last 2 years.

Builders making these retarded threads instead of building out their job sites is probably why we have a supply problem. Stick to what you’re good at."
2021-06-01 12:39:22,wallstreetbets,"A correction or stabilization, maybe, but I don't think a crash.

Right now, extra demand is being driven into the suburbs as (1) civil unrest increases in cities, (2) covid+wfh changes working styles and commutes, and (3) debt is super duper cheap

Eventually, the urban emmigration will settle down and debt will become more expensive. Demand will lower, but I do not suspect it will drop so significantly below pre-covid levels so as to induce a major price shock.

2021-06-01 00:22:08,wallstreetbets,"You can’t read the market when you have too much opinion on “why” it should be at a certain value. If you’re not in the market you’re being left behind and angry. The government cares a bit (if it gets so overpriced that the news and public opinion put pressure on), but that level is still very very high. 

The market itself (minus government policy) doesn’t really care if deserving people can’t get a home. The economics of renting (and spending a lot of your income on rent) has been shown to work in Asia and Europe, so far as society does not collapse.  It’s not fun though, when people with good jobs really have to accept renting for the rest of their life and not being able to build equity in their home. 

The market is not going to crash because it’s gone up another 20% or another income tranche can’t afford to buy. There’s always more money out there. Sounds silly but, we all live in the gme/amc world, and should know by now there’s more money out there... more that we can imagine. 

Over not a great picture. What can you do? I’d try my best to get a down payment anyway I can. Be it crazy saving, borrowing from someone, yolo’ing on amc next week. Finding someone to get you a mortgage (ask around, someone will be able to help you; check with agents that seem to turn over a lot of business if you can’t find one yourself). Then pick an area you can afford, you might need to further and further out. But stay smart, and check that your area isn’t appreciating more than close by areas (don’t buy the worst value...even if it’s all expensive) .

The Bull housing market is not going anywhere as long as interest rates and stimulus stay around and it looks like years of it still.

I think we’re gonna see ridiculous ($6+/gal) prices coming in around the time of the child tax credits rolling out mid July. 

This crazy gas hike is what I’m using to bet on a wood market collapse late summer as well. Naturally, all supplies for building a house are going to skyrocket (even further than now) with fuel prices skyrocketing. Deep 9/17 puts on WY and WOOD as well.

Didn’t decline a single bit. So now they are at a point where if they don’t buy now, they won’t be able to afford the price it’ll be in the future. With the level of supply, their worries are warranted. It will take massive reform around building to fix the supply issue.

Supply is being squeezed by that and covid regulations restricting many evictions. When GME squeeze happens and banks begin to go bust, those housing assets will be put to auction and the market will potentially be flooded with supply and could tank housing prices. Things are about to get very interesting over the next few months."
2021-06-01 01:47:14,wallstreetbets,"A realtor I know did a deep dive on this and much of the issue is that new construction never recovered from the pre 2008 levels..indeed they were only about 50%...leading to a major shortage in the market.

2021-06-01 09:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Building is fine. Honestly not building is brain dead. Building is still less expensive as far as what you get for that money than buying right now and for most people who are just looking for a primary residence who cares if the market corrects and the value of their home goes down 20-30 percent, assuming you're going to be there 15-20 years you'll make that up and then some more than likely. I also don't think they market will correct like that. If you're worried about a correctly like that then you could cash out refinance and pull the equity out if you have a better investment to make in the interim. 

If you are like me though and developing houses and condos you can make a mint right now so its a great investment. Affordable housing is the hot market because supply is low across the board. 

This has nothing to do with 2008 either this is purely people want to buy and cant and investors who can buy are snatching everything up. As soon as builders can exhaust investors funds and put some supply back into the market things will level out. Right now the reason lumber is up 300% is because literally everyone is racing to put supply back into the market. 2008 was banks giving loans to people who couldn't afford them, then when we hit a recession, nobody could afford their loans. Now the government is buying mortgages at an insane clip for the last year or two. So the government is not going to want you to default because they are not in the business of selling houses. They are also talking about letting people refi to a 40 year mortgage right now just to make sure 2008 doesn't happen again."

Now people are looking for a safe place to put their CASH.  Even if paying 10-15% more then it’s worth today, it’s fine for them.   They know eventually the market will stabilize and go upward.   Like buying stocks at $100 knowing they may drop to $80 in the short term but go to $200-250 in the longer term.   It’s a safe bet with inflation on the Horizon and the lingering word of a stock market collapse.

2021-06-01 03:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Ok here's how I think it could go. Basically what's happening is some people are over extending themselves into mortgages, both housing and commercial. For causes, you could say it might not be as bad as 2008, say - because of tighter mortgage controls, mortgage stress testing (in Canada anyways), pent up demand, people saving due to pandemic, working from home, supply shortage, low interest rates, government encouraging mortgage lending because it's basically a retirement plan, whatever you want, etc, etc... Ok fine. 

But anyways, point is people are redirecting their income towards a non productive market. 
That leaves less money to actually do productive things. 

Eventually the price of everything goes up because the storage/manufacturing/human resources/infrastructure to support everything depends on housing and commercial site prices. This is similar to having empty stores in NYC because businesses cannot afford to operate (30%?). We have the same thing in Vancouver Canada. But now imagine at the whole country level. It will take down everything productive with it. 

The cost of building anything civic (bridges, roads, etc...) sky rockets and the government can't develop anything( It's already happening). Ditto for any business or person attempting to build anything. You get some serious inflation. Eventually your money is worthless and nothing can move.  

People who over extended themselves on high mortgages cannot spend on anything ""non-essential.""  People who don't have mortgages won't have work because the cost of doing business and living is so high they will move or end up on the streets. Now you have no business and no labour. So the economy will tank and move somewhere else. (Ie: China, India, Bangladesh, etc...)
If you borrowed money thinking you would always have your job and that your salary would go up from here, you're out of luck when you get laid off because your job moved overseas. You sell your house or forfeit..."

2021-06-01 03:21:47,wallstreetbets,"I think something important to think about it is buying a house to live in versus as an investment - my dad and I are looking for a house and we had that conversation about prices. Since we're looking for a new house to live in, the price crashing doesn't really affect us since our house isn't getting any smaller, and my dad's job is extremely unlikely to be affected in any sort of crash. As long as prices will go back up eventually (presumably over the span of the 10+ years we may spend), I don't think buying right now if you have the capital is an especially bad idea. Lower interest rates make it nice as well. I should add that our own house itself has gained around 200k in value in the past year so it really comes out a  net zero at the end.

Fast forward to today. The issue isn't the controls or policies, its the Fed with low rates and high inflation. The cost of everything MUST go up to compete with higher wages. In the end costs have gone up and the average Joe is still further behind.

Housing is in a better place because debt levels are not as bad. People are making the payments instead of falling behind, and the total number of available units for sale is limited. So it is highly controlled. So what happens if everyone is locked in on 30 year fixed rates @ 2%... do you really think people will be moving? This supply side issue will be getting more worse instead of better any time soon. If you are a smart builder, you would phase in your construction projects so you are releasing a few at a time. This keeps the supply low and allows you to stay nimble if things go south."

* Minimal new construction in past 10 years. The housing crash severely dropped demand for housing as no one wanted to buy houses for years. While population kept increasing, housing supply never kept up
* Pent up demand - also due to housing crash, interest in housing dried up and people who would have normally bought houses from 2008 to now, decided to rent, as houses were perceived to be not as desirable. Creating a giant backlog of people who were supposed to buy if the housing crash never happened
* Millennial tsunami - millennials are the largest demographic age group in American history, even more than baby boomers.  Not only was there pent up demand, but it came from the largest population group ever. Most millennials have been working for the past 10 years and have enough savings to buy houses
* Chinese Buyer Hoarding- For the past 10 years Chinese buyers have permanently removed supply from the market. What I mean by this is: they see American houses as a swiss bank account. Remote and safe from their government. They will NEVER sell it and keep it as their emergency piggy bank if shit hits the fan back in china. They will either hold it empty or rent them out, and eventually they will just give it to their children. This effectively removes them from the supply permanently since they will never sell.
* Covid - fear causes people to rush into big decisions. That's why so many people got married and having babies and also buying houses. Work from home also created demand for more space and yard and only houses can offer a suitable environment to work from home

2021-06-01 03:47:23,wallstreetbets,"no , this is a case of inflation and low supply/high demand

there will be a correction 

the unfortunate people who need to buy now will overpay and it'll be poor value for them especially if they then need to sell in the next 10 years or so - those may lose money on the deal"
2021-06-01 03:50:27,wallstreetbets,You might think it's weird and wonder who all these people are who are buying now. The houses are being bought by Martians. They decided to take over Earth after they heard Elon's plans to start a colony on Mars.
2021-06-01 03:52:50,wallstreetbets,"I think you are wrong. I think these prices are here to stay. Look at the world around you. Population growth everywhere is going unchecked. Resources are being gobbled up by ever industry you can think of. As long as population grows, houses will be needed."

2021-06-01 03:57:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm a real estate investor and it's absolutely nuts. Prices in my area in Germany doubled since COVID.  
Even houses which need heavy renovation are more expensive than new build homes, because no land is available.  
I bought a apartment house for 315k€ 2018, it's now worth about 900k€, thats just crazy...

A heavy correction is overdue."
2021-06-01 04:00:46,wallstreetbets,"Houses always sell because people need somewhere to live and for most people, the family home will be their one and only asset. So there's always going to be demand, even if all other market indicators are bad. I've also noticed that people my age managed to save a lot of money during the pandemic and are now rushing out to buy their first house. If you want to buy a house if say wait a year. If you want to invest in housing I'd say wait for the next crash."
2021-06-01 04:05:12,wallstreetbets,Whenever commodity prices surge like this they crash even harder. In two years there will be an oversupply of lumber copper and steel. Even if housing prices don't crash the current market is unsustainable.

OSB board is the closest to GOLD Ive ever seen building materials.. SUCKS TO BE IN RESIDENTIAL CONTRUCTION, right now NO PROFIT"
2021-06-01 04:13:34,wallstreetbets,"If there is going to be a correction I don’t think we will be picking houses for cheap. If someone bought a house right now for 500k and the price drops to 350, you think they are going to sell that house for the low price? I think the demand for houses will be even greater if there is a crash. People will have no other option than to rent, with the high rent prices the new generation will have to share a house with other people. There will be 3 couples living in 1 house, they probably rent 1 car together, one coffee machine that’s being leased, 1 washing machine.   Cooking at home would be a pain in the ass so probably no use for a kitchen, food delivery will become a huge part of our lives. Invest in food delivery services, invest in agricultural land/companies also car companies that build small 2 person electric cars. With land being so bloody expensive there will be nowhere left to park a 5 seater car, and with less people having families smaller vehicles will become very popular  maybe the only means of transportation in large cities. The new normal has not arrived yet, it will come. This is my prediction."
2021-06-01 04:14:35,wallstreetbets,"I'll wait for major job losses before there is a guaranteed collapse. If lumber and supplies cost too much who knows how many could afford or will bother with new projects and it'll snowball from there.

2021-06-01 04:17:12,wallstreetbets,"In Germany, the prices are growing 10% year. Just to put this in perspective, this is a market where average price growth for housing <2% since 70s and 60% folks never own a home and rent for life. Part of it can be planned as years of lack of new housing being built/planned and of course <1% interest rates have made it insane.

Its impossible for us to find a place, everyone i know, has bought or is looking for a place. I have been saving for a down-payment and the prices go up faster than i can save. 

What surprises me is, I have family in Singapore, tiny place with homes but its cheaper to get a large apartment with gym and pool facilities there when compared to my mid sized town in Germany!"

2021-06-01 04:35:57,wallstreetbets,This time is different than 2008 people are buying with real cash over appraisal not getting some sign and move in interest only variable mortgage with no stake in the game.  There will not be a similar crash the game changed!
2021-06-01 04:39:22,wallstreetbets,"So I've been looking into building my own house but using steel framing because its supposed to be cheaper, especially since lumber is like 1000% up from what it was. Thoughts?"
2021-06-01 04:40:25,wallstreetbets,I think the difference between now and 2007 is that the market is so full of liquidity that people don t know what to do with it
2021-06-01 04:41:30,wallstreetbets,If the price of the materials used to build houses went through the roof then the house prices are justified?
2021-06-01 04:42:43,wallstreetbets,Friend of mine who works in construction says the same. Some lumber prices have doubled this year. Their purchasing manager is also saying that you the houses are not worth the money they are sold for right now. Still beats renting in a Dutch city (for now).

2021-06-01 05:19:23,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think a crash is on the horizon a correction yeah but not a crash ... the 2007 08 crash was because of the loans constructed and all the BS in that not the prices of the homes it’s like saying GameStop prices are getting higher it’s going to squeeze that wasn’t what caused the squeeze, what caused the squeeze was the dumb hedge funds shorting the crap out of it. 
This is just a huge shift in supply and demand not enough houses on the market so the supply on the market has bigger demand it will have a correction once the whole covid thing starts to level off like it is and the interest rates go up I believe but I’m not a financial advisor 😅"

2021-06-01 05:30:06,wallstreetbets,"""The market"" believes that a sustained high inflation is coming. Literary every media outlet and your screeching mother-in-law makes sure that you do.

One of the best possible asset to have - in a high inflation environment - is low yield, fixed rate debt. If you can get into debt for 2-4% fixed rate when you expect the inflation will go above 5-6% then its just free money.

Guess which asset can be bought for fixed rate ~~mortgage~~ debt..."

2021-06-01 05:53:04,wallstreetbets,"One thing to remember is there was about an 18 month gap between the places that crashed first (Southern California, Vegas, Arizona) and the places that crashed later (Seattle, for instance).

My guess is there will be some region that acts as a bellwether for others but the crash timeline will be shorter this time. If you’re paying attention and you’re lucky enough to not be in the place that’s first to fall, you can get out and sell to buyers willing to catch a falling knife before your area’s prices drop too far."

2021-06-01 07:23:34,wallstreetbets,Construction is booming. It never stopped. Essential workers bs and all. It ravaged job sites but deadlines are deadlines and they didn’t care if the crew of 35 drywall guys were out for 2+ weeks. They said find more people
2021-06-01 07:27:30,wallstreetbets,Won’t crash like 2008. This is an apples to oranges comparison.
2021-06-01 07:32:10,wallstreetbets,"The amount of government spending has to be accounted for.  They are justifying it because ‘borrowing is cheap’.  Yeah.  Today.  What happens when they can’t sell those Treasuries and are forced to increase rates?  And as we increase rates all other rates follow.

The Fed being greedy isn’t better than banks being greedy.  Worse."
2021-06-01 07:34:10,wallstreetbets,Until the banks stop handing out basically interest free loans this isn't going to stop. People don't look at the intrinsic value of building or adding onto a home all they see is what the monthly payments are going to be and dive in. Once the market falls out these new homes will not see there actual value reflected in the market for 20 years. If you build a house rite now it's the same thing as burning 30k.
2021-06-01 07:35:10,wallstreetbets,"We’re 4 million houses short of demand. How do you rectify that? It’s an infrastructural issue that was neglected for an entire decade, if not longer. The US has underbuilt for way too long. I don’t see a crash soon enough for my liking."

2021-06-01 07:38:58,wallstreetbets,"The housing market is far too complex to sum up in a post here. One of the main drivers is migration. People are leaving urban areas in droves so that’s driving demand in certain places. The covid eviction moratorium also kept a lot of houses occupied when they really should’ve been for sale and that limited supply. I just sold my house and the realtor told me there are five agents to every house listing in that area so there’s just not enough inventory. It was only in the market four days before I received an offer. You already covered the cheap money angle so I won’t mention it again. Bottom line, it’s a seller’s market and building is waaay too expensive now."

2021-06-01 08:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Real estate companies are buying up all the property, then either sitting on it, selling it at markup, or renting it out, causing an artificial shortage.

On the other end, because of property taxes being affected by home value, people are being priced out of their own homes and forced to leave - which then allows real estate companies to swoop in and take the property. It's a problem that's spiraling out of control, and quickly.

You're better off if you're in one of just a handful of states that protects home owners from rapidly increasing property values (or California, which goes so far in the other direction that it incentivizes owners to *never* move, ever).

Note that available housing supply is low, yet home ownership rates are *declining* and total housing supply is increasing. This is because a smaller number of people are owning a larger and larger amount of the total housing.

My brother is in Nebraska and I'm in Georgia, but we've both observed the same market in both places.

Personally, I'd say anyone should steer clear of any kind of investment in the housing market that you plan to sit on longer than even 3 months. Be it real estate or stocks. We're at a point now that either the bubble is going to burst on its own or state or federal governments will be forced to take action."
2021-06-01 08:05:08,wallstreetbets,My home is worth around 800k.  I've seriously considered listing it for 1m.  At the rate homes are selling for around here (usually 10-15% above asking) I figure someone is dumb enough to pay that price.

2021-06-01 08:07:19,wallstreetbets,"It is not 2007 again. That was caused by sub-prime lending. The main reason home prices have been soaring is lack of supply of houses - the number of available homes for sale has fallen by 2/3. People are staying put in their houses. Builders are building luxury homes (because of bigger margins), and affordable housing is ignored.

I stayed in an airbnb in Seattle four years ago. It was a bedroom in a townhouse and the rent for my host was $2500/month. Even people with jobs are finding it difficult to find a place to live."
2021-06-01 08:11:26,wallstreetbets,"Markets set the price. This isn’t 07 because we don’t have vacant neighborhoods listed at astronomical prices sitting for weeks on market. Like you said houses are selling in a matter of hours. Not weeks or days. I think before we see prices correct, we need to see human behavior revert. People need move back to higher congestion areas. Supply chains need to stabilize and cost of materials need to come down. And ultimately new housing starts need to pick up. With inventory in rural and suburban areas so low and new homes coming to market fetch premium prices in record time."

2021-06-01 08:15:08,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing... with inflation, the best thing to do is buy tangible, actual things. Houses for example. Doesn't matter if you take a huge loan when inflation is going to skyrocket. A 500k mortgage seems like a lot, but when the price of everything goes up and wages inflate to match it, the debt doesn't go up as well. So post inflation, 500k won't seem to bad."

Hell yes I’m selling. Suckers."
2021-06-01 08:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Honestly...I used to think a housing crash would come. But there are literally not enough places to live where I am (a bigger city in Sweden). We have been looking like crazy (2 people with high income) and there is nothing. And anything that is available you need to renovate the shit out of.

Maybe the prices will stagnate but I doubt prices will crash anytime soon. Also I have been hearing it's gonna crash for the past 5 years...I mean sooner or later, if you say it enough times, you will be right."

We are entering hypergrowth phase. Speculative frenzy is coming in the next few years.

Then we will have a correction, but it will be worse than 2008 as interest rates are near zero already. So this time printing money will not fix the problem.

We will be witnessing very interesting times.

On top of that hedging against this scenario is not just a matter of ""buying swaps"", but making sure that your life isn't affected by distribution grid and monetary collapse."

I hope this bubble pops very soon, right know prices are way up compared to average salary, seriously its unobtainable.

Just imagine paying 130 000 € for 2rooms flat, 65 m2 when average salary in capital city 1000 € netto/person, if you are in IT you start around 1200. Salaries grew by 3%.. flats 30% just within 2 years, years back it was also 2 digits grow."

2021-06-01 08:49:21,wallstreetbets,I bought because locking in a price at the start of inflation is only going to make paying off the house cheaper when the jobs feild reacts to the inflation with a pay raise.
2021-06-01 08:51:52,wallstreetbets,Idk I think a lot of people are paying in cash this time. I don’t think they’re being bought with sketchy loans. And most aren’t even being bought by people; hedge funds and pension funds have been buying entire suburbs. There’s just a shitload of rich young people who see that society is crumbling and we aren’t one of them 😂😂😂😂

2021-06-01 09:02:02,wallstreetbets,"It needs to be more than high house prices to repeat 2007. The housing crash was in large part perpetuated by poor banking practices from all the major mortgage companies. They were handing out bad loans for over priced homes, to people who couldn't afford them. The collapse, was from a small and normal housing market ebb that caused a reaction of loan faults. It was a domino effect that caused the market to plummet. As long as the banks are handing out good loans and have managed their risks, housing prices going down shouldn't trigger anything devastating. But yes, I believe there will be a correction soon"
2021-06-01 09:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Just bought a house back in march. looked at and put a bid on probably 10+. lost almost all of them to cash offers $20k+ over asking. i got insanely lucky with the one i got, had to do $15k over asking, which was still in my budget, just to secure it but the previous owners completely overhauled it and likely made off with $50k+ in profits. Its insane. People listing their dead grandmas ancient 900 sqft house that smells like roadkill because there's a dead opossum in the attic and carpeted bathrooms for $150k+ and people actually buying them.

2021-06-01 09:10:44,wallstreetbets,I think people realized when stuck at home during the pandemic that they don't really like their lives. They don't like their homes or their families. Changing homes is easier than ripping apart your family.
2021-06-01 09:12:14,wallstreetbets,"just remember, even when you're right, timing is everything. even the guys who successfully shorted the first housing market bubble in 08 ate big carry losses for the first 2 or 3 years. tudor was basically going house to house trying to get money for his positions in like 05 lol. 

so it's not about if the housing market is inflated, it probably is, but about when the inflation stops. and it's probably 3x as long as you think. 

people were talking about sf being a housing bubble since 2014/2015, and here we are."
2021-06-01 09:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Why aren't homes supposed to fly right now?  

We've had a fundamental shift in the nature of white collar work, ie: the folks who can afford houses.  With the rise of companies understanding that remote work is actually not so bad, plenty of people are shifting to new locations whether it's more rural or suburban instead of cramming themselves into urban apartments.  

Demand goes up, prices go up, but the demand isn't people over-leveraging credit to hopefully flip to some sucker on a cut rate half-assed renovation job, it's people looking to permanently abandon what they were living in for something new.  And also those idiots who are trying to flip houses into those people.  

Money's cheap, debt's cheap, if you have a 2 person 75-100k/year job household even stupid prices for houses are technically affordable and even better if it's an ""overpriced"" house coming from an urban salary and you're going to be able to keep your urban salary in a rural area.  Like 2k/mo rent in a big city (which is small) gets you 400k worth of house.  If you're paying 3k+?  You can literally live anywhere that isn't a city and get a giant house.  

It'll maybe correct itself on future demand, but we're not looking at unsustainable occupancy levels, people are buying houses to live in and work in, not flip.  (at least I'd figure most are by sales in the last 2 years in the neighborhood I bought a house in where everyone's abandoning the city and moving to suburbia if they can afford a down payment and keep their city pay, which most can)."
2021-06-01 09:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Housing market is way way overbought so to speak. Inventory was/is artificially low due to the pandemic(virus, lockdowns, mobility hampered), forbearance, and cheap money. I would not even consider looking at Residential RE till after the fall."

2021-06-01 09:23:03,wallstreetbets,"So if alot of these mortgages are being sold at steeply inflated prices, on the precipice of a historic crash that we all see coming, are banks relying on insurance to make up the difference once defaults roll in?"
2021-06-01 09:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Echoing the statements of others in this thread:
1) Everyone in there 30s looking to buy there first home. Older people delaying staying in there homes for longer. 
2) After 2007 Blackrock and other private equality purchased alot of single family homes that were foreclosed on sucking up alot of supply. 
3) Limited development opportunities to seriously increase supply. Here in NJ the only opportunity for building is up i.e. large apartment buildings. Alot of it gets hammered by zoning laws or lack of public transportation. 
4) Super low interest rates. 

Zero chance a similar 2007 style crash happens now. Will prices cool off if interest rates rise? Sure. But it's not going to be this mass foreclosure crisis because there is so much demand out there. Also the government insures most mortgages so there isn't going to be a systemic run on the large banks. Maybe a currency crisis but again housing will still be relatively expensive compared to other things since it's physical asset."

I’m a cost accountant but I was speaking to a house inspector who’s a client and he’s saying that so many people are in a rush to get their bid’s in with the least amount of hassle for the seller possible that they’re putting in offers that skip inspection. He thinks that houses built and sold during this time are going to carry a stigma in the future as “pandemic houses”. 

It’s probably different here but because of the cost of lumber, supply issue with parts and the rush builders are under, he says corners are being cut like never before on new builds."

2021-06-01 09:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Well its also the perfect time to sell, so depending on how much you have your house paid down, you may be able to make enough off it to afford a more expensive larger home.    


Like I bought my house 4 years ago for $95 a sq ft, I can currently sell it at $150 per sq ft.  Id make like $100K on selling my house.  Maybe I cant afford a $320K home, however after dropping the profit from my previous house on that, I'm back to a $220K per month mortgage.  


Overall its really expensive to buy, however your high sell cost due to someone else not having the money to build or buy brand new means you can rake in record profits.  


A close friend just sold his house for $160 per sq ft, made about $160k in profit.  That's why he was able to buy something else even though it normally would have been outside his means."

2021-06-01 10:02:25,wallstreetbets,Seriously you guys need to follow the Fed it’s either inflation or deflation.  By now it should be obvious that the fed will not allow deflation.  The only way out is inflation.  Your buying Silver in a manipulated market which uses fiat to suppress prices and believe eventually that will end when inflation pushes people away from the dollar and into Silver.  Yet on the other hand you believe real estate will crash?
2021-06-01 10:02:50,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends on your market that you're looking at. I think housing in places like Montana, Colorado, Idaho (rocky mountain front states) will actually continue to rise and not experience a dip. The ability for people to work from home and not want to look at ugly fucking scenery and pay 1mil for the pleasure of staring at asphalt and concrete is a real benefit that I think is being realized.   


Housing spikes in other communities are up for interpretation and I'm just saying what I see locally (MT, Wyoming area). I was lucky and bought my house in Aug 2019. It's gone up 30% in value. The creation of new housing was slowed by covid etc etc so you might see a slow down in the value increase but I don't think you'll see it go down by any stretch in certain areas."
2021-06-01 10:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Technically waiting won’t make housing prices any cheaper. They just may not sell WAY over value any longer, once interest rate goes up. Will always be expensive, unfortunately. An absolute nightmare for new homeownership right now"
2021-06-01 10:03:38,wallstreetbets,"But its not like 2007.  We have trillions upon trillions of new “money” (whatever that is ...) and we have the post-bust mortgage laws protecting (to some / large extent) a crash for similar reasons.  

If we do not foresee mass foreclosures then we dont foresee a major crash. 

Higher rates will lower prices.  But in the long run, that’s no biggy.  It will really hurt flippers in the near term, but a buy and hold in real estate is as sound now as ever in my opinion."

2021-06-01 10:07:52,wallstreetbets,It's not insane if inflation is out of control. I think a lot of rich people are taking out huge loans to buy property because they think that money is going to be worth less a few years from now.

This is why people are buying homes, because a 400K home is still cheaper than renting with these interest rates.   


You think the fed will really raise rates? They won't. They are too chicken shit to do it under the Biden administration because that will spell doom for the democrats. They're going to keep printing money and give it away to help distract everyone else on what's going on.   


Side note, we get $900 a month starting in July for our kids which we don't REALLY need. My mortgage is nearly paid now for the next 4 years unless they extend it? There's going to be a lot of people out there under same situations where they either now qualify for homes, will go buy cars, go out to eat....then you have people out of work that will now go back to work because unemployment ends. Numbers will only get better.   


This is it though. Once things get better there's only one place but up, and that's DOWN. We have a few good years left imo until things start to slowly go downhill. I think investors are buying up properties to rent out because the market right now is starting to get frothy."

2021-06-01 10:19:06,wallstreetbets,How do you make money off this tho
2021-06-01 10:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Homes are ""flying off the shelf"" partially, as you state, due to money being cheap. However, low inventory is also a strong driver. People get FOMO, and buy in. It's like the toilet paper debacle at the beginning of COVID.

For insulation specifically, there has just been one compounding issue after another. Originally the supply chain was broken due to trucking and COVID, then there was a freeze in Texas which shut down the the manufacturing of several plants, and took some time to get back online. Not only that, due to the low production levels right now, insulation manufacturers are more focused on high-density products so they can make more money per truckload. 

Being that you work for a custom home builder, your projects are probably primarily spray foam, instead of batts. The cost of foam is changing by the week, so I'm sure it effects you more than smaller tract homes.

I expect housing costs to level out in the near future, and maybe dip slightly. However, I do not expect a repeat of 2008. Home loans are harder to get, many people are paying cash in full amounts for their homes, and even if everyone who was on an eviction/foreclosure forbearance were to get evicted today, I don't believe it would crash the market as the numbers are nowhere near what 2008 was."

so they sold the house  got 1.2 million 

came to dfw area

bought a house CASH.. 70 above price.. 285k

2021-06-01 10:57:03,wallstreetbets,"Here is one apes take on the situation:

Worked as Realtor during the 2007-2008 crash, before and after as well, and this situation is extremely similar. 

What is being left out here is the tremendous amount of refinances that are going on, which in turns boosts the money supply in general and further contributes to raising costs for all other large ticket items (including land, vehicles, campers, etc) Throw in the raw materials cost plus the rising cost of labor and you have a real set up for hyper-inflation or a massive market correction in the housing market.

Those of us working in the days leading up to the crash remember the same-day offers on houses, multiple offers per house and offers that usually came in 10-20% over asking JUST to be sure they got the house.

Word to the wise: keep some cash on the side for when housing collapses again and buy some REAL dips, don't buy in this market, there is going to be a big time sale in the next 12-24 months."

2021-06-01 11:02:44,wallstreetbets,"I don't think we're going to see a bubble burst like we did in 2008. That was in part due to sub-prime lending where people were being approved for houses they couldn't afford and were defaulting on their mortgages. What we're seeing now is huge demand for people migrating to relatively cheaper parts of the country while simultaneously dealing with lower supplies from the pandemic shutting everything down/ reducing material output. We're going to see Demand keep rising for some time before material supplies catch back up and the market will then get back to equilibrium. 

TL:DR

I don't expect to see a big crash, the prices on our houses will sky rocket and then recede, but they won't lose value unless you buy at the top"

It looks like the builder is going to be taking a fairly significant haircut on their profit margin with these material costs, but the price is set in stone according to the contract. They build these things in stages, releasing lots periodically to artificially deflate supply, but they haven't released lots for months, likely because of the materials prices. In the meantime, I am looking to sell my dinky little townhouse  in this INSANE market and make a solid $70k over what we realistically could have gotten in a reasonable market while closing on a house in the next 4 months that will be worth north of $100k more than what we paid on day one. Its not like I'm getting enough to cover the entire amount of the new house, but i'm still set to make out like a bandit here.

if i remember that episode of the office where Batman was a guest star, there were other factors contributing to the crisis other than cheap money.

I agree that the anecdotes of home-buying are all ridiculous... but people still need places to live and we keep manufacturing more people.  maybe lumber prices go down and/or some progressive policy shift to tax rental income happens?  unless there's also some endemic tomfuckery with cascading debt like before it's not going to wreck the ecommonie as bad."

So only rent affects CPI and not housing price. I see housing valuation based on rental yield. So since rent hasn't increased at the national level beyond that of CPI, it's hard for me to buy right now.

This is at the national level. There are of course good values to be had in certain markets.

Also in 2008 we had foreclosures which contributed to price fall. If we didnt have all those relief last year, many would have been foreclosed which would help a bit with housing price. Should start again once foreclosures begin nationwide"
2021-06-01 14:10:07,wallstreetbets,"It’s not the same as 2008. Supply shortage with high demand driving up prices is wholly different than a fraudulent financial market hiding bad debt.

If interest rates go up, it could slow down the market or even cause a correction, but it won’t be a 2008-like crash. That was the biggest housing crash in history, and led to the second worst recession in history (US). People are filled with FUD after living through it, but comparing everything to 2008 doesn’t make sense because not every recession/correction is going to be comparable to one of the worst ever. 

Frankly, with the low interest and money-printing covid relief, I think it's more likely we slide into stagflation than a huge recession (which could be even worse). But who fucking knows, maybe we'll have another crash on par with the worst ever. It's just sort of a waste of time to keep on with the ""like 2008"" comparisons, because I have literally been seeing them since freaking 2012.

Prices are high, but the underlying causes are not remotely comparable.

Eventually there will be a correction (there always is), but what made 2008 so bad was all the bad debt, which was bundled into securities and sold to investors, which does not appear to exist this time.

People constantly comparing everything to the 2008 recession are the bear version of the investment advisors calling everything the ""next Amazon."""

One listing was highlighted on a local news broadcast in my state. Slum level house with 70 year old fixtures and a deck that was literally unsafe to walk on. Got 90 offers and sold for 275K cash in hand when the average for that area in previous years was half of that.

2021-06-01 14:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's being fueled somewhat by the extremely low interest rates and foreclosure moratorium (supply constriction).

If interest rates spike, the housing market will take a hit. But they won't spike.

As someone who has bought and sold 3 homes going back as far as 2004, I don't see a major correction happening unless interest rates spike or supply somehow explodes.

If interest rates nudge higher and supply nudges higher, I think the most likely outcome is a cooling off period of stagnation or maybe slight deflation. A crash like 2007/8 involved some factors that are not present in today's market (the lending/leveraging situation was out of control)."

Its different than 2007 in some respects though. What's driving the prices up here is lack of inventory on the market. Want a home? So few to be had it's a nasty competition to get in.

With the recent materials price increase it will be interesting to see if that is accepted by the builders and successfully passed onto the buyers. I suspect it will be.

Longer term though - I completely agree we are far overdue for a correct. The fed raising rates may facilitate some of that but we need more inventory available to really make things reasonable again...

I have several friends who do not want to buy but they are feeling like they have no choice. Starting a family and want out of the apartment...so we shall see...  I would also like to upgrade - but not in this market. I'll keep waiting..."

2021-06-01 15:26:35,wallstreetbets,"It’s different than 2008 because there’s no supply on the market. With the mortgage crisis, people were getting loans for houses they couldn’t afford and there was plenty of houses on the market. Most of the houses currently selling for 15-30% over asking are going to cash buyers who are trying to outbid others who may be using traditional financing. Now, those cash buyers COULD be using mom and dad’s money to secure the house, then getting a mortgage to pay them back, but that’s highly illegal. 

So far there’s no reason to think there will be a mortgage bubble burst, but if anyone is in the market for a house, don’t FOMO yourself into a mortgage you can’t afford. If you CAN afford, just remember you’re purchasing at a premium. It’s like buying a PS5 from a scalper on eBay. You’re buying because you want it, they have it, there isn’t much inventory."

I think this is drastically different from 2007-2008. All this building and demand to buy isn't fake or flippers looking to make a quick buck thinking ""houses only go up""...people genuinely need places to live and want to build their dream house or catch up on a year+ of renovations.

So you have to ask: if you're balls deep in work and can't sustain demand, why would the demand just evaporate overnight? What is the ""bubble"" here that is going to pop?

Costs will drop as supply chains for materials ramp back up, and then buying and building demand will stay flat or increase because more people will be able to afford building and buying."

I have 2 brothers that build about 300 houses per year. Today they cannot find framers unless they will pay them under the table. The moratorium on foreclosures could be problem when it is lifted and create some supply but what I have read says very little.

The riots last  of summer are sending people to burbs and the labor supply shortage along with general supply shortages (lumber etc) are the culprits IMO."
2021-06-01 13:03:50,wallstreetbets,BUY THE DIP!
2021-06-01 14:34:55,wallstreetbets,The fed won’t let it happen again. You missed that boat.
2021-06-01 14:51:34,wallstreetbets,The main difference is that we are going to see COVID coming back again every year until the Vaccine Passport is global.....resulting in more disruptions of the global supply chain. Most industrial shipping is still petroleum based and high oil taxes will be pushed onto consumers as well.
2021-06-01 15:03:56,wallstreetbets,"My apologies.  But I fear you're wrong.  Inventory in my area is normally over 5k.  Sitting at around 1.8k today.  If you're FHA or VA right now, those go in the trash first.  Cash or conventional are the only sales hitting right now.  It may not be as bad as 2008, but I won't be good."
2021-06-01 15:19:21,wallstreetbets,You have any numbers to back that up? Or this just personal observation?
2021-06-01 16:42:37,wallstreetbets,"US dollar is overvalued in general
Commodities are the only thing that is cheap 

If you print too much money…. Guess what will happen? That right the value of the currency goes down relative to others at some point eventually 

Housing is just a byproduct of that"
2021-06-01 18:33:03,wallstreetbets,"House prices are inversely proportional to interest rates: interest rates go down, prices go up. And.. interest rates go up, prices go down, except, prices are “sticky” (an economics term).

What you tend to see happen when rates go up, prices mostly flatten out and sales volume decreases. Housing doesn’t crash because prices are too high or market is too hot or building costs are too high. It needs a catalyst like a banking crisis or something.

And look im not a housing perma bull... i love a housing crash. That’s when i swoop in and buy em up cheap just like in 2009. Best deals of my life. Im just a realist. This hot market can continue for years and then just quietly cool off, no crash."
2021-06-01 14:12:05,wallstreetbets,"So does this mean that if you buy a house at this low rate and then the interest rates go up, the value of your house will decrease instead of increase?"
2021-06-01 03:17:00,wallstreetbets,Interest rates can’t go up substantially. There’s where the people calling for a bubble to pop are wrong.

2021-06-01 16:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. But we're facing more than the usual up/down here. Material shortages due to covid are sending prices through the ceiling.

2021-06-01 19:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Very much this. Cheap credit inflates the prices of houses. Right now the influx of money is causing inflation. Interest rates may be very low but they will have to rise to stave off inflation.

He owned it for one year, made no improvements, and made 90k three hours after listing it.

Housing is way too hot. We're gonna crash."

2021-06-01 12:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Tough call.  This isn’t 2008.  If you look at housing starts versus household formation we’ve been balanced since 2009.  Meanwhile about 500k houses go into obsolescence per year.  In 2008 we were building 1 million plus houses above household formation.

Key point we have a lot of under building and strong housing fundamentals.  That being said if construction costs return to normal then we should be able to build a lot more which will lower house pricing.

If I were looking to buy a house today I’d be very mixed.  If you wait for building you might miss out on low rates."
2021-06-01 13:09:15,wallstreetbets,"Where I am located (southern Ontario).  Houses are going in some cases for double of what they were listed at.  

To put another thing in perspective of how fucked up our real estate prices are right now.  I bought my house 6 years ago for 180,000.  A neighbor down the road from me, with a very similar house, same layout and style.  Slightly smaller yard, interior wasn't up to date and would need work.

They just sold it for 625,000.   They listed it at 450,000.

I don't understand how first time home buyers are ever going to afford housing with prices like this.  Here in Canada you need 20% down to avoid CMHC (Canadian mortgage housing commission) fees.  Which is basically insurance you pay on-top of your mortgage payments that protects the lenders of your loan, if you were to default on your mortgage.  The fees are quite high, so it's better to have the 20% down.

Not many people, at least in this area have that kind of cash laying around to be able to buy a house that they probably need to spend another 50-100 grand to fix up."
2021-06-01 14:17:57,wallstreetbets,I just lost out on a house because someone offered 70k (25%) over list price and waived *all* contingencies. wtf is this market?
2021-06-01 15:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Same, have viewed over 30 houses now. Submitted bids on most of them and out bid every single time. Yesterday we called it, we are waiting for the correction. Just wanted to take advantage of the low rates. SoCal if it matters"

2021-06-01 02:11:34,wallstreetbets,Sydney and Melbourne have been dealing with overpricing for years now. Wages are the same as 10yrs ago. And housing price has doubled. Aparantly fueled in part by foreign investment and fomo. Now I am hearing stories of mortgage stress and defaults because retards have overleveraged themselves. The banks and brokers are loving it though.

Still didn't get it on the most recent house, so he had his agent ask.  The sellers agent said that his (100k over asking) offer was ""in the top 5"", but obviously was lower than the winning bid.

Oh, and it sold after 1 day on the market."
2021-06-01 07:28:37,wallstreetbets,"10-20% ? That must be nice.  Houses are up 60-100% in my area, its absurd."

2021-06-01 09:43:59,wallstreetbets,"I bought in December. House last sold for 155. They were asking 170 for it. I pulled a stupid and offered 175 because first day the house was listed, the street was packed with people looking to buy it. I had seen about 30 houses maybe more by then. Some shit holes but anything worth buying was gobbled up within 48 hours. House had new electric, new plumbing, windows, and ac since the last owners. At these interest rates I don't see why anyone WOULDNT. Obviously don't pay too much but  at 2 percent interest for a house? I'd be stupid not to take it."
2021-06-01 10:13:04,wallstreetbets,Same thing here as well - I'll call to offer and they'll respond with we already have multiple offers above the list price.

under contract in 48.

we sold 20% over what we originally intended to list for, buyer's agent offer 1% of their fee refunded, buyers offered $500 twoard our closing costs on a information only(meaning if anything were found it would not be a deal breaker) home inspection, $15,000 escalation offer (meaning if anyone else offered more they would increase their offer by 15k) $10K GAP if the home didn't appraise for the purchase price.

The assessor was a dick and pend the value at exactly their GAP pricing for 'reasons'

it was a surreal experience, all of the offers we received before we closed the listing were above asking with many having the same 'incentives'"
2021-06-01 13:19:01,wallstreetbets,"10-20% is nothing here in Sweden, thats the norm - if they even go to bidding. Most houses are bought before they even have showing. It's insane. It's actually cheaper to build new than buying used"

2021-06-01 13:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Maybe this is a dumb question, but does it really matter all that much if most of the home loans these days are fixed rate? So long as people are able to afford the monthly mortgage (which are crazy low right now compared to renting costs) what would change for people who have already bought homes if interest rates are raised? Aren't they already locked in to their fixed rate thus somewhat preventing 2008 part 2?"

2021-06-01 13:33:20,wallstreetbets,I’ve only seen like 1/20 top comments that understand asset price inflation... the short version is that we won’t see housing prices stabilize until interest rates go up. These problems get oversimplified. It’s like thinking the titanic sunk because someone called it “unsinkable.” Look up “hyperinflation” and “stagflation” — that’s the direction we are headed if fed policy doesn’t change.

2021-06-01 09:50:18,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at buying a multi-family unit and from the dozen or so properties I looked at I found about 70% of the leases were month-to-month.  I found this very odd as I've never had a landlord who said ""ohh you're done with the lease, okay just go ahead and pay month to and month and don't worry about signing another.""  Sure enough, when I looked at the tax forms for the listings there was missing rent when compared to what the current owner said they were leasing at.  My suspicion is that many of these landlords haven't made their tenants who aren't paying re-sign leases so it'll be easier to part ways once the moratorium ends."
2021-06-01 12:12:31,wallstreetbets,"This^ 

I moved into a new subdivision in late 2019, right before Covid hit of course. They suddenly couldn’t sell homes with everyone getting laid off, so they started renting them out. The neighborhood has been absolutely trashed because everyone has stopped making their rent payments as they know they can’t be evicted. And also because they can’t be evicted, they don’t mow, they throw trash out in the street, and generally don’t perform any upkeep on the property. While surround areas home prices are continuing to go up almost exponentially, the value of my home has actually gone down since 2019. Fucking sucks. 

I used to have sympathy for renters, but when they act like this, I have to side with the landlords. Evict these clowns and sell the damn houses already."
2021-06-01 14:27:11,wallstreetbets,If they don't give some new eviction protections there will be mass evictions. I know a lot of people who worked in the restaurant industry that are 10-20k in debt for rent right now.

2021-06-01 05:20:28,wallstreetbets,Yes but at what point do they start evicting people? This is the one thing I’ve been waiting for and I really don’t think the dems would let it happen because it looks very bad for them.
2021-06-01 13:59:44,wallstreetbets,Yep. That moratorium ended today. The foreclosures should hit the market by September.

2021-06-01 02:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Last time rules and regulations were crazy. Banks were incredibly greedy and as loan officers it made us greedy too. And this made potential homeowners greedy too. My first mortgage job was for Ameriquest. We use to do stated loans like this; on this blank sheet of paper write your profession and 150k so the dti works, and sign the bottom. That was stated docs lol

Then after the sub prime market went away, I worked as a broker, & they gave us option arm loans, which gave borrowers the opportunity to chose one of four payments, 2/28 arm, 15 fix, 30 fix or what everyone ended up paying INTEREST ONLY. If they paid the IO payment it added additional money to their principal every month, making people upside down af. I told borrowers the consequences but people like the lowest payment. I think the banks knew this and just thought they would get cheap property when they defaulted. They were paying us up to 5 points on the backend fuckin crazy. I could charge zero upfront fees and just throw 5 on the back and max out my commission and the person paying the mortgage would pay numbers like $900 per month on a million dollar loan. Insane

Bad credit got houses worth a mill. I was in LA county so 15 Mexican families just acted like they would split the Bill. Add that to crazy ass greed from the banks and everyone selling the loans, that shit had to come down hard.

This time around will not be as severe IMO 

A lot of homeowners now have a ton of paperwork they need to provide and you need at least decent credit. This will be 2007 the lite version. Less foreclosures anyways"
2021-06-01 03:34:20,wallstreetbets,"In addition to all the comments, ARM was a major catalyst in 2007 that isn’t as common today. People signed up for ridiculously low rates in the first couple years which then jumped significantly after. When the mortgage payments increased and people couldn’t sell or it was underwater they’d be forced to foreclose and go bankrupt."
2021-06-01 07:36:53,wallstreetbets,"I would disagree. The bubble should have popped in the last year and a half, but the government made a big pivot to avoid it.

Here's the catch though. There are A LOT of people being talked into places they can afford on paper. In reality though they can't. Brokers and Realtors are the worst for this they get people all excited because they can afford it on paper. When you factor in property taxes, home insurance, regular expenses etc. They are in a every dollar counts type of situation .... at 1.89%. Even worse some people being placed in variables at prime minus 1.10% (roughly 1.35% today) because they could not qualify for fixed. It's ridiculous. 

Well when the rates are bare minimum 2% higher than now in 5 years there will be a lot of bankruptcy and foreclosure. Flooding the market with supply and no demand. Everyone will owe more than they can sell for and this is how our market will pop."

I don’t think keeping the mortgage rates this low is going to last for very long though. It’s a house of cards that’s going to come crashing it’s just a matter of when it happens."

Several people have asked what my rebalance looks like so I thought I would make a separate comment.

* 25% commodity funds that focus on non-precious metal mining such as copper, nickel, and lithium. 
* 25% Inflation protection bond fund 
* 25% emerging markets funds 
* 25% Stable value fund"
2021-06-01 00:17:40,wallstreetbets,Same here. Made our offer in February 2020 and closed in March just as everything shut down. We actually got a good deal cause it was a zillow owned flip house and i guess they figured incorrectly that covid would lead to lower demand and prices dropping so they wanted to unload it asap. I negotiated 20k under ask too. Now its worth 150k more than i paid for today.
2021-05-31 23:37:14,wallstreetbets,me too  😂 bought in november right before the pandemic hit and value is now up 50%.  some days i wake up and cry tears of relief.  I'm a millennial home owner and most my friends moved back in with their parents or pay exorbitant amounts for rent 😬

Summer 2021 has been the plan for a few years so it sucks the market jumped when it did, but due to the cash purchases, influx of cash heavy people moving from the coasts being brought by the companies relocating, and the low supply, I just can’t find the reason this would be a bubble that’s gonna pop in this city until supply catches up and passes demand. Unless interest rates go sky high, or some other massive manipulation like 08 that people aren’t seeing happens, I just don’t see it being a bad idea if I plan to live here for 5 years. Beats renting in the long run."
2021-06-01 01:39:35,wallstreetbets,I believe foreclosures are about to start coming through the pipeline. I’m interested to see what that does to the market. Maybe we will have a record hot summer and all the new yorkers/californians will leave lol

The lending standards are not being completely ignored, and extremely low quality debt is not being fraudulently labeled as good debt and bundled and sold as securities (to my knowledge).

The lazy 2008 comparison has been floating around since at least 2012. Eventually someone will be right, but it probably won't be like 2008.

People still prefer rents instead of trying more to buy to own.

People who are now making decent money don't realise that at their age of 50-55-60 ageism will hit them hard and good luck making rent money at low paid jobs as companies will prefer to hire young stallions who wanna prove their working capabilities more than oldies.

We might see a slight cool off when the federal safeguards for homeowners in trouble ends, but they will just sell or short sell and won’t be underwater.

Imagine when they actually raise them. They will have to hedge inflation and QE before it gets worse than it is. Folks are buying like crazy because most of America are “payment” shoppers.

2021-06-01 01:25:22,wallstreetbets,Mostly this. Inflation is here. Eventually the premium over asking will go away when supply is higher but I doubt prices will fall much. It would take a whole lot of inventory to lower prices. Also people turn to real estate  during inflation so demand will stay high.

I'm sure the same house coulda been had for $100K less a year ago."

2021-06-01 10:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Germany and  Austria pretty much the same, Money is cheap and young people are building /buying in fear it will rise even more. A lot of shit realestate is listed for high prices, but i think in the last 3 month those dont insta-sell anymore, so its getting cooled down a little bit i feel. I was looking around for house prices in my area (i want one), but decided to wait for it to come down. Luckily im done have a wife, so i cant be forced to own a House. 

No idea if true but i think in 5 years or so prices will start to decline, as more old people die or go into Old peoples institutions and less young couples buy. The current prices level is more to the Cheap money combined with little offer."
2021-06-01 13:51:20,wallstreetbets,Whats your commodity pricing like? Is lumber pricing gone up (you are a nation of forests after all)? What about milk/dairy/bacon/pork/etc.? Anything noticeably inflated (aside from housing)?

2021-06-01 02:01:59,wallstreetbets,At some point evictions have to start. I have hard time believing everyone was making their mortgage and rent this entire time. Does anyone have any numbers on this?

We were also thinking of selling and just moving into my parents rental for free until the market stabilizes but even then we'd be sitting on a pile of cash that's getting stolen by the government every day that passes. Maybe that's the plan, people sell off thinking they made it big then government takes all that cash and blames it on inflation."

2021-06-01 04:30:40,wallstreetbets,"Shit you guys are lucky. Housing here in Canada went from 250k to $630k and I wish I could say that was a joke or exaggeration. We've built nothing but sparse McMansions for the last 30 years and now that millennials are buying there literally isn't enough homes for the amount of educated labor we have. 90k salaries aren't enough to get into anything more than a 2 bedroom condo. 1 bedroom condos are going for $480k.

Up 6 figures this year and further away from getting my own place than I was last year."

2021-06-01 05:54:34,wallstreetbets,I'm of the mind that the housing market is doing what it is due to the massive dilution of the dollar. People are down to pay more for property as a store of value for when the dollar crashes...
2021-06-01 06:42:52,wallstreetbets,Ive been thinking of selling my house but then the issue is buying a different house that isn’t overpriced garbage

So uhh, not gonna crash bud sorry"
2021-06-01 12:42:42,wallstreetbets,"i dont think you will see a similar crash. in 2007 many people couldnt afford their mortgages, and when the house value went underwater it made no sense to keep paying their 5/1 ARM mortgage that was going to require either a refinance or a balloon payment.

the current mortgages will continue to get paid, and people wont be flooding the market with inventory by walking away from houses."
2021-06-01 13:53:25,wallstreetbets,made 90k? how much were the fees both ways though? i doubt it's that much
2021-06-01 14:22:59,wallstreetbets,"Stop asking and hoping for a crash. Unless you've got the full 600k sitting around in cash, your peasant ass won't be able to get a loan unless you make 250k in combined income and you have 800+ credit scores. Lenders tighten their lending standards when things go south."
2021-06-01 15:30:00,wallstreetbets,haven't yet seen the run up. i will bet you a can of soup the biden administration brings back no income no job no asset loans. it's the next logical step in fighting systemic racism.
2021-06-01 16:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Unless you're living under a rock you'd know that the majority of these offers are cash.

2021-06-01 17:46:10,wallstreetbets,"Even if we crash big investors are still gonna be buying houses out the ass like they have been for years. It's a supply and demand issue as well, and there just isn't much out there. Honestly Idk when this will come to a head, but I do know rates won't be this low forever."
2021-06-01 13:03:57,wallstreetbets,Bad take. There will be a dip when inflation hits harder and interest rates double. But they'll still be historically low and won't deter 90% of buyers. The catalysts driving home sales now aren't changing. The rate of growth isn't sustainable but saying there will be a crash is just uninformed speculation.

Hell, I looked up my trucks trade in value, I do this about once every other month, just out of curiosity, and the trade in value on my truck is up $3k from where it was back in March. It makes no sense to me."

2021-06-01 13:13:31,wallstreetbets,Honestly probably nothing. I feel based on what I’m seeing in mortgages that even if most people lost there homes that there would be so many people ready and willing to buy them at close to market price or over market price. The inventory is insanely low right now. If anything people getting their homes foreclosed on would just correct the home shortage
2021-06-01 11:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Do you not think there’s pent up demand to match that?

I just bought my first house and I’m already ready for a second one because money is cheap to borrow and all of my other assets keep increasing."
2021-06-01 12:55:01,wallstreetbets,"IMO theres 2 things that can happen:

1. government steps in and establishes a home loan modification program similar to HAMP where the delinquent payments basically get added to the end of the loan, either as a balloon due upon loan balance payoff or extending the note maturity date

2. government does nothing and a massive influx of inventory hits the market as homeowners who cant afford to catch up on their payments opt to sell their homes. supply catches up to demand and we see home prices fall as a result"

2021-06-01 08:16:28,wallstreetbets,"I would assume that it will not be like 08, as there is no way in hell that we will see any reasonable increase in interest rates. Rather, there will be inflation (even as low as 4%), but if the interest rate stays at 0%, any commodity that is not trash like bonds will fly through the roof. The thesis would be that smart money knows that we will get inflation and we might be at the beginning of a melt up. Just my 2 drachma and I am retarted."
2021-06-01 09:29:25,wallstreetbets,"It's not investors buying property, it's white collar (tech) workers who previously were told they have to live in San Francisco, NYC, Austin or somewhere urban and pay 3k/mo+ that now can live and work literally anywhere and are choosing to buy some place comfortable to work long term forever.  Plenty have IPO money to cash out or other investments from working a 6-figure job for a decade.  They're not looking to sell to make quick money because they've been making good money for a while and will likely continue to do so in the future."
2021-06-01 09:11:20,wallstreetbets,Inflation happens and what used to seem like a lot of debt is now not a lot of debt. If you get hyperinflation you can’t buy anything new but all your old debt is just mini debt now.

2021-06-01 00:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Even when supply catches up I don't know if it will pop.     


My realtor is of the opinion that 300-400k simply IS the new house price now.  

Also, it's not like the late 2000's-early 2010s when people were given loans they couldn't really afford easily.  Qualifying for a mortgage or refinance is a stone bitch compared to what it was a decade ago.   


But assuming you can get a house, your mortgage payment will still probably be less than rent.  Because the rental market is equally insane.  With a shortage of houses, all of the people coming in from out of state need somewhere to live in the interim."
2021-06-01 15:36:52,wallstreetbets,"I have a number of friends in realty and they are echoing the same sentiment: a very large percentage of homes being bought in austin are investment properties being flipped into Airbnbs or rentals. Not only is this driving prices up but also creating an STR bubble so a secondary issue in addition to demand outpacing supply is influx (both tourist and new residents) being outpaced by STR availability. This doesn’t just affect prices though, there are lots of repercussions for neighborhood/community development, crime, cleanliness and quality of life when STRs compete with normal residential neighborhoods. Austin is about to become an expensive shithole with half its population demographically considered “bachelor party”"
2021-06-01 07:00:19,wallstreetbets,They won’t. Buy as soon as you’re able.
2021-06-01 09:08:38,wallstreetbets,I’m renting right now with my rent covered by the GI bill because I’m in school. The house was rented out to a tenant since I had moved and when they decided to move I figured it was the perfect time to sell. I’m waiting for the (inevitable it seems) crash. Selfishly I’m hoping it happens in the next year so that I can scoop something up at a lower price without paying cap gains on my previous sale.

No such thing as a construction loan.

Prohibitive cost of utility connections, which again, cash only and up front.

You aren't allowed to live on it until it's a full service house.

The only way to turn that land into housing by yourself is if you already have a paid off home you can use to tap the equity, and if you do? You're just going to buy a home that's already built instead.

2021-06-01 03:55:58,wallstreetbets,"This. There’s been a supply issue even before the pandemic. There needs to be a massive increase in supply right now, which is throttled by how much it costs to build a house right now. 

It’s a perfect storm of low supply, high demand, people relocating because of Covid, rent being higher than monthly mortgage payments, low interest rates, stricter lending practices (which means less foreclosures), and probably a ton of other factors."

2021-06-01 02:07:04,wallstreetbets,I mean I'm not going to feel bad at all for people taking out variable mortgages at historically low rate levels.  There's 0 fucking reason to be taking out a variable loan right now when you can get a fixed rate 30 year at 3%.
2021-06-01 00:06:37,wallstreetbets,why wouldnt you recommend that? are you short on GME?
2021-06-01 03:49:32,wallstreetbets,A lot of outdated thinking in this thread.
2021-06-01 18:32:05,wallstreetbets,That’s the issue - you limit yourself with those thoughts.
2021-06-01 09:06:46,wallstreetbets,"2008 happened for many reasons, but at the core was an oversupply of housing. What we see today is the inverse, will be interesting to see how it plays out."
2021-06-01 15:14:11,wallstreetbets,"The bank forecloses regardless of equity in the home. It has to do solely with whether or not the borrower made the payments. I'm sure some people will sell to try to take advantage of the equity they might have, but they also have to find another place to live. In this market, it's tough. Even with the equity they may have to get a smaller place than what they currently have. 
They won't be able to get approved for another mortgage if they are behind on their current mortgage, and rental companies will be very wary of someone who could have paid their mortgage but chose not to. 
Once banks are able to foreclose, they will and prices will start to correct, eroding the equity gains the seller would have realized if they had sold at the peak. 
So, yeah it's common sense to sell but not everyone will be able to. And not everyone has common sense"
2021-06-01 15:56:35,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying the market will continue rise, I get it.     For the short term yes.  But what happens when the supply comes back? And it will come back.  We're not selling gadgets.  We're selling homes.  Where people put most of their money.   Prices will plunge and those that were foolish enough to buy in this market will be upside down.  If you're telling your buying clients now is the time to buy I guarantee they will not be your clients when they're ready to sell."
2021-06-01 17:20:04,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. I think a lot of people are overlooking how important it is to look at the size of monthly payments relative to incomes, and the impact loan term has on the size of monthly payments.

What happens if 40-year mortgages start to become the norm? Or 50-year? We're already seeing this kind of thing in HCOL areas on the coasts. What happens to housing prices if banks start stretching terms and suddenly what seemed unattainable on a 30-year becomes much more reasonable on a 40-year?

I suspect in a rising rate environment we'll see lenders start to stretch the terms of loans. It increases the lifetime cost of the loan, sure, but that's of course in the lender's best interest."
2021-06-01 17:12:41,wallstreetbets,"4-5% is not high enough to entirely cool off the current housing market...demand is simply too high, while supply is low, and material costs are high."

2021-05-31 23:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, at least when we bought \~5ish back when things were still hot, just maybe not as hot:  


Anything decent got offers instantly. My SO and I had talked, planned to do the traditional thing of going to open houses and browsing. Spreadsheeting up pros/cons/cost/stats etc.   


Instead the first two open houses we went to were really meh and not places we'd consider. The third had accepted an offer prior to the open house and the realtor was just there to network. Everything was either instantly gone or had significant issues visible to the layman's eye. If you're not refreshing the formal postings or getting inside intel the only thing that was left was the actual scraps.   


Now if we went more rural things might be different. Still super glad we bought when we did instead of waiting but man it was a horrible process compared to what I thought it would be like."
2021-05-31 23:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but also no. As fucked as Canada has been the last few years, the last year has been even worse. Prices up 30% anywhere that isn't Bumblefuck, ON. And still going 100k+ over asking pretty routinely. Then there's Toronto. Houses listed for 1m going for 1.5m sight unseen.

This can't continue. I'm hoping for a collapse, but realistically every level of government has a vested interest in not letting that happen. I can easily see them let inflation run 5%+ if the alternative is raising rates to a level that would fuck all the recent buyers. Too many votes to be lost."

2021-06-01 13:57:03,wallstreetbets,"Live on the west coast USA. A lot of buying pressure coming from China as the rich there try to get their money out. It's why they will pay over listing price, in cash.

2021-06-01 01:40:37,wallstreetbets,"well, I’m not sure about a “crash,” but a buyer will not get that 4% average appreciation that makes home ownership a wealth accumulator.  

i think the big bet is to bet against major home insurers that are selling value/quality over the next 3-5 years. so the brand names. 


people will be more price conscious than ever. insurance rates are all based on costs of labor and materials.  and both are in the stratosphere.  so get ready to see your home insurance rates double, again. i know they already have. well I mean again.  if you think you would be motivated to shop, and know deep down you will let yourself be convinced its “the same” coverage for a lower price, then bet against the name brand insurance companies."

The evictions will probably help the market as small time property owners are likely not thrilled by having their rights shit on for a year and will list their property instead of trying to rent it again.  The big landlords that own a shitload of property are going to still wind up renting because they'll be the one scooping up the bailout money, but the middle class family that bought a second property to rent out instead of investing in the market has spent the past year getting fucked hard."

How else could mortgage rates be below 4% when YoY inflation is above 4% ? Banks would be retarded to lend below inflation unless they knew the money was being made by selling to the Fed. 

Central bank has gone form lender of last resort to buyer of first resort."
2021-06-01 17:54:30,wallstreetbets,"The inflation arrives because those same central banks control the means of production. They don't want to invest in increasing production out of fears that demand will decrease in the future, leaving them with unused capacity.

They always promise to deliver the jobs, but delivering on the jobs is less profitable than just taking the money.

This is where financial inequality cannibalizes the free market capitalist economy. A capitalist economy requires an even distribution of wealth to enable entrepreneurs to enter the market where the profit margins are too small for existing wealth to expand, but high enough for lower wealth individuals to improve their standard of living.

Our inequality has created a gap where the owners of capital won't increase production but the lower class doesn't have the means the enter the market to meet the increased demand.

And the longer this gap exists, the worse it gets."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-01 14:40:02,wallstreetbets,"there is no systemic risk.

But housing prices can very well fall, and fall hard. There is a massive supply crunch right now, from a variety of factors, many temporary. It will move towards equilibrium, and this ridiculousness will end. People won’t be dropping 30% over asking for long.

I don’t think it will be a “crash”, but a massive correction is very much in the cards.

Of course there is hyper inflation risk, which IMO is valid, but at this point way overstated. The effects of supply crunch are hard to separate from true inflation, and I tend to believe the fed in that much of this is transitory."
2021-06-01 06:52:01,wallstreetbets,I’m with you I do think we are going to see a crash due to interest rates rising (even sub 2% to 4-5% is a big jump that’s going to hurt a lot of people) that being said I think that’s still 2 or so years away.
2021-06-01 14:37:34,wallstreetbets,"Hyperinflation would have the opposite effect. Even if wages only increase enough to remain flat on an inflation adjusted basis, if your wages start going up 5% per year, and you are sitting on your super-expensive house with a 2.25% interest mortgage, you are not getting foreclosed on. You are laughing as you pay off the debt.

This happened to my stepmother in Ecuador during their period of hyperinflation. She effectively got her house for nothing.

People who already own have their debt and interest rates locked in (ARM loans are much more rare these days). Inflation makes their homes and mortgages effectively cheaper for them, and means foreclosures are less likely, so long as they remain employed and keep earning an income. Everything else might cost you more, but you are going to laugh as you pay your paltry mortgage every month."
2021-06-01 04:57:16,wallstreetbets,"Hyperinflation helps people and corporations that are balls deep in debt. As the debts inherent value decrease. This is why it could be in the favour of the government and the fed to let inflation run for a while, to pay the national debt. Even though it fucks over many, but hey, that’s not something they are new to."
2021-06-01 02:15:59,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if you're using hyperbole but there is absolutely a such thing as construction loans. I used to work in real estate lending.

2021-06-01 09:57:50,wallstreetbets,When money is lent that cheaply you get really bad inflation.
2021-06-01 10:33:18,wallstreetbets,"The banks are also taking out loans on that money they are lending to you. Generally they get the money from the national bank at ~2% and lend it to you for ~4-5%. If the central banks up their rates the banks are forced to up theirs.

The central banks do this to help control inflation. If a country just starts to print money it devalues their currency. I know it’s an extreme case but look at what happened to Germany at the end of WWI they had huge debts to pay for the damages and they just printed money to pay it it cases their currency to be worthless and the economy to go from bad to worse. There’s a little more to it than that but that’s the tldr"

Also, with all this money being injected into the economy plus the hiking of wages will only inflate costs for the foreseeable future. I don’t see how prices will ever come down significantly. It may come down a little but not for homes that are highly desirable, only the shitty ones.

Edit: To clarify, since this is getting downvotes, my understanding is if you're on a month-to-month lease, the landlord can give notice and evict if they want to sell. If you're on a longer lease, the landlord can still sell but would do so with the tenants in place and the new owners evict at the appropriate time if they choose to do so. Either way, the eviction moratorium does not prohibit the landlord from selling. This is a rough summary because there are some differences depending on states and municipalities."

It's pretty obvious though that despite having OER, out of pocket healthcare expenses, and college tuition factored into CPI that those 3 categories (housing, healthcare, education) are inflating faster than everything else.

Not saying they should revamp CPI to give extra weight to those things or anything like that, but maybe the conversation the Fed has about raising rates should acknowledge that low rates will spur home purchases and create housing bubbles (and therefore crashes). 

Now I'm sure they do know that, they're not stupid after all, but they should comment on it when making rate decisions if they want to look like they know what they're doing.

Also, like in 2007, a bunch of people who bought overpriced homes they couldn't afford got foreclosed on, so not everyone who buys a house recoups the inflation in price later, many of the people lose completely."

But the situation is just so different.   In Austin the people throwing insane money over list at houses have it to throw to begin with.  Either they are in tech or what not or, as often, are coming into town from a city where they sold for millions.  


Lot of stories of Californians who sold for 5 million, moved here, got a 1.5 million dollar house and retired.   So the situation is different than the predatory lending one from years back.  All loans go through Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac and they are a pain in the ass about this.

2021-06-01 18:38:08,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t hurt people who already have their low-interest rate mortgages and are not trying to sell.

The only way it hurts people who already own homes is if it reduces the amount of potential buyers who can afford the higher prices at increased interest rates, causing a reduction in the price you can get upon selling. That’s likely, but again, only a problem if you intend to sell.

My house is financed at 2.25% now. That is below historical average inflation. It’s like the bank is paying me to use their money to buy my house. If inflation increases, that’s even better for me, as I’m paying the bank back with dollars worth less and less compared to the dollars they gave me to buy.

Why would I ever sell that? If anything I’d convert it to a rental and just buy another house if we want to trade up, because it would be crazy to sell it given the terms of our loan. Refinancing it to such a low interest rate reduced the monthly mortgage, taxes and insurance to the point that it would be profitable as a rental now, whereas before it would have cost me money (for now).

And if people aren’t selling, there is more competition and prices stay high.

It’s too hard to say what will happen, but it’s entirely possible an increase in interest rates to 4-5% might not even cause a correction, but merely decrease the rate of appreciation. Historically, rising interest rates don’t always cause housing prices to decline, because rising interest rates usually happen during economic booms, where people are doing well and more likely to try to make big purchases."

However the market is due for a crash; it’s not 2008 but 2008 on fuckin steroids. The cmbs is definitely inflated. Housing prices are up due to numerous factors; supply and demand. People upsizing; the fed is snapping up MBs securities. The issue is when all this shit is supposed to mature and were going to see a nuclear melt down. I’m waiting; ‘it’s going to be interesting. Real estate agents are the worse they’re just trynna make a sale. So I take everything they say with a grain of salt lmao 😂
2021-06-01 03:13:26,wallstreetbets,2008 crashed because of factors not occurring right now. People want to point to 08 like they're clever but i don't think the comparison is apt. If we crash in the next 2 years i doubt its the same as 08.

Trump gave a 30% tax cut to landlords. This fueled focusing on building only apartments the last 4 years too. Less homes built = low supply. 

It's going to be hard to find cheap labor, to build millions of homes, real fast."

Also it's not ignorant when they are all fighting over those same square miles, they either don't want or haven't even done research on to what else is out there. Even in less expensive cities that would have most of what they have in the cities they live in.

2021-06-01 13:54:19,wallstreetbets,"So, what you are describing is non renewal of a lease. That's not an eviction. 
Non-renewal applies if the lease is expiring anyway. Nobody has done anything wrong. It's just the end if the lease term per the contract. Tenant moves out and LL sells or gets a new tenant. 
Eviction is for cause. So, if I don't pay rent, or violate my lease by moving 20 people in who aren't on the lease, or run a weed farm out of the garage in a state where that is illegal, I'm in violation of my lease and could normally be evicted. It's a legal process and goes on your credit. 

Alot of people don't understand the nuances around it. Eviction is a lot worse than just non renewal. 

The problem is that some tenants just stayed after their lease expired and stopped paying rent. At that point, it becomes an eviction because there are continuation clauses in the lease and the person must pay. It really sucks to be a landlord right now."

Yes, any sane person who understands the consequences of climate change understands that as it continues, ice currently on land will melt and end up in the oceans. This isn't a ""maybe it'll happen"", it is a ""it is happening right now"". We are currently looking at .13 of an inch per year increase in sea levels and if we do not reverse what we've done to our world, that will continue to increase. Not only are we adding more water to our oceans by melting ice currently on land, thermal expansion as the average world temperature rises will cause the same mass of water to take up a larger volume of space compounding the issue. 

As far as Obama's mansion, the man turns 60 this year. He will be dead before that building is underwater. Make no mistake, if we do not reverse the damage we are actively causing then that building will end up underwater.

The only chance they have is if the banks  are smart this time and work with them. There’s been talk about extending peoples mortgages. So if you fell behind 14 months they would just extend your mortgage 14 months. I’m not sure exactly how that would work or if it would work.  I just know it’s an idea that’s been floated

For example we have not seen the wave of layoffs coming yet. We haven’t seen the backlog of foreclosures released. We haven’t seen interest rates go up. We have yet to stop stimulus. We haven’t seen the effect of inflation on the vast majority of people living paycheck to paycheck. So many dynamics at play here.

Lol I don't think you've ever spent considerable time in Chicago, curious where do you live considering how butt hurt you got about my comment? Nothing can really beat  Chicago in the Summer with the lakefront, museums, food, and other entertainment. And it's extremely affordable compared to NYC and Bay Area.   

More and more young high earners were moving to Chicago before Covid and Big Tech was opening up offices left and right as we have some of the best colleges outside the East Coast (University of Chicago ring a bell)? We have FB, Google, Salesforce, PayPal, and many smaller tech companies. As well as several leaders in Cannabis were founded here and are growing fast. 

And some of the wealthiest people in the country make Chicago home, know someone named Ken Griffin by chance lol?

Now the general exodus from major cities during Covid is another story and about to reverse, employers are calling back employees. Mine for instance wants us back by September but we get to work 2 days from home. That doesn't translate to anyone can live wherever they want, which was the fairytale many thought possible last year. 

There was the belief covid was going to change things and I wished it would. But even big tech is wanting employees back to their home offices."

2021-06-01 14:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Every state has different rules on this. Generally, sale of the property is covered in the existing lease. 
Some states require the buyers to honor the current lease until it expires, but others allow a new lease to be drawn up. 
Regardless, it is usually 60 to 90 days notice unless the tenant is on a month to month lease. Then it's usually around 30 days. 
And really that's not unreasonable wait time. Tenants have to find another place to live, sign leases, set up movers, etc. 
I'm a landlord, but I am on the tenant's side on this one- as long as they are paying and not trashing the place. It takes time to move a family, especially right now. It's really hard to find good tenants, so if you have good ones, I always say keep them."

2021-06-01 14:53:49,wallstreetbets,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_Ecuador_economic_crisis

I couldn't tell you regarding the real estate market. 

The upshot is that people generally only buy homes for cash now in Ecuador, which does depress prices and curtail appreciation. Borrowing to finance a home is rare and interest rates are very high.

So the problem for people who already own homes might be that the value of their home stagnates, or even drops, but again, that is not a problem that is likely to lead to foreclosure, as the hyperinflation effectively decreases the real value of their debt. Who cares if you are slightly underwater on your mortgage if the mortgage now costs far, far less than rent. You are going to stay put. If my home loses 25% of its value due to hyperinflation, but my mortgage payment is effectively 50% lower relative to the new, hyperinflated dollar value, I'm going to sit on that house forever, because the price is low. 

It's more likely to cause a liquidity crisis as no one sells than it is to cause a foreclosure crisis.

So while hyperinflation could make real estate less profitable, or cause it to crash a bit, people probably aren't going to lose their homes en masse because of it, because the relative value of their debt is going down, making it easier for them to pay it off over time."

For everyone like that, there are people who lose a little bit. And then there are those that lose a lot and confess.  Loss porn.

If it were this easy to make money, we'd all be doing it.  It's a combination of luck, balls, and insight that all collide in one Venn diagram."
2021-05-31 22:51:11,wallstreetbets,Tbh I I had done my research well before this pop. Once it gained a huge following I knew there was a high chance itd pop again for a few bucks
2021-06-01 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,Cause sometimes you get fucked and sometimes you do the fuckin..... simple as that.
2021-05-31 21:56:19,wallstreetbets,I didn't say you had to nofap. I just said not to fap while i was knocking the bottom out of your wife.

2021-06-01 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,"Go 80/20 on calls and puts so you have a hedge. If it goes up, who cares about losing the put. If it drops again, your puts will off set the loss. Only way you lose it all is if the stock trades totally flat until exp which is pretty much impossible."
2021-06-01 04:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Hi, im new, I need help, how Can I buy a call?,"
2021-05-31 21:54:08,wallstreetbets,I had to. They expired on Friday. If I didn’t sell at the open they would’ve gone worthless
2021-05-31 22:49:25,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I started with only 2.5k in this. Sold for 17k on Thursday and used that to buy more for friday

2021-06-01 02:17:18,wallstreetbets,"I fucked myself by sleeping through/not selling my $30 calls at the early morning (west coast) run up to ~$36, and didn't take profit while they wear at/near the money, assuming the stock would spike again mid day like it did Thursday. Kicking myself in the ass for it, but thankfully only had a few and bought for cheap. I'm fairly new to trading options near expiry, so chalking this up as a learning experience. Did you set targets to start selling? Or sell the few on Thursday to recoup buy-in and hoped for the best Friday? Any strategy tips would be much appreciated!"
2021-06-01 08:05:50,wallstreetbets,Whoever bought those 30’s probably did not have nearly as good of a weekend

2021-06-01 03:08:47,wallstreetbets,I sold on Thursday looking to take my gains. I bought back I’m thinking could make more money off a 1 day OOM call. At market open stocks like these tend to spot up a lot then fall down to normal levels. I used that as my chance to cash in before I risked it all
2021-06-01 04:32:34,wallstreetbets,Yep

2021-06-01 17:59:59,wallstreetbets,must be feelin pretty dang smart after hours rn.
2021-06-01 03:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Man fuck BB, I'm down 37% on that, (it's only 10 shares but still) I jumped on it when the Hill spoke about the January short squeeze right after Robin hood did it's thing.

Figured I didn't have the money to buy GME or AMC but since Saagar said the Reddit crowd was short squeezing BB, and I could afford it at the time I bought 10 with everything left of my monthly income only to see it go down and down and down.

And nobody on WSB was talking about it, nobody, Everyone was still going on about the gaming stock which I then fomo'd into, sold everything I could to yolo 10 at 270€ (320 Dollars) and average down later (since May I'm finally seeing green on that)

&#x200B;

The pure mentioning of BB enrages me it's not a lot of money but down 37% looks grave even if it's pipi money and I'm probably never going to see any green on BB in my lifetime. Most analysts who think it will go up see it going to a range between 13-15 US dollars I bought mine at 16,21"

2021-06-01 10:42:21,wallstreetbets,What happened to BB? It seem like maintained at $10.7. 🤔I wish that it will push through $11 today
2021-06-01 15:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Actually, just read that per last CEO conference call, they are selling patents by end of July.  Rumor is that Facebook is buying, which is ironic given BB successfully sued Facebook for patent infringement regarding messenger.  But makes sense.  Facebook wanted that IP.  Now will purchase it legally.  Once he deal is signed the stock will 🚀🚀🚀 even more!!"

2021-06-01 03:53:16,wallstreetbets,"Can't you read, I spent everything I had on averaging down on Gamestop.

From Saagar's excitement I expected to see the 16 dollars shoot up to 500 dollars or so in a few days. I didn't even join WSB until after I bought the 10 BB, came here looking for BB confirmation bias and ended up losing all faith in it and fomo'ing all in on Gamestop (I was up 8000€ on that last Thursday, and then it melted again to up 4400€ but it's Green and it makes me happy to see green.)

the nice girl from my bank even called me about BB a day or 2 after buying it saying: I see you bought something here that's pretty harsh in the red you want me to cut your loss on it?"
2021-06-01 11:19:21,wallstreetbets,next month? next year? who knows. No one can predict or time the markets. They could announce at end of day today that they're being purchased by Apple for all we know.
2021-06-01 11:03:36,wallstreetbets,👌okay
2021-06-01 03:55:39,wallstreetbets,You have ppl call you about ur plays? Lame lol
2021-06-01 14:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Just because I'm truly a retard, could someone explain what the Apple sale would entail for holders of BB stock?"
2021-06-01 11:31:19,wallstreetbets,Here we go!! Almost to $11.  Once it breaks $11 it's downhill to $20.
2021-06-01 06:01:44,wallstreetbets,No bank does that or gives a shit lol. ...
2021-06-01 04:23:58,wallstreetbets,"It's a small office, she will often call me about all kinds of banking related things, this is a small town, we run into each other in supermarkets and the communal pool etc... Often chat about all kinds of things. Whenever I'm in her office we spend 10 minutes speaking about banking/finance related stuff and maybe 60 on drinking coffee chatting about our families and lives etc...

It's kind of sweet that she called me about BB she's really great."
2021-06-01 15:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Anyone could buy BB ( except Huawei which the Can. gov't wouldn't allow ) Apple, Amazon, Google.... could come in and say we will purchase BB at X$  a share.. or in exchange for a % of Apple stock. Stonk would go up... there are a lot of if's. I'm not saying it's going to happen but .. it could. I mean BB's patents alone are worth a ton. Then the their tech future QNX. In my mind it would make a ton of sense for someone who is in the auto biz to purchase BB now while it's affordable and not later when it will be $$$$$ ... holders of BB would do well as long as the sale / price per stock is higher that what you bought into it at."
2021-06-01 12:24:43,wallstreetbets,And there we go.  It's on like Donkey Kong 🤘

* If the colour is yellow or red, liquidate your retirement and rebalance into a combination of AMC, GME and go balls deep into PLTR.

Discovery wasn't shorted to wheres its at now, the reason why it lost almost 50% of its value its because of what happened to that hedge fund that had a margin call and was force to liquidate its entire positional a few months ago (link included for full info)  
So unless another huge fund buys back that amount its just not going up, or i should say it may bot go up enough for you to profit of it. If you had just looked up the top shorted stocks list you would of noticed that DISCA isn't even on that list and that alone should of rang a bell. But hey good luck maybe the company gets some good new soon and your position can make you some money or at least make our losses back.

2021-05-31 22:05:21,wallstreetbets,Oh whaaat send me 10k of it you have more chance getting your money back
2021-05-31 22:01:55,wallstreetbets,RobbedyouNood is not ok
2021-05-31 23:22:42,wallstreetbets,Diamond hand it to zero.
2021-05-31 20:35:12,wallstreetbets,That’s what I told my wife when she was complaining about me taking too long.
2021-05-31 21:04:42,wallstreetbets,"..and people dont have to ""like the stock"", they can just fucking trade it"
2021-06-01 01:25:37,wallstreetbets,Dame 🤣🤣😳
2021-06-01 02:38:18,wallstreetbets,Was about to say this.. these people are so retarded it makes you wonder how they even have a dollar
2021-05-31 20:35:35,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but that doesn't rule this out."
2021-06-01 06:38:16,wallstreetbets,VIAC is still a good undervalued stock to own at these prices
2021-05-31 20:46:47,wallstreetbets,Consequently it's way oversold and I'm looking for a technical bounce to the 20% upside
2021-05-31 20:48:42,wallstreetbets,U
2021-05-31 21:04:30,wallstreetbets,"A merger. Oh, wait a minute..."
2021-06-01 12:03:45,wallstreetbets,*had* too much money
2021-06-01 08:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Motivation for OP...

https://youtu.be/hGeEXrR84XE"
2021-05-31 22:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Full transparency - I'm really not expecting a squeeze here; this was a move based on FA, TA and carefully watching the options market here.  I bought one trading session too early on this which is why I'm currently upside down and will ultimately limit my profits on this trade.  That said, millions in bull call spreads were bought immediately following this play with 35/40 strikes - you can go back and track the transactions for validity; this is why my bet is on the 20% bounce to 39.  

This doesn't need to be 90% short to trigger squeeze but maybe that's all WSB considers.  Also, please understand I'm not posting any DD reasoning and this post is mostly entertainment value."
2021-06-01 02:26:43,wallstreetbets,"..and they don't need to hold it forever, they can just take profits."
2021-05-31 21:03:20,wallstreetbets,You really dont understand what a shorts squeeze is do you?
2021-06-01 16:17:58,wallstreetbets,Nobody watches CBS. They fucked star trek so I hope they die.
2021-05-31 20:49:18,wallstreetbets,"I just don't see it. It wasn't oversold imo, it just just originally overbought. Looking at a 5 year chart, MACD and RSI only show overbought and the sell off only corrected that."
2021-06-01 08:30:12,wallstreetbets,Currently I think you're looking at a 40% swing down already since you bought it
2021-05-31 23:59:51,wallstreetbets,C
2021-06-01 03:17:22,wallstreetbets,"I know this isn't the proper place to ask but......I've been trading stocks for over 20 years but I just started playing some options recently. Do you buy more contracts in this case? Similar to a stock trade where you avg down, or do you already know going in that your not adding no matter what"
2021-06-01 03:41:37,wallstreetbets,"Man, if these people could read they would be very upset on what you just said"
2021-06-01 10:38:01,wallstreetbets,TROOF!
2021-05-31 20:52:57,wallstreetbets,"The 5 year chart recognizes Discovery as a cable company outperforming albeit an industry in secular decline.  With the merger and their DTC approach with Dis+ they're looking to be valued on global IP.  But I'm not here to post a bull case, just YOLO nonsense."
2021-06-01 00:21:32,wallstreetbets,H
2021-06-01 06:19:11,wallstreetbets,This often depends on liquidity and strategy. I. E. Most people on this sub go all in and have no more liquid cash to buy more.
2021-06-01 06:44:25,wallstreetbets,"You either roll over your existing contracts if the underlying stock hasn't recovered for time value or close them out at a loss. Unlike stocks, DCA doesn't work with options."
2021-06-01 10:37:56,wallstreetbets,:)
2021-05-31 20:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Good luck to you. I definitely don't think there will be a huge price increase in your date window, but I do think you'll be able to close positive."
2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I screwed myself right? 
2021-05-31 22:16:08,wallstreetbets,BB was already up in Canadian market today. There was a sharp increase in price at the end of the day which is a bullish sign. I am long on BB (stocks) and added 1000 more. The sentiment is positive and you may be able to cut down your losses this week. 💎🙌

2021-05-31 21:27:10,wallstreetbets,"You're not screwed. But, you're screwed when you sell at that price."
2021-05-31 20:28:22,wallstreetbets,Ride it out. With the posi movement the last week you have a chance.

2021-06-01 00:05:19,wallstreetbets,This could print - just don’t get greedy and you could be good

&#x200B;

You can do eeeeeet!!!"
2021-05-31 20:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did you buy these at the ATH? Here’s some none financial advice. Buy the $GE 7/9 $14.5 calls. Not advice. Not anything. Maybe do it maybe not. Might go up or down or left or right."
2021-05-31 20:20:29,wallstreetbets,"For whoever said your screw.. they are screwed in the head.

You have a ton of time still, don’t sell or you’ll be sorry. Ride it to the end BB 🦍style 🚀🌚

2021-06-01 01:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Options never expire , that date is just a reminder that a Friday is coming up in two weeks. He paid 24k for that reminder...... In all seriousness all he has to do is HOLD and wait for results and yes I mean hold for at least another week before selling at a loss. It’s a two week contract , yall are paper hands I swear"

2021-06-01 13:46:36,wallstreetbets,"You know what happens in two weeks, right?"
2021-05-31 22:30:45,wallstreetbets,"Options are a little complicated.   

OP bought the right to buy BB at $12.50/share by June 11.  For this right, he paid $1.12 premium PER SHARE optioned.  Options are sold in 100 share blocks, and he bought 219 contracts.  So he bought the right to buy 21,900 shares by June 11 for $12.50 each,  and this play cost about $24,500.

The problem is, as that price target becomes less likely the closer we get, the VALUE of those options are dropping.  He could have bought those same Options now for 50 cents/share, or less than half what he paid.

The $10.04 you see is the current price.

The reason the break even price is higher than his strike price is, he would need the value of the shares optioned to rise enough to also cover the premium he paid to buy the option contracts, so that's where the $13.62 number comes from.   

But if BB starts moving up quickly,  the value of the Options could go up above $1.12/share, in which case he could sell the Options at a profit even if the stock price itself didn't hit the $13.62.

Options are priced on volatility,  so the bigger and faster a stock swings in price, the more Options cost."

How Tesla is quietly expanding its energy storage business
Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in 2015 that the electric-vehicle company would be getting into the energy business. Now, it's starting to take off. On its Q4 2020 earnings call, the company said its battery deployments increased 83% in 2020, particularly thanks to the popularity of the Megapack, which stores energy for utilities.
Renewable energy such as solar and wind need battery storage for when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. As nations around the world set goals to transition to renewables, demand for these large-scale storage systems is on the rise. Grid-scale battery storage is expected to become a $15 billion market by 2027, according to Grand View Research.
CNBC visited PG&E's Tesla Megapack site in Moss Landing, California, and learned why energy storage systems like Tesla's could be everywhere in a future of renewable power. Watch the video for a look inside Tesla's energy business"

“Burry initiated short position(s) on Tesla before or around early December 2020, according to a now-deleted tweet[23][24] and likely added to his short positions[25][26] after the market cap of Tesla surpassed that of Facebook. Burry predicts Tesla stock will collapse like the housing bubble;[26] he boasted that ""my last Big Short got bigger and Bigger and BIGGER"" and taunted Tesla bulls to 'enjoy it while it lasts.'[25] Burry currently holds long puts on 800,100 shares of Tesla.[27]”

2021-05-31 21:49:24,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:

1.	⁠GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2.	⁠BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3.	⁠GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO. 5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

When you buy them, consider that money gone, like you just set it on fire in the middle of the woods when you're stranded in winter. Be quick to take profit, time is not your ally. I bought June 18 calls back in March at $200 each. They fell to 20.. I did not sell, I considered the money gone (I actually bought 10 more). Last week when the price spiked on AMC I finally saw profit. A lot of profit. When it consolidated around 27 I sold at about $570 each. They went as high as $800 Friday and I held because I was asleep when they were that high lul."

The buying pressure is heavy. They have shares to dump but looks like retail investors will gobble them up.

I think AMC is looking primed for a infinite squeeze."

2021-05-31 23:46:05,wallstreetbets,I was up 70k with gme and didn’t sell and then down -10k because I was trying to day trade and buy call options to get my money back And now I’m at +10k maybe with recent run up. If I would’ve just diamond handed I’d be up 22k maybe. Nothing wrong with taking profits. I would’ve been up 70k. Nothing wrong with diamond handing either. Best thing is risk management!!

Besides, putting >25% of your portfolio into a single weekly strike+expiry feels taboo on another brokerage. Have to start with RH. It's one of the rules of WSB.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$Z will disrupt most aspects of the industry that has one of the biggest addressable markets (TAM) I am in the daily thread way too much and I have heard many times that many folks would like to see more quality DD on non-MEME stonks.  I stated a couple weeks ago that I was going to do one on Zillow.  I was able to stop shit posting just long enough to give this a try.

I will include some numbers and links to most everything I lay out in this post, but much of will be anecdotal along with just how much I personally think of the company overall and how I use it. I am not a TA guy personally but do like trends.  

$Z is ubiquitous to real estate (RE) as is $GOOG to search and $ZM for video conferencing.  It has grown and become a part of pop culture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEfsaXDX0UQ I am also in the insurance business and the top search result anytime you enter a physical address in Google the $Z listing for the property is the top result and we can glean any information needed to be3 able to do an accurate home insurance quote.  With the shortage in the housing market, people and families moving more, and the work from home trend continuing, $Z will be at the forefront of the change and disruption that I believe will only accelerate at a pace that will surprise many in my opinion.  

The first disruption I will cover is $Z Property Manager.  From my own personal experience, it is the greatest thing to come along.  I have moved houses in the same city 6 times in 10 years, was in the lake cabin market for many of those years along w having 5 rental properties.  First, the marketing alone from $Z has provided the best and most quality applicants for the rental units.  $Z simultaneously puts your property on $Z, Trulia, and Hot Spots.  Craigslist is nonexistent in this space now (at least in my area) and while $FB marketplace is decent; it does not come close to competing w $Z.  Last 8 tenants have all come from $Z marketing.  It does not stop there either.  Once you get an applicant $Z rental manager allows you take applications, accept applications, and once accepted set up all payments electronically – all online and seamlessly.  They will even screen applicants for public records, credit, and criminal history.  The lease process is so simple using your own documents and easily insert data, initials, and signatures wherever needed.  $Z is now charging (monetizing) the marketing of rentals and I have no doubt they will be able to do so more for all facets of the rental process and I would not blink an eye as long as it is reasonable.  Mobile app is easy to use for all parties from my experience.  Customer service has been top notch on the 3 occasions I have had any questions. https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/

The numbers have been fantastic.  $Z acquired it’s closest competitor Trulia in 2015 https://www.inman.com/2015/02/17/zillow-trulia-merger-closes/ $Z is coming out of the hyper growth at all costs phase of their business and is now actually making revenue while at the same time still plowing billions back into their business and growing sectors and disruptors at an alarming rate.  $Z current share prices is $117.32, off 43.6% its 52 week high of $208.11.

$Z reported 4th Q 2/10/21 and absolute blew past any and all expectations.  My rough research had $Z moving from about $164 to $194 on this report and it had ran up nicely up to earnings.  In my opinion, it then sold off after this in the general tech sell off that started very close to this reporting date.  I wont list all the numbers here, but here they are for you to peruse https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zillow-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx

$Z Q1 2021 earnings report was another beast of a report in my opinion, especially the EPS of $.44 beating expectations by 83% https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zillow-group-zg-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates-2021-05-05

I believe in addition to what is laid out here, that $Z will disrupt how RE is transacted in the future w iBuying division https://blog.qualia.com/spencer-rascoff-zillow/ , but not only that $Z could disrupt the appraisal industry and mortgage industry in the future as well.  I believe all these sectors need to change and that $Z will be the lead agent to do so.

$Z share price has not been this low since Dec 2020, it looks like it has consolidated to me and ready to run and never look back.  TipRanks has an analyst price target of $172.62, an increase of 46% from current share price https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/zg/earnings-calendar YahooFinance! has a 2.2 buy rating and a price target of $184.56, representing an increase of 57.3% over current share price  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/Z?p=Z&.tsrc=fin-srch

Obviously, there is way more information out there and analysis then provided for in here, but I wanted to do a DD on something I believe in that isn’t mentioned on WSB much that I have seen and I believe has tremendous long term viability and growth ahead of it.
Don’t ever invest based on what some dude on the internet says and I have been long in $Z for a long time and plan to only grow that position:
Sold some shares over a week ago to buy a LEAPS Jan 2023 $100 strike and have 50 shares.  Plan is to sell CCs over the LEAPS at some point and to pick up more shares/LEAPS.

I have been compiling this long enough and time to go grill some steaks.  Good luck!

Edit Paragraph formatting and getting the links to work

Edit 6/1 just sold a $110 CSP 6/18 for $3.50 on margin. I really believe my DD 😉"
2021-06-01 01:02:57,wallstreetbets,"A lot of tract homes have been built since the 1990s.  Thousands of cookie-cutter homes scattered throughout subdivisions with identical lot sizes.  I can see Zillow owning those transactions by perfecting a algorithms to be within 6% of true market value and being able to under-cut realtors by taking direct listings at a fraction of the price.

In more rural areas; no chance.  But that is not the high turn-over market Zillow wants."
2021-06-01 00:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Thank god, something that not sink it all on AMC and GME."
2021-05-31 21:19:04,wallstreetbets,"Question, you stated that the Work from Home trend is continuing strong, but now that 150+ Million Americans are vaccinated, lots of states are Re-Opening their business and 34 States have dropped the Mask mandate. Assuming the vaccine hits 250+ Million; that would mean 3.5/4 of Americans are now vaccinated and ready to go back to work. I guess my question is, do you think that if the work from home trend decreases it would affect $Z? 

Thanks for the DD."
2021-05-31 23:07:44,wallstreetbets,"My approach is to just keep buying on dips.  It feels like a 'build a position, check in 10 years' type of deal to me, like an Apple or Google."
2021-06-01 00:02:59,wallstreetbets,"I was wondering when Zillow would make it to WSB, I've been in for the last 3 months during the ride you described, doubled my position (now 100% in) on the way down scooping stock and options at 105.xx it's a no brainer! 160+ by August"
2021-05-31 22:47:00,wallstreetbets,"For years Zillow promised Realtors they were not competition. Then Zillow started Ibuying and got licensed brokerages in many states. Agents have been paying $1000's every months to get leads from Zillow. The leads from Zillow are reportedly getting worse all of the time. Realtors see now that Zillow is not an honest partner, so I predict their income from leads will decrease. Zillow also overstepped when they bought Showingtime. They are about to have ultimatums in MLS's across country. Either withdraw their brokerages from all of the MLS's or they will replace ShowingTime when or before the contracts are up due to the conflicts of interest. Ibuying will also be a broken business model when the bubble pops, unless they go the American Homes 4 Rent route. We are already seeing the market soften nationwide over the last few weeks. Too many headwinds, I would stay away."
2021-06-01 00:45:41,wallstreetbets,"This is much better than the last DD I read on $Z.  

But buyers beware:  Real estate prices are high but volume is way down.  I can’t predict the future but I am really cautious of the real estate market so long as inventory is constrained by eviction moratoriums and forbearance programs."

I for one contemplated selling my house bc the money Id make would be great, but then I have to buy another house that's probably priced above value also. Plus the houses that are going up for sale are being bought sight unseen in a day. So I think OP has a good point, Z has the potential to gain."
2021-06-01 01:42:56,wallstreetbets,"I think people are now looking at ""going into work"" as something that they might do a bit but not as much as they used to.... we have proven that WFH doesn't lead to total disaster for many industries and people are now feeling ""I don't want to sit in a cubicle all day I want to sit in my house and be comfortable"". And people are thus re-assessing where they live; the house has become far more than ""it's a place that let's me get to work easily""."
2021-05-31 23:09:06,wallstreetbets,"We're NEVER going back to how it was.  The trends in CRE are nuts right now. Companies that rented 10 floors in towers not renewing leases on 3 of them, and getting options to put back 2 more in the next few years.  And the owners have to take it, because they're that desperate."
2021-05-31 21:22:27,wallstreetbets,"I meant that we won’t go back to the way we were. People will go back for sure, but will still be much higher than recent history. I also think either way it is negligible on $Z. Thanks for feedback."

2021-06-01 00:06:32,wallstreetbets,Picking up more. Good luck

2021-06-01 13:24:15,wallstreetbets,Hate to tell you not the 6-7% plus fees sometimes that is charged for selling and buying a house needs and will be disrupted I assure you
2021-06-01 07:15:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-31 22:03:19,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. People want different house set ups due to the ""Covid"" realizations of what life could be like working from home. Just from the anecdotes in my personal life, I see more people staying put due to not being able to afford a home due to lower inventory of homes / uncertainty of income.

I'm not sure which push/pull is stronger -- the demand of moving due to change of situations and low interest rates OR the supply of less homes. If it is simply the supply, then things should correct when levels meet the demand (still would take years). If it is leaning toward lower interest rates, that could correct much quicker (ie a few months)."
2021-06-01 09:58:33,wallstreetbets,True.  But sales volume is way down nation wide.  That’s not a good thing for the real estate market.  I have a friend that owns a real estate company in Miami.  Her listings are down by 80%.  I live in CO and there are 3 homes for sale under $1.5M in my entire zip code.  And this is not a high income zip code.  Prices are up over 25% since last year.  I think it’s safe to say the inventory of affordable homes has been wiped out in a lot of places.
2021-05-31 20:34:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks for assisting and RE in most areas are just nuts and many reasons you cited plus more. Good luck.
2021-06-01 15:34:06,wallstreetbets,I want a new house due to a growing family and it just happens to coincide with this madness. I just want to be able to quit renting a damn apartment but it's getting more and more expensive to be able to own!!!

2021-05-31 22:59:39,wallstreetbets,"I am. They are mostly doing their Ibuying in larger markets and competing against other IBuyers like OfferPad. But with innovative Realtor affiliated programs like 72SOLD, they have already lost a ton of marketshare in markets like Phoenix."

Z will be above $300 in the next 12 months"
2021-06-01 13:32:44,wallstreetbets,So Zillow will not take fees any more? How are they gonna make money? Zillow has -18% margins on their house flipping business btw.
2021-06-01 13:07:23,wallstreetbets,Interesting.  How do you see redfin as a competitor in this space?
2021-05-31 22:06:14,wallstreetbets,"I would disagree with the stating that it isn't ticker competition. It is absolutely ticker competition. Zillow's space is getting more crowded every week and with the recent home price increases, more and more VC's and private investment firms are seeing $$ and possible spread in the space."
2021-06-01 13:34:35,wallstreetbets,You sound like a RE agent honestly.
2021-06-01 15:41:35,wallstreetbets,"Redfin has been a discount brokerage from the get-go. They partnered with Offerpad on the Ibuyer side, which I again contend will be a stream of revenue that will be drying up when the real estate market shits the bed. They are such a small player in our market that I haven't tracked them as much as Zillow. Chances are almost all brokerages will become discount brokerages in the near future with some of the court cases going, so their space might get crowded. 

Zillow is Darth Vader's Empire of the real estate space. They want to turn agents into Uber Realtors and pay them a pittance per showing or sale in my opinion so they can pocket the cash. They purchased Dotloop and ShowingTime so they can scrape all of the data on buyers, sellers and agents. But, again, I see regular agents turning against them as they have shown their true face after peddling lies for so long."
2021-05-31 22:12:13,wallstreetbets,"From a business aspect obviously there is competition.  I was more referring to OPs comment that there are ways to make money off of more than 1 ticker. It doesnt have to be one or the other. OP posted DD on this particular ticker, if someone has DD on Redfin they can post it."
2021-06-01 15:19:10,wallstreetbets,I am unemployed living in Africa lol. Just hear for the discussion. I have no skin in the game.

Earnings on June 8 are going to be fucking phenomenal.  Analysts haven't been convinced sporting goods stores could carry pandemic success into 2021 but they have.

All peers knocked it out of the park and ASO is best positioned among them all.  Lots of people se it as an ammo play (which has sold exceptionally well lately) and a squeeze play (which there is some small element, and all existing shorts are red, but I don't factor this in) but it's really a reopening play.  Sports leagues in the southern US are full go, and there's been 12 months of pent up demand for things people don't order online like cleats, baseball bats, and golf clubs.

May see a little dive before earnings.  I'll be buying heavily this week and may end up with a YOLO if it dips a lot.

2021-05-31 23:27:45,wallstreetbets,"Pro tip: when you take your dog out for a pee/poo, don’t take him back inside right after he does his business. Otherwise, you teach him that he goes back inside after his pee/poo, so he’ll make a bad association with it (assuming he likes it outside, as most dogs do).

&#x200B;

So, keep him out longer after he does his thing.

2021-05-31 21:48:10,wallstreetbets,Do you have blistering cold more. Personally I can beat the heat with water sports so I lean to warmer weather. You’re also by a ton of lakes and the mountains to escape the humidity. I’ve never actually been to Charlotte but was on my possible move to list. When do you have till having to decide?

2021-06-01 04:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Ok. It's due to the arbitrage opportunity from the efficient market hypothesis. basically the efficient market hypothesis states that all stocks on all exchanges trade at their fair value, and are not undervalued or inflated. To dumb it down, it is basically saying that the price you see in EU or US or wherever is the actual price of the stock everywhere else.

Now, this creates what is called an arbitrage opportunity, where, in situations like yesterday fo example, where EU was open and AMC gapped up to >$30 due to all europoors buying whilst US was closed  (remember it closed at $26 in US on Friday) there was a price difference between EU on 31.05 and US on 28.05. This 'arbitrage opportunity' is essentially taking advantage of the price difference between the two exchanges and will cause the price in US to match that of the last listed price of the same stock in EU. So, the opening price for pre market in US was $29.45, which was the same price at 10:00am here in Germany (when US pre market opens)."

I see Charlotte being a better investment if you’re looking to own as I suspect more and more people will be heading south for that warmer weather.

Think of it as a learning experience cause it is. once you're comfortable with that you can start doing options then others.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB - Unbiased Technical Analysis ***TL;DR -*** $BB's candle on Friday was ugly and the volume was not supportive of the trend. In order to see more upside - we have to clear this resistance at **11.86.** Above there, it's full speed ahead. 

There is key support at **9.84** and **8.71** \- if you are one of the people long right now hoping for a squeeze - it may be in your best interest to stop out below one of those (daily close).

\-----

Fully prepared to be downvoted to shit for not going along with the group think - but for those who are more focused on making money than catering to their bias - I figured I would give a little $BB roadmap.

This one is not nearly as simple as my previous plays. We are already in the middle of the breakout. We've also **already hit the primary target** I had for said breakout.

From here - we need to look at key supports and resistances to determine whether there is good odds for more upside.

First - let me review the breakout in question:

[$BB 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/19nhc3d71i271.png?width=2244&format=png&auto=webp&s=04bad77e41550e92a0c48c296b07d5f063009f9f)

Here you can see we were stuck in a descending channel from Feb 2nd\~ until May 25th. This is the exact same setup as many other meme stocks. 

After breaking said channel - along with a lot of the other names of this nature - we broke our first key level @ **9.84** with nice volume - and then followed through further to **11.86 -** the far target for this move. Overall - it was a fantastic play and generated some nice profits.

However - **Friday's candle was not pretty -** long wicks like you see there on the top end on a red candle are generally a bad sign for bulls - although I'm not crazy about candlestick reading. It's just one data point. More importantly - we closed lower than we opened with a huge increase in volume. This is often a sign of a major top (or bottom if the role is reversed). 

You can see a similar occurrence on **12/1** \- as well as **1/26** \- although the volume was much higher. Again - just another data point - but one you want to take note of. Every TA post I see here is pretty much people just cherry picking indicators that fit their bias - and that does no one any good. If there is one thing I know - **it's that if you go looking for confirmation bias - you will find it.** Be careful.

Now - let's take a look at the bottom line - **the data that we can actually put into practice, levels:**

Very key support is sitting @ **9.84** \- below that, **8.71.** If we lose the first one, it's not a great sign for momentum. If we lose the second one, I wouldn't go anywhere near this thing.

Now - **for the bull case:**

We have very key resistance @ **11.86 -** if we got a daily close above there, we would rocket straight to **14.37,** maybe even **15.72.**

How I would play this:

Enter long on a **daily close above 11.86 -** target **14.37** take half my position off - set a trailing stop loss on the other half and shoot for **15.72** if volume is supportive.

You always want to let the plays come to you - it's not good to force things.

*Not Financial Advice*

---

Update: Solid close today - memes are rangebound/in no mans land currently chopping back and forth - but potential for crossing that 11.86 tomorrow. The fact that we did not lose 9.84 today was a good sign.

Range is 11.86 - 9.84 looking for a break either way.

Small caps also broke out (RTY) which is great for meme names.

As I type this we are going over 12.10 -

—-

15.72 was the last resistance before 20.00 - we rejected off it this afternoon but we’ll see about tomorrow"

2021-06-01 01:42:58,wallstreetbets,"Honestly. Whatever. What do you think is gonna happen when there’s major call action all week.  going into a long weekend, people are going to close their positions just like they did AMC just like they did gme. It causes downward pressure for a variety of reasons discussed here ad nauseum. 

Call volumes say we continue to rise and i like the where the moving averages are and weekly macd looks ready to cross over for the first time since January. It’s funny how you say people cherry pick indicators and then you go ahead and cherry pick yourself. Are all the indicators pointing in the exact same direction? Of course not, yes RSI is elevated and looks overbought, but things can go from overbought to really overbought and stay there for a long time, just ask TSLA shorts. 

All that being said I believe in the company, know it has a huge future and dont really care what happens over the next quarter(s). despite my mammoth investment  id actually prefer the stock drop so i could pile in more of my net worth into this. 

Finally in my view and for the first time since January bulls are back in control or at least back in the fight. Call premiums are up and overall interest levels are too. Its gonna be a very exciting stretch."

2021-05-31 21:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:

1.	⁠GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2.	⁠BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3.	⁠GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO. 5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 7 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. Although it's a short week this time round, there are still  a surprising ammount of companies posting, meaning there's good money to be made! That being said, earnings season is just about over, so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around. Thank you all for joining me for the ride!

&nbsp;

All that being said, I love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z8vpI6JOEWFScuCdl-gVnmyVEYEJSwB7Jz_BqozX-Bk/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Although risky, Digital Turbine options are inefficiently priced.** Similar to ZScaler last week, Digital Turbine has the gambler's edge this week. Historically, Digital Turbine moves roughly 8% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. Furthermore, across the past 10 earnings reports, Digital Turbine has moved an average of *15%*, giving us an insane edge. Unfortunately, the direction this could go is a complete tossup. Digital turbine is sitting at 4 month lows indicating the potential for a moonshot, and they also postponed earnings by one week, indicating that there's something going on behind the scenes. They claimed they postponed due to the ""anticipated completion of a recently announced acquisition"", leading me to believe they plan to drop some announcements regarding the merger during the ER call, which could be incredibly bullish. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills, or a call debit spread.

&nbsp;

- **Scotia Bank earnings are very likely priced in already.** While the 5 other major Canadian Banks reported earnings last week, Scotia Bank has been banished to this week. Unfortunately for us, we can't make a collateral play on it since it's followed the *exact* price action as the other 5, while still not reporting earnings. The other banks have gone up roughly 2-3% during earnings week, and scotia bank followed suit on no catalysts. Expect Scotia Bank to stay flat or go down post earnings unless they managed to create money out of thin air, or put forward some insane guidance.

&nbsp;

- **Slack has capped upside due to the SalesForce acquisition.** Although you may look at the historical moves and options pricing and think it's an absolute steal, I would avoid playing this ticker entirely. The details of the acquisition state that shareholders will get $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce stock in exchange for each share of Slack on the day of the merger. If you run the numbers, this equates to roughly 45$ per share of Slack. With Slack currently trading at 44$, it leaves us with less than 2% upside on this trade - absolutely abysmal odds and return. Slack has no reason to breach 45$ either, as then shareholders would be paying more for less come the merger.

&nbsp;

- **Similar to last week, liquidity is suspect**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 35 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BNGO Discounted Cash Flow Model https://preview.redd.it/ko3tmu2buh271.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b152ff16064d6ce20439d94e448adac57d08878f

This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO. Please note that I haven't made any pin-point assumptions. All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate. I'm not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst. I'm just a random guy applying his financial education in real life.

I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions. Please let me know if I'm missing any other types of revenues/expenses. If you feel its justified, feel free to share it on other social media platforms! :)

Recently on SeekingAlpha, an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be $7.3 which I feel wasn't justified enough. I believe it was because he didn't factor in Saphyr 2.0 potential and didn't project his sales for longer years. Well, so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself.

NOTE: This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time, its really hard to estimate those numbers. Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of $12. I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth $12.

EDIT: I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit. I will be incorporating those changes, but it will only affect my analysis positively.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*TLDR; #BNGO2THEMOON\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Units Installed:

Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80% every year as more and more labs/clinics/hospitals/etc start to adopt it. Though from year 2028+ I have reduced the adoption to 50% every year, giving me an almost 70% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rent/Sold:

I have broken the sales of Saphyr into “rent” and “sold”. This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of “sale”. As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript, he said rentals are more sales; however, this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level. My assumption is 60% rent and slowly reducing down to 35% by 2030+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue per Consumable:

We currently know it costs $550/consumable. As BNGO’s goal is to reduce it to $100, I have done about $50 decrement each year starting 2024 (when Saphyr 2.0 will launch) and achieving $100 from 2028+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 1.0/2.0:

Saphyr 1.0 is just 5000/14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year. Why divide by 14? Because that’s what Saphyr 2.0 will be able to do.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Min 120 Genome per 6 month (Rent Agreement):

If someone rents from Saphyr, that’s what the agreement states currently. This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr (rented ones) per consumable price every year. I’m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle:

Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr. For them, the genome run would cost $450 instead of $550. However, for ease of calculation, I have not included the $100 discount in my calculation. Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year. I’m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 2.0 Consumables:

This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of “assuming stuff.” We all know they are aiming to launch 2.0 by 2024. Therefore, adoption of 2.0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2.0. We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year, but not every lab/clinic/hospital/etc will be running that much. So for my calculation I have assumed only 5% of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere. This will increase by 2.5% over the years up to 20% by 2030+. In terms of CAGR, it will be increasing by almost 180% every year. Given the power of Saphyr 2.0, I think its reasonable enough estimate. I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher. My calculations are based on that only 25% of the full power of Saphyr 2.0 will be used. This section is debatable and I’m happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Revenue:

Revenue growing at 79% CAGR. Again, this is a very conservative number from my perspective. Also, as per Eric (CEO), he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2.6B – 3.8B with 10,000 Saphyrs sold. In my calculation, we hit 10k mark in year 2029. We can see total revenue is around 2.3B, lower than Eric’s estimation. Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation. Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off. I’m assuming 65% will be sales and 35% will be rent by 2029. Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate??

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Margin:

Currently BNGO’s margin is around 33%. To be very conservative, I haven’t increased margin by a lot. I’m estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Costs:

This is any other costs over operating expenses, just being more conservative. I’m increasing it at a rate of 20-30% over the years at a 25% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Profit/(Loss):

You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024. It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

Formula: Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt

Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta\*(Market Rate – Risk Free Rate)

Risk Free Rate = 10Yr Treasury Bond = 1.75%

Market Rate = 8%

Beta = 2

Cost of Debt = 0 (As BNGO rarely have any debt)

WACC = 14%

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Cash Flow:

Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminal Value:

Assumed a 3% industry average for BNGO. Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage. But for ease of calculation purpose, BNGO will grow at 3% for the rest of its life.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firm Value:

After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14%, it gives me the company value to be around 5.5B. This is about 3x the current market cap.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outstanding Shares:

The current outstanding shares are 279M. For the sake of dilution articles out there, lets say BNGO raises extra $350M and lets say at $7 price, this would mean extra 50M shares. So, out outstanding would now be 329M.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Price per Share:

With the 5.5B MV and 279M O/S share, this gives me a share price of $20. This is about 3x the current share price. Giving a potential upside of about 200%. Even with the extra $350M offering, the price would fall to $16.7 per share.

Well, in any case, as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method, BNGO seems to be heavily discounted."

Could it make some investors and consumers risk averse enough to limit some of BNGO's initial growth? Something to look at ahead of the mid-june FOMC meeting.

2021-06-01 12:29:32,wallstreetbets,"Well by that case then Amazon and Walmart should have 80% margins by now. 

I agree on most of the assumptions but growth and profit margin are quite important. 75% for 10 straight years is quite generous. And margins typically decrease over time, not increase. Theres some saving due to scaling but costs tend to increase too. In 10 years their margins will double? It's just too generous. How about a sensitivity analysis using 33% margins and lower growth?"
2021-06-01 16:32:03,wallstreetbets,"I have gotten a lot of feedback and I will for sure be doing DCF 2.0 with more and better assumptions. In this exercise I haven’t taken taxes into consideration. As I said, I’m not financial expert and this was my rough and dirty analysis. Even with lower margin etc we will end up with a price $10+. 

Also note that I haven’t included Lineagin and Other services revenue BNGO offers. I purely used consumables and units sold revenue! 

Another thing I want to mention is that after 2030+ my assumption is 3% in CF. Meaning company will be increasing net profit by 3%. So in the very long run, BNGO will come to the average. It’s only the first 10 years that look high, but honestly imo, seems fair to me given what ARK and some other analysts think. ARK thinks 82% CAGR from 2020-2025 and another analyst on seekingalpha thinks 80% until 2026. After that it might start the creep down but not by a lot hence, my 60% gross margin and 50% net margin!"

Their PC line up hasn't seen the quantity shipped that it could have, and with the pandemic, Intel is eating up the market of ""gimme a CPU and gimme it now"" people. IIRC AMD does have a big fat chunk of TSMC's production capacity, and will for awhile so they are locked in for years in terms of production. Throw that in with domestic (USA) fab production and potential funding from government, and AMD is sitting pretty. And don't forget about their server lineup. EPYC is doing fairly well for them, and their laptop lineup is, I think, gaining steam. Their laptop CPUs are SIGNIFICANTLY more power efficient than Intel, so they get much better battery life.

AMD is buying XLNX in a purely stock transaction and every share of XLNX will turn into 1.72 shares of AMD when the merger is completed.

There's always an outside possibility that the merger won't go through, but I haven't heard any plausible reason why it would get blocked (NVDA buying ARM on the other hand... that's risky IMO, UK govt analysts did NOT like nVidias server CPU move)."

They were cheap, and performed well, before Intel was able to update to core2 duo and quad, which greatly enhanced core and thread performance.

Intel and AMD build chipsets around different philosophies. AMD builds cheap and wide, Intel builds innovation on pipeline efficiencies.

I don't invest in either right now, but (in the past) they essentially diametrically swapped for each other in terms of gains/losses marketwise. Ride AMD for a while, then sell and ride Intel on market news. Rinse and repeat.

I was kind of framing that statement from a gaming perspective. https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_value_available.html Notice how the top of that list is a $170 part? That would be considered pretty mid range which is what the vast majority of users would be targeting. 

> amd absolutely obliterates intel on sheer performance.

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html  
  
Well how about that, single thread performance is nearly identical at the top. Your statement probably comes from just comparing benchmarks utilizing all cores, of which AMD generally surpasses in core count and will of course start to look like it is destroying Intel but the real world performance for *most people* is not going to be significantly different even beyond the first 4 cores, let along hitting 8 cores or more. Most consumer programs will not see the benefit of a 5900X's 12 cores/24 threads."
2021-06-01 17:44:03,wallstreetbets,"DLSS is the main killer feature. Also RTX Voice (now RTX Broadcast).

And you can pretend that ray tracing is a fad, or you could look at Digital Foundry's latest video on the new Metro Exodus update that requires an RTX card. It's absolutely stunning. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't even worth playing without ray tracing imo. 

More and more games will take advantage of it and there is a reason why AMD is desperately trying to catch up on ray tracing and DLSS-like tech."

2021-06-01 09:52:04,wallstreetbets,">4) WIX, competitor of SHOPIFY, has similar number of live websites but has 10 times less revenue from merchant solutions (they call it business) than SHOPIFY. Financial statements of WIX are: https://sec.report/Document/0001178913-21-001179/ Usage statistics: https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Shopify https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Wix-Stores   5) Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. This is very unlikely since the standard period is minimum one month. The thing is that even the absolute number is lower than WIX, not just percentage.

I have a Shopify plus store, and they bill in $5,000 increments multiple times per month. Shopify is *the* ecommerce solution - Wix ecommerce is just trash."

2021-05-31 23:58:54,wallstreetbets,"One more thing. OP's whole analysis on principle vs. agent is wrong.

Here is how IFRS defines the principle vs. agent relationship:
https://ifrscommunity.com/knowledge-base/principal-vs-agent-revenue-gross-vs-net/

A principle is the party that controls the goods/service prior to transfer to customers. 

What does control mean? 
>- primary responsibility for the good or service meeting customer specifications
>- inventory risk
>- discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service

By OP's own research, Stripe only processes payments. Pricing and delivery of the actual Shopify platform is done by Shopify themselves. Control is firmly with Shopify, and thus they are correctly recognizing revenue as gross.

In fact, most payment processors are agents. They are the middle man between the retailer and the consumer, and have no discretion as to what goods/services are being transacted, and at what price.

TL;DR: OP definitely did not pass his CPA exams."

2021-06-01 05:11:02,wallstreetbets,I think is because Shopify did use YouTube rapidly and make lots of people in Asia recognizing shopify. While WIX doesnt have much promotion compare to shopify compared to Chinese market. Hence unless Wix go aggressively in Asia market. Otherwise their revenue won't as good as shopify.

2021-06-01 04:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Ok, fellow apes. I see a lot of criticism about my statement that Shopify has to recognize revenue from Shopify Payments as an agent, not as a principal. Let me put it in simple words. You buy a bus ticket for international travel from a travel agent. You paid him, he paid to the bus travel company. In this case travel agent is an agent and must recognize revenue on the net basis (difference between what you paid him and what he paid to the bus company). Why? Because if you feel bad in the bus, tier explodes, bus driver dies it will not be his problem. The whole responsibility is on bus travel company. When you are stuck at the border in the night travel agent will be sleeping in his bed and bus driver will be there with you. Even if travel agent is not sleeping he doesn’t have tiers, medications or another driver to give you. Travel agent could be a principal if he rented the whole bus with driver and as a result controlling your journey.
Shopify simply doesn’t have the bus. Firstly, it is not on the balance sheet. Secondly, Shopify didn’t announce it and they announce everything that makes them look good. When customer pays via Shopify Payments money is entering Stripe system and going through the whole Stripe system to store. Shopify doesn’t even rent a separate channel of Stripe."

If we have a major market correction or worse (bear), SHOP will decline to that level or lower.

If there is fraud, sure it could go to $150.  The problem is fraud isn't discovered by looking at the financials that everyone else sees.  There will have to be some shenanigans that are being hidden, even from the auditors."

2021-05-31 20:46:27,wallstreetbets,Being over valued is one thing lmao but everything is overvalued lol. GME at 220$ is normal lmaooo?
2021-06-01 00:07:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Deciding how to treat intangibles in companies where shareholder equity is approximately equal to intangibles still always gives me trouble. Tried reading the INDOPCO regs and just came out more confused.

2021-05-31 23:08:04,wallstreetbets,He's selling puts Doy
2021-06-01 00:26:49,wallstreetbets,"You're right. That's my bad, I was looking at marketwatch instead of pulling from the reports. Short term was listed in miscellaneous. I don't know why the discrepancy then, but that would be something you could ask IR about, if they have any details on how they're booking deferred revenue.

Edit: All I can think is if there is a big difference between monthly and annual billing. WIX deferred is about 37% of annual rev. Shop is about 11%. If SHOP has way more monthly billing and WIX has more annual, then that could explain it?"
2021-06-01 03:04:24,wallstreetbets,Have you reported them to tax office for fraud yet?
2021-05-31 20:43:12,wallstreetbets,Do you understand what the word custodian is lmao. Do you think the cfo keeps his commercial paper in his shoe??? Gtfo with this bs lmaoo. Clown man.
2021-05-31 22:55:17,wallstreetbets,Not everything is overvalued.  Alimentation Couche-Tard is one off the top that's ridiculously undervalued.
2021-06-01 00:54:06,wallstreetbets,True was talking a bit bout some tech companies
2021-06-01 01:10:52,wallstreetbets,"Not convinced by OP on this but this comment is spot on. It's like trusting the the government assessment on your property value - since they need taxes to go up they're incentivized to not be honest.

Or the rating agencies here giving out bond and stock ratings. They get paid by companies they're rating or who hold assets their rating in some cases which means they're constantly balancing good work with making sure they don't lose a client"
2021-05-31 21:13:59,wallstreetbets,If you buy puts... I'll buy puts!

2021-06-01 07:15:48,wallstreetbets,"The GME short squeeze thesis relies on the presence of a large number of naked shorts, that are created/maintained in such a way that they couldn’t possibly be counted in “official” short interest figures. Days to cover is therefore even less useful than usual.

They think there is a large amount of naked shorts because the options data indicates the possibility that Deep ITM calls/puts are being used to reset reg sho close-out.

The techniques they appear to be using are discussed in this SEC warning:

2021-06-01 13:59:07,wallstreetbets,"That's a fair point, about irrationality invalidating some models, but that kind of invalidates the dynamics of a squeeze as well."
2021-05-31 23:26:05,wallstreetbets,Short squeezes definitely occur in pennyland. I have played several tickers in the last month from what I have learned from the GME DD and been successful in picking small-cap stocks ready to pop.
2021-05-31 23:11:59,wallstreetbets,"The answer is GME was shorted to a degree never before seen, and would have squeezed regardless of retail's involvement.  It was triggered by Ryan Cohen and his two friends being named directors and buying 20% of the float all at the same time in January.  It was a powder keg waiting for a spark and RC knew it, and we were lucky enough to have a small handful of guys *who don't even post here anymore* to clue us in on it.

Can you depend on that confluence of circumstances happening all at once again?  And to see it coming?

You'd have to look for situations like that, or where Porsche bought up all of the float of Volkswagen, or Shkreli bought the entire float of whatever that pharma company was.  The one thing they all have in common is ONE ENTITY came in and bought all the shares.  Retail buying and holding 6% of a company ain't gonna do it."

I do see the squeeze being more difficult to start for two reasons; firstly at this point apes are probably tapped out to create buying pressure that would create momentum (and the stupid buy the dip mentality is also a killer) and secondly the toxicity of the stocks to the “logical crowd” means they won’t pile in like they did in January."

2021-06-01 00:15:39,wallstreetbets,">You can’t force a bankruptcy through short selling

You can exponentially increase the odds of bankruptcy through short selling by artificially deflating the price and crippling the companies ability to raise cash.  Gamestop raised half a billion when their stock was in the $150s and eliminated long term debt. This would not have been possible at $4. They did this by selling a few million shares during a period of time when the price was actually going up showing the shear amount of buying pressure the stock naturally has even with the dilution.

>No evidence of them doubling down. Though some did short at $300+ and made fantastic returns

There's a game show called Golden Ball that seems kind of apt, but it's like a multi-player version of it with variable payouts. Cooperative strategies - in a world where there are no defectors do, in fact, have a higher payout here, but of course, it's +EV to defect, and if that becomes the norm, then it's +EV to defect earlier, and so on, until there's some price equilibrium, right? 

If that's price discovery though, who is to really say what words like ""fundamental"" mean? Aren't they just econ major apes, that make EBITDA, p/e ratios, and all those fancy terms nothing more than a dogma that only works because other people believe them, and just as self-fulfilling a prophecy as the apes?

C) cdos were derivatives, exotic ones. They were all documented and understood. There was nothing wrong with cdo as the product. The problem was with people not checking what they were buying and being tricked by salespeople that they were buying high quality debt. Just because the layman found out about cdos after the crash does not mean there were not plentiful sources to read about them if you looked for them. A lot of people had been warning against them too, that's why some made crazy money. 

My statement was more about being critical of theories and ideas that originate solely from reddit and have 0 backing in any reputable source. You need to be especially critical of anything that confirms your bias because that's how you get swindled. If you have researched these things and you feel confident they are true, then good for you, at least you are making an educated decision. That's all I'm pointing out.

Every person who's long on the ape stocks is incentivized to promote good and bad reasons for buying/holding. That's why the conspiracies are so sticky.

Isn't a DD here (especially the more dogmatic ones) or someone posting some garbage article on SA, a short research report, ARKK, or even Berkshire publicizing their positions all an implicit attempt to get people to jump into your positions, thus, increasing your EV?

2021-05-31 21:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Following 1/28, both price and volume plummetted, day over day, for weeks.  And yet obv remained flat overall. which by all means - it shouldn’t have based on how the sentiment & momentum indicator it is - works, and is calculated.

I understand how obv is calculated, which is why this doesn’t make sense.  Please feel free to correct me.

Take 2/2 to 2/3 for an example.  Obv on 2/2 was 1,019b, having opened at 279 and close at 115 witb 78m volume.  Obv on 2/3 was 1.061b, having opened at 197 and closed at 100 with 42m volume.  

How is this possible?  If price goes up - obv = previous day obv PLUS volume.  Price goes down, obv = previous day obv MINUS volume.  So between 2/2 and 2/3- obv increased by 42m, even though it ‘should’ have gone down.  There are several other days during this period where we see the same thing.

Now looking at it purely in terms of similarity to the crayons - obv tracks fine on upward price movement - but not when it goes down.  Outside of meme stocks - which at the beginning of the year were ‘admittedly’ highly shorted stocks - i can’t find any other examples of anything like this.  And it’s not rando vol spikes throwing it off either - obv tracks explosive shit like rkt just fine, up and down.  

Checking obv using AH / premarket trading tweaks the numbers a bit but the trends remain.  It makes no sense."
2021-05-31 20:41:04,wallstreetbets,"Ok, the health comment was in reference to what the shorts wanted, and tried to do - which is force them into bankruptcy.  So while this company is not instantly a blue chip because ryan cohen showed up with big dick energy - that bankruptcy shit is completely off the table for the forseeable future.  Meaning - if this stock was shorted naked and excessively, as many including myself are convinced it is - the shorts are completely cornered now that there are millions of retards buying and holding.  

Also keep in mind, that short interest ‘reporting’ is based on shares not marked as ‘long’ when sold, which several of the involved players have a rich history of fudging, and subsequently being fined laughable amounts for.  Those shares sold short aren’t part of any report - nor are shares sold short by market makers doing ‘bona fide market making’.  So basically, the short interest reports can’t be trusted.

I use webull for OBV, i hate it for trading but i really like the charts.  I dont wanna get banned mentioning another sub, but there are others who’ve written on the subject and offered a variety of screenshots to illustrate the point.  

At 1 crayon = 1 day, obv ‘should’ track price.  It is a sentiment and momentum indicator.  So as gme’s price rose up and down in ‘21, so should have the OBV.  Except it hasn’t.  This momentum indicator shows even higher values now than in january.  After 1/28- if everyone was selling, obv would have plummetted.  Except it didn’t."

Same as with CDOs, it's not about the thing itself, but about people taking advantage and cheating for personal gain (i.e. get as much money as possible).

&#x200B;

Lastly, whether you want to believe it or not, short selling has been a shitshow in the American economy for at least 100 years. Like any other tool, it might have its purpose, yet just like any other tool it can be used for nefarious purposes if there is no regulation of said tool. This technique has long been used as a predatory practice for big money to take out companies and make a big buck while doing it."

2021-05-31 22:22:09,wallstreetbets,"If OBV is going up on red candles then your platform is calculating it wrong. There isn’t some universal OBV value that just exists. It’s just a calculation made based on normal price and volume data. 

OBV remained flat when volume plummeted because OBV only moves when there is volume. And since it’s cumulative, any day with massive spikes in volume will make future low volume days look even smaller.

OBV does not measure sentiment or momentum. You can interpret as an indicator for those things but neither is an inherent property of OBV. And because GME has abnormal volume spikes, you can’t really compare it to stocks with normal price and volume movement.

RKT only has one volume/price spike and it has a red candle with high volume the next day.

GME goes up with extremely high volume. Then the price trickles down with low volume. This is exactly what the OBV chart shows. It’s literally just an indicator, and a very basic one at that. It has no secret meaning and you can’t just compare it to other stocks and say “something is fishy” because all of the data in OBV is also available in the price and volume already on your chart."

2021-05-31 23:19:37,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the wrinkle, i realize now these numbers are not absolute.  Though, im seeing the same trends on TOS, even though the exact numbers don’t match, the disproportionate volume following 1/28 makes sense why obv doesnt rise AND fall in proportion with the price, you know, peaks and valleys and such.  But having deleted the buy button - it is unsurprising why the price could be cannibalized on super low volume, and still supports the way i have been interpreting obv.  

Admittedly, 6 months ago i didnt know shit about fuck, fomo’d in jan, and have poured my life into understanding this world since.  I looked up OBV on investopedia, when trying to follow a thread here on reddit and trying to understand wtf was being talked about - and it says this:

KEY TAKEAWAYS
On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical indicator of momentum, using volume changes to make price predictions.
OBV shows crowd sentiment that can predict a bullish or bearish outcome.
Comparing relative action between price bars and OBV generates more actionable signals than the green or red volume histograms commonly found at the bottom of price charts

So to be clear - I’m a retard, and am not saying obv is a sentiment and momentum indicator because i took some deep dive and figured it out for myself.  The reason i stated it as such, and am using obv tbis way as i try to make sense of all the colors and shapes on my screen, is because that’s literally what i was told it is, when i looked it up."

2021-06-01 00:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I like to think of it in physics terms. Momentum is mass * change in position over time.  In trading terms that would be volume * change in price over time 

OBV doesn’t measure the price, so you need external information in order to interpret momentum with OBV. It does measure volume and the general direction of the price, so it can be a good momentum indicator during high volume, but it can also be misleading. Especially when the numbers get skewed by spikes in volume.

OBV is also a pretty good sentiment indicator when there’s high volume and a distinctive price change. Obviously GME sentiment is extremely bullish when volume is high and the price spikes. But when volume is low it doesn’t really tell you much about the sentiment. You can sort of think about the smaller off-spike movements of OBV as “people aren’t interested”. So I guess it’s kind of a non-directional sentiment measurement. You really need more price data to judge sentiment though

For example, there can be periods of high volume where prices don’t change much at the end of the day. You basically have a ton of buyers and a ton of sellers and they all end up counteracting each other. In this situation, OBV is going to move strongly in one direction even though the actual momentum and sentiment were neutral. If it’s a green candle then all of the seller momentum and sentiment get associated with the buyers even though that’s not what happened. 

So like I said, you can indicate momentum and sentiment with OBV but you need some extra information. I think the way you were using it was kinda reverse engineering an OBV interpretation based on what you already knew about the momentum and sentiment. 

I read a few of those OBV DDs too. They’re not good. Most of the TA and indicator DDs are pretty bad as well. With indicators, I think it’s really important to understand the math behind them and try not to over-interpret what they’re telling you. Indicators can be really useful to summarize data in a way that works for your particular brain, but some people treat them like magic prediction machines and that’s just not what they’re meant to do.

Anyway, thanks for reading and engaging with me! Most people ask for an explanation and then vanish once you give one."

I agree - and think i did reverse engineer it, which makes sense as i’ve been looking to poke holes in this whole thing, and there OBV is  - presenting a case to support what i already know as fact: people have fomo’d in, and continued to pile on since jamuary.  Downward price movement is being achieved with less volume than the inverse, and could be explained by minimal retail firepower during periods of no news / tweets etc.  

As part of a birdseye view looking at this whole thing - obv makes sense with the reddit narrative when taken in context, but i do see your point that - in and of itself, obv does not present a slam dunk case.  Instead, i see it now as maybe some smoke, not necessarily fire, when taken in context.  

Unfortunately, due to the beyond lax reporting on short interest - and vague / shady explanation of the numbers reported and what they actually mean (no transparency on the # used for float, etc) - there’s really no way to prove true short interest from any charts or sec filings, which is why we resort to alternative methods and theories.  Which really is the main point of all this.  The fact that so much effort has gone into keeping these figures hush, even after dodd frank mandated more visibility / SI reporting - along with media constantly telling me to ‘forget gamestop’ - has my bullshit meter dimed out."

We know that every day, swing traders short it and buy it all day long to scalp on price movements.  This is where, again, you just ignore what you don't want to believe.  If it's your choice not to believe those things, you are rejecting facts and wading into the make-believe.  You don't get to act like you're the reasonable one while treating your made up numbers like they're better than the real numbers, and then say ""nobody knows!""

It's true that the float is tight.  Absolutely true.  That makes it volatile, which makes it super profitable to swing trade.  I have done it.  I've even shorted it but honestly I chickened out on that pretty quickly, and now I just buy when I see it at support.  Institutions are doing it every day, all day.  

Have you ever shorted something?  Do you want to know how covering works?  Click ""Buy"" and that's it.

The shares are available to buy.  There is literally nothing stopping them, and they can do it whenever they please.  Billions of shares have traded hands since January squeeze.  There were only, at the peak, about 120 million shares shorted.  Which is a fucking huge number, but nothing in comparison to the volume.

2021-05-31 20:52:40,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is overpriced I love the car I love musk I love the idea of the company but the stock is WAY over priced it cost more than the next 10 major manufactures stocks combined with less sales annually and lower profit margins than them. Tesla should be realistically priced at 70-100$ range because it does have a brighter future than a lot of other car companies. Will it drop tho no trading and stocks over the years have become less about actual performance and more about the potential hype and speculation around it. I do expect Tesla to dip in the 300-400$ range however and I don’t expect it to see those $1000 plus per share stocks anytime in the near to mid term future. With more EVs coming out and more mass marketing and adoption of them comes less interest and focus on Tesla which will bring its stock down as a lot of its price is litertly based on the attention and focus it has on media and news as the primary EV maker the last few years . Once the market is more saturated with EVS tesla is going to have to make a decision on if they are a Luxury EV company and focus on that market or if they are a economic EV company and focus on that market. Having two different markets under the same brand dilutes the brand and turns off luxury owners from your brand (think a Kia k900 or Hyundai Genesis) awesome loaded cars but because their focus is economy not many luxury owners even check it out or give it a thought. Theirs a reason Mercedes and BMW don’t have brand new cars at $15,000 range it will ruin the value of their high end models by diluting the brand from luxury status to everyday status. I think the future for Tesla is going to be more rocky than it’s investors believe it to be. There is a lot of aspects that go behind brand recognition and exclusivity on luxury brands vs budget brands if you have 100k teslas and 20k teslas the 100k buyers are going to start looking at what is more exclusive for the price range as they don’t want to wield the same badge and brand as the average consumer. They may have gotten a Tesla today but in 6 years they may opt for a Porsche BMW Audi Mercedes EV instead of the Tesla if they try and serve the broad range of luxery and economy class

1: A lot of (good) competition coming their way in the next 2 - 3 years

2: Their after sales operations are a hot mess.  (and it will continue to get worse with each car they sell)

3: Their carbon credits are going to evaporate in the coming years as companies won't need them.  

4: China is becoming a major issue for them.  Sales dropped ~40% in April.  combination of factors:  unhappy customers, govt is pissed at them, etc.  

5: Europe is declining for them

6: Since their profitability model depends on selling cars and *RETAINING* customers, 1-5 do not bode well.  (E.g. sell the car and collect the sweet subscriptions:  Self Driving, Supercharging, Internet Data, Insurance, Lease)

The **best** EV range money can buy - which is an $80k car btw - has just matched the *median* for ICE vehicles (which a $5k used Camry can do). 

Not to mention if you actually use all that range, the Tesla takes close to 12 **hours** to recharge where filling a gas tank would be under 5 minutes.

The problem is battery technology, which is largely a chemistry problem and not something science has ever made linear progress on. We could see a huge breakthrough next week, or not until the next century - but what we absolutely will not see is a steady continuous improvement in EV ranges.

No, he didn't. He literally outlined his thesis in febuary before he deleted his twitter. 


> imma bet the inflation jumps a couple percent let me bet half a billion. 

Firstly, he didn't bet half a billion. He bought puts representing a nominal value of half a billion. Huge difference. He probably bet  only $10-30 million depending on the premium on the puts he bought. 
 
Secondly, inflation jumping a couple of percent can absolutely demolish growth stocks without any crazy ape conspiracies getting in the way. He made these bets in Q1, most likely before the 10 yield started spiking. It went up less than 1% and Tesla corrected by 25%. He made a fuck load of money off being right, probably in the tune of $100 million.

Every time I go on Netflix, it takes me like an hour to find something I want to watch, and half the time I realise it sucks, stop it, and download something from a torrent site instead.

The UI is godawful, the reccomendation system is useless. There's no way to hide shit you don't want to see, so you've got a wall of shit you don't want to watch. Shows arrive, and then get removed without notice, so even if it does have something I want to watch, I have to watch it RIGHT NOW. They had Das Boot recently, but I didn't want to watch Das Boot while I was sick, by the time I was better and I felt like watching Das Boot, it was gone, so I torrented it instead.

I don't see why anyone would keep Netflix. Army of the Dead was their top show of the year, and people hated it. They didn't watch it because they liked it, they watched it because there was no other options. People hate Netflix, it has nothing, and the experience sucks.

Theyre also expanding quite rapidly in asia afaik, people rave about disney and hbo, but, again afaik, their competitors arent making local shows that go viral, Netflix has french and korean shows doing really well internationally and even better locally. Some comment said hbo makes all the best shows, but i cant think of more than a few hbo shows ive heard people talk about, meanwhile Netflix has about a dozen shows a year that go mainstream.

I think this is just the struggle period where everyone tries to compete with Netflix, but i think a few years down the line most of them will have given up/failed and Netflix remain the champ, i just dont see how anyone could triumph Netflix without some unforeseeable shit happening.

That said, Netflix still might be overpriced, i have no idea whats their fair value is, especially with the fact that these next few years might be their hardest, even if i still think they will be amazing over a really long period."

2021-06-01 13:49:36,wallstreetbets,"I like HBO Max's selection, but their streaming software is the absolute worst I've ever seen. *Hulu* was better at launch, and that crashed at least once per episode. HBO Max has the worst input lag I've ever seen. It takes like 15 seconds to pause, you can't hit the ""rewind 10s"" button more than twice without freezing, etc., and that's when the service is actually working! Truly garbage software. They should invest in contracting some competent people who can make it run more reliably that a PutLocker mirror site. Any paid service should at least have a better experience than  a pirated one!

On the other hand, I'm impressed with Peacock. It's a good service with a good selection. Haven't had a problem with it! 

Anyway, I agree with you, I just wish HBO knew how to make the player function properly."

2021-05-31 20:29:14,wallstreetbets,"From my perspective, I was poor when Beyond had their IPO. I knew about stocks but I had no money and I told my parents and some others who had the ability to invest even a bit that it was going to be big and would be a wise investment. They went public at $25 and here we are. Nobody listened to me"
2021-05-31 22:12:59,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think beyond meat will disappoint going forward. The ones who will love it jumped on it a year ago. Carnivores won’t embrace it unless it’s half the price of ground beef. They aren’t going to win over as much additional vegetarians as they think- some just think meat is gross- nobody is doing to eat fake poop just because it’s not real poop if they think poop is gross. And people who like poop are going to want the real deal. I think the only place for them to grow is lower price- so I’m not sold on BYND.
2021-05-31 20:29:51,wallstreetbets,We'll see where it's at after current squeezing season. Keep focused and put your money where it belongs...$AMC
2021-05-31 20:26:30,wallstreetbets,BYND is 10% of my freezer portfolio. I like the product. When Cramer said buy I sold it.
2021-05-31 20:03:24,wallstreetbets,">And anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. 

Exactly, so why should we set up a potential short squeeze for a company foaming at the lips to dilute stock. Not every shorted stock has a squeeze potential. They will issue stock in a heart beat. Not only that but follow the mantra, Do opposite of what Cramer says to do an you'll make out alright."

2021-05-31 21:05:56,wallstreetbets,Yes BB short squeeze happening this week
2021-05-31 23:06:09,wallstreetbets,"There are monthly and weekly options. The monthly options are 6/18. Most people buy on the monthly because there is more volume and smaller spreads (the difference between the bid and ask price).

Not a problem if you bought the 6/25. Make sure to check the open interest on an option before you buy it though. You lucked out though- I see an open interest of about 800 on that option. Open interest tells  you how many open contracts there are (so compare it to outstanding shares of a stock). But sometimes you might have an open interest of 10 or so. That's not too many that would buy your option if you needed to sell. For comparison the option for 12 on 6/18 has an open interest of 28,000. So about 35 times the amount of buyers and sellers as  your option. But 800 is still plenty to work with.

Think of open interest like going to the market, or auction, and having an audience of 10 vs 800. You would probably be more likely to get the true value for your product with more people, if that makes sense.

In regards to the earnings, I'm not too sure how that would affect the price- I'm inexperienced with this stuff. Seems like others are suggesting it's okay to keep the option, but consider selling a week or so before earnings, or possibly a few days before earnings to maximize profits (or earlier than that if you see the price not making any moves or going down). That was what I read, but don't take my advice- I probably know as much about this as you do."

If they weren't gona let GME go into the thousands the first time when they blocked trading, they aren't going to let that type of situation play out again...also the 500k price would send the market cap so high it would dwarf every other company combined and would cause a subsequent crash because the numbers would not justify it at all. It's not just about short interest/squeeze etc...there are so, so many other factors that come into play lol."

2021-06-01 14:42:25,wallstreetbets,"You know, the rapid expansion of electric vehicles and states starting to ban the sale of new gas cars over the next decade has me thinking about the upcoming stress on the power grid. From what I've seen, electric cars take about 30 kilowatts of power to drive 100 miles. Average American commute is 16 miles one way, so you're talking about a full charge twice a week, just for work. I think it's fair to assume an additional charge for other miscellaneous errands (and school, driving around town, etc.) 3 charges per week, or 12 charges per month. That's 360 kilowatts monthly, and 4,320 annually. *This is just one car.* The average American family has 2 cars, and 35% have 3.

The average household consumes about 600 kilowatts per month already (a little less, between 580-600). That's 7,200 kW annually. 

We're talking about more than *doubling* the power usage for average families once EVs become standard. States like California already struggle to keep the lights on. I know the intent is for wind and solar to replace fossil fuels, but you're talking about incredible stress on the power infrastructure that I don't think they can handle. Nuclear can, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of support for that in the American political class.

To make this more WSB appropriate: how can I make money off the inevitable infrastructure failures from sudden EV adoption?"
2021-06-01 15:09:18,wallstreetbets,"You make a great point on the increased demand stress on the power grid. However, there is a key point that I disagree with in your argument: growth/replacement rate. I believe this will have a major impact on the future of individual EV companies.

First, I think you're grossly overestimating the rate of replacement in the US; the United States is actually the market with the slowest penetration and adoption rates. Families considering getting an EV will not replace all their cars at once, but incrementally. The replacement rate is higher in Europe and Asia, where governments and interest groups have stronger influence in forcing the early retirement of ICE vehicles and spurring the replacement rate. Similarly, per-capita income growth in developing countries will focus the majority of new car buyers in these developing markets in Asia. 

Parts of your thesis are not lost on me; the United States auto market will continue to be the largest market within our forecast horizon, and likely benefit domestic players. Poor charging station coverage will likely favor HEV/PHEVs instead of BEVs, which also reduces power load on the grid. 

I think your thesis is correct, with significant other factors contributing to the growth in power-facility stocks. Increased adverse weather conditions will make picks like Generac and Caterpillar attractive, which also synergizes with your brownout assumptions. Changes in regulation for renewables will make solar/wind portfolios more attractive. Large, geographically safe utility companies could be a safe defensive play."
2021-06-01 17:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Fair points, and the US has probably 15+ years before really widespread adoption. I'm mostly looking at the state mandates right now, which (I don't think) have been challenged in court. If these bans start going into effect, I think you're going to start seeing big spikes in EV penetration. I think the average American keeps a purchased car for something like 10-12 years, so it could take a decade after bans start being enforced. 

I just had the stray thought about power consumption, and my head started spinning when I did my weak-ass math. Maybe we'll have figured this kind of thing out by the time gas cars are really replaced, but there's a ton of work to do, and a lot of it is looking pretty ugly."

It's an operational barrier, not a legal barrier. They do not want to touch negative rates (yet).

They do not want the excess reserves to be loaned out, which is why they're paying IOER."

2021-05-31 20:47:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah my options Friday lost 54% even after I averaged down. Now its unlikely I will profit off of them unless we breakout quickly. Otherwise I'll cut losses and move on. New options players use optionsprofitcalculator dot com to look at your potential profit/loss charts. Super helpful if you don't understand time decay.

2021-06-01 08:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Excellent question, ape. The only reason to use a more sophisticated algorithm is to improve accuracy, but there are two fundamental problems with the proposed solution. One is inherent to the hypothesis that sentiment is a proxy for price action. I believe that was true, that's why I built an algorithm. This turns out to be partially true. The basic correlation analysis (Kendall's Tau) revealed that the ticker mentions correlate to the volume, however volume does not correlate to the positive price action. The second problem is the time scale of the algorithm. Because of my day job I cannot do intra-day trading, so I choose daily predictions. Unfortunately, the algorithm becomes almost descriptive (reactionary) than predictive. Yes you can find all the great stocks a day later, but that doesn't help since MM already starts their counter move the next day. There's probably a third and more nuanced issue, which is related to natural language processing. When someone mentions a ticker, say GME,  in a positive way, it follows with lots rocket emojis and ""i love the stonk"" or ""that is the way"". Your algorithm needs to be sophisticated enough to understand stonk==GME. That's why you need transformers with a sufficient beam length (sorry for the technical jargon). For all these reasons, it's ""hogwash"". Believe me, all the HFs have much better algorithms (I'm suspecting LSTM, maybe even transformers) than the one OP is running here."

2021-05-31 23:55:15,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily. If they put up another YOY growth of 70% or more then it’s on track to be 3b ARR next year.  This is one of the hottest secular industries for the next decade
2021-06-01 08:15:33,wallstreetbets,I felt bad that no one had filled in the blank yet.

2021-05-31 21:16:29,wallstreetbets,Calls on companies making life size sexbots with remote-operating capacity.
2021-06-01 10:45:32,wallstreetbets,"All those serve personal users.  The difference is Zoom is trying to serve the corporate world and is even dipping into government.  Municipal government uses regular Zoom ... And need I mention ZoomGov?  It's like if DocuSign pushed their product out with fake encryption, which Zoom literally did."
2021-05-31 20:38:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah maybe Skype? XD
2021-06-01 02:02:34,wallstreetbets,"I mean there’s a chance it could shoot up soon w the hype but most ppl on the bb sub were thinking around 20 by eoy, so leaps around the money but tbh youre better getting shares, or just not investing unless your cool with holding a year or two ( I’m just buying shares but 9-10$ weeklies could print who knows)"
2021-06-01 09:24:07,wallstreetbets,Morning.
2021-06-01 09:23:29,wallstreetbets,Thought it already squeezed?

2021-06-01 12:32:14,wallstreetbets,You think today is a squeeze? because it went up in premarket? ok then. I'll keep buying puts. good luck with your trade.
2021-05-31 23:58:37,wallstreetbets,That is definitely the way… I’m all shares but will buy long dated calls on another major dip because this ripped right back from March
2021-06-01 00:01:41,wallstreetbets,PMd you
2021-06-01 16:06:21,wallstreetbets,would you recommend selling my 30 shares while it’s $30+? i’m in @ $10 average.
2021-06-01 12:36:51,wallstreetbets,No buddy YOU SAID IT WAS A SQUEEZE AND You tried to mislead apes. Why u doing puts???
2021-05-31 20:27:05,wallstreetbets,Wen Lambo?!
2021-06-01 00:02:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah looks like there may be some resistance at the $225-230 level. Probably buy leaps if if drops back down to $170-175
2021-05-31 23:58:50,wallstreetbets,Your opinion is accurate. Frame work wasn’t built to handle any to this. Now it’s just going to be patch after patch
2021-06-01 17:39:32,wallstreetbets,"First off, congratulations on making 200% on your bet. That kind of performance with shares rarely happens so quickly. I would set a stop loss to lock in your profits at the very least. Here are the questions I’d suggest that you ask yourself:

If you were holding $900 in cash, would you buy 30 shares of AMC right now, or would you put that money somewhere else?

If you saw the price fall to $15, would you hate yourself for not selling when it was at $30?

If the price goes to $60 how will you feel about having made 200% on your money instead of 500%?

Also: you don’t have to sell it all, you can sell 10 shares and cash out your initial investment. Or you can sell 20 shares and lock in that you’ve doubled your money. Good luck!"
2021-06-01 00:03:50,wallstreetbets,Unless there is a correction in growth stocks again that probably won’t happen. They’re growing 80% YOY and the 3rd fastest company to reach 1b in ARR behind CRM and Zoom which was completely driven by the pandemic and will be decelerating
2021-06-01 11:23:08,wallstreetbets,"As someone from Mobile, who knows that plant, I think the price increase is a huge overreaction. It's a small plant, with old equipment, environmental issues (lucky for them the state doesn't care), and stuck-in-there ways management. Shell is selling it cause it's not worth the liability. 

The money to made is the loading facilities. When New Orleans/Houston gets hit with hurricanes, the loading facilities here make \*BANK\*. Also, this will propel Vertex into having the ability to start maturing their logistics and shipping businesses."
2021-06-01 12:07:28,wallstreetbets,Too late? :(
2021-06-01 12:09:27,wallstreetbets,congrats and fuuuun would it be to enjoy your profits.

2021-06-01 12:15:29,wallstreetbets,Here we go!!
2021-05-31 21:48:37,wallstreetbets,So they could buy back anytime ?
2021-05-31 21:52:47,wallstreetbets,That’s what it sounds like.  Not sure if there’s a time window. The way the CFO said it made it seem like they haven’t used the billion yet. They did do a special dividend in March but so far nothing in terms of a buyback.
2021-05-31 22:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Probably lost more than i made on options, but when they hit just right they keep you coming back!! 😅😅😅"
2021-05-31 21:53:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah the dividend is what made it shoot up

Market cap for TLRY is $7.4B vs $1.8B which is 4x

Not even close….  TLRY all the way
Maybe when Tilray reaches $40 becomes a tossup"
2021-06-01 00:12:09,wallstreetbets,"11.  Fuking learn what IV and Theta are and how you keep losing your ass even when the underlying stock seems to move in the right direction. Hint: High IV = expensive fun token & High Theta = expiration coming soon.

The IV like the  point spread of a sports bet.  If some one let you bet on the cowboys vs the jets only giving the jets 3 points, its good.  If some one offers you to bet on the cowboys giving thet jets 22 point you're a retard.

even the disaster known as the jets can't figure out how to lose to the cowboys by more than 3 touchdowns.  yes it can happen, but you will lose much more than not."
2021-06-01 00:15:04,wallstreetbets,one time after yoloing my whole account on pumkin futures in november i got my penis stuck to the ice tray and called the fire department.

2021-05-31 23:32:19,wallstreetbets,Lumber is already going down
2021-06-01 00:19:59,wallstreetbets,">Yeah except PLTR is growing at 50 percent YOY

their debt is growing at 100% YoY. PLTR has never turned a profit in its history and per their 10-K they may never be profitable.

In addition their stock based compensation model is deeply flawed; they already have 1.7 billion shares and the rate at which they are handing them out will likely lead to secondary offerings."
2021-06-01 08:18:37,wallstreetbets,"That is absolutely not true. Their debt from this quarter is basically the same as it was from the same quarter a year ago. Actually in this quarter alone they decided to pay more than 200 million to payback their long-term debt obligations, cuz they have so much cash. Their total liabilities increased by only 30 million on a YoY basis. On the other hand, their revenue grew by more than 40 percent, their free cash flow increased by 404 million dollars and their cash at hand grew by 300 million. That is extremely impressive and it comes as no surprise that most analyst were amazed by Palantir's performance in this quarter. Palantir is a cash flow positive company and the only reason they are not profitable is because of SBC.On a non GAAP basis they are actually profitable. (TL:DR- they are basically choosing to not be profitable, to provide their employees with more equity)"
2021-06-01 17:48:25,wallstreetbets,">they are basically choosing to not be profitable, to provide their employees with more equity

so they don't care about their shareholders, they have already made it clear they have no intention of paying any dividend in the future.

>the only reason they are not profitable is because of SBC

their SBC model is deeply flawed, they are too heavily reliant on paying their employees with shares of their company. every other page in their 10-k references SBC.

in addition no one really knows what the company does, it takes reading until page 90 in their 10-k before they finally state that a majority of their work is classified."
