2021-05-30 19:43:21,wallstreetbets,Going to YOLO $5g on some calls. I’m not gonna miss it this time...
2021-05-30 19:22:43,wallstreetbets,"My ape brain caught on fire.
What do you want me to do?
YOLO calls, buy stonks?"
2021-05-30 19:51:44,wallstreetbets,BB to 14.60!!!!
2021-05-30 19:44:39,wallstreetbets,What are those charts for
2021-05-30 19:51:06,wallstreetbets,Fighter of the DayMan
2021-05-30 19:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

TLDR BUY BB SHARES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Position: 25k at 10$"
2021-05-30 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,Ive been side eyeing BB all year. Picked up 100 shares last week out of some CLF FD returns. Wouldn't be terrible to see some movement next week.
2021-05-30 19:17:24,wallstreetbets,"I initially bought in to BB at 16$ and was able to average down to 13$ range. Holding around 400 shares currently. Honestly I don’t mind bag holding even if it doesn’t reach 13$ in short term , I have great confidence that in 2023 with their QNX product for EV’s we will have a 20billion market cap+"
2021-05-30 19:36:18,wallstreetbets,Better squeeze before the 18th my calls are basically ded
2021-05-30 19:17:58,wallstreetbets,BB is hitting $30 this week. LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌💎
2021-05-30 19:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Wow. Lots of fucking shorts huh? Scum fucks, let’s 🦍 gang bang the fuckin piss out of them!!!"
2021-05-30 19:10:58,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-05-30 19:30:16,wallstreetbets,Both!
2021-05-30 19:25:53,wallstreetbets,"Same here bro, I got in at $18 during the peak and it hit 25 and never sold and was freaking out when the value dropped. I didn’t want to panic sell at a loss so I just waited and averaged down during those red days. My average is currently $12 so seeing myself break even on Friday was a blessing. I’m holding till it’s 20+ again. This week should be interesting how AMC ended up"
2021-05-30 19:21:26,wallstreetbets,Sus profile.
2021-05-30 19:44:21,wallstreetbets,Yes that's how market making works... market makers are required to be delta neutral. There isn't a short squeeze on BB really though iirc
2021-05-30 19:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Unlike you I did the opposite , tried to catch the falling knife😂. But yea honestly we was down as much as 7.80$ and it was depressing to look at. Friday felt good in the morning kinda shitty near end but like you said I also think it’s only starting. BB atm is 1/2 cap of AMC and with its QNX product it seems undervalued in my eyes. Plus sentiment across Reddit has been very bullish for BB in this upcoming week. I think we could maybe hit 13$ this week"
2021-05-30 19:22:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m new to Reddit, so kill me"
2021-05-30 19:57:28,wallstreetbets,Even though the % shorted is almost 42%.... 2nd highest in past month....
2021-05-30 17:53:18,wallstreetbets,There won’t be a correction with the Feds printing money. But if they keep printing then you tell be worthless
2021-05-30 18:23:56,wallstreetbets,Tell them when I die put my money in the grave my money won’t be used for shorts! Trendies for this life and trendies for next life ape strong!
2021-05-30 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,"That's a reasonable take; to be clear I'm not advocating for a correction here, but a 7-10% pullback sometime this year before heading higher (which I believe we do into the end of the year) seems reasonable.
As I stated, hard to determine direction but it looks less likely for this kind of pullback now vs 5-6 weeks ago"
2021-05-30 19:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Such a pull back as well may be temporary, as they usually are. Someone argued that the recent pull backs to 405 was the pull back and now that we've bounced off that there's no place but up."
2021-05-30 17:51:03,wallstreetbets,I like it. Let’s see what happens.
2021-05-30 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,I showed my D to your wife and she let me go all in to 🦍
2021-05-30 18:45:17,wallstreetbets,What did your wife’s BF say?
2021-05-30 18:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Everyone says they sell low quality products but that's not true. I mean, they sell Chinese brands but for many people that would work. For example, my dad bought a nice leather bag and all in all he's satisfied. Okay, it's not Gucci but it does what it is supposed to"
2021-05-30 18:38:37,wallstreetbets,Her boyfriend is going to hate this.
2021-05-30 17:55:13,wallstreetbets,Skimmed. Their biggest issue is shipping time. Generally Products are priced low avg shipment time is over 60 days
2021-05-30 17:55:41,wallstreetbets,Isn't this the company that sells the shittiest items known to man?
2021-05-30 18:27:28,wallstreetbets,But did you ask her boyfriend if you could go all in?

2021-05-30 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,Puts on wish. No business that sells fake Seiko’s should have anywhere near their market cap

2021-05-30 18:08:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol, actually she told me about you, she said  that  with a small size the only choice was to go all IN not only the D,"
2021-05-30 18:47:52,wallstreetbets,"This  is  the big question, I have doubts because she accepted  with no problems !!!!  Maybe  he was alredy all In in other stock,  before me

So  she  is the big winner , with me or with him she is always winning"
2021-05-30 18:37:25,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Some people have bad experiences but I've bought dozens of items on wish and got what was promised every time.
2021-05-30 18:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Lol, it sales what you pay for,  you cannot pay 3$ for Item  and  wait  for a 50$ quality"

2021-05-30 18:31:58,wallstreetbets,"Two simple rules to invest by.

1) When you own stocks, only two prices matter. The price you bought and the price  you sold. All the other stuff in the middle is just there to give you ulcers and is best ignored. If you cannot sell at a profit, DO NOT FUCKING SELL! Once you sell a stock that has dipped you lock in your loss and that is that.

2) Never gamble with money you can't afford to lose, because the desperate gambler always loses."

Wrong. The market can be irrational in the short term, but is ultimately rational in the long term (voting machine short term, weighing machine long term). The point in having diamond hands is having conviction in your investment thesis, and not letting the number that the market offers you cause FUD. Investment thesis adjust over time, as the company, the sector, and the market changes. If you believe your thesis no longer applies, and the stock is not an attractive investment at the current price point, then you absolutely should sell. If you believe that your decision to invest was correct, and that the market will ultimately recognize it, then a fall in price may instead offer an opportunity to buy more.

To put it another way, lets say you never invested, and simply have the cash value of your investment sat in your brokerage account. If you would invest that money in the stock at the current price, then you should hold (or buy more). If you wouldn't invest at the current price, you should sell, and move your money to a more attractive investment. Being willing to hold and willing to buy (given sufficient liquidity) at a price point should be considered equivalents, and being unwilling to admit defeat and lock in a loss simply makes you a victim of phycology, and will limit your gains in the long run."

After watching George Gammon's videos all night, I've been studying Paul Franke's article this morning titled *The Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse* and making sure what I've been reading/watching are correlating with his hypothesis.

I want to warn my family about a financial collapse but know they'd look at me like I was crazy... I probably shouldn't even bother telling my therapist. She'll just tell me to ""stay in the present."" hah

The Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse  
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4413979-great-2021-bond-market-collapse  
CPI = Consumer Price Index  
GDP = Gross Domestic Product  
YOY = Year Over Year  
Note 1:  
“To artificially drive interest rates lower for the common good over the last 12 months, the FED under Chairman Powell has purchased nearly $4 trillion in Treasuries, added mortgage securities, and even acquired corporate bonds to stabilize prices after the coronavirus pandemic recession of 2020. In total, measured from the Great Recession bond buying program begun under Chairman Bernanke in 2008, **the FED’s balance sheet has risen $7 trillion. For perspective, $1 trillion in FED assets was accumulated over the previous 95 years of the central bank’s existence**. These quantitative easing efforts have injected $7 trillion in paper money and liquidity ($23,000 per U.S. citizen, $92,000 for a family of four) into the financial system the last 12 years, **producing the biggest bond/stock bubble in the financial world’s history.**  
At some point soon, if interest rates are not allowed to free float again, **either capitalism will be supplanted by complete government management of the economy like other socialist experiments that ultimately failed miserably, and/or confidence in our currency by foreigners could implode.”**  
Note 2:  
“Well, with loan rates still being held underwater by record Federal Reserve interference in the world’s primary bond market, the 2021 rate picture could quickly become the most detached from reality since 1966. **The projected 6% gap between nominal GDP growth in the second half of the year and the current 10-year Treasury rate is absolutely horrible news for bond investors.**   
Analysts are boosting their growth and inflation forecasts, with Americans on the cusp of getting stimulus checks under President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion package. The average projection for nominal gross domestic product hit a 32-year high of 7.6% in Bloomberg surveys. Even after doubling to 1.6% since November, 10-year bond rates can barely keep up with the growth upgrade, leaving the gap between the two likely to be the largest since Lyndon Johnson was President.   
Note 3:  
**The last time nominal GDP to bond market yields was this out of whack with reality came during the rising inflation 1960s and spiking inflation 1970s.** While some of us have been suggesting investors look to inflation hedges since the FED announced “unlimited money printing” efforts last March, the reality of 3% to even 4% YoY CPI gains by the summer is only now sinking into mainstream thought on Wall Street.”  
Note 4:  
“**Warren Buffett** (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway), in his annual report letter to shareholders released late in February, specifically mentioned **fixed-income investors face a “bleak future” as inflation and economic growth accelerates after the pandemic.** Jamie Dimon (CEO JP Morgan Chase) correctly and aptly recommended investors shun the Treasury market back in early December. **He said he would not touch the U.S. government bond market with a 10-foot pole**, much less consider buying securities at today’s record low yields.”  
Note 5:  
“If the FED refuses to raise short-term savings rates and/or allow long-bond yields to increase a further 1-2% this spring, **we could see a complete loss of confidence in the dollar’s exchange rate, forcing foreigners to liquidate U.S. financial assets.** And we desperately need overseas capital with our staggering structural sovereign deficit borrowing needs of $2+ trillion each year, alongside the $5-7 trillion mountain of annual refunding requirements.  
Note 6:   
If they (FED) don’t allow a bond market rout (likely cascading to a stock market tank similar to 1987), **even bigger issues with our currency will hit like a bomb later in 2021.** Compared to a relatively stable U.S. currency situation for decades, none of us in America have experienced a true currency crisis, **or what repercussions a 30-50% drop in the dollar would unleash on world trade and wealth movements.** \[For example, given a Yuan to dollar value increase of 40%, the Chinese economy would almost overnight become the largest in the world, passing America with a gracious wave as they zoom by the former #1.\]  
Note 7:  
The flip side is a **FED adding fuel to the inflation fire by continuing to interfere in Treasury security, corporate debt and mortgage markets.** If that is our future, I fully **expect a dollar tank will be the release valve for those wanting to express their disappointment in America’s failing economic experiment in socialism.** A total train wreck in the dollar’s exchange rate could quickly lead to even higher inflation and interest rates in 2022, nicely above 5%.”  
Note 8:  
“My gut feeling is the March 2021 world is looking a lot like the middle of 1987, which I traded. A weakening dollar, record money printing, a super-strong +50% stock market advance over six months, spiking commodity prices, an upturn in the economy, and a zig-zagging lower bond market were ingredients of the 40% equity market crash over less than seven weeks into October 1987. Sound familiar? **The scary difference to consider is today’s stock market is the most overvalued in history, based on total market capitalization to GDP output, price to tangible book value, and price to underlying business sales.**  
**Playing the FED’s current game of manipulation, guaranteed to outline amazing losses in asset purchasing power, spells real trouble for funding Uncle Sam going forward, at a time of record need.”**  
Note 9:  
**“TLT remains the ""poster child"" bond investment to Avoid or Sell. I am modeling another 20-30% price decline, on top of the 13% loss in 2021 to date,** assuming coronavirus herd immunity is being reached into June and the FED realizes its aggressive easing mantra has reached checkmate.  
I have been short TLT off and on since December. **My battle plan today is to reenter a small short position in the $136-138 area**, on a minor rebound following last week's beat down. This position is a good candidate for a straight 10% stop-loss level (buy-stop in this case) on my sale price. If my thesis is correct, more intense bond selling is right around the corner with robust and upgraded economic/inflation numbers reported by the government.  
Real estate holdings, **REITs**, oil/energy conglomerates, and utilities as income alternatives seem to **have better odds of maintaining their purchasing power years down the road.** However, these investments may also suffer losses in a stock market debacle, before rebounding.”  
Note 10 (holy shit):  
**""I can think of just two events that could prevent a bond market implosion the rest of 2021. Scenario #1: the FED talks the big New York City banks into intentionally crashing the stock market first, thus relieving the building consumer confidence, spending and inflationary pressures. Scenario #2: variants of the coronavirus unaffected by current vaccination formulas make a big comeback in April-May, forcing new economic disruptions, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, like those appearing in Europe this weekend.** So yes, we may be stuck with a number of rotten realities to choose from right now.  
**If you pair short sales in weaker securities like bonds against relatively undervalued names continuing to witness strong buying, your portfolio can rise in value even if the wheels fall off our financial markets.** That's how I am positioned.”

Also, why do banks get overnight repo reversals? We have to wait a full day to a week for accounts to clear before we move cash, but the day AMC and GME shot up the fed had half a trillion overnight fed reversals (from banks) to not have to pay fines for holding too much cash, ya sure “only” the apes made money last week.

Last paragraph was speculation at the time, now I know that even Tuesday they had 433 billion in repos also, short term rates are dropping and banks are having a hard time finding buyers for loans and the reverse repos keep those short term rates higher by kicking treasuries to banks."

It looks like a solid book, and I did just buy it, mostly because I need to brush up on my economic history, and this looks like a great starting point.

That being said, I don't think you will find any real trading ""magic"" in there.

Here's a summary of it, somewhat, and if you look at Bridgewater's holdings, they basically just buy obvious large caps and call it a day... COST, WMT, MCD, JNJ, PG.

SPY beat them by 4% last year, for what it's worth, so again, not a magic recipe.

Sure, it may work once in a blue moon, but I'd rather wait, and just buy as much of the dip as I can, if it comes. I think selling my assets and moving to cash right now however would be idiotic."

2021-05-30 19:47:07,wallstreetbets,The reverse repo facility pays zero interest and it's used by money market funds that don't have any other options (as the t-Bill market supply has shrunk in the last few months).

2021-05-30 19:15:28,wallstreetbets,"I've read up on it a lot, and none of it makes any damn sense to me.

I mean, the get the issue with too much money, and not enough treasuries.

But, like you said, the actual effect on the market is basically anyone's guess.

I feel like it could tank at any moment, because it's basically just held together by duct tape, and is highly unstable and manipulated.  

But by the same token, it could absolutely moon again over the next six months, and that would totally make sense too, considering there is all of this extra money being printed, and it absolutely has to go somewhere, I guess it'll go into stocks.

People keep acting like inflation tanks markets... it doesn't.  Raising interest rates tanks markets, and we are a ways off from that still.

I'm still cautiously bullish, though I do think the next couple months will be shaky."
2021-05-30 19:11:44,wallstreetbets,"So the banks are overflowing with cash, so much so they cannot find people to pay for loans from them. All the while food pantries are needing help and labor cannot make enough to survive on, so fucking dystopian."

2021-05-30 18:01:05,wallstreetbets,"People are willing to pay 10k for a feature that isnt fully functional because they have been convinced that FSD could cost as much as 50-100k in the future. Idk its their money, did you buy a tesla do you feel cheated?"
2021-05-30 17:59:55,wallstreetbets,"From my point of view they sell a feature that is not available on the day of purchase. People dont have to buy the FSD option tesla doesnt make you pay for it, because youre right its not going to work out of the box. Those darned regulations."
2021-05-30 19:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Volatility was super low last week yet it remained flat, something is brewing for sure."
2021-05-30 19:56:45,wallstreetbets,"To me reading those articles looks more like reading pre-2008 articles of how the house of cards was about to fall because such much was held together by shadow securities that were actually junk.  We have all these monetary systems that governments are built upon that rely on gamerfied gambling.

And it isn't anything to do with capitalism, it is just a shadow world no one sees but affects everything, it is the boogieman."
2021-05-30 19:52:03,wallstreetbets,"hey man, i never said i agreed with it. lol. also, this is a result of the 2008 crisis. banks were forced to/willingly increase their lending standards so people couldnt speculate on things like homes. but yes, i agree it is dystopian that we have *too much* money that never goes to where it needs to. but that is the nature of capitalism. why do you think stores burn their excess clothes or throw away their excess food? to maintain an artificial value"
2021-05-30 19:41:55,wallstreetbets,"I have long-term warrants (5 year option calls basically, my ""safe"" holdings) then about $40k in short-term puts, mostly based on max pain data for the next 60 days,  that makes it seem like things will drop a bit.

But whatever money I make from the puts, unless interest rates are unexpectedly raised, which I almost guarantee won't happen in 2021, I'm putting it all right back into calls by end of summer.

Basically, I expect a massive bear trap over the next ten weeks.  People will think it's March 2020 all over again and will short heavily after things drop 10% or so, but then it'll shift right back to bullish and maybe even go substantially higher."
2021-05-30 17:49:05,wallstreetbets,$3 calls. Imagine how beautiful those gains would look if AMC smells even $100 lol. Sir! Congratulations and fuck you!!!!
2021-05-30 16:28:17,wallstreetbets,Bought June 18 call one morning after reading AMC release discussing possible bankruptcy.  Jan 21 calls I got last August. First option I ever purchased. These will be exercised so l can leave them in my will to my great great grandson.

2021-05-30 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Worked out nicely but never forget, buy low, sell high, or regret it later. I don't know if it will ever reach $35 again but if it does take your money and run. And if you really like AMC buy it back when it craters again.

Also sort of strange to pay 2/3 of a share for leap option, you're not getting the benefit of much leverage and would lose out on distributions for example. And still have downside risk of ending up out of the money. Just something to keep in mind next go around."
2021-05-30 16:19:01,wallstreetbets,Nice

2021-05-30 16:20:35,wallstreetbets,i need explanation on how this works to be great like this
2021-05-30 18:17:15,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I google options, puts, calls, naked call, etc… and I’m still unclear of what I’m looking at. You bought options at 23.18 and 23.12. That you aren’t obligated to sell. You bought them in anticipation that the stock price will rise?"
2021-05-30 17:52:03,wallstreetbets,"I also have XXXX shares, I bought a little with every paycheck this year 🦍"
2021-05-30 16:53:12,wallstreetbets,"You read it was going bankrupt, so you bought calls ? That was the plan ?"
2021-05-30 16:36:04,wallstreetbets,Why exercise? AMC probably won’t exist when your great great grand son is ready for his first lambo.
2021-05-30 18:46:28,wallstreetbets,I have already taken large profit. I have no plans to sell more.
2021-05-30 17:15:09,wallstreetbets,Not a win till you sell
2021-05-30 16:50:30,wallstreetbets,"You pay a fee to buy the option of purchasing stock at a certain price. For example, you could buy a $10 call option that expires next week (there are no indefinite options) for the cost of $15 (made up number here) meaning your break even price for you to make $0 would be when the stock reaches $25 like it currently is. Buying the $10 call option means you buy the option to purchase the stock at it's previous price of $10, but not the actual stock. You would choose to not buy the stock if the price never got above $25 (the break even number previously mentioned) and you would absolutely choose to buy the stock if the cost went above $25. The risk is that buying the option for $15 means you initially lose that money with 0 return. The opposite of this is called a put option where you bet that the cost is going to go down, and ultimately is why short sellers are having a bad time right now."
2021-05-30 16:28:04,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-30 18:28:12,wallstreetbets,"He bought 1 call with $3 strike for $108 

Second he bought 3 for $666 total.

He has great returns and should sell but will hold until they expire worthless since the shares will fall to zero when they file bankruptcy in a year"
2021-05-30 18:44:11,wallstreetbets,"But theoretically, if you wanted to use the calls and not sell them, how many stocks will you be able to purchase with those calls for that price? (just curious to how it works)."
2021-05-30 16:55:53,wallstreetbets,"I bought MORE calls after reading possible bankruptcy. I know America will never abandon the movies as a part of our culture under any circumstances. AMC will never go bankrupt, Americans love the movies too much to let that happen. COVID is temporary. Our passion for films is forever."
2021-05-30 16:38:14,wallstreetbets,They will
2021-05-30 19:00:58,wallstreetbets,As long as you're taking profit to cover the initial investment nothing wrong with letting it ride.
2021-05-30 16:54:56,wallstreetbets,wouldnt the opposite be the short call?  this is why you just tell them to google it instead of expmlaining itt
2021-05-30 16:32:19,wallstreetbets,Sure have OP lose all his gains.
2021-05-30 18:33:31,wallstreetbets,"So the strike price is the minimum in this case? And he wants to sell above the strike price. Versus, a put option that you want to buy below the strike price? Sorry for being a fucking retard. I’ve just been reading so much on this shit that it gets confusing."
2021-05-30 19:15:33,wallstreetbets,1 option contract = 100 shares
2021-05-30 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,It’s an amazing play. It’s the definition of buy when other are fearful. Amazing play. Too bad you didn’t buy a couple hundred calls. Well done !
2021-05-30 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,Such flawed logic that I’m glad it worked out for you. Maybe check in on some balance sheets and economic trends next time
2021-05-30 18:25:03,wallstreetbets,"You realize there is more than one theater chain, right? Some that make more money. Like cinemark 

Lol

Good luck with that bankrupt company. The seller thanks you for taking that crappy shares off their hands."
2021-05-30 17:17:05,wallstreetbets,"I did, they are a little skewed from Covid if you haven’t noticed. Delayed blockbuster releases and pent up demand- they will have their best years in decades in the next 2 years. Look at the performances of big films- the numbers are there."
2021-05-30 18:28:29,wallstreetbets,"I’d buy cinemark too if I could. 
🤣
But AMC has an army of 🍆🦍"
2021-05-30 17:20:01,wallstreetbets,"The numbers for theater attendance and ticket sales have been materially declining for many many years. What are you talking about? 

You’re investing in horses bc you just saw a model T drive by"
2021-05-30 17:27:32,wallstreetbets,"There is a cap. You can only show so many movies in a day, even if demand booms past pre-Covid levels and just because Americans won’t abandon the movies doesn’t make the antiquated business model viable or them bulletproof to bankruptcy but, hey it worked out for you so, congrats"
2021-05-30 17:28:02,wallstreetbets,😂 Their are a limited number of affordable public activities available. Movies have continued to gain in popularity and set record box office numbers year after year. When going out in public becomes normal again- folks will attend the movies and pay for the nostalgia. Movies ain’t goin nowhere- we need a reason to leave the house from time to time. Some movies just aren’t the same at home. Those are the movies that do $1b in ticket sales.
2021-05-30 17:32:09,wallstreetbets,Disagree that the business model is antiquated.
2021-05-30 18:04:10,wallstreetbets,You’re sadly misreading the data to fit your hypothesis. Best of luck with that
2021-05-30 17:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Well, if I choose not to buy their concessions, I’m pretty sure I’m a loss for them as ~60% of gross ticket sales go to the studios. So my $20 popcorn and soda beg to differ. If studios keep around the “straight to streaming” or a hybrid model post-Covid there is no way they aren’t fucked imo. Which is likely as the big studios are increasingly owned by someone who also streams and they need to keep their subscriber count inflated. But we can agree to disagree, time will tell"
2021-05-30 18:01:19,wallstreetbets,"You don’t get popcorn at the movies? That’s weird bro. 
Made for TV movies have been around forever- not the same experience or even in the same category."
2021-05-30 18:13:51,wallstreetbets,"No I definitely do but, that’s sorta my point. That’s the business model, the tix are loss or break even leaders, all they got is concessions, that’s it, in most theaters. I see in the not too distant future most theaters to be the bougie variety with recliners, waiters, bars on-site, 4D experience, reservations, etc. People will go to see Blockbusters but, the movies that don’t require that large screen experience peeps gonna watch from home. Big screen TVs are much cheaper now so, it also depends on how you rolling @ home too"
2021-05-30 18:18:26,wallstreetbets,I see the Disney premium access model becoming the norm. Giving the consumer the choice which is bad for theaters
2021-05-30 18:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, AMC has already upgraded all of their facilities to meet that type of demand. That money was spent over the past few years. They are in a great position to provide that type of experience. Disney is an experienced based company as well- they understand it better than anybody. AMC and Disney will be great partners for many years to come. Even if you have a baller setup at home- you will still go to the movies, especially if you are an enthusiast."

Next day installed RH and stayed about 80 percent true to my word. Still put 2 grand into AMC and 750 into GME. Bought at the top and am already down 500 total on both stocks.

Obviously you might be long on a stock and stick with it, but if you bought for reasons that don’t exist anymore or the information has changed your value equation, selling can be super smart."

2021-05-30 16:22:58,wallstreetbets,Variants might be around for short term but cruises will pick up for long term investments. Just don't bet on them for the next 6 months but hopefully will be a good investment for 2-3 years

2021-05-30 15:27:17,wallstreetbets,I've bought some shares in them with a view to long term. 2-3 years I'd expect them to do well but not expecting any short term returns

2021-05-30 14:06:58,wallstreetbets,Lost 25k in a week on an extremely stupid yolo call. Saw my portfolio hit under $100 for the first time since I opened my account. It was brutal. I was depressed for three whole days. Now thinking about going all in with the same yolo call just 4 weeks out. 🦍
2021-05-30 13:26:16,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, half of that 30k donation goes to Bezos ex- wife and her boyfriend…

2021-05-30 13:55:57,wallstreetbets,"OP that put spread has 500$ max risk how do you manage to lose 30k in a single trade? 

Theta gang preaches wider spreads so you can get better breakevens and roll easier if the position goes against you."
2021-05-30 17:40:25,wallstreetbets,"yea hanging on to losses and not rolling my positions cost me a lot its the hardest thing to learn. 

Stop hoping for a miracle"
2021-05-30 16:52:47,wallstreetbets,why so risky? you should be scalping like selling the 3000/2900 pcs instead going for the home run

2021-05-30 18:20:30,wallstreetbets,Small exponential gains and compound interest bro. I't easier to go for a bunch of easy layups instead of the half court shoot. You only need to get 15 5% gains to more than double your money.
2021-05-30 14:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Hey, good job bro! 🥳"
2021-05-30 15:57:08,wallstreetbets,"you can only ""be the casino"" if you can weather out some losses. also theta people dont fuck with spreads because they are a one time bet just like puts and calls."

2021-05-30 17:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Your portfolio went to $100, so how do you have enough money to do a similar YOLO? Or was that loss not realized?"
2021-05-30 14:46:32,wallstreetbets,He evidently bought a fuck ton of spreads.
2021-05-30 16:15:10,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe you lost your entire life savings. 🤣 Actually I can. That's fuckin hilarious. I think I would be a complete wreck if I did that.

Your only option now is to YOLO on margin to get your money back."

I'm just going for monthly spreads, 2 months out or longer. Boring, but if it works, it works."

2021-05-30 17:27:53,wallstreetbets,Making a spread takes self control and op probably should just buy and hold stock because he can't manage risk.

Industry consolidation and race to the bottom, also IMO traditional US car brands are just bad. Ford & GM are lemons; all the better brands have been bought out and degraded, like Shelby, Cadillac, Corvette, etc. 

Ferrari, BMW, and other luxury brands know how to make a moat; excellent product, excellent service, and no race to the bottom."

2021-05-30 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,"I don't dispute that claim. In the United States, industry consolidation that started with the Great Depression would culminate in the demise of independent Automakers in the 1960s; including startup efforts like the Delorean and Tucker, one could reasonably say that it took nearly 30 years for the auto industry to consolidate.  


We could likely see the same timeline for EVs, perhaps with more ending diversity as countries try to maintain independence in EV technology and supply chain proficiency."

2021-05-30 15:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Wire becomes a resistor when enough current flows through it. At those voltages before being stepped down at a transformer again, that's a lot of current. Resistance builds up heat. Heat builds up to autoignition of jacket which catches fire. Insulation burns and hopefully melts the cable to open the circuit, more likely it'll hit the transformer and blow it up and open the circuit thereby cutting power.

Though the transformation station up the line should really have circuit breakers to prevent too much mayhem."
2021-05-30 16:19:14,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess at one point that wire was crimped making a thin spot in the insulation, and when you are dealing with voltages up in the thousands that have power plants pushing them those crimps are a time bomb.  And once it arcs over it makes a carbon path that lights and burns much like a fuse would as it follows the current back to source as it burns the wire's insulation up."

2021-05-30 16:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Ah, but it's not the circuit breaker overcurrent rating that will stop it, it's the short circuit withstand rating of the fuse that stops a runaway short circuit.  This is why breakers for power circuits have 2 ratings, one is for overcurrent like ""100A"" in the event the end device starts pulling to much current over a period of time. The other rating (SCCR) is how much it can withstand In the event a short circuit happens and will not be damaged, which happens in just a few cycles of AC current.  This is also known as an arc flash if it explodes by vaporizing copper which expands for one cubic inch to 60,000 cubic inches in the blink of an eye if the fault current is large enough.  SCCR ratings usually start at 10,000 kaic at a given voltage.   2 different animals."
2021-05-30 16:07:58,wallstreetbets,Very good explanation. The reason why these lines have very high voltages is because of power losses. It requires step-down transformers (MV or KV to 120V) for normal household appliances.

2021-05-30 16:24:19,wallstreetbets,Dam you smart!
2021-05-30 17:09:26,wallstreetbets,"Fuses and breakers are the same principle just different operations. I don't know about substations but I assume their shit is just upsized for obvious reasons. A bus bar under a certain load vaporizers at X amount of current and opens the circuit. A breaker is magnetized or thermally activated and pulls the contacts away at Y amount of current. The faster the quicker it opens. I'm assuming substations probably have larger breakers with some semiconductor type logic due to the large loads and areas it serves. Again, IDK. 

As far as controlling arc flashes I'd guess the best way is for the conductor to vaporize and widen the gap. Beats me you sound like you're more familiar"
2021-05-30 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,Do what now?
2021-05-30 17:19:43,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what shorted the phases together. Could be anything. The end result is the same. Seemingly unlimited current flows from one to the other until shit blows up. Hopefully the fuses or the lines themselves before it hits other areas.

2021-05-30 17:46:00,wallstreetbets,"As the insulation burns off the contact area between phases bcomes greater, a bigger short pulling more current.  It just keeps growing"

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD Lithium Of Americas (NYSE: LAC) Hello fellow apes,

A lot has happened in the lithium world in the past few months. I am going to try to summarize why I’m bullish on Lithium of Americas (NYSE: LAC) [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/). There are a lot of positive points, but also risky ones; but scared money does not make money. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgqwspm8y9271.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a104a27f190c94809a0d17944d064ff49e86e4d

Lithium of Americas is a junior company that is currently developing “two world-class lithium projects”:

\- **Thacker Pass Project in Nevada** (100% owned)

It is the largest known lithium deposit in the United States with probable reserves of 3,1Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent. [https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) 

\- **Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina** (49% owned)

LAC is currently developing this project jointly with Ganfeng Lithium and the site contains and estimated amount of 3.6Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent. [https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/cauchari-olaroz-lithium-project/](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/cauchari-olaroz-lithium-project/) 

Both sites have an estimated lifespan of about 40 years.

For information, the stock went from $2.14 at the start of the pandemic to $28.75 in January 2021 and is currently sitting at $15.30.

&#x200B;

[Nice \\""cup and handle\\"" graph](https://preview.redd.it/o019vofiy9271.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9fa9e56c6a43c5539efe4be4fd338affde53c31)

As you know, due to environmental concerns, EV are starting to weight more and more in the eye of the consumers (hello Nio and Tesla stocks in 2020). Thus, some countries and states are announcing the end of petrol and diesel cars. For example:

\- **UK** will ban petrol and diesel cars by 2030. [https://thedriven.io/2020/09/22/uk-to-accelerate-ban-on-petrol-and-diesel-vehicle-sales-to-2030/](https://thedriven.io/2020/09/22/uk-to-accelerate-ban-on-petrol-and-diesel-vehicle-sales-to-2030/) 

\- **Norway** will ban petrol and diesel cars by 2030. [https://www.fleeteurope.com/fr/safety//article/norway-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2025?a=FJA05&t%5B0%5D=Tesla&t%5B1%5D=CO2&t%5B2%5D=Fuel&curl=1#:\~:text=From%202025%2C%20it%20will%20be,agreement%20on%20this%20radical%20measure](https://www.fleeteurope.com/fr/safety/article/norway-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2025?a=FJA05&t%5B0%5D=Tesla&t%5B1%5D=CO2&t%5B2%5D=Fuel&curl=1#:~:text=From%202025%2C%20it%20will%20be,agreement%20on%20this%20radical%20measure). 

I will not list every country that is aiming at banning fossil fuel cars from their roads; the list would be too long. But as you can see, more and more are willing to reach this goal.

Furthermore, more and more historic car makers are starting to look in this direction, competing with newcomers. For example:

\- **Hyundai** is aiming at reducing its production of petrol and diesel cars by 50% and only sell EV by 2040. [https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/05/29/hyundai-reduces-production-of-petrol-diesel-cars-by-50-aims-to-sell-10-lakh-electric-cars/](https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/05/29/hyundai-reduces-production-of-petrol-diesel-cars-by-50-aims-to-sell-10-lakh-electric-cars/) 

\- **Ford** is anticipating that EV (in general) will represent 40% of vehicles by 2030 and the company will invest 30 billion in the next 4 years in this segment. [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/investing/ford-electric-vehicle-investment/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/investing/ford-electric-vehicle-investment/index.html) 

All of these points have a common denominator: batteries. EV currently need lithium (among other things) for the battery (about 10kg/22 pounds each). [https://www.barrons.com/articles/new-risk-tesla-other-electric-vehicle-makers-lithium-supply-batteries-51601498472](https://www.barrons.com/articles/new-risk-tesla-other-electric-vehicle-makers-lithium-supply-batteries-51601498472).

Furthermore, vehicles sales are estimated to reach 117 million units worldwide. I know it’s a quick and maybe too easy solution, but it can give an estimate: if we combine this with the estimation of Ford (40% EV in 2030), EV will represent 47 million vehicles, thus 470’000t of lithium will be required. In 2019. Worldwide lithium production in 2019 amounted to 77’000Mt ([https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf)); production will need to be multiplied by 6 to reach the desired amount to build enough batteries for EV.

I am betting the increased demand for lithium will drive the price higher than it ever was. The latter is slowly recovering and gradually increasing ([https://www.fastmarkets.com/commodities/industrial-minerals/lithium-price-spotlight](https://www.fastmarkets.com/commodities/industrial-minerals/lithium-price-spotlight)).

https://preview.redd.it/ok9mjmvyx9271.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d131d2f9fda983f372361158ae8431f2c6015c0

Unlike Piedmont Lithium who already signed a contract with Tesla, LAC has not. If the lithium price continues to increase, the longer they wait, the higher their asking price will be and the higher their revenue will be.

Costs of extractions are estimated to be <$4’000/t at their future facilities in Nevada and Argentina and the lithium carbonate price is currently sitting at about $12’000/t. If the price continues to increase, we can clearly see that their profits will skyrockets… ([https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)).

Furthermore, LAC received in January 2021 from the Bureau of Land Management the **approval** of the Thacker Pass Lithium Mine ([https://eplanning.blm.gov/public\_projects/1503166/200352542/20033308/250039507/Thacker\_Pass\_Project\_ROD\_signed\_2021-01-15.pdf](https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/1503166/200352542/20033308/250039507/Thacker_Pass_Project_ROD_signed_2021-01-15.pdf))
A few more autorisations are expected to be delivered late summer (water, air quality,...) 

Joe Biden is also defending its **$174 billion** proposal to support the transition to electric vehicles. [https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/president-biden-174-billion-electric-cars-1234604827/](https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/president-biden-174-billion-electric-cars-1234604827/) 

Now, unto the risks:

As soon as LAC received the approval, some people filed a lawsuit ([https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bartell\_BLM\_COMPLAINT.pdf](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bartell_BLM_COMPLAINT.pdf)) against the Bureau of Land Management, alleging that environmental impacts (on groundwater for example) were downplayed.

Two administration officials told Reuter a few days ago that “Biden will rely on ally countries to supply the bulk of metals needed to build electric vehicles and focus on processing them domestically into battery parts” ([https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/)). This could be a threat to US miners, but LAC already received the approval (the project is still on hold due to the lawsuit).

In my mind, the positive outweighs the negative, but it’s still a risky investment and I believe in LAC.

Feel free to add anything that I might have missed.

Positions: 

1’300 shares at 11$

And 1’825 shares of another future Lithium producer in Europe (but can’t say the ticker here)."

An other pro could be rising inflation, this Will help all commodities, especially if they don't deteriorate.

However there is a fuckton of reaserch going into finding alternativet types of batteries. Litium-batteries are still the best we have but a lot of smart people have massive funding for developing alternatives. If that is successful, all of this is moot."

2021-05-30 15:57:50,wallstreetbets,f'em and their Nevada project...which hopefully WON'T happen.

2021-05-30 12:30:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm also hard for lithium. I see your LAC and raise you  GALXF. Here's what some professional analysts (can't say who without getting smacked apparently) say about GALXF. 

""The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 71.22% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $4.65 and $6.04 at the end of this 3-month period.""

OROCF is also looking promising, though I'm not privy to the potential draw-backs for this company. OROCF is expected to rise 51.99% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $7.29 and $9.39 at the end of this 3-month period.

I own small stakes in both aforementioned companies. I'll be adding to my positions in the near future.

2021-05-30 18:03:18,wallstreetbets,Copper is safer long term. Every single electric motor uses copper windings. Copper wires. Aluminum is substituted here and there but not in critical operations. Copper is king for conductors at good supply and decent prices. Expect the former to shrink and latter to grow as more and more motors are made.
2021-05-30 13:04:17,wallstreetbets,"I agree. In the short term lithium is probably quite secure. But OPs post made arguments streching to 2030, thats quite a bit more then short term."
2021-05-30 13:07:08,wallstreetbets,"I agree. A lot of battery research is focused on getting away from cobalt, not litium. I just mentioned that point because it was just a thought i wanted to add to the discussion. There is a risk in regards to lithium investments over the longer term. That can be said about a lot of stuff but few has as much funding as research for new forms of storing energy."

2021-05-30 10:37:39,wallstreetbets,Nah NOK bout to pop forsure fam
2021-05-30 12:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, go time."
2021-05-30 13:15:19,wallstreetbets,Oh my bad I can’t read that’s why I bought 300 NOK CALLS
2021-05-30 11:25:45,wallstreetbets,U big mad or little mad? 🤣🤣
2021-05-30 12:02:51,wallstreetbets,BANG gang. That’s why
2021-05-30 11:27:40,wallstreetbets,Why not though?
2021-05-30 14:37:55,wallstreetbets,They will be in the money. He has lot of time.
2021-05-30 10:45:12,wallstreetbets,Bro NOK to the LITERAL MOON
2021-05-30 11:33:56,wallstreetbets,How it called on wallstreet? SNDL/AMC/GNUS?
2021-05-30 14:37:12,wallstreetbets,That was the wrong time to buy. Total euphoria
2021-05-30 10:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Well I haven't touched calls ever, so I know nothing about thar"

2021-05-30 15:24:40,wallstreetbets,"i wish i bought in at 3.98 when i had the chance.  you're right,  lots of shares.  also NOK has contracts to supply internet service around the moon.  literally going to the moon though. /shrug"
2021-05-30 18:54:05,wallstreetbets,"5.5 is commonly referred to as Cinco De Mayo. Your wife and her boyfriend probably celebrated it without you. 👫🦍 wife, wife’s boyfriend, you."
2021-05-30 12:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I guess. I think that was the point where I hope NOK sees 7 dollars and your calls are worth 40 cents. You can embrace being a retard, you don't have to get defensive."
2021-05-30 10:38:39,wallstreetbets,But AMC and GME is popping now
2021-05-30 12:03:24,wallstreetbets,BANG gang represent!

2021-05-30 13:17:22,wallstreetbets,Lol fair enough
2021-05-30 11:30:40,wallstreetbets,I enjoy NOK and what you are trying to do. Massive upside with these penny calls. But putting a time limit on an investment as valuable as NOK? Hitting 2x in 2 months when it hasn't been that high in decades. Buy shares not calls. I'm broke and don't like to waste money is all. I hope these are worth .40 cents for you someday. Keep me posted
2021-05-30 11:27:12,wallstreetbets,Big mad. He’s a strictly GME or you should be banned probably.
2021-05-30 11:32:18,wallstreetbets,Answering a question with a question is wack.

2021-05-30 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,That's right he was in NOK lol
2021-05-30 18:57:31,wallstreetbets,That makes no sense in the context of the call annotation. A $9c on 5.5 for Oct?
2021-05-30 12:05:56,wallstreetbets,U just mad cause you don’t have $3k to drop on NOK calls.
2021-05-30 12:05:30,wallstreetbets,If Nokia hits $7 they’d be worth $4 at minimal. 🤣
2021-05-30 10:39:21,wallstreetbets,Ya and you can buy all 3 haha even some BB
2021-05-30 13:47:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Will do. 🙏🏽
2021-05-30 11:33:00,wallstreetbets,Lol you realize that the stock doesn’t even have to go up and I can make money right? You should learn how options work. It doesn’t have to hit my $9 call lol.
2021-05-30 11:28:48,wallstreetbets,U type like u on drugz maybe u should be banned haha.
2021-05-30 17:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Wait till the peak, and then buy calls."
2021-05-30 19:35:15,wallstreetbets,"I had it the wrong way around, I have 9 calls at 5.5 strike price for October"
2021-05-30 12:19:52,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-30 14:22:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-30 12:06:20,wallstreetbets,That's just not true
2021-05-30 13:25:21,wallstreetbets,"This is my plan for Tuesday. Going to try to buy the initial dips (if any) of BB, AMC, NOK, (Not GME) and ARRY.(Last one is more of a long term buy)"
2021-05-30 10:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I sold everything and move all into AMC, check out my post"
2021-05-30 17:51:31,wallstreetbets,That’s just it. Buy calls by doing what exactly? Dm me please
2021-05-30 14:23:28,wallstreetbets,Go off king

2021-05-30 10:43:53,wallstreetbets,U wild I hope u bought a while ago
2021-05-30 12:23:26,wallstreetbets,I'm not trying to argue here. NoK is a long play IMO. I do hope these print for you. But knowing they won't see 9 dollars you are just going to sell them to the next sorry sap here that buys into this hype
2021-05-30 10:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Yup, February"
2021-05-30 12:24:06,wallstreetbets,Bruh u realize the price of NOK could go down and the option can make money right?
2021-05-30 12:25:24,wallstreetbets,"Anyways, the volume on NOK recently is insane, the call options are being bought insanely. If amc continues to squuze and the market stays good. NOK 100% will pop. Idk what to tell you."
2021-05-30 12:26:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s fine if you disagree, you should buy some put options on NOK"
2021-05-30 10:44:49,wallstreetbets,Nice!!!
2021-05-30 15:57:59,wallstreetbets,Whaaaaaaaa? Are you serious?
2021-05-30 16:58:49,wallstreetbets,"IV spikes do weird things, but they don't last long. Happened to people with puts on AMC last week for a few hours on Friday. Still, even if they did print, someone will be picking up that bag and it doesn't mean it's a good buy, just that he got lucky."
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nj7tco/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)

Overall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford’s F150 lightning. 

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.

**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** 

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)

No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company’s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.

**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO’s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.

**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.

**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don’t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.

SOME FAQ’s:

**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

2021-05-30 10:46:05,wallstreetbets,So in other words 100 11$ Jun 4 BB calls next week will get me lambo ?
2021-05-30 13:07:34,wallstreetbets,"Huge sentiment in BB, guess that’s what I’m buying more of on Tuesday."
2021-05-30 16:23:44,wallstreetbets,"BB Jan 2022 $5C is cheap. ~2x leverage with some safe margin. Oops, this is not r/options. So BB $20C Jun 18 then."
2021-05-30 15:42:31,wallstreetbets,"7,000 BB shares and counting. I’m willing to buy another 7,000 if i have to."

2021-05-30 17:32:24,wallstreetbets,Buying more GME. Thanks for the input!
2021-05-30 11:48:24,wallstreetbets,Memestocks move together. They'll all have a good run this week on the back of AMC
2021-05-30 11:34:22,wallstreetbets,SPCE next week +50$
2021-05-30 19:07:57,wallstreetbets,Ngl BB not only good for short term but I want to hold this company till 2023. I think it’s only starting. As EV gains more momentum BB shall follow
2021-05-30 19:00:56,wallstreetbets,BB to ATH of $140; holding 💎💎and buying 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-30 10:28:46,wallstreetbets,"In regards to $SNDL, that looks like it’s about to go to $1.24 on Tuesday and $2 after the CEO speaks later in the week on the 4th of June."
2021-05-30 14:52:01,wallstreetbets,In summary: AMC 🚀 🌝 on Tuesday....
2021-05-30 13:41:44,wallstreetbets,"how can I get your program? I think its great, do u have telegram?"
2021-05-30 14:07:46,wallstreetbets,I can't wait to see this info on cnbc
2021-05-30 17:18:31,wallstreetbets,Keep this going every week.
2021-05-30 18:07:22,wallstreetbets,So options call for bb. Jun.11.2021 @ $11 ? Is it solid?
2021-05-30 12:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Mentions don't cause market moves, they are a result of them"
2021-05-30 13:22:25,wallstreetbets,Doing Gods work here
2021-05-30 17:54:11,wallstreetbets,I will wait for a pullback at the open on Tuesday and enter on trend formation. I agree with your assessment on BB vs AMC and GME
2021-05-30 12:58:09,wallstreetbets,This is awesome!
2021-05-30 14:44:43,wallstreetbets,This is great
2021-05-30 17:32:33,wallstreetbets,Can you tell me next weeks top 10???
2021-05-30 12:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't it be easy for bots, or even just normal users to spam the stock they like, to artificially inflate numbers, giving the perception that a stock was really popular, when in fact nobody was talking about it."
2021-05-30 11:38:14,wallstreetbets,"This seems to be a bit of a confirmation bias setup.

What are the big gaining stocks that had *modest but targeted* mentions prior to their runup? What about DD posts of significant length that preceded a stock runup?"
2021-05-30 12:31:13,wallstreetbets,How many different-same people are making these?
2021-05-30 10:34:36,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-30 16:33:53,wallstreetbets,Market closed on Monday?? I'm from Australia.. the times are confusing me.
2021-05-30 17:30:29,wallstreetbets,"u/nobjos You thinking of monetizing this? Or keeping it open source? I would love to take a look at the source code if that's possible. I totally understand if you want to keep it to yourself, I am only asking because I just recently started to learn how to code, and one of the very first projects I tried to do is exactly this. A tracking software of mentions + sentiment. But my sentiment wasn't working, and I had a hard time with twitter api's (Again, fairly new to this), so would love to look at the code to learn from it. But I totally get it if you want to keep this to yourself."
2021-05-30 18:25:36,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-05-30 18:28:03,wallstreetbets,You forgot UWMC and CL OV. Seen quite a bit of attention on those two lately.
2021-05-30 15:09:10,wallstreetbets,Where is TTCF on the list. No love.
2021-05-30 18:32:52,wallstreetbets,All options on the table for me.  AMC and all its friends
2021-05-30 11:40:21,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-30 12:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

TLDR BUY BB SHARES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Position: 25k at 10$"
2021-05-30 19:40:36,wallstreetbets,15 don’t be a bitch

2021-05-30 16:50:23,wallstreetbets,Don’t underestimate the power of WSB. This thing can literally shoot to the moon
2021-05-30 17:17:21,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I've got 30 at 56.

2021-05-30 18:01:27,wallstreetbets,This is the way 💯
2021-05-30 19:40:29,wallstreetbets,no both but amc is riskier bb is safer
2021-05-30 12:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this model is not a predictor of success but rather a hindsight summarizer, which are a dime a dozen."

2021-05-30 12:36:48,wallstreetbets,Stop bullshitting. One quick look at the guy's post history shows that this is the same guy who was doing it previously.
2021-05-30 17:26:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's Memorial Day in the US."
2021-05-30 17:23:06,wallstreetbets,Yep.  It's a holiday in the states on Monday.
2021-05-30 17:19:18,wallstreetbets,No market Monday

2021-05-30 13:30:52,wallstreetbets,Wait wait wait isn’t this gamblers fallacy in a nutshell??
2021-05-30 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,BB and NOK are the same boat. Old telecom companies with nothing to offer.
2021-05-30 18:01:50,wallstreetbets,💯💯
2021-05-30 12:38:25,wallstreetbets,Damn. I didn’t go full on detective just passing by and noticed someone else was posting same information. I don’t know who fucking copyrighted it lol
2021-05-30 15:25:41,wallstreetbets,The number only goes up over time!

2021-05-30 13:09:11,wallstreetbets,"You don't gotta be an investigator to take a glance at the dude's post history lol.

They've both been doing their own things. This guy does writeups while the other posts time-animations of mention comparisons."
2021-05-30 19:46:08,wallstreetbets,They are both meme stocks and moves proportionally together. You don't need any software just old fashioned wsb retards to comment a few rocket emojis and it's good to go
2021-05-30 13:10:20,wallstreetbets,My apologies I didn’t realize it was so touchy then.
2021-05-30 13:21:00,wallstreetbets,"My bad. The way thar your question was worded it kind of sounded like you were accusing him of something, and we've already had enough conspiracies/pitchfork mobs based on misunderstandings for a lifetime"
2021-05-30 16:12:49,wallstreetbets,Ok mr wsb president
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Opinions on Martin Shkreli ? Hey everyone, I've heard about Martin Shkreli years ago with the drug pricing thing like everyone. I recently came across his old finance educational youtube videos and learnt he's actually sort of a legend here. I mean it is really cool that he spent all that time teaching random people investing stuff, but he's in jail today and partially because of a tweet or something?

I know it's probably biased to ask here but I'm curious about the guy and hearing from the source"
2021-05-30 09:32:02,wallstreetbets,I think he might have overpaid for that Wu Tang album
2021-05-30 09:39:09,wallstreetbets,"He used to be a mod here. He was a fun troll who did livestreams, uploaded DDs on youtube and interacted with WSB. People here mostly adored him and he knew how to defend himself in debates quite well. He's intelligent and articulate, had a lot of youtube vids similar to those ""ben shapiro facts and logic etc"" vids.

WSB is completely different than it was back then, this was over 4 years ago I think."
2021-05-30 12:42:34,wallstreetbets,Ya his finance videos are surprisingly informative and is generally how you should analyze a business. If only he followed his own advice instead of gambling clients' money on penny stocks in that short-lived investment fund he ran.

Oh how the times have changed"
2021-05-30 09:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Martin Shkreli seems like a generally terrible person who has done a ton of sketchy shit in the Pharma world which was deemed to be morally outrageous but not illegal. Turns out fucking over poorer HIV patients isn’t something that gets you more than an afternoon of grandstanding by Congress.

He’s in jail because A) he fucked with rich peoples money and B) he was an easy sacrificial lamb to use as a scapegoat for drug price gouging while Eli Lilly and Pfizer do way worse on any random Tuesday. He isn’t part of the old money club and didn’t have the good sense to keep his mouth shut."

2021-05-30 18:28:11,wallstreetbets,He basically what happens if you give a 4chan troll too much money and exposure. Pissed off enough people that they decided it was worth while to dig into his finances and they found enough dirt to get him convicted because he is an unlikable enough guy that the average jury is gonna convict him for basically anything.

2021-05-30 09:33:31,wallstreetbets,He's an asshole who got thrown under the bus as he only did what other hf and pe did.  It's like the 2008 crisis.  Only a couple of people went to jail to appear that that they were punishing people.
2021-05-30 10:45:06,wallstreetbets,"he did (as a single person) exactly what big pharma does every day, so he is not any type of uncommon evil

the difference is that he bragged about it on the internet constantly and was very straightforward about what he was doing, which made him an EASY target for people who need to appeal to moral crusaders

he wasn't the right target, but he made it so damn easy to vilify him because he just wore his shittiness on his sleeve instead of obscuring it like pharmaceutical corporations do

but just to reiterate what he did is done frequently, it is not new or a plan of his evil genius... he's just a run of the mill scumbag who doesn't care if you know"
2021-05-30 10:44:57,wallstreetbets,He mostly reminds me of DFV's retarded and criminal cousin... So he should fit well in here when he comes out of the joint
2021-05-30 12:44:12,wallstreetbets,He is where my investing learning journey started many years ago with those videos you mentioned. I am eternally grateful for that. While he has some chars flaws I would like to believe that he is not all bad. I personally like him imo. Unpopular opinion clearly.

In September 2015, Shkreli was widely criticized when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 (from US$13.50 to $750 per pill). In 2017, Shkreli was charged and convicted in federal court on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud, unrelated to the Daraprim controversy.[3] He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and up to $7.4 million in fines.

It probably had less than a 100k subs and the people that were on here were quite knowledgable. It was a group of experienced investors and traders discussing risky plays. Shkreli was a perfect fit for this structure and his DD on pharma was well-writen and the results showed.

/R/wallstreetsbets is also called ""4chan with a bloomberg terminal"" for a reason. People here were absolute degenerates and basically only had one common goal: make as much money as fast as possible. It wasn't about the little guy vs the hedge funds like it is now.

What he did with Daraprim wasn’t right morally  by 99% of people’s standards. But don’t be blind to the fact that what he did with 1 drug is a drop in the bucket to what big pharma does on a daily basis with literally thousands of products. And to top it off he did it with such a rarely used drug. This shit happens daily with much more commonly prescribed maintenance drugs. To some extent he actually was a sacrificial lamb. I don’t support what he did and I won’t defend it because it wasn’t right, but yes, he absolutely was thrown on the chopping block while this shit still continues on a much much larger scale EVERY.

2021-05-30 10:24:34,wallstreetbets,"I mean... Shkreli exploited a regulatory system failure in generic drug manufacturing to price gouge HIV patients. Saying that’s what every business does is a pretty damning indictment of capitalism, if true (it’s not true, don’t worry). People were right to call him out for how egregious the things he did were, it’s just that in large part he made himself an easy scapegoat for a system-wide failure to regulate drug prices. If he hadn’t been such an ostentatious dickhead about it all he probably could have flown under the radar, but he chose maximum crotchgrab as his response strategy. C’est la vie."

In some countries the products/drugs are offered at prices you wouldn’t even think about because you can easily afford it. Yet, it is unaffordable to those living in these systems/countries but no one takes notice nor gives a fuck about. But as soon as the same is happening in your/our own countries/societies we scream for morality and justification and want those guys hanged. 

There are folks dying in parts of Africas, Asia and South Americas because the drugs are either not available/offered (too small market, not enough margin) or it is too expensive for part of the population yet it costs only a few bucks in our western countries. 

So, in this sense, all Shkreli did is to bring the same principles, values and business models we live by to our doorsteps mate. 

If you can’t/couldn’t afford Shkrelis drugs after the price increase, that’s clearly your individual problem because some of us could and can still afford it. Simple as that."

Same for luxury goods and any products for that matter. 

The only problem was (and still is) the hypocrisy of them mainly western societies to think bad about the system they’ve invented, perverted, used and abused and about individuals like Shkreli it has taught and brought up.

Martin Shkreli Sentenced to Seven Years’ Imprisonment for Multi-Million Dollar Fraud Scheme

Shkreli, a Former Hedge Fund Manager and CEO of a Biopharmaceutical Company, Defrauded Investors and Engaged in Stock Fraud Scheme Involving Publicly Traded Retrophin Inc.

Earlier today, in federal court in Brooklyn, Martin Shkreli was sentenced by United States District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto of the Eastern District of New York to seven years’ imprisonment for committing securities fraud and securities fraud conspiracy, to be followed by three years’ supervised release.  The Court also ordered Shkreli to pay a $75,000 fine and $7.3 million in forfeiture.  Earlier this week, the Court signed a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture, which will allow the government to seize substitute assets to satisfy the forfeiture judgment if necessary, including $5 million held in an account that had been used to secure Shkreli’s bail, the “Once Upon A Time in Shaolin” album by the Wu Tang Clan, the “Tha Carter V” album by Lil Wayne, and a Picasso painting. 

Shkreli was the founder and managing member of hedge funds MSMB Capital Management LP (MSMB Capital) and MSMB Healthcare Management LP (MSMB Healthcare) and the former Chief Executive Officer of Retrophin Inc. (Retrophin), a biopharmaceutical company that trades under the ticker symbol RTRX.  He was convicted by a federal jury in August 2017, following a six-week trial, of two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy.  In September 2017, the Court found that Shkreli had violated his bail conditions by making online threats against former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and remanded him into custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is currently incarcerated.

Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the sentence.

“For years, Shkreli told lie after lie in order to steal his investors’ money, manipulate the stock market and enrich himself,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue.  “He will now pay the price for repeatedly violating the trust placed in him by his investors, his employees and the public.  It remains a priority of this Office, together with our law enforcement partners, to identify, investigate and bring to justice criminals like Shkreli.”  Mr. Donoghue thanked the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Regional Office (SEC), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., Criminal Prosecution Assistance Group (FINRA CPAG), for their significant cooperation and assistance in this case.

“Martin Shkreli was notoriously ambitious, seeking to enrich himself at the expense of those who unwittingly invested in his lies,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. “His crimes have been laid bare for all to see, and his intentions, which have been proven true beyond a reasonable doubt, resulted in this sentencing today. While we can now close this chapter of our investigation, our efforts continue to uncover and expose all crimes of this nature that claim innocent victims and defraud our financial markets.”

The evidence at trial established that Shkreli, who was convicted on three counts of the superseding indictment, alleging securities fraud (Counts Three and Six) and securities fraud conspiracy (Count Eight), executed three schemes to defraud investors: 

As charged in Count Three, between 2009 and 2014, Shkreli used false representations and omissions to induce investors to invest more than $3 million in MSMB Capital, a hedge fund he founded in 2009.  Subsequently, following trading losses, Shkreli sent fabricated performance updates to investors, boasting that the fund had made big profits when, in fact, it had sustained substantial losses.  In addition, Shkreli withdrew more than $200,000 from MSMB Capital, far more than the one percent management fee and the 20 percent net profit incentive allocation permitted by the fund’s partnership agreement. 

As charged in Count Six, between 2011 and 2014, Shkreli used false representations and omissions to induce investors to invest more than $5 million in MSMB Healthcare, a hedge fund founded by Shkreli after the implosion of MSMB Capital.  Additionally, Shkreli used MSMB Healthcare assets to pay obligations that were not MSMB Healthcare’s responsibility.  As with the MSMB Capital scheme, Shkreli withdrew more from MSMB Healthcare than the one percent management fee and the 20 percent net profit incentive allocation permitted by the fund’s partnership agreement.

As charged in Count Eight, between 2012 and 2014, Shkreli and his co-defendant Evan Greebel, an attorney who served as outside counsel to Retrophin, engaged in a scheme to defraud investors and potential investors in Retrophin by attempting to illegally control the price and trading volume of Retrophin’s stock.  Greebel and Shkreli executed this scheme by, among other things, concealing Shkreli’s beneficial ownership and control of the majority of Retrophin’s free-trading shares.  Greebel and Shkreli recruited associates of Shkreli to be nominee shareholders for the majority of Retrophin’s free-trading shares, and they also filed a false document with government regulators to hide the fact that Shkreli controlled those shares.  Greebel and Shkreli prevented the nominee shareholders from selling these shares, and also directed that some of the shares be used to settle liabilities owed by the MSMB hedge funds and Shkreli. 

In addition, Judge Matsumoto ruled in a decision issued on February 26, 2018 in connection with the sentencing, that the government had also proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Shkreli had engaged in a fourth fraud scheme, the wire fraud conspiracy charged in Count Seven of the superseding indictment.  Specifically, the evidence at trial established by a preponderance that between 2011 and 2014, Shkreli conspired with Greebel and others in a scheme to misappropriate Retrophin’s assets in order to pay off defrauded investors in MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare.  As part of this scheme, Shkreli and Greebel caused Retrophin to enter into so-called “settlement” agreements with certain defrauded MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare investors, which caused Retrophin to reimburse those investors more than $2 million in cash and stock for their lost investments in Shkreli’s hedge funds even though Retrophin was not responsible for those losses.  Shkreli and Greebel also arranged for certain other defrauded investors to enter into sham consulting agreements with Retrophin as a means to settle liabilities owed by Shkreli and the hedge funds.  In total, the settlement and sham consulting agreements caused losses to Retrophin of over $10 million."

2021-05-30 14:40:02,wallstreetbets,"AMC Bull Thesis

    1.    Hyped / Trending Worldwide
    2.    Movement to Stop Corrupt Hedge Fund Shorts (Buying & Holding Shares so Hedge Funds can’t cover their short positions)
    3.    Gamma Squeeze if too many call options expire in the money
    4.    Short Squeeze imminent if buyers continue to hold shares. It’s a time bomb ⏱
    5.    Hedges lost 2 billion $ this past week so far
    6.    June 2nd - Share Count Exposing Synthetic Shares (I would buy in by June 1st)
    7.    Hedge Funds Shorting More than Stocks Exists and they’re doing it with borrowed money (90m+)
    8.    60 Trillion $ in Insurance Backed by DTCC (More than entire market value)
    9.    Dusaniwsky has developed a Short Squeeze score and ranks AMC’s metric a 10 out of 10 for a short squeeze.
    10.    Following GameStop short squeeze patterns
    11.    More focus than GameStop, not multiple meme stocks trending
    12.    People saw a successful squeeze with GameStop, more people trust the theory now
    13.    If the stock goes high enough, hedge funds will get margin called and forced to sell. The more stocks that sell, the higher the stock goes, the more margin calls, etc, etc
    14.    Hedge funds fought hard last Friday trying to short even more, and barely moved the stock
    15.    AMC CEO in favor of the movement and the squeeze
    16.    Up over 100% in a week and the squeeze hasn’t even started yet
    17.    Price prediction $50 - $500,000
    18.    Jim Cramer (Mad Money) is now a believer that the hedge funds can be defeated 
    19.    17% Short Interest Free Float
    20.    Volume trading at all time highs 
    21.    Also, movie theaters are opening again, so that has to help a little. But not a huge factor."

I noticed something very both crucial and dangerous the fight between the Short Sellers and the Reddit Army (we) are divided to so many parts. I mean we pick more than one stock at a time to invest. In this case, we decrease our strong strength and buying power to minimum. If we all focus only on one stock at a time, then we are definitely win the fight against the Wallsreet/Short Sellers. Otherwise, they can easily take over and bet us all very badly. 

As a matter of fact, currently we are talking/invisting about Stocks such as AMC, GME, BB, BYND and NOK and more. In fact, you can clearly see that we are broken to pieces. So, we should all take this risk under serious considerations."

2021-05-30 15:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Basically the Hedge Funds used a glitch in the financial system to create fake shares and sell them to unsuspecting buyers. They then shorted the stock to bankrupt the company which would have resulted in them never having to pay back the shorted fake stocks. The plan failed when somebody caught them, told the world and a bunch of retail apes bought all of the stock preventing the company from going out of business. Now the hedge funds have to “buy back” all of the short shares that they made up, but nobody is selling! Now the HFs are screwed because there are not enough fake or real shares available to buy back to settle their accounts!  I think!
That about covers it!  Not financial advice! Cheers!"

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why are banks lending so much to the FED through the Reverse Repo? In a Reverse Repo, from the FED point of view, the FED lends a Bond to an institution and get cash back, usually overnight.

As you can see [here](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000), On May 28th, 479B were lent to the FED at 0% and the number has been only increasing in the past months (data [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD)). What it the point of lending at 0%? Couldn't bank just keep the cash, having the same result? What is the reason that for a bank is preferrable have a Bond overnight instead of cash? Thanks in advance"
2021-05-30 08:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Money in a banks balance  sheet is counted as a liability since they have to pay interest on them. By swapping to overnight repos they get rid of the cash and can loan treasuries which they then lend out to hedgefunds , who uses them as collateral for margin requirements. The margin gets a quick look about 1-2 pm every trading day, and at that point they have the treasuries in place for collateral. 

Later in the day they return the treasuries to the banks which later sells them back to the fed. The kicker here is that the fed always counts these treasuries in their balance sheets.

This is a big topic that can be read about for days and days. But almost every day the amount of treasuries sold to banks increase, that means someone are in dire need for collateral to satisfy their margin  requirements. Read what you want out of it."
2021-05-30 08:30:54,wallstreetbets,"Deposited cash is a liability, not an asset to the bank - as at some point will need to pay it back to the depositor.  They need that liquidity for day to day operations, so the overnight rrp is the perfect temporary solution as it guises some of those liabilities as assets (purchased bonds), balancing for the day.

The part that should be alarming is why they have these excess liabilities:  too much qe?  Retail expecting a crash and moving away from equities and into money markets?  De-valued bank assets like commercial & residential mortgages exacerbating all the above?"
2021-05-30 06:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Banks mostly aren't lending via ON RRP, it's money market funds. Extra reserves sloshing around via QE (many channels, I won't get into detail here) are pushing cash investors into money market funds which are pushing short rates down to negative territory (another one called SOFR not offered by the Fed), so the safe option to park cash with no penalties is via the Fed through ON RRP."
2021-05-30 06:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Reverse repo is used as an investment of last resort for very conservative funds. It allows the Fed set an interest rate floor.

2021-05-30 08:06:25,wallstreetbets,SLR was not extended. So banks have a limit to how many Treasuries and cash they can hold on to. So this reverse repo we have seen in the past weeks is a bypass of the SLR penalty because the treasuries are short term lended to the FED. The FED doesn't want banks to dump all these treasuries in the market. That would jump yield rates and interest rates as well triggering a liquidity crisis. Now the real question is; what will the banks do with an insane surplus of treasuries? They will create a new instrument with solid ratings to sell as a package in the secondary market. Does that ring a bell? You are witnessing the CDO creation from 2008.

2021-05-30 06:51:57,wallstreetbets,">why do you mention ""penalties""?

Fees (which have been waived recently but will definitely rise back up) and negative rates.

>Are MMF forced to invest somewhere ALL the cash they have

Even if they hold onto the cash, they have to deposit it at a bank (notes and currencies are a no go). Banks have been turning away deposits from funds and other wholesale entities due to the SLR relief ending (effectively increasing capital requirements for banks to hold against their total liabilities/assets), so if banks charge the MMFs negative rates, they go to repo. If the repo market charges them negative rates, they go to the Fed for ON RRP.

There are also prime funds that offer commercial papers and multiple-bank deposits etc but that's less secure than your vanilla Tsy MMFs.

Think of ON RRP as a way to temporarily hoover some of the excess reserves out of the system.

&#x200B;

>Also do you have any source that explains what how MMF work?

Google is your best friend here. There are several types and they're all fairly easy to understand."
2021-05-30 06:48:47,wallstreetbets,"https://fed.tips/sico4-1/

According to this, banks want to shed the cash. But the MMFs cash is in a bank’s checking account. And in order to shed the cash for their balance sheet the banks incentivize the MMFs via fees to get rid of it."

2021-05-30 11:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Yea probably, I work at Wells Fargo though and we got a message on our intranet that the hard date is the end of the year. With any running contracts at that time running till 2023. 

Then there will only be the SOFR type repo."
2021-05-30 14:38:16,wallstreetbets,Who knew flooding the market with money simply by printing (or adding zeros) could possibly devalue the money? No way this can be predicted as it's neva been dun befo
2021-05-30 17:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Hang on for the ride. Ain't nobody make it out alive, fewer still after the next crash"
2021-05-30 17:20:05,wallstreetbets,"It's this so much. That crash was brutal for people closer to retirement. Those old farts that panic sold at the bottom then got to see a bunch of retards on Reddit make millions, and they just still can't come to terms with wtf happened"
2021-05-30 08:44:32,wallstreetbets,"One last question (which maybe is going to be extremely stupid, just trying to wrap my mind around all these concepts): if MMF would deposit their cash at a bank, the bank would need to increase their reserves by the FED and therefore gaining 0.10% (IORR) on these reserves. Given the 2-year yield is currently 0.14%, wouldn't it be a not-to-bad investment?"
2021-05-30 16:37:47,wallstreetbets,So it’s whirly bout to avoid the SLR.  Why even have the SLR then?
2021-05-30 12:47:16,wallstreetbets,Wasn't it bigly bad when the MMF rates went negative for a short time in the financial crisis?

2021-05-30 16:18:03,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s not that cynical. It’s a way to regulate short term supply to maintain equilibrium. It isn’t a grand malicious conspiracy. It’s just a complicated cog in the wheel of regulating the price of money, day to day. The price of money is sort of complicated in itself as a thought. Now extrapolate that to a national economy, things look weird."
2021-05-30 17:13:13,wallstreetbets,"It’s only similar in the fact that this would be a composite asset, and the similarity stops there. CDO’s we’re impacted by end borrower credit risk, AND an inflated housing market, so were literally radioactive.

A U.S. treasury backed CDO would only go tits up if the federal government did. It’s tremendously different than a CDO in this regard."
2021-05-30 06:45:14,wallstreetbets,"He's saying if you're not gonna answer OP's question, why comment?"
2021-05-30 06:46:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m saying you don’t know, what the post is asking. The point is not to get 0% because It is better than -2%. Not so basic economics."
2021-05-30 06:46:31,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-30 06:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Just lost 1 of my many billions in the German markets. I for one, like many of us very wealthy individuals here, am freaking out daily! Crazy the whole country doesn’t feel this way!"
2021-05-30 08:13:02,wallstreetbets,Because bank is charging you interest now when you have account with them above certain amount. In Denmark it's 10k euro. Imagine having more than 10k euro on your account and bank is charging you interest on it.
2021-05-30 08:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Reserves count as assets for banks. This lowers their capital ratio with the same amount of capital now having to back more assets/liabilities (deposits from these MMFs). This is a problem for the big GSIBs which have higher required ratios since they also have to absorb more reserves via continued QE.

Remember, bank lending/operation/margin (basically everything a bank cares about) is constrained not by the reserves (fractional reserve banking/money multiplier theory has been dead for decades) but by capital requirements and lending opportunities/deposit optimisation. Banks need to comply with these way before caring about earning IOER."
2021-05-30 14:30:49,wallstreetbets,"I think you're thinking of breaking the buck, which happened because some (prime) MMFs held commercial papers by Lehman and they couldn't pay back, so these MMFs had a NAV of less than 1, which rendered them insolvent and caused runs on them. Yes that was very bad so some regs have been put in in order to minimise the risk of that happening again. Also why prime MMFs trade cheaper to gov MMFs, there is a *confirmed* credit risk."
2021-05-30 08:46:00,wallstreetbets,"Apologies for my snarky end comment. However, you still haven’t shown how it’s wrong."
2021-05-30 06:46:58,wallstreetbets,"It answer one of his questions: why lend at 0%?

Answer: because it's better than -2%"
2021-05-30 06:48:48,wallstreetbets,It's percentages you fucking clown... -2% on a million euros or a million dollars is -2% wtf is wrong with education where your from ?
2021-05-30 08:31:26,wallstreetbets,Yes it's a sound policy if your encouraging active investments instead of dead money in bank accounts. Again nothing new or to freak out about.
2021-05-30 17:06:24,wallstreetbets,Till IOER goes negative....interesting thought experiment.
2021-05-30 15:12:15,wallstreetbets,Excellent reply! Thanks for the clarification on the difference
2021-05-30 09:11:13,wallstreetbets,"#yeah, I use bold font because of my big peepee handicap"
2021-05-30 06:52:02,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-30 14:47:43,wallstreetbets,"They aren’t lending. They are forking it over (temporarily) as directed by FOMC. Again, you’re lost. This is part of daily rate regulation, not a seeking of 0 over -whatever interest rates. It’s not as simple as you need it to be."
2021-05-30 06:53:31,wallstreetbets,"It is, it's just has a risk that they'll never pay you hence why the 50%. Stop writing your only showing your an uneducated moron"
2021-05-30 15:10:20,wallstreetbets,10 hrs later still deleting you old stupid comments to write more are you ? Lol
2021-05-30 15:43:47,wallstreetbets,"Not so lucky I’m afraid.  I am still here simply explaining the same. I understand you’re upset you look ignorant on the issue. But now you know there is something deeper going on. You can research and learn if you choose, or be bitter, lash out…etc. But, I recommend the former. I’m not sure you are making much ground lashing out."
2021-05-30 15:45:10,wallstreetbets,Lol

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB | Shorts won on Friday 28th May - next week bulls got a new chance! | 12$ resistance as Make or Break borderline! 🍇 Chart update for $BB 🍇

Last friday we saw a first attempt to start a new uptrend. The first price target (12$) was reached in less than 24 hours. Subsequently the price got heavily rejected at the resistance level of 12$, forming a bearish candle.

The volume on Friday was much higher than the average. The short sellers tried to push the share price down below the resistance at 12$ in order to avoid a further surge. I assume they are really  scared to see the price above that level because chartwise that means a bullish trend reversal.

Next week Blackberry needs to break the resistance around 12$. Beyond 12$ there is almost no resistance besides the ATH. Furthermore the short interest rose during the consolidation since February. The percentage of float shorted is around 9% now (5/14/2021) which provides additional fuel for a squeeze. That means we could see a fast acceleration of the new uptrend.

&#x200B;

If the share price of $BB falls below the support at 8.5$ the bullish scenario is **not valid** anymore.

**Price targets:**

\#1 12$ ✅ 28th May

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

\#4 🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-30 04:05:41,wallstreetbets,Woo hoo BB Babeeboo!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-30 12:24:56,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.
4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

TLDR BUY BB SHARES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-30 10:02:23,wallstreetbets,"What happened Friday was more likely traders cashing in their options at the open and causing dealers to unwind their positions which lead to the initial drop then if you follow this guys horizontal line you'll see that a bunch of people who were holding bags for months finally went green and probably sold out which is likely indicated by the higher volume. Who knows what will happen next week, its four days so probably consolidation. BB hasnt really been behaving like the others (which is good imo), no catalysts like GME strategy change or AMC reopening play."

I wonder if BB should just spin off its new tech into a new company and let BB keep any legacy stuff.

2021-05-30 13:28:03,wallstreetbets,I agree with you it will likely trade side ways. Also I believe that it may seem an uptick around the week of June 8th and June 23 rd a couple days after the finra short exchange receipt dates. Would recommend taking a look at the 21 trading ftd cycle GME and AMC are currently experiencing there is some DD scattered around regarding this.
2021-05-30 12:39:09,wallstreetbets,"I also think that a lot of amc money drove the push to 12.09 (high of the day). If you lined up the minute candles starting from 930 am amc spiked and started falling. Smart traders got out with profit and searched for the next move. Drove up calls massively with an IV spike. Because IV hit 300 percent. Then people took there profits and collapsed it all. People got trapped in AMC and BB Friday. 

You seem very experienced, I am not still learning. But I did write this to help newbs. I’m afraid some people who just use Robinhood saw the green dildos and just chased. When there were warning signs not to Friday.

Can it happen? sure,  but you either have to be smart or just lucky. Panic and greed are your worst enemies. I've been trading for 20 years and have worked for some major money houses. When you're young you tend to have much less patience. When you're older, wiser & smarter you wait it out & then sometimes the money rolls in."

2021-05-30 03:56:18,wallstreetbets,Of course - that's part of the market fluctuation. There are always buyers and sellers. Especially at a heavy support/resistance a certain price action will be observed.
2021-05-30 10:50:41,wallstreetbets,I've heard on good authority that stocks don't actually go down tho
2021-05-30 04:16:11,wallstreetbets,"More than a bunch I would assume :). Well, as I trade chances with a nice risk/reward. I assume a better chance of seeing a new uptrend from here. My risk is limited as my stop is below the support"

2021-05-30 19:18:17,wallstreetbets,I have a question. If you sold at the high for 251 bucks using 6/18 12c as an example. The stock at the time was selling for 12.09. At the end of the day the option was down to 64. So  again of 187. But the stock closed at 10.07. So if you closed out the deal you would be down like 15 bucks. I know time is your friend but I’m wondering what the experienced call seller does here. Close it and hope for a spike to resell the option next week? Ride it out? Thanks.

Than the stock itself has a pattern of up and down that’s very consistent. The only time the pattern changed was during COVID and last years riots/shootings which caused the stock to sky rocket.

With all that being said off of the data it should be back going down to mid 60s range. 

The stock market is so unpredictable these days tho it makes no senses sometimes… smh 😩"

3-year Return: 197.48%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 43.82%
2. **Crosslink Capital - Seymour Kaufman**  
3-year Return: 186.27%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 41.99%
3. **Sequoia Capital Global Equities (SCGE) Management - Jeff Wang**  
3-year Return: 171.53%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 39.51%

Alex Sacerdote is clearly leading the pack; what's even more impressive is that he manages $12 billion dollars, while Kaufman manages $551 million and Wang manages $8.9B. In fact, out of the Top 20 Performing hedge funds, Sacerdote comes in only second to Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who has the most assets under management (AUM) of $18 billion.

Whale Rock has a 3-year return of 197.48% as of 3/31/21, and an annualized weighted 3-year return of 43.82%

He has trimmed TSLA, SHOP, PTON, PINS, and CRWD, and has loaded up on AMZN, GOOGL, and FB. No, this isn’t the end of growth stocks, and I am certainly holding on to mine. However, it may be safe to allocate some capital into proven, cash-generating companies. Stay safe everyone!

Let me introduce to you a highly oversold stock that will rebound greatly in the near future. Ive included plenty of pictures for you fellow degenerates.

&#x200B;

NRG Energy is in the business of producing, selling, and delivering electricity to over 3.6 million residential, industrial, and commercial consumers by means of natural gas, coal, oil, solar, nuclear and battery storage.

$NRG has been on the decline since taking an estimated loss of 750 million due to the Texas winter storm. It is currently sitting at a -23% discount at $32.15 a share. The RSI is currently at 28.9 indicating its been oversold. After a rough 2021 beginning NRG's earnings are projected to be be back on track after the anomaly that was storm Uri.

&#x200B;

[STRONG BUY](https://preview.redd.it/47ks25o736271.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b43fabc8b015b62d2ab6274f44d827906d53f5f)

As you can see above the average price consensus is currently at $44.6 a share and has maintained  BUY rating since may 2020. I believe the bottom is here and so do many other investors. As you can see below there has been an influx in volume of calls this past Thursday and Friday betting on an increase in price in the short term.

&#x200B;

[Smart money betting on upward movement.](https://preview.redd.it/e8ivlgb676271.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b8ec33d7dc7711fd8d79046299f7500e8e8e075)

&#x200B;

Now lets get to the only part you care about... the positions. Anything a few months out or longer will be a good approach. I will be picking up some further out exp. on Tuesday along with my more aggressive short dated calls. This shitty DD is not financial advice. Don't overlook this opportunity while chasing the next hottest meme to baghold.

2021-05-30 13:12:34,wallstreetbets,I cant tell you it will or wont until it happens but i believe its unlikely to touch the companies responsible for generating electricity. Majority of lawsuits thus far are against Ercot and companies responsible for distributing power. There have been companies filing lawsuits against pipeline operators for not being able to supply natural gas to generation stations during the Texas storm.
2021-05-30 13:56:40,wallstreetbets,It would be concerning if they weren’t such a cold hard cash generating machine. End of 2020 they had 700+mill in free cash.

2021-05-30 04:34:41,wallstreetbets,Oh yes! Excuse me. Friday had a lot of unusual volume towards closing. Wednesday and Thursday option chain volume was more bullish than Friday’s. For every buyer theres a seller. Has to be someone on the other side losing their ass selling calls at the bid. Ill take the risk buying what i believe is the bottom.

2021-05-30 03:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Just looking at your screen shot. Compare the sold vs bought calls,...it is 47:27, in fidelity reds are sold & Greens are bought calls/puts. Check the price executed at the bid. That is a short position. Interestingly almost all of it came in at the last minute of trade. If these are covered call some one is unloading shares, or they are betting the stock won’t go higher than 34-35. Looked at TA aswell not so hot."

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is no one talking about BBBY? I know everyone is all about AMC and GME right now and by all means I have nothing but love for the Apes putting up the fight. I paper handed my AMC shares literally right before this last jump like an idiot. I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME.

According to Yahoo Finance as of 5/14/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is:

GME - 29.34%
AMC - 21.13%
BBBY - 64.38%

BBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play.

Unfortunately, the analysts don’t have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5/28/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4/21/2021. I suspect Morningstar will come out with an updated report in the near future. CFRA rates it as a sell with a target price of $16 in a report published on 5/29/2021. Seems pretty conservative given that the stock hasn’t been at that level since September of last year. Maybe they have some short interest 🤷‍♂️.

Before I YOLO a large percentage of my portfolio into some call options, I wanted to get your thoughts/opinions on the stock to see if I’m missing something."

2021-05-30 06:45:25,wallstreetbets,... didn't BBBY already have a short squeeze like in January/February? It was one of the reopening plays. It was right in the middle of GME's first squeeze. Vaguely remember it too.
2021-05-30 09:25:11,wallstreetbets,I’d assume to give smart money a chance to get in before it goes to the moon next week.
2021-05-30 15:21:05,wallstreetbets,"I have been thinking about BBBY as a recovery play. Also, because it has a lot of short interest.If the consumer discretionary or staples markets turn around in the next few weeks companies like BBBY or BYND could start to go up in price even if a bunch of reddit traders don't pile in. If some of them do it could be even better.I know people are attached to AMC and GME but I wonder if they should consider the possibility that retail traders sell every chance they get when the price goes up and AMC and GME might not have much room to grow.Stocks like BBBY and BYND are trading at reasonable prices and could be more entry level squeeze positions at current prices. Also general market conditions in the next couple months may be more favorable to BBBY and BYND.For the record I went all in on BYND with my speculative account, my fun money.  I'm considering putting a small amount in BBBY. I do think Jim Cramer recommending BYND on Mad Money could be a big advantage because it will attract people that would never get involved in this kind of trading strategy."

2021-05-29 21:41:36,wallstreetbets,I didn’t realize he had said anything. That’s good to know.
2021-05-29 21:45:00,wallstreetbets,"And just recently. He said something like “if WSB is look for a squeeze, go after BBBY”. There were a few other stocks too that were not meme stocks."

2021-05-30 01:39:10,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer wants to make you money
2021-05-30 01:45:54,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer wants to make money.
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Buy SPX or XSP options, not SPY I've seen a lot of posts with YOLOs on SPY calls and puts, some people holding 100s of contracts. If you're going to buy enough SPY calls, just buy SPX, and even if you're buying 1, just buy XSP. Should you somehow manage to pull gains, you get 60/40 long/short term capital gains, rather than 100% short term capital gains.

If you are a millionaire/hold 1000+ shares of SPY to sell covered calls, you could mimic a similar position in SPX, selling weeklies at the nicer tax rates as well. Even if you can't afford deep ITM SPX options, you can mimic a similar SPY position with deep ITM XSP options.

Not only this, but you are getting fucked by market makers if you buy SPY calls. You'll notice that the premium is quite a bit higher when compared against XSP.

TL;DR: If you wanted to YOLO on 0DTE options, just do it on indexes. If you win, you won't be getting fucked by the tax man as hard as you otherwise would be.

Edit to add: Make sure you don't get fucked with an AM settlement though. Monthly contracts expire AM on Fridays, so keep that in mind if you do go buying."
2021-05-29 21:06:31,wallstreetbets,"Also they are cash settled and European style which makes them a lot simpler to deal with, particularly the short legs (no early assignment risk and no pin risk)

One thing to keep in mind is that if you are holding across a year boundary, they are marked to market on the last day of the tax year and taxed accordingly.  This could possibly result in you being taxed on some phantom gains and not being able to claim that money back until the following year.  So if you have huge gains on open contracts at the end of the year you may want to realize them since you are paying tax on them either way."
2021-05-29 21:01:45,wallstreetbets,Ehhh liquidity and bid ask is fantastic on SPY. Great advice for intermediate to advanced traders (degenerates)
2021-05-29 21:53:47,wallstreetbets,"everyone here has short-term losses to write off against numbnuts, so why do we care?"
2021-05-30 19:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Not relevant if trading in a Roth IRA. I choose SPY because of the significantly higher Volume, Open Interest and tighter Spreads."
2021-05-29 21:25:14,wallstreetbets,only reason people trade with SPY is because of its liquidity. no dumbass holds SPY shares they buy VOO.
2021-05-29 21:32:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you.  Switched over to those exclusively, no more spy.  Taxes blow."
2021-05-30 03:10:06,wallstreetbets,There's also no possibility of being assigned with SPX since it's an index. Everything is being settled in cash at the end. So you don't even need to worry about closing your positions if you are doing well. Just let it expire and your broker will settle it for you. You'll be saving on transaction fees.

2021-05-30 13:04:51,wallstreetbets,How much less is the premium by ratio compared to SPY?
2021-05-29 21:05:48,wallstreetbets,"european style options are not as intrinsically valuable as American style options so it make sense SPX calls would be cheaper.

they are tax-advantaged but imo that does not make up for the difference."
2021-05-29 21:24:38,wallstreetbets,yeah telling people to be on SPXL or SPXS should be a great advice
2021-05-29 22:03:39,wallstreetbets,Why are SPX and XSP 60/40 and SPY 100 short term? Cuz the first two are indices?
2021-05-30 10:10:38,wallstreetbets,This is how my brain becomes wrinkly.
2021-05-29 20:53:25,wallstreetbets,Wow I actually have no idea what 80% of that mean’t.... Guess I should’ve expected learning the stock market to be hard
2021-05-30 04:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Tldr: Buying SPY instead of options  on SPY is always going to be good long term, if poor family XSP and SPX options are safer FDs

The current market however does make entry quite difficult to gauge when a ""good"" entry is as we're currently peaking repeatedly.

I don't think it's a bubble i think it's an effect of more people entering ~~the casino~~ the stock market in general.

There is a new user boom, the question really is for buying SPY is ""is it overvalued right now"" personally i don't believe so.

I think crypto money is withdrawing due to the bans and SEC investigations into crypto and going into blue chips and long fundamentals. More money in the market, higher SPY index."

2021-05-30 01:12:37,wallstreetbets,Or you use a roth IRA and pay 0% taxes on gains
2021-05-30 06:40:01,wallstreetbets,Every time ive bought 0dte options on SPX ive lost money even when it moved in my favor. Am still not sure why (maybe closing the gap of the bid/ask spread reducing its value?). Then again Id buy kinda far otm options

2021-05-29 22:45:37,wallstreetbets,I don't see spx or xps when I search in my brokerage
2021-05-29 21:12:55,wallstreetbets,"Definitely a safer bet for those idiotic enough to sell naked covered calls as well. I would never have the balls for it, but you're far safer selling a naked call on SPX than you are trying the same on SPY. Didn't know about the phantom gains issue, but most people in here probably aren't buying contracts farther than a few months out.

Overall, there's far more reasons to buy index options over ETF options. The only exception would be NDX options. The spread is horrendous."
2021-05-30 03:16:17,wallstreetbets,"WYH, they tax your unrealized gains? So if I hold a LEAP, I will get taxed? Is this only with SPX or in general for all options?"
2021-05-29 23:19:47,wallstreetbets,"Liquidity is such a key factor especially with multi-leg options. If I'm just opening a single leg option then I go for XSP. Otherwise, I go for SPY."
2021-05-29 21:05:29,wallstreetbets,"The bid/ask isn't bad on XSP either. You're talking $3 vs. $1, and when you add to that the fact that SPY premiums tend to be higher than XSP premiums, you probably come out with better value, especially the farther out you go. The bid/ask spread on SPX is about $20 for ATM options, which is equivalent to a $2 bid/ask on SPY considering the fact that SPX is 10x XSP/SPY. Generally, if you want a lot of contracts, SPX is the way to go, if you want a few, you're still better off in XSP over SPY."
2021-05-30 10:17:03,wallstreetbets,I'd rather be a degenerate than a paper handed broke bitch

Disclaimer: I just degen Spy options but would like to know why to not hold shares ?"
2021-05-30 14:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Well historical volatility on SPY is 11.896%, and IV last is 12.2%. Historical volatility on XSP is 10.559%, and IV last is 11.59%. Historical volatility on SPX is 10.564%, and IV last is 12.3%. As both SPX and XSP have been less volatile in the past, the premium paid is also less."
2021-05-29 21:17:01,wallstreetbets,"The fact that they're european settled makes no difference for the majority of investors. In fact, what you'll find is that in some cases, far out, deep ITM options will trade lower than the current price because of this fact, essentially allowing you to get in at a bargain, assuming you're in for the long run, and understand the risk that your option could expire worthless, should the market crash.

European settled just means you can't exercise before the contract expires, but there isn't a good reason to do this anyways as you lose time value."
2021-05-29 21:26:55,wallstreetbets,"What? I'm saying buy SPX/XSP. These are indexes, not bull/bear ETFs. In fact, calls on these actually perform pretty poorly because of their high IV."
2021-05-29 22:45:47,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-05-29 22:47:09,wallstreetbets,"I think it is becasue the first two are 'futures'.

If you trade futures (on any index, gold, oil, bonds ect) and you are considered a 'trader' then you get taxed 60/40.  The IRS definition of a 'trader' needs looking into.  Probably if you don't make a lot then technically you might not be considered a 'trader', but the IRS probably doesn't care.  Certainly if you make a decent proportion of your income from trading futures and trade them regularly, then you are considered a 'trader' can use the 60/40 rule.

I am not a financial advisor this is not advice on how to claim your taxes, but maybe some into to get you started in finding out.

2021-05-29 20:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Yoloing on 0DTE options is a retarded play, but this is the home of retards. At the end of the day, no matter what your timeline is, if you want to buy options on SPY, do it on XSP/SPX instead. You get far better tax treatment on your gains, assuming your option is being held for less than a year."
2021-05-29 21:07:18,wallstreetbets,XSP is 1/10 the size (same size as SPY)
2021-05-30 06:09:24,wallstreetbets,These aren't 3x ETFs you retard. They're indexes.
2021-05-30 09:37:16,wallstreetbets,"RH doesn't allow trading in SPX or XSP as it is single listed on the CBOE.

2021-05-30 01:29:54,wallstreetbets,look up voo vs spy. voo has way cheaper fees
2021-05-30 07:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Well one of the reasons would be management fees, but another would be that you can leverage yourself by buying deep ITM leaps. Buying $1000 calls on SPX/$100 calls on XSP essentially frees up $100k/10k. Of course, you run the risk that SPX closes below $1000/$100, but only a crash will do that, if even."
2021-05-29 21:49:40,wallstreetbets,optionality is the added value and it is significant. eurpoean style options are really much more like futures than they are like options imo.

2021-05-30 00:47:32,wallstreetbets,Same thing honestly....spy options are cheaper to trade. The only reason to trade spx will be due to tax reasons.
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Made another WSB sentiment analyzing bot (I used machine learning) -- 33% annual return ($16k). Source code and explanation below! So a few days ago someone made a sentiment analyzing bot for this sub and as a programmer myself, I thought I’d try my hand! For those of you that want to poke around or use this for yourself, 

&#x200B;

Edit: here’s my [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)

Edit: [Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com/) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y’all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can’t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys

&#x200B;

**HOW I DID THIS:** Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 6 other stocks -- I could do more but the relevance drops off typically after this. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive for a beginner/intermediate programmer, but essentially what it uses is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.

**HOW THIS WORKS:** The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.

In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The acting was good , but the movie could have been better” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.

**Results and some stats:** Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)

\- The strategy is backtested only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- Max drawdown of -8.7% (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)

Happy to answer any more questions about the process/results. I think doing stuff like this is pretty cool as someone with a foot in algo trading and traditional financial markets"

This is a big problem and probably why it’s impossible (for know) to reliably predict the stock market.  I understand using the tool as guidance and as a resource but additional thought is required.  From 2020 it’s was better to throw your money at SPY and you would have made way more profit.

I’m not meaning to trash about your project, as a programmer I think it’s a great idea.  But as a trader I would be careful :)"

2/ break the functions into smaller one-task methods, e.g. 1 method to get the data, 1 method to analyse it for the above reason of being able to swap out data source and analysis type

3/ well done!

4/ You don't actually scrape WSB to get the top stocks, instead you search for posts / comments of ones you decide to look for. There's a big difference!

2021-05-29 22:36:10,wallstreetbets,"same, I can't get it to run in an IDE or in python natively"
2021-05-30 08:24:40,wallstreetbets,I downloaded the “Python2IDE” app and ran the script
2021-05-29 21:23:56,wallstreetbets,lol make sure you erase the code that’s already on there for “hello world”. I ran mine and it says “Facebook”
2021-05-30 01:00:09,wallstreetbets,"This is my question.

Buying on sentiment makes sense, but what's the sell trigger or sell threshold based upon?"
2021-05-30 08:47:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming he adjusted daily (buy at/near open, sell at/near close), which would limit PDT folk under 25K and might not take into account commissions which rack up quite heavily if you're using a real broker and making 20 trades a day."
2021-05-30 09:37:28,wallstreetbets,And your wife knows how to run it
2021-05-30 12:11:18,wallstreetbets,tell her dont play with the python for too long because it may release a dangerous white toxin
2021-05-30 02:00:50,wallstreetbets,Did you install any required libraries in the code?
2021-05-29 23:06:52,wallstreetbets,"I haven't even opened the code. But you could try using Google Collab to run python scripts online. 
For every error you get, maybe try searching online. 

For missing pkgs it must just be done pip install consent, that you can get guidance on online sites like stackexchange.. but all of this is only if you still have interest to use or try that code"
2021-05-30 01:45:08,wallstreetbets,It’s so wild that this is possible now. Just scraping data and making bets. What a time to be alive. Wish I had the skill that the op has to build something like this.

Show me one outlet on MSM that reported GME being/continued being shorted  over 100%.

The false information is irrelevant and it's being disseminated on the behest of these ""billionaires"" who know the true picture before they tell their presstitutes what to write/say. Evaluate the dd and make your moves, ignore them, it's just theater and ass covering."

2021-05-30 18:14:50,wallstreetbets,you've got the right idea.
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"From March to Friday - Finally Back in March I threw everything I had into AMC after doing countless hours of research. I learned what options were, calls, puts, SI, CTB, everything.. like downloading skills from the matrix. I had never traded a stock in my life. 

I went in... with everything... and immediately got nuked. 

&#x200B;

[March](https://preview.redd.it/g8hxaunzb5271.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a5ac761f7a79576bd618f49b160cb3b80434ac)

I got really nervous.. but was convinced.. I was completely convinced I was right. I missed GME Round 1, and am going to take some earnings and finally get some GME on tuesday. I'm super stoked. To quote the big short ""I'm right. I might be early; but I'm right"".

&#x200B;

[Friday](https://preview.redd.it/2pdcxgj7c5271.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=8908a7dd2bc9382c154112ed238fa8ca3462d8df)

I sold my 5/21 calls for more shares.. and while this was still down from the high, things are finally looking up. This has been the longest 3 months of my entire life.

The crazy thing. This is still the pre-game. The main event is still yet to come. Except this time, I'll be in on GME and AMC. 

I know there has been a lot of hate towards AMC. GME was just too expensive for me to make any real traction.

I love me some gamestop. Can't wait till tuesday. Never lose the faith."
2021-05-30 12:39:01,wallstreetbets,"Bro if you don't take that 100k win and just play with the rest, you are insane. If this was truly 'all in' then this definitely would change your life. Just 2¢ from an older WSB member who has watched many people like you end up going from 150k to 2k and wanting to die. 🚀🙏🏼

God speed either way, autist. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-05-30 09:54:02,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you!! 🦍💎🤲🏼
2021-05-29 20:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Very cool, and I am sure this will be downvoted.....but have a fucking exit plan and don't baghold until you are red again because ""apes strong""

&#x200B;

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH TAKING PROFIT BECAUSE YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT AT SOME POINT

Spend it on something that matters, your mom, you wife's boyfriend, yourself. Profits are great but don't do anything for you if you don't cash out. Shit, donate to the gorilla fund again. Make your life what you want with the money you worked/gambled so hard for!"
2021-05-29 21:59:43,wallstreetbets,This is me with BB. The hype train is just starting. Already invested 500 on calls and 1000 on shares. Let’s hope it plays out as well haha
2021-05-29 21:16:08,wallstreetbets,"I got in February. Not just cause of all the talk about it, but figured with summer coming and covid restrictions lightening they could only go up so felt like low risk... And if high spikes as a meme stock worth the risk. 

Planned on holding throughout the summer unless big spikes up..Don't know yet if it's peaked yet. I'll be watching it this week and as long as no big spikes down I'll keep holding. Right now the gains would be kinda minimal due to taxes I'd have to pay. But willing to sell an under performer if I end up selling amc to offset the taxes a bit."

2021-05-30 15:58:20,wallstreetbets,Is it still a good time to buy AMC? I am planning to put $8k at $25.64 once the market opens again.
2021-05-30 19:42:22,wallstreetbets,"There is an article in Yahoo finance about amc. Where that meme stock has created millionaires. It has turned $20 investments into 500. And $15,000 investments in the $500,000 or more."
2021-05-29 22:19:48,wallstreetbets,"A percentage is a percentage regardless of the ticker.  If you thought GMeee was good and put 1K into it and it went up 75%  you'd have the same $1,750 as if you put that 1k into AMC and it went up 75%."
2021-05-29 20:53:26,wallstreetbets,"Smart move to cash out some when you're up big. Hopefully things go up Tuesday for you and not down at open, as those $40c could easily drop half in value at open if AMC tanks."
2021-05-29 20:26:27,wallstreetbets,">I threw everything I had into AMC after doing countless hours of research

you wouldn’t have bought if you actually had done countless hours of research."
2021-05-30 07:23:54,wallstreetbets,"Many of us sold their AMC stocks on friday and i can unterstand  it if you already invested in Dec/Jan, you made a lot of profit but we gotta stay strong together and hold!

2021-05-30 16:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Any one have leads on good sites/videos explaining all this stuff?

2021-05-30 17:30:12,wallstreetbets,"Anyone knows how to jump into the call system, is it an app on iOS where one can call for the stocks. 
How does it work? 

I use Robinhood, so I am not familiar as how the call system works! 

I’ll appreciate if it can be explained step wise. 
Thanks"

2021-05-30 01:11:18,wallstreetbets,My advice to you vl-chris... you made a very bad choice and got lucky on it and hit it big. Take your profits and invest it in a better way. Consult professionals this time and let it grow slowly and correctly. Some people on here really do know what they’re doing with this whole GME/AMC fiasco and more power to them. You can make a killing if you really know your stufff... unfortunately you’re no where close to knowing what you’re doing. If you continue you’ll lose it all. Please listen and take your profits out and invest it in something more safe

As to what? That's just going to depend on the charts. It's completely speculative at the moment. I plan to sell in tiny increments on the way up and the way down. Hopefully average somewhere near the top. It's all just going to depend on the market imo. Not setting any price targets."
2021-05-30 18:41:21,wallstreetbets,Smart advice.
2021-05-30 16:41:23,wallstreetbets,"The first time it was coordinated with GME, how many people ""HELD THE LINE""? What was the original amount of followers in this thread?

There are now over 10 million followers. This resource is not being used to its full advantage.

With a little coordination you would all drive the prices through the roof. 10 million strong. 

Whatever profits you're taking here is crap in comparison."
2021-05-30 14:33:32,wallstreetbets,Bought 100 bb friday. Whats with their short ratio 3.32 and amc’ 1.17 i dont know what that means big picture ?
2021-05-30 08:06:14,wallstreetbets,BB 1 week chart looks identical to AMC’s. Hoping for some simultaneous squeezage.
2021-05-30 16:48:57,wallstreetbets,Hey dude what’s calls? I know what shares are but what are calls ?
2021-05-30 07:53:09,wallstreetbets,"In my personal opinion we will have big spikes down followed by larger rips. I'm seeing this through to the end when shorts are covering their positions. All this $35 to $26 because of hedge unwinding doesn't really phase me. If a $10 swing scares you, when this thing starts doing $50-$100 swings you're going to lose your mind. I'm just staying calm and watching the charts, short interest, large option plays EOW and seeing where gravity takes us launching into the next week."
2021-05-30 03:16:39,wallstreetbets,"BB seems to be a decent yet risky company to bet on, I’m thinking of taking a small position there but I need to do more research first. I think it’s still a yolo but the company seems to have some potential, I wouldn’t go only for the hype train, there must be some value on the fundamentals at least. To risk is ok if you know the risk but to blindly bet is not ok imho."
2021-05-30 02:30:38,wallstreetbets,Bb and uwmc taking off next week

2021-05-30 14:39:26,wallstreetbets,I think next week will be fun.. but still the fun doesn't really start until we start seeing some serious shares returned
2021-05-29 20:26:34,wallstreetbets,I've run out of nails to bite. I feel like I just pushed all the chips in and I'm just watching the ball spin around the roulette wheel.....
2021-05-29 20:36:06,wallstreetbets,Same. I’ve studied and am willing to give it a go. Got in on the ground for BB. I’m eager to see what happens with AMC
2021-05-30 13:21:37,wallstreetbets,No you’d have more
2021-05-29 20:57:56,wallstreetbets,If it goes down. I have a little bit before theta rears its ugly head. My plan is to sell on or before the 14th.. So I have a little breathing room.. just not much. Going to roll most into 9/17 when it comes time to let them go.
2021-05-29 23:37:57,wallstreetbets,"I think he means research as why it's good to invest as it's gonna squeeze, not fundamentals as it's a good stock lol"

2021-05-29 20:29:38,wallstreetbets,haha.. well then I need like 40 hours of my life back. I guess you're right.. It technically is countable.
2021-05-30 18:22:56,wallstreetbets,I didn't sell shit Friday. Esp not for $25-$30. Way to cheap for my shares. Anything less than 4 digits is too cheap
2021-05-30 17:36:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-30 07:28:07,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze to $50? via gamma perhaps. Short squeeze though, even if the shares on loan are the only thing covered (minus synthetics), $50 is still peanuts. 

Also, a few daytraders probably sold on Friday in preparation for the inevitable hedge unwinding which makes sense based on all the short term options purchased; but let's be honest.. nobody sold their shares over a measily dip."
2021-05-30 14:30:53,wallstreetbets,"Everyone saying I'm stupid for not selling -- I mean it's cool.. I didn't come this far to sell at the first sign of green. If PotatoInMyAss can get me to sell, then this isn't the game for me."
2021-05-30 13:14:14,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the correction :)
2021-05-30 13:06:58,wallstreetbets,“I say when we fucking sell”
2021-05-30 18:48:46,wallstreetbets,Yep. Very true.
2021-05-30 07:05:46,wallstreetbets,haha no doubt.
2021-05-30 13:20:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm probably going to buy a few shares and then options in Sept. I feel something is around the corner with GME, and I'd like to be part of it."
2021-05-30 14:27:45,wallstreetbets,I personally believe so. Anytime before the squeeze is a good time. Before it gets too expensive.
2021-05-30 14:38:25,wallstreetbets,IV mostly combined with the fact the expiration is still a few weeks out. The more volume/volatility affects the price considerably more than simply just the price of the stock in that current moment.
2021-05-30 15:25:29,wallstreetbets,haha.. Return? I was just born.

2021-05-29 20:04:05,wallstreetbets,"I explain call options to people like this: 

You go into a neighborhood with the thought that the value of the homes are going to go up.   


You go to homeowner, and say ""I'd like \*the ability\* to buy this house."" I pay a small premium that I will buy that house by the expiration date (say 30 days for instance) for $100k. If I don't buy the house then I lose my premium, and the contract expires.   


Now while I hold this contract.. The value of the house goes up +$200k. It's now worth $300k while i held this contract for $100k. Someone tries to buy the house, but since I hold the contract, they have to purchase the contract from me if they want the house. I sell the contract for $200k and take the profit  and then they can buy the house for $100k (if you could transfer the contract to another person) Don't even know if you can do that or not but I mean.. pretending here.   


This may not be a perfect analogy, but it was the best way I could explain it."

2021-05-29 20:39:06,wallstreetbets,Same here my anxiety for next week is through the roof I feel like it’s January again. The volume for AMC was insane last week over 700 million in one day. That’s double what it was in January. I think we are gonna see $50 this week.
2021-05-30 13:52:29,wallstreetbets,Are you high?
2021-05-30 13:29:01,wallstreetbets,"I flunked out of kindergarten so you're going to have to explain to me how $1,000 that goes up 75% is more in GME compared to AMC."
2021-05-29 21:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah just set a limit sell and hope it hits, the fear would be price drops back down under $15 and then $40c would drop to almost nothing again rather quickly after I think. You'd still have the shares at least so if you're a believer hang on to those and just jettison the options while they are in profit."
2021-05-29 23:51:58,wallstreetbets,"You threw some money into far into the future OTM call options...... at strike prices higher than the company’s all time high. You only profited because of a freak event which has 0 things to do with the company but just pure luck. That person was right If you actually did hours of research you wouldn’t have thrown everything into those investments lol

Not belittling your returns. Amazing job you hit the lottery. To say it was smart and based on research is just laughable though lol"
2021-05-30 10:38:31,wallstreetbets,This whole $50 squeeze is gross you can get way more... if u wanna sell yourself short of profit go ahead guys but if I were you I’d consolidate at $50 but keep at least 85-95% in for the moon gang

2021-05-30 14:49:48,wallstreetbets,The lengths that shorts go to to spread bad info is just an ever present reminder of their desperation.  They’re not only telling you to sell they’re holding onto the notion that you never should have bought.  The more they try to explain themselves the less it makes sense.
2021-05-30 15:22:24,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Been using robbing hood and getting confused with their break even pricing. Appreciate it. Nice gains. Gonna throw more at amc Tuesday
2021-05-30 15:34:43,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you are gonna take another big L again
2021-05-30 00:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Not quite right. You buy a $1000 contract from a construction company for the right but not the obligation to buy 10(ten) $100,000 houses in a new under construction neighborhood of 200 houses. Construction on those houses will be finished by Dec 1 2021 and you have until that date to decide whether you want to buy 10 of those houses at that price ($100,000). As construction continues, the prices of those houses go up and down because of the housing market and because people can start to see how those houses are looking as they are being completed. You can exercise your right to that contract at any time up until construction is complete, but once the construction is completed on Dec 1 2021, you have to decide if you want to exercise your right to buy those houses at $100,000 or that contract will void and you would’ve paid $1,000 for nothing . You can also sell that contract to anyone else to give them the right to buy those houses at that price.

ANYONE can buy those houses, and they don’t have to buy your contract from you to buy any of those houses. In fact, someone can buy ALL of those houses in that neighborhood and there will be none left for sale, but luckily for you If you exercised your contract then the construction company that sold you that contract will be forced to buy 10 of those houses at whatever the price is at that time to sell to you because they wrote you that contract and they are obligated to fulfill it , even if they have to pay $1,000,000 per house out of their own pocket to hand them to you (ie example of a naked short)"
2021-05-29 22:31:11,wallstreetbets,"This is actually a solid way of explaining. In this scenario, is this considered a “call, hold, other etc?”"

GME 1,748

2021-05-29 21:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, just based on watching this, they seem to carpet bomb a lot looking for stop losses..  I've seen red for so long it doesn't even phase me anymore. I just get excited knowing they are shorting more making the inevitable all that more awesome."
2021-05-30 07:11:59,wallstreetbets,"My research was just short interest + after the earnings call that they are not going bankrupt and have enough cash to the end of 2022 and that people are going to start going back to the theaters, shorts quadrupling down, retail owns the float, more people are buying and holding which is going to eventually squeeze them out. It just took a little longer than I thought.  For me to be lucky, someone has to be unlucky.. and I felt I was capitalizing on the fact these guys didn't bail back in Jan/Feb and went in harder. I'm probably out of the stock market when this is all over with.. I'm just here for the gangbang."
2021-05-30 06:20:29,wallstreetbets,"These guys are right. Absolutely congrats and fuck you though. Just don't throw too much at the next stock you think you're right on based on hype and momentum. Enjoy your gains, you had decent odds but you're still very lucky."

Max down side without rolling is $1k per spread. I figure there is a fairly decent chance they expire otm if the market is sideways anyway.  If the market touches or goes over 421 I will probably load some more each time.  I think 420 is around the resistance level and either it drops or goes sideways for a while before any more gains."

AMGN will be there presenting since they just got a FDA approval for Lumakras.

2021-05-30 13:59:40,wallstreetbets,"For valuation  a quick look can give some dirty numbers. Total breast cancer cases in the US, about 280,000. Now an estimate for how many will receive chemo we can say roughly half, although I'm sure a more exact and uptodate number can be pulled, https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21565. Lets say140,000 are receiving chemo, pre Covid NCCN guidelines stated only high risk patients received prophylactic G-CSF, however with the advent of Covid patients in the intermediate risk group can receive it as well. It is hard to determine if the guideline will revert, but based on studies it does seem to be the more cost effective solution, so hopefully it stays. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.29\_suppl.73 About 1/3 are high risk patients, another 1/3 are intermediate risk patients. Being conservative lets take 1/2 of the a140,000, 70,000 per year. In the conference call the CEO stated 70% of oncologists were interested, so lets take 70% of that, using 50,000 out of the 280,000 breast cancer patients as our market. Using the price of G-CSF as a stand-in, it would still put the yearly revenue over the current price of the market cap. A market cap of 2-3x revenue is a 3-4X return on the current SP. I can't find a number anywhere for the total number of breast cancer patients a year that receive Filgastrim currently but I'm sure it exists in either a conference call or company paper for companies that produce their version of it. That would be the best bet for the most accurate market size of Plinabulin. Edit: I believe the goal of their NDA is for approval in all solid tumor chemo regimens that G-CSF is currently used in, breast cancer is just what their protective studies measured due to the prevalence."

A simple 1 to 10 will do if you don't want to give closer  percentage likelihoods for strategic success rates.  
('scuse me being hard with you about this, no offense)

When you say <<this **WILL** determine>> do you mean that a computer can be instructed to follow this strategy?"
2021-05-30 07:31:56,wallstreetbets,Wut
2021-05-30 07:17:26,wallstreetbets,Truth.
2021-05-29 22:39:56,wallstreetbets,Sorry friend. That like me and AMD. I feel you 😀
2021-05-30 09:23:51,wallstreetbets,We are out of gin???! Fffff
2021-05-30 07:30:42,wallstreetbets,I actually like how they are mimicking aapl in regards to a lifestyle.
2021-05-30 09:12:44,wallstreetbets,"well that's certainly true - I was talking about individual ordinary shares NIO Inc ADR ..  not options .. but if you want to talk about options , go ahead, what do you have to say?

NIO will be worth 200 dollars a share, in a while .. if you buy shares at 36 on Thursday when the weekly trailing price sag (often) reaches it's low  and then sell them at 37-38 on Monday, you'll make 2 dollars. If you keep them until they go up to 200 you will be holding long, but that will TEND to move the midweek and the overall spot action a bit higher a bit faster from week to week, and you'll reach your 200 sooner. (if enough folk take that view)

So it's down to you if you buy/sell 5 or 10 times and so (hopefully) make 2 dollars per cycle, or hold 5 / 10 weeks and (hopefully) make 200.

There is a kind of ""best price"" for retail traders in any share, the point where you feel you can do MOST with that share.. .. eg you don't seek out penny stocks and you don't chase 870 dollar-a-hit shares (mainly)..  many retail folk have a share price they're most comfortable with, if they think about it...   it rings a bell in them when shares are in that price range ..

just a feeling, ya know.. look and you'll see it's there ..

so its maybe tempting to make your 2 dollars on a share now, rather than put the time and ""effort"" into going for 200 ""in a while""

need to see how you think yourself, and work that out with a pencil, too.. hmm?

for me, IMO -  I expect NIO will go to 200.. I get off at 140.   
And THAT'S because I want that liquid for another project, so I don't want NIO to take forever to go where it's going.

But hell, it's a long winner no doubt at all, I'll wait if I have to, I'd just rather not. After 150-200 I don't know what will happen to NIO.  Out there the DD looks good.

**HEY - what year or month will you have the first NIO in the USA, anyone want to offer an opinion?**

Check the car stuff on Youtube, see what those car mags & pundits  say about NIO and their boss William Li.

p.s. Disclaimer : I got no advice and I don't work for these damn people. And I got more shares in Renault and Dassault than NIO.   
But none in Tesla and no intention that way.  
Ford could be a better bet than Tesla IMO, starting go get from now. You tell me."
2021-05-30 09:39:18,wallstreetbets,I dont need to prove myself to you friend. Nor do I have time. Lmfao. You can do your own dd and look at my post history.

2021-05-30 09:21:43,wallstreetbets,I’m bullish on nio friend. I was referring to “make a few dollars on a dip” comment. They are trying to create a lifestyle like aapl - which I like. Trying to expand to Europe. Def upside.

2021-05-30 01:16:39,wallstreetbets,"I can understand GME and AMC, those were more about making a point. The rest were truly retarded. I mean, how does someone believe some of these companies are worth more than huge corporations that have been around for decades? It stagers the mind how ignorant you have to be.

The hedge funds are absolutely loving this blood bath."
2021-05-30 01:24:26,wallstreetbets,I just look at them as high scores and feel way better

2021-05-30 09:29:48,wallstreetbets,I got sucked into the “you only lose if you sell” trap in the telecoms era.  I was up over $100k (almost 20 years ago) and it started to fall.  I diamond handed down to a $50k loss and I am still holding that stock as a reminder of my former stupidity.

2021-05-29 22:41:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a bagholder. It's not something to be proud of. I sold AMC for a profit now I'm getting involved with BYND. It's an entry level position on a good company with serious squeeze potential.  
It has squeeze potential with just and increase in sales and natural growth. When WSB people pour in it will go over the top.   
I'm all in."

2021-05-30 10:55:31,wallstreetbets,It's not bagholding when a revolutionary action of the masses pushes the system to their control from selfish animalistic sociopaths in charge of hedge funds. Let's never forget the ultimate goal i.e use the very system to change it.
2021-05-30 11:43:29,wallstreetbets,"LOL.......sorry, no bag holders for AMC under $100 per share.
GME isnt over.  Rules are changed, and shorts dont have INDEFINITE Amount of time to cover.
Its coming, and when it does......BOOM.
None of you really know what happened do ya?...

Hedge funds used an AI to do buying, selling, shorting, and it ran up a MASSIVE work flow, so that shares were MULTIPLE borrowed against.
Gamestop, and AMC were NEVER supposed to have this many shareholders.
The price is gonna rocket.
Why would Hedge funds IMMEDIATELY take DTCC insurance up to $100k a share........68 TRILLION dollar insurance protection?........
Stop paper handing ya life."

Buying 90 calls because i think people get fooled at least twice nowadays"
2021-05-30 03:03:45,wallstreetbets,"On my first day of downloading RH and learning about stocks, there was something that felt off about NKLA. I wanted to invest so badly but didn’t. Glad I dodged that bullet."
2021-05-30 06:07:36,wallstreetbets,How? Easy. Stock valuations are based on... wishful thinking and hype. Fundamentals never mattered.
2021-05-30 07:31:54,wallstreetbets,"When NKLA peaked, none of these things were known yet."
2021-05-30 14:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Hype is reality, my friend. At least to some."
2021-05-30 01:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Dude , the truck rolling down the hill was for a promo video at the time. They DO have a real truck made in Germany with IVECO. i think they will have a great H2, the media FUD hit this company hard.

It’s starting to pay off. Walk street was punishing them for insiders selling and compensation packages  for CEO. But that’s in the rear view mirror now

It’s an unpopular opinion but I like the mortgage origination game for the next 5+ years, with some potentially rocky times in there. Fundamentally, there’s a veritable FUCKLOAD of people who need to remortgage/cash out their profits they’ve made since 2012. I like aggressive expansion for them right now. Just my .02….I wouldn’t dive into an empty pool just yet but you should definitely take your wife’s boyfriend out for a nice dinner, he’s been pretty understanding all things considered"

2021-05-30 12:08:23,wallstreetbets,Bought in at 21.. :(
2021-05-29 20:40:03,wallstreetbets, NKLA and amc are pointing at each other
2021-05-29 23:25:42,wallstreetbets,Now why exactly did you do that?
2021-05-30 02:30:13,wallstreetbets,Blow & Hookers
2021-05-29 21:20:56,wallstreetbets,I'm up 25k now in a matter of a few days. We are on our way.
2021-05-29 23:15:06,wallstreetbets,Stock dipping at the end of the day before the madness that's going to happen next week does not equal bag holding lmao.
2021-05-29 21:32:08,wallstreetbets,I got in at $32 too. Silly me I thought it could breakaway from GME but they look like they will forever be tied to each other.
2021-05-29 22:38:29,wallstreetbets,i bought it at $26...my advice to you is..double down on tuesday before it moves
2021-05-29 23:27:30,wallstreetbets,Don't worry we're coming back for ya be ready.

2021-05-30 00:12:17,wallstreetbets,Came here to say exactly that. [*Secret handshake*]
2021-05-29 23:50:51,wallstreetbets,I concur that one of these things is not like the other.
2021-05-30 01:02:35,wallstreetbets,AMC
2021-05-29 20:57:51,wallstreetbets,I bought 25 shares at 60 2 years ago.  Should’ve dumped it when it went back up recently but thought I was getting ahead of myself.  It tanked the next day back to its miserable current levels.
2021-05-29 20:34:03,wallstreetbets,"Turns out, don't take stock recommendations from reddit"
2021-05-29 20:30:58,wallstreetbets,You probably learned something so it’s not all bad

E: nvm it capped at like 25, so I must’ve bought at like 20ish, but point still stands"

2021-05-29 22:37:47,wallstreetbets,Bro we hit 12.09 yesterday. Sell it.
2021-05-29 22:33:49,wallstreetbets,"honestly not a bad cost basis... I think fair value is 320-330 at payments average EV/sales, with the caveat being if you think their revenue can sustain beyond 2022."

2021-05-29 23:58:44,wallstreetbets,"AMD has been at $10 for 6 months now, and as soon as the price skyrocketed these retards could wait to jump on the fomo train.  If you believed in the stock, why did you wait until it was too late?  I'm sorry, I paper handed some 300% gains."

2021-05-29 20:08:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah AMC tendie train is just boarding
2021-05-29 20:41:46,wallstreetbets,And thus the bagholder torch is passed from one generation to the next....

2021-05-30 00:13:30,wallstreetbets,It’s ‘going’ to 500k according to the fanatics lmaooo
2021-05-29 22:31:16,wallstreetbets,At that point AMC would be worth 33% more than GME.
2021-05-30 00:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Yep, after the the box office for the weekend has been awesome.  I agree!!"
2021-05-30 10:24:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s going to $60 the same way GME is gonna moon any day now
2021-05-30 08:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Then hold the bag open for all the money to be tossed in later. MVIS is a solid company with a bright future, that $25 price might seem rough now. Check back later though ;) 

It's eye roll worthy when MVIS gets lumped in as a ""meme stock""."
2021-05-29 20:23:43,wallstreetbets,username checks out
2021-05-29 20:28:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m throwing more at it too, hate to average up but look at GameStop, still over 200 so I feel good about it"

2021-05-29 21:05:07,wallstreetbets,I'm up $4200 we are coming for you
2021-05-29 20:38:46,wallstreetbets,"GME brought in a huge influx of new people, and seemed to create a subgroup of WSB that only posts negative shit. 

Do you remember when shitposting was simple and all in good fun here? Pepperidge Farm remembers."
2021-05-30 00:14:44,wallstreetbets,There are a lot of shitty people in the world. All you need to know is that $AMC is going to the moon.
2021-05-29 20:40:40,wallstreetbets,"nope, its just a last chance to try to get as many people of the wagon as possible imo"
2021-05-30 00:17:41,wallstreetbets,"You mean it isn’t a 24/7 circlejerk/fantasy land where people honestly believe their share of GME will be worth 20 million? 

No, thankfully there is another sun for that"
2021-05-29 21:37:06,wallstreetbets,A lot more positions made up entirely of shares too. Bunch of pussies running around these parts now.
2021-05-29 21:06:47,wallstreetbets,"Billions are in play, of course there are new accounts."
2021-05-29 20:42:34,wallstreetbets,It's not too late to buy at $35 so it can drop back down to $8 in a few weeks. :)
2021-05-30 01:16:09,wallstreetbets,What's the plan for blackberry ?
2021-05-30 07:22:41,wallstreetbets,Same here. Suckers
2021-05-29 21:00:24,wallstreetbets,Why? I haven't read any good explanation why it would make sense compared to GME? Zero. On the other hand there are many reasons why GME is the right pick
2021-05-29 23:02:50,wallstreetbets,Rkt has billions in cash in the bank and and the market cap been hovering around like 35b or so. That is the one that gets me. They literally have the equity power to just buy shits load back if they get sick of the price being so low.

Call it ""How to catch a Retard""

People who believe shit like ""IPhone killer"" ""Next Tesla"" ""Next BYND"" etc when it's just a copy product, completely missing the point of how the original product became successful, deserve to lose money on them.

The ""Next Tesla"" isn't going to be a fucking electric car. It's going to be some innovative product that shakes up an entirely different market in a big way and you'll never find that looking for EV companies."

They have top shelf and bottom shelf herbs like any other flower/oil producer, plus a ton of vape and topographic remedies in their lineup. They are also just about everywhere in Canadia. Everyone wants soon, I think Sundial is a $4-5 Long hold. I only wish I hadn't sold out when I did but other stocks were callin."

2021-05-29 23:42:09,wallstreetbets,The only legitimate reason to buy AMC over GME is not having more than (currently) $222USD available to you.

Their business model was used physical video games (In 2021) and selling toys to manchildren, also lets not forget to actually purchase a fucking product you will be subjected to more questions than a suspect in a homicide, and as you mentioned the main thing they were known for at least in what passes for Video Game Journalism was being an absolute shit company to work for, so shitty in fact they tried to get their employees classified as essential in March of 2020 of all fucking times.

But whatever its the most undeserved turnaround in history but they have a future now and that's thanks to us retards."

2021-05-29 22:15:53,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps it’s another value play. They can certainly grow. But there are bigger LPs that have brands that seem to be much more popular overall. Sundial got a ways to go. Still, it could be a good play I don’t know enough about it tbh. 

I don’t personally know anyone who’s spoken highly of their offerings, except maybe TopLeaf, they’ve come across my radar."
2021-05-30 15:39:19,wallstreetbets,"You? That's how you're acting.

I don't hold GME.

Okay that's a lie. I hold one single share because that's how I met my future wife.  :) I don't care if they go bankrupt, I've made money on them as well as lost some. Close to a wash.

I play the volatility for sure but I'm a degenerate gambler. In no way, shape, or form do I believe these meme stocks will pan out long term hence no long positions on them."

2021-05-30 08:42:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah Nikola at 90+ Jesus if those people still exist you may as well dump the cash in a burn pile.  Or hope they find a new hill to roll their next revolutionary semi down.
2021-05-30 07:55:19,wallstreetbets,Depends on your time horizon. I will loss over 60% if I sell my BB bags but if I keep ‘em. Inflation may eventual in 10 years break even on paper.
2021-05-30 11:48:27,wallstreetbets,"That's why they call it bagholding, you are just holding the bag of money for someone else"
2021-05-30 08:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes. You only pay taxes on net profit and if you net loss you can take $3k against your other income, any remaining rolls over to future years."
2021-05-30 10:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I think he just meant the spike was irrational. They have new management and are aggressively pursuing worldwide 5g deployments. I would hold at that price no question, it’s almost back there from the high $3 range a couple months ago. I legit think the company is worth over $6 as things stand right now and have a much brighter future."

2021-05-30 03:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my average is at $7.5 so I’m not exactly worried about any price dips. I’ll hold some of the shares for the potential meme squeeze, but I can’t believe people who are panicking about bagholding at $26+ refuse to put themselves in a better situation when it’s presented to them. 

This sing and dance of high surges and low dips has happened too many times for people not to learn their lesson.

I’m not gonna be mad I took some profit too early if the shares end up being $60 next week. Better to make money than not."
2021-05-29 22:50:39,wallstreetbets,You put over 3k into AMC as your first stock purchase ever? Bro lol
2021-05-30 10:50:28,wallstreetbets,It’s not about sellling at this point I mean your down 80% might as well ride this bitch for the next 2-5 years and hope you have an upswing.
2021-05-30 13:44:38,wallstreetbets,"With the truck in neutral and the right camera angle....just might work. By golly, I think you're on to something here."
2021-05-30 08:30:56,wallstreetbets,"True but the money you potentially lost for not moving what you had to something productive, could lose you money in the time it took for you to maybe break even."
2021-05-30 08:36:17,wallstreetbets,opportunity cost? read a book
2021-05-30 08:45:10,wallstreetbets,How will you lose 60% when its high during the spike was 14.04 and its at 10.04 now?  Unless you are a true rare breed and picked it up like 10 years ago and have been holding ever since.
2021-05-30 10:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!

I only had a thousand dollars to invest and split it between GME and NOK. I’m just sitting on them until something major happens. I figured one for long term and one for the squeeze.

I do have to get off Robinhood though."
2021-05-30 16:44:47,wallstreetbets,Lmao your flair is great too
2021-05-29 22:57:15,wallstreetbets,"nah, its worse. I have over 700 shares at $30. Did you not read my handle?"
2021-05-30 03:03:17,wallstreetbets,"I put $2,700 in AMC as my first stock ever and over doubled my investment"
2021-05-30 11:26:34,wallstreetbets,I agree.  I mean if you are going to dig your own grave slowly might as well hop in it.
2021-05-30 15:23:44,wallstreetbets,"So rather than selling the rest and buying a potential 10 bagger, it's better to leave it slowly decay and then HOPE at least to recover a little of it? Makes no sense to me. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"

2021-05-30 02:40:27,wallstreetbets,"We should buy PLTR, then randomly spam it on WSB so that when they comment on CNBC on why PLTR has gone up… they’ll say “it’s been trending on WSB, 69,420 times this past week. Retail investors are buying up the stock because of a potential squeeze”. Yada yada yada, PLTR.

Serious question tho, I wonder how many of these CNBC market reporters actually have GME and AMC in their portfolio. At times when they bring it up, they secretly want to laugh but rein it in because it’s trending."
2021-05-30 15:07:14,wallstreetbets,yeah PLTR broke the 50 SMA friday with strength. Most retards didn't even notice cuz they were too busy jerking off to AMC gains. 2nd pop coming next week i bet.

2021-05-30 09:45:28,wallstreetbets,This stock got on my nerves. Had to sell it awhile back. It was going to cause a stroke. I bought in way to high and you know it dived as soon as I bought it.
2021-05-30 09:59:23,wallstreetbets,How did you get such cheap calls? Asking for my Cat
2021-05-30 10:38:32,wallstreetbets,When did you buy these?

2021-05-29 21:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say. Friday had a somewhat bad inflation report and its why it went from like 9% in the green to 1%.


But PLTR is a long term hold for me, and i am confident it will literally moon once wall street sees inflation is not the end of the world."

2021-05-30 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,"Calls with PLTR are ridiculous, and don't seem at all related to potential movement. Go out and sell $100 CCs for $1000 and laugh all the way to the Tendy shop"

2021-05-30 06:52:12,wallstreetbets,I went in depth on one of the top comments.  Another lad has a great comment explaining it somewhere on here..
2021-05-30 07:16:28,wallstreetbets,$30 is merely over the hill.  I hold 200 shares at 21.50 that I don’t plan on selling until $100+.
2021-05-30 06:54:21,wallstreetbets,I could not agree any more
2021-05-30 10:20:10,wallstreetbets,I woke up 5 days straight down every day ... lost like 60% on my calls. The size of the aneurism in my brain should have killed me. A normal person would make the easy choice to sell. Because I’m an actual retard I decided to double down

2021-05-30 08:20:11,wallstreetbets,They interview CEO’s and follow the market for their job. So you’d think they’d be the one of the first jump on a piece of news or more in-depth knowledge than most of us. They act like they are poor when they talk about their personal lives.

2021-05-29 20:42:14,wallstreetbets,Wait for example I got 2 contracts for amc so I’m suppose to sell them and not exercise them? New to options and jumped in because I thought buying call options was straight forward but damn I need to do more research.

2021-05-30 17:04:36,wallstreetbets,So how much will you make at 27 call?
2021-05-30 11:11:41,wallstreetbets,Citigroup posted a typo price target of $170 that was almost certainly supposed to be $17. Palantards have been spamming that $170 is accurate. I love those fuckers. Some palantards say it was indeed a typo... but meant to be $1700
2021-05-30 14:32:13,wallstreetbets,Emphasis on retard
2021-05-29 20:58:37,wallstreetbets,It is not for the faint hearted.... a 70% loss on the day is not crazy for option trading. I would advise choosing expiration dates at least 3 weeks out
2021-05-30 06:43:49,wallstreetbets,"The answers here are definitely not wrong, but there are a couple other ways to look at it.

Not everyone throws their entire life savings into options as soon as humanly possible. As a matter of fact, options allow you to take a smaller portion of your account and use it to make huge money. For example, I directly own shares in some ETFs. This makes up maybe 60% of my account. The rest of the account can be used to make a crapload of money off options. If I ever need to exercise my options, I can free up capital in order to do it by briefly selling shares to free up cash.
If do this I will pay some commissions on all these trades, but at least I have the option (pun intended!!!) to exercise my contracts if I need to.

There are some reasons to exercise the contract:

1) You might fuck up and forget about the expiry date. If the contract is in the money, it will auto exercise for you. This can cause utter chaos for your brokerage account if you dont have the cash to pay for the stocks you are exercising the right to buy. Brokerages fucking hate when this happens and they can temporarily lock your account down and give you a scolding.

2) You may need to execute the contract if there is not enough liquidity. Options usually are significantly less liquid than the underlying stock. If nobody wants to buy your contract and the price of the underlying is hot RIGHT NOW, you may want to exercise it. This is pretty rare though, and doesn't come up often.

3) As another user said, the price of the contract will move up and down with the underlying, and the degree to which this happens is called the delta. If a huge change happens in the price of the underlying, and the delta of the option was low during this change, the price of the option may not have moved as much relative to the price of the stock. Exercising could be much more profitable in this case.

There are a couple downsides to exercising though:

1. You have to have the cash sitting around to pay for the stocks you are exercising the right to handle. If you sell something else off, there will be commissions for this. If you use  a low commission broker, it'll likely be negligible.

2. There is a risk that as you go through the whole process of selling other assets for cash, exercising the contract, and finally selling the stocks you exercised the right to own, that the price of the stock could drop. This just depends on its volatility.

Edit:  just wanted to add that even after saying all this, people almost never exercise the contract. It's more work, there's extra risks, and there can be commissions involved. Usually when people design their option strategy, they try to take advantage of a good delta.

If you sell all of your options, you dont need to worry about having cash laying around and you can take full advantage of all your capital. That being said, I do like splitting my account between options and shares. This does 2 things:

1. If I need capital to exercise a contract some time, I have shares I can sell off.
2. If I manage to get every single option trade wrong, I'm not going to lose my whole account. If 60% of my account is stocks and 40% is calls and the stock market crashes, and the calls all expire uselessly, I won't lose my whole account."
2021-05-29 21:00:35,wallstreetbets,So when you buy a contract you are only buying the opportunity to exercise 100 shares. You do not have to exercise the option to buy the shares
2021-05-30 10:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I haven't done the math myself, but it was a claim made by Pensioncraft in one of his videos.

I'll take his word for it, because regardless the point is that if the option happens to have a good delta when the underlying asset rallies, you can see massive returns relative to what you paid for the contracts. Since tesla gained what, over 1,000% in a short time, I could believe that a small contract price could have a massive payoff

Edit: another element is the contract price. If the contract has a price per share of only $0.04, you have huge access to betting on a large number of stocks for a relatively inexpensive amount of contract price.
In other words, you're paying very little for the right to exercise each full stock. An outlay of something like a few hundred or a few thousand dollars allows you to bet on, sometimes, a huge amount of underlying stock.
If the delta is high when the stock has a huge rally, or you exercise at the top, you paid almost nothing for the contract relative to the value you unlocked by making the correct bet"
2021-05-29 21:26:52,wallstreetbets,I honestly don’t know how PLTR isn’t more popular and liked amongst WSB.  Over on stock twits it’s huge
2021-05-29 21:31:08,wallstreetbets,You guys don’t like .. actually talk about good companies?
2021-05-30 15:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Some people exercise the calls, others buy them thinking they'll be worth more later."
2021-05-30 11:37:08,wallstreetbets,Tax man will probably take .6¢. 🤣
2021-05-30 18:57:26,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand how return works lol I paid $10k for these contracts. And netted $23,000"
2021-05-29 20:50:03,wallstreetbets,Buy CNXS ASAP
2021-05-30 11:35:51,wallstreetbets,It’s a joke till it’s not a joke though!! Palantards unit!! 🤠🦧🦾🤣
2021-05-29 21:16:24,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-05-29 22:21:50,wallstreetbets,Tell us why please?
2021-05-30 12:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy... I pretty much read this whole thread last night and all your responses n you definitely are helping people out with your replies. Keep it up, and congrats on big dub! You’ve sparked my interest in option trading"
2021-05-30 15:06:31,wallstreetbets,"UMC $10 call for 1/21/22. It's absolutely a steal at (currently $123), and you're gonna want microchip manufacturers in the coming months.   
If you wanna get in on the memes, a BB call for 10/17 at $10 is only $200, and it's nearly certain to get enough meme action to jump over $13 by then, I think BB is worth a lot more than that, but I'm not very smart."
2021-05-30 07:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Good post, people keep asking me what options are... I herby pass future questions to this guy"
2021-05-29 21:06:02,wallstreetbets,So I guess my real question is when should you exercise the contract? Is there like a strategy when to sell the contract or to exercise it?
2021-05-30 14:08:47,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-29 23:36:40,wallstreetbets,"It was extremely popular here from mid Nov-Early Feb. The memes people were cranking out in that time were incredible. But since getting swatted back down to $20, other tickers rose to prominence. It's still consistently talked about and I have a feeling all the hype will come rushing back if this upward trend continues"
2021-05-29 21:31:48,wallstreetbets,🤫
2021-05-30 15:46:14,wallstreetbets,Is it supposed to go up or something?
2021-05-29 20:28:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah you should definitely do that bro
2021-05-30 11:41:14,wallstreetbets,Ayyy😎🦍
2021-05-29 22:47:06,wallstreetbets,I’m long as fuck…… siting on these 400 shares & just waiting
2021-05-29 21:36:17,wallstreetbets,I will say I did buy 75 $23 6/4 calls right at the end of the day.   Basically I went full retard again this time with $5k.  Could see another post like this next week 😘 or I lose all my money like the autistic fuck I am
2021-05-30 12:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man! I’m glad I could help! I can’t believe I’m getting awards and stuff, never expected any of this when I made the post"
2021-05-29 21:10:44,wallstreetbets,I mean.. the value of the contract correlates to the stock price. Everybody should have their own personal sell point. I keep a chart on all the stocks I trade with trend lines and certain sell targets
2021-05-29 23:26:28,wallstreetbets,Nobody ever exercises because no one here has the money to exercise. You sell those contracts and immediately plow those gains into more calls (or puts)
2021-05-29 22:48:41,wallstreetbets,Boom!!!  If I knew how to trade options I’d throw a grand down and follow OP but I have no clue
2021-05-29 21:53:15,wallstreetbets,I ask my wife in July about buying gme was smart lol she said we shop there why not lol yo the original wsb ppl even tho I never post are just sitting back watching laughing including me but I will same I missed amc on the long no regrets tho gme was more than enough to retire. I still have my wsb mentality but its so much easier
2021-05-29 23:28:26,wallstreetbets,Interesting...I was going to exercise so I could hold the line with the apes now I’m not sure
2021-05-30 07:28:51,wallstreetbets,"You’re paying for the right to buy 100 shares at a future date. There’s only a few things you need to know:

Expiration date: This is how long you have to make gainz. 3 weeks or longer is the way to go IMO

Strike price: After this point you start to make gainz

Price, or contract cost: This is how much you pay, per contract. Remember, you’re paying for the right to sell 100 shares. So a contract that costs .90 isn’t actually 90 cents. It costs $90. If you want 10 contracts it’s $900. 

Break even point: This is strike price + cost.  So if I buy a $20 call that costs .90 my break even would be a 20.90"
2021-05-30 07:37:22,wallstreetbets,It all depends on your levels of retardation. A full on autistic orangutan like me would do what the guy above said
2021-05-30 00:02:09,wallstreetbets,aaaa123454321 is an awful name but I love you anyway palantard.
2021-05-30 07:57:01,wallstreetbets,Honestly I could have done that research myself and should have.  I appreciate it.  I’m gonna see what the contracts look like.
2021-05-30 08:08:20,wallstreetbets,And I guess what people call “leaps” are just options that are way way out in time.
2021-05-30 08:02:25,wallstreetbets,"I see so the further you go out in time, and or the less the strike price deviates from the current value.  The more expensive the contract. 

One thing I don’t get is why there are call options with strike prices under the current value."
2021-05-30 15:55:58,wallstreetbets,"You can make money way before the option goes ITM. There's a lot of factors that go into option pricing.

Important to understand. The Greeks will have their way with you, if you don't."
2021-05-30 18:52:35,wallstreetbets,"Can you clarify something for me? I have $40 call on $BB and I’m currently down. I started off in the green on Friday, despite the stock price only reaching $12 but it end at $10 so now I’m never in the red. But, you said you only make money after the stock price surpasses the strike price. I don’t think that’s always the case because again, when the stock price was $12, my call option was green despite a strike price of $40. Please provide your thoughts...."
2021-05-30 06:49:02,wallstreetbets,Well... my original account I forgot my password. So I had to post on my incognito account (this one).  Looks like this is my new account lol
2021-05-30 08:09:55,wallstreetbets,"You got it. I’m not crazy on leaps, just buy shares if you’re that long IMO. The price you pay per contract is a lot"
2021-05-30 08:06:21,wallstreetbets,"Those would be considered “in the money”... they are much safer and obviously are reasonably more expensive.. “out of the money” is when you’re over the current price. Retard apes like myself only buy out of the money, tho I only shoot slightly outside"
2021-05-30 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,The value of the contract increased on those days due to the time value of money. A $40 call on a $10 stock is absolutely retarded amongst all measure. I love it
2021-05-30 09:43:55,wallstreetbets,Narrator: The username for the incognito account was also the password to the original account.
2021-05-30 08:31:57,wallstreetbets,"I see.  So for an in the money call the contract price dictates how much the stock would have to increase to break even.  PLTR in the money call might be $20.  Contract price could be $6 even though PLTR is over 21 you would need to se me a rise to 26 for a break even. 

Buying those sounds stupid, I’m retarded.  Seems like less risk cause your already in the money and less gains cause they cost so much."
2021-05-30 18:57:23,wallstreetbets,Even if the expiration date is a year out?
2021-05-30 11:44:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly ... so if you paid $6 for a 20 call... it ends up being $23.  You don’t lose it all You still get $300.  Because those $20 calls are still worth something.    I will say $6 a call is expensive as fuck for a $20 stock. That’d be worth like a 1-2 year contract lol
2021-05-30 18:58:42,wallstreetbets,A 400% increase in a year is incredibly impressive.  But it is a meme stock so I truly have no idea where it may go
2021-05-30 11:52:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I just picked numbers at random to make the example.

That being said I’m not in love with the options available on PLTR right now.  Have to look more but after talking to you I really understand the process and thinking back to some of my other stock buys I really want to take time and find something to use these options on.  Thank you."
2021-05-30 12:08:11,wallstreetbets,I really don’t get the “break even” price though.  If it’s .05 price for the option to buy with a strike of $35 on 6/18 Why is the “break even” 35.05?  I’ve more than broken even at $35
2021-05-30 12:15:04,wallstreetbets,"Also side note.  This shit must be bananas in volatile stocks.  I’m assuming they price in volatility to the options yes?
Sorry I keep bogging you down with questions.  Tell be to screw off whenever"
2021-05-30 11:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, that’s honestly really cool to hear. BOL"
2021-05-30 12:14:00,wallstreetbets,"Because it is factoring in your original cost, or how much you paid.  If you paid .05, that’s a $5 contract

When a contact reaches its expiration it theoretically pays $1 for every 1 cent you are over strike price. So if it lands on 35.04, at expiration it pays you $4

I say theoretically because your contract gets automatically sold if you don’t expire it on the day of expiration

I hope that makes sense"
2021-05-30 12:16:54,wallstreetbets,Ohhhh fuck yeah. For a gme or amc option you have to pay a ridiculous amount.  And idc I’m just sitting here bored anyways lol I love stocks and love talking about them
2021-05-30 12:31:19,wallstreetbets,So that’s your break even on the contract.  You would no longer have to factor out your contract price m.  Since PLTR is at $22.80 at $35 you are getting $1220-$5 so 1215. At 35.05 you are getting 1225-5 so 1220 breaking even with the value of strike price
2021-05-30 12:25:50,wallstreetbets,"Well if you don’t understand something till you can explain it to a retard, you understand. Thank you again."
2021-05-30 12:46:11,wallstreetbets,"My break even on the 5/28 20.5 calls contracts were all around 21.40 ,, so if it hit $35 then .. Jesus I would have made a lot. 

But I have sold these contracts...

I reloaded with $23 6/11 calls at .67 average cost.  So that break even is $23.67"
2021-05-30 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,But at 23 you’ve hit your strike and can exercise
2021-05-30 12:54:12,wallstreetbets,I never exercise .... you need a lot of buying power because you have to literally buy 100 shares at $23. So it would cost $2300 to exercise one contract
2021-05-30 13:00:57,wallstreetbets,I see I had a major misconception.  You are agreeing to buy at strike price. Or rather to have the option to
2021-05-30 12:59:09,wallstreetbets,So you can sell your contract.
2021-05-30 12:59:46,wallstreetbets,Wait I thought you were buying at 21.40
2021-05-30 13:04:35,wallstreetbets,Exactly! It’s just the *option* to buy 100 shares at so and so price
2021-05-30 12:59:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah bro.  At any time you want
2021-05-30 13:03:56,wallstreetbets,"That’s when I originally purchased my contracts.... shown in the original post. 

The only calls I own in the picture shown are 5 of the 6/25 $20 calls. 

When I sold to cash the 6/4 and 5/28 calls I then made another $5k bet with the $23 calls that I currently own"
2021-05-30 13:07:39,wallstreetbets,So you are really looking for the price to exceed your strike to make any serious money.  You are not setting a target that pays.  You are setting a target you believe will be exceeded.  The target is just a number that as it approaches derisks your contracts.  Which depending you can still sell at a profit even before the strike price is met.
2021-05-30 13:37:17,wallstreetbets,"So I could in theory follow that trade today kinda by buying ITM $20 calls for roughly $3.30.  That would be most in line with your trade that could be made currently.  

Outside of that would be OTM $23 calls for a buck change or so.  Which would be more bullish on the price but close in terms of speculation to where you currently are."
2021-05-30 13:10:47,wallstreetbets,Precisely!! You sound like a true retard. Welcome to option trading mate
2021-05-30 13:19:59,wallstreetbets,Sick I’m gonna go lose some money now.  CRSP has even more expensive contracts than PLTR and they have been trending together.  I might start there.  Loss porn for sure.
2021-05-30 13:25:43,wallstreetbets,Also.  Damn you put up some real money on those options.
2021-05-30 13:40:27,wallstreetbets,Scared money don’t make money
2021-05-30 13:49:11,wallstreetbets,Facts. Fear isn’t a deterrent when you’re retarded though.
2021-05-30 14:17:29,wallstreetbets,Also on that note.  Probably best to buy calls on red days.
2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My first DD, ARRY to the Sun!! 🚀🚀🚀☀️☀️  COMPANY INTRO:

Array, $ARRY is a solar systems company that was founded in 1989 and IPO’d on October 15, 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B. Array makes money by selling mounting/tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy. This video from Array shows their systems well: 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA

   GROWTH:

Yearly:

Revenue:
2018: $290M
2019: $648M (+123% YoY) 
2020: $873M (+35% YoY)

Net income:
2018: -$61M
2019: $40M
2020: $59M (+48% YoY)

Quarterly:

Revenue:
Q3 2020: $139M
Q4 2020: $180M (+29% QoQ)
Q1 2021: $245M (+36% QoQ)

Net Income:
Q3 2020: -$7M
Q4 2020: -$2M
Q1 2021: 3M


Good growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income (will get to later). 

Now on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array’s consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity. 

US Solar Production from Utility (GWh)
2011: 1,800
2012: 4,300 (+138%)
2013: 9,200 (+114%)
2014: 18,300 (+99%)
2015: 26,500 (+45%)
2016: 36,700 (+38%)
2017: 53,000 (+44%)
2018: 66,600 (+26%)
2019: 72,200 (+9%)
2020: 90,900 (+26%)
Source: United States Department of Energy 

Solar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other  companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won’t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure. 

Good video by CNBC on the Grid, Storage systems, and the growth of solar utility production:

   UNDERVALUED:

In the first few months after IPO Array’s price held around the low $40’s, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.

1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I’m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity. 
2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn’t matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn’t operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don’t finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array’s CEO said “Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down” So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.  
3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. “This industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.” - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array’s cost of goods sold so it’s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism. This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability/margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity.

2021-05-30 12:39:10,wallstreetbets,Because of the rise in materials costs I think this is sideways for a few months.
2021-05-30 14:08:59,wallstreetbets,I would be careful ARRY experienced a huge sell off mainly because of share dilution from another offering + underwriters having the option to purchase shares at below ipo price. Company does not look attractive with their post-dilution market cap. FTCI looks better to me atm but I haven't done extensive DD on that one yet. They make the same type of tracking panels and recently came dip well below the IPO price of 12-13$. This is also a new ipo tho so I''m hesitant to play it.

2021-05-30 03:17:42,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure. I’m curious and planning on listening to previous earnings calls to find out more ab it. I think a  majority comes from 1 time payments bc the quarter to quarter discrepancies in revenue would suggest that type of business model. From my understanding tracking businesses in general also make money off recurring payments from running the software that tracks the sun and moves the panels. I’m not sure if that is only for double axis or for single axis too. Array sells single axis trackers. They’re businesses model is for sure something I’ll be digging into soon

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BASEL 3 is going to send SILVER and GOLD to the MOON So i did some dd and here's what i found out:

TLDR: SILVER and GOLD MOON by end of june and spy might drill.

&#x200B;

A lot of basel 3 regulations are happening on june 28 2021 and an important one is the Net Stable Funding Rate. 

This regulation in essence requires banks to prove their physical holdings of commodities relative to the amount of physical commodities they have lent out or shorted or leveraged on.

[https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs271.pdf)

more details on that link\^

&#x200B;

Many commodities traders say this is the single biggest event in their career and this regulation could send SILVER and GOLD to the moon when:

1. Banks reveal they don't have enough physical holdings -> indicates shortage 
2. Banks can't short physical commodities like gold and silver beyond their physical holdings -> banks cover their shorts causing a squeeze. Banks manipulating the silver market is not a conspiracy theory spread during the gme squeeze to distract wsb retards from gme. The manipulation has been going on for a long time and big banks have been fined heavily for manipulating the silver market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325))

JP Morgan has been a big culprit of manipulating the precious metals market by suppressing the price through paper shorts and when the price falls they buy physical bars of silver.

&#x200B;

Recall that the basel three regulations take place on june 28. Take a look at the OI for $SPY

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[OI for $SPY](https://preview.redd.it/yxbdwumzr3271.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef7a95c937dfdcf0cc136a95c09205a46ddb6c64)

Look at the 06/30 oi. There's an unusually high oi for 06/30 which is a weekly expiry whereas all the other weeklys are nowhere close to the oi on 06/30. There's a 74% oi for put and 25% oi for call on that expiry and similar ratios for the expiries close to june 28 when the basel 3 regulations take effect.

&#x200B;

Now look at the oi for $SLV

&#x200B;

[OI for $SLV](https://preview.redd.it/on521lejs3271.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb65ae75d160e8df27682d7a24ddeb82a946d36)

Again look at the 06/30 expiry with the unusally high oi. 1.1 million oi on 06/30 which is INSANELY HIGH for any expiry let alone a weekly. And at this expiry the call oi is 80% and the put oi is 19% which is the opposite of what was observed with SPY. 

Now, normal wsb retards have no idea of basel 3 and the effects on the precious metals market. The high oi and call oi on june 30 on $SLV can't be attributed to wsb retards who hate silver. It's most likely the smart money coming into play. 

Spy has a high put/call ratio while silver has a high call/put ratio on that expiry. Similar values on QQQ and GLD respectively. This points to a scenario where silver moons and spy drills.

Take note that june 28 has a lot of other regulations coming into place as well and there can be other huge moves in the market in other sectors due to the different regulations.

A lot of wsb thought the silver squeeze movement was a conspiracy by the banks but look up the data by yourself if you aren't convinced by this dd."

2021-05-30 00:22:17,wallstreetbets,It has to break resistance at 12 first. I’m unsure that happens.
2021-05-29 20:48:41,wallstreetbets,how
2021-05-29 21:14:19,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-30 15:45:43,wallstreetbets,It's 1/3th the Marketcap of AMC. It's most definitely better than AMC.
2021-05-29 21:15:48,wallstreetbets,"FUD alert, also the fact that this is the top post in here says a lot

2021-05-30 11:48:17,wallstreetbets,I sold Friday my position 💯
2021-05-29 21:34:48,wallstreetbets,"This was heavily shorted last Friday and short shares available turned zero. That means short hedges will not have any shares to shorts next week. They will need to buy back those shares and will drive up the price. Also, great indicator is put to call ratio is so low meaning more call options are there betting the stock will rise"
2021-05-30 08:53:38,wallstreetbets,congratz and fuck you

2021-05-30 11:56:58,wallstreetbets,Yoda?
2021-05-30 18:48:14,wallstreetbets,Don't give me hope again lmao sold at 8.52 and tempted to jump back in.
2021-05-30 09:56:16,wallstreetbets,Should I really buy it on monday if it's still 10$? I sold my AMC shares right before the squeeze and I got really frustrated and because of that I bought them again at 30$ and sold them 28$. My 2 stupidest decisions in one week. I lost a big amount of profit because I sold all my shares from AMC in Monday last week and maybe I can still recover smth from BB.
2021-05-30 09:12:28,wallstreetbets,💯🙏🏻
2021-05-29 20:41:11,wallstreetbets,Monday is a holiday.

2021-05-29 23:13:29,wallstreetbets,I liked the odds of it getting pushed to 300 better than 220 Friday too. It was a decent gamble...just didn't pan out somebody wanted it no where near 250
2021-05-29 23:58:17,wallstreetbets,Ballsy move with 7k. Same day expiration would make me quiver. Bravo mate.
2021-05-30 07:43:15,wallstreetbets,I'm just saying you can do better
2021-05-29 20:03:29,wallstreetbets,How many times you gonna post this bro?

2021-05-29 21:06:07,wallstreetbets,"No balls, no babies. 🚀"

2021-05-30 08:03:47,wallstreetbets,Aiming for bankruptcy next time. Hopefully it’s worthy of sharing.

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Really need a big move from BB 
2021-05-29 20:13:53,wallstreetbets,BB is next week friend
2021-05-29 20:11:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding my 42,000 shares until $150+. Let's get this party started."
2021-05-29 20:58:19,wallstreetbets,I cry everytime I see another RH screenshot.
2021-05-29 20:18:56,wallstreetbets,I will buy more BB on Tuesday
2021-05-29 20:20:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking to buy in to BB to help the cause.  It’s that old phone company, right?  That doesn’t make phones anymore ... but does lasers, or video games, or EVs or some other shit.  Whatever."
2021-05-29 21:53:13,wallstreetbets,$25 by Friday
2021-05-30 00:17:43,wallstreetbets,BB to the moon next week🚀
2021-05-30 00:32:17,wallstreetbets,"$BB comparison to Jan - courtesy of Gabriel over on yahoo chat
“Please check  chart patterns around  Jan 15 and May 28, it's similar in volume and price.  even  Jan 19 and May 31 both are holiday  it's  immortal guiding Kindle on May 28 and much better that than Jan15. I believe  BB will rocket to the Mars soon.”"
2021-05-30 12:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Very bullish on BB but please, for the love of god get off of RH!"
2021-05-30 12:43:13,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.


5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

TLDR BUY BB SHARES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Position: 25k at 10$"

2021-05-29 21:45:42,wallstreetbets,You are correct in the thought direction - a they did do phones and now do something techie as opposed to animal husbandry or something.
2021-05-30 00:45:36,wallstreetbets,you like to pick up pennies in front of a stream roller. A man of culture.
2021-05-30 09:22:13,wallstreetbets,I’d  rather wait for it to spike then sell deep ITM calls a month out. ESP if it spikes over 100%. If it spikes less than that it’ll be otm. That’s my retarded idea
2021-05-29 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,I’m literally in at $27 CAD from its first spike. I would kill for anything above break even at this point haha. BB TO THE MOON.
2021-05-30 13:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Well,  AMC and GME came back for me. I'm sure BB will too."
2021-05-30 00:05:41,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine. Even if it heads back to 9 you'll see 10 in short order.
2021-05-30 00:04:46,wallstreetbets,I blame that on the lead up to the long weekend. I feel like that sucked the momentum out of everything. Hopefully it all picks back up on Tuesday.
2021-05-29 22:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Dang, close to doubling up. When did you buy?"
2021-05-30 01:18:44,wallstreetbets,Yea $50-$70 per share seems like a good area

2021-05-30 13:16:52,wallstreetbets,Almost as good as my $19.50
2021-05-30 12:23:59,wallstreetbets,Well done 👏 👏
2021-05-30 11:57:34,wallstreetbets,Every bit counts! It is those little instances of missed opportunity that I like to take advantage of. It’s almost like I name my price and get paid until someone buys.
2021-05-30 02:24:28,wallstreetbets,It’s only a matter of when
2021-05-30 12:21:56,wallstreetbets,Poor guy. You'll go broke.
2021-05-30 01:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Between investopedia and youtube you should be able to figure out the process quickly. I only started investing in mid-Nov, got caught bag holding 700 PLTR shares at the end of November, by the 2nd week of December I was selling covered calls. It's a great strategy to use when the stock is trading sideways but if it starts to move quickly in either direction it could work against you."
2021-05-30 08:19:30,wallstreetbets,My man
2021-05-29 23:46:54,wallstreetbets,I hope but I’m pretty sure it’s gonna go down to 9 and trade around there for another month
2021-05-30 13:22:14,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Ape math
2021-05-30 11:58:54,wallstreetbets,"I think you missed the point I was making. Do you know what happens when the price exceeds your covered call? I hope those pennies are worth it.

2021-05-30 01:27:44,wallstreetbets,That’s a possibility but it just broke above its 85 day moving average and it’s forming the same trend like AMC and other shorted stocks. I think it’ll test $9 for a day or two and then it’ll start it’s epic run.
2021-05-30 10:12:07,wallstreetbets,What if he already double the first 100%
2021-05-30 16:51:16,wallstreetbets,You can if you believe hard enough.
2021-05-30 10:09:50,wallstreetbets,Hey leave him alone it’s pretty fucking good for a crackhead wizard
2021-05-30 00:53:37,wallstreetbets,Are you sure? [I've been working on it with PLTR](https://i.imgur.com/km7O3Nf.png). Only 12.25% more to go to.
2021-05-30 12:02:53,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I’m misunderstanding but I am perfectly okay selling my 100 shares at the strike price. 

If I have 100 BB shares at 10 avg. selling 12.50s to pick up some premium and sell at a 25% profit seems right up my alley. 

If it doesn’t quite hit 12.50 I’ll just adjust for the change and enjoy the premium right?"
2021-05-30 02:45:19,wallstreetbets,Time to load up by the sounds of it 😎

2021-05-29 22:38:42,wallstreetbets,Nice.  I did 1 day dte $27 fomo calls on Thursday afternoon.  Down %50 that night and then on Friday i sold at $36 for 4x.

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TSP: The best way to play self-driving today TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis?

Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. 

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Technical

Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. 

&#x200B;

Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Operational

With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.

&#x200B;

Why not Robotaxis: Business

The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.

&#x200B;

Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. 

&#x200B;

Why Trucking?

Why Trucking: Technical

Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Operational

Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.

&#x200B;

Why Trucking: Business

There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). 

&#x200B;

Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.

&#x200B;

In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.

&#x200B;

Why TuSimple? 

The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.

&#x200B;

TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.

&#x200B;

TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. 

&#x200B;

But, but, aren’t they Chinese?

They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? 

&#x200B;

This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $8B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. 

&#x200B;

In other words: TSP to the moon, apes!

2021-05-29 21:44:07,wallstreetbets,"Interesting play. I'm personally waiting for some of the other big players to IPO. Aurora is partnered with Volvo (who historically have only ever put the safest shit possible in their cars) and are also focused on deploying trucks first. There's also ArgoAI, partnered with Ford and VW, literally the biggest automakers, and their tech seems *very* good. There's about to be a loooot of competitors in this space and I don't see where TSP has a big advantage... good luck, though!"

2021-05-30 00:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Risk/Reward. 

I expected 45k call options to be hedged and move the price up. Unfortunately ~1000 puts being exercised prevented that from happening.

Edit: target was 300 minimum, potential 350. Depending on what would happen I expected at least 115k, likely a hell of a lot more on volume."
2021-05-30 14:37:27,wallstreetbets,45k options being hedged on a strong meme stock week. Figured volume would move to GME on the call options. It woulda worked had 1000+ puts not been exercised.

2021-05-30 06:50:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes but also no. As a former 0DTE gambler, theta is at full max ruthlessness the closer it gets to 4 pm, destroying any or all extrinsic value. I've since graduated to rolling over calls by Wednesday at noon to the following week."
2021-05-30 02:42:24,wallstreetbets,"As theta is negligible? Dude, 0-dte (OTM) are completely extrinsic value that will be gone once the day ends. Theta is actually at its maximum on the day of expiration. It's rather all about gamma."

2021-05-29 20:06:39,wallstreetbets,I use flow algo but its shit when days are volatile in the morning. I day trade options that way. Also how I knew 2 million in roblox 105 strike August were bought at its low 60s I loaded tf up. That kind of money something is happening. Puts can be hedges so it depends but calls can be actually synthetic short so you have to be able to read into it to what makes sense. Obviously no one is hedging a long on AMC with 1 million no way lol

If they were not forced to cover when the stock hit $350 a couple months ago they're not going to be forced to cover now. Smart money hedges with out of the money calls, moves in and out to capture profit daily, and a lot of the current short interest is simply hedges against put contracts where the premium has already been paid.

All that said, who the fuck knows what the GME price is going to do from day to day. Look at AMC. It's a total POS company with 20% short interest but retail drove the price up 300%. Yes, they're going to be a lot of bag holders as a result and big money is not going to be forced to buy to cover at inflated prices. But guys who traded weekly $26-$30 calls that were like 2x out of the money at week start made millions last week... There is money to be made with strong movement and either of these stocks can move strong up or down based on the retail feeding frenzy and gamma effect from everyone having easy access to buying calls."
2021-05-29 23:03:27,wallstreetbets,"GME and all these other over-shorted stocks are literally a geopolitical play, fundamentals/TA/stats mean absolutely nothing. This market is almost entirely rigged and you just have to ensure that the side you're on that day has more power. Govt will probably put a cap on this craziness at some point, I think 1k/share is realistic. Tell the guys who got in at 483 that they doubled their money, be happy with it and go home."

2021-05-30 13:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Those are 3 of the ""greeks"", factors involved in the price of an option contract. 

Delta has to do with how the option price relates to the underlying share price. It tells you how much your option will gain in value if the underlying moves 1$. 

Delta doesn't stay constant throughout the life of an option contract, though. The way delta changes is the next greek gamma. If the underlying changes by 1$, gamma tells you how much the new delta will be. The closer an option is to expiration, the higher gamma is and thus the faster delta can change. 

Speaking of expiration, theta tells you how much value your option will lose over one day if all else stays the same."

I'd love to hear your reasoning on that.

2021-05-29 23:18:59,wallstreetbets,"It's possible, statistically, but it's a political decision at this point. Govt wants stability/predictability above all else in our economic system; all these huge moves undoubtedly involve a lot of risk to the system. Would not surprise me for govt to recognize that there are a ton of pissed off apes all around the world who will be ready to tear down the entire economic system if they don't get their payday; every day that goes by we learn more and more about the corruption that takes place, and we want our tendies. There has to be something going on with the Fed, people shorting treasuries, Citadel, Blackrock, etc. Will be interesting to see how it pays out. With that said, all the talk of 1 mil or 20 mil a share is just a massive waste of breath and gets annoying. People need to be realistic. 1k/share is a realistic payout to people."
2021-05-29 21:49:25,wallstreetbets,"“What happened in January won’t happen again” says the autist who missed the run up to $350 and the run up to $268.  Let me guess, you’re a bag holder?

2021-05-30 02:23:46,wallstreetbets,Theres definitely stuff going on behind the scenes. Funds arent really required to report short positions. Just look at what happened with AMC this week. Not organic. Prob close to 2 billion shares traded yet they said only like 200 mil shorts

2021-05-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC Volume Price Analysis   

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

&#x200B;

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target."

2021-05-30 01:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Another possible reason it touched $36 and came back is when you short, you need some reference point on the upside to base your risk off of. $36 is the LAST highest high at 36.13 set back on 3/23/2015! After that, it’s about guessing on whole $1 & $1/2 areas, ie 36.50, 36, 37.50, etc. Its a whole different game for them when there is no true resistance to base risk off of and only rely on these new levels!"

2021-05-30 10:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Great post I enjoyed reading it, learned some new things, I miss these types of posts on WSB.    
Any chance of a 'GME Volume Price Analysis' post?   

From what I gather from your post, seems like on the 30min chart GME ran up on higher volume and strong buying pressure to $240, saw some selling off down from $260, was retesting a $230 support on falling volume meaning many weren't selling at these prices, but then sold off some more on higher volume until close maybe due to long weekend uncertainty.    

Day chart shows Friday black candle with longer upper wick and lower close than previous day's candle which also had a longer upper wick. To me also looks like a ""bearish meeting lines candle"" as you put it.  

So good chance Tuesday there's testing of supply on falling volume and we consolidate for a while, and the uptrend may continue soon. 
Or there is more selling off and another candle with lower close and longer upper wick forms for then a 70% chance of trend reversal, and we have a pullback to find lower support and enter a longer period of consolidation. 
Seems it'll go down anyhow; with first scenario happening if falling volume, second scenario if volume picks up.  

Any opinions?
  
All this not taking in consideration whether any significant shorting is cause for selling pressure. As you say any bearish candle in the recent history of AMC is likely to be very short lived, and shorting based on bearish meeting lines is dangerous. Perhaps these bearish meeting lines followed by a quick reversal are the result of continued short term shorting and covering."

Is it going to tank on Tuesday after the holiday now?

What is going to happen next week?

I got paid yesterday fellow Apes (Friday 5/28).

I was not able to buy anymore shares of AMC because my check didn’t hit my account until after market close. 

Everything I have left over after bills is going right into AMC. 

I don’t want this to end, Apes. 

I don’t want us to look back on this opportunity and think, “What if…”

I have something to ask of you all…

We don’t each need to put in $1,000,000 to keep this trend moving the way we want. 

What if each one of us put in $1 on Tuesday?

What would happen?

Whether it’s $1, $5, $10 or $20, what would happen if we all put in whatever we could afford?

The transactions are all part of the algorithm that governs the momentum of the stock. 

I ask you all, fellow Apes, will you join me and keep this ride going the way we want and need it to go?

Please. 

Let’s not let this opportunity and momentum go to waste and don’t sell unless it’s a hardship.

If we do this together I think we can keep this going forever. 

Stay strong everyone.

Really Well done 👏 🤴!! 🦍 💪"
2021-05-30 02:19:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD
2021-05-29 20:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Many of you have good points but you really should understand the technicals and the role you and other play in this squeeze. Thank you for your analyst.

The most obvious choice for the big shorters is to Rollover their position for more time hoping to outlast the apes and hype to take less losses or when covering their short options are more favorable. We just have to hold the line and average up. I am not a professional and you should seek advise from a professional. Trading is extremely risky. My goal with any trade is to secure my initial investment. Scared money don't make money."

2021-05-30 02:30:30,wallstreetbets,Where's the TLDR?
2021-05-30 04:11:41,wallstreetbets,"You idiots need to stop pulling bullshit technical analysis from your ass. AMC will move when its fucking wants to. When you are not holding calls. When your calls expire worthless. Thats when this shit will skyrocket. Although, as most memes, this will sink down to $10 within a month first."
2021-05-30 05:47:40,wallstreetbets,Well then fuck my 10 AMC 26$ puts for next week..

2021-05-30 08:30:05,wallstreetbets,"500k is entirely possible if literally everyone who buys stock held on until that point. The chances of that happening though are far below the level of logical possibility. At the height of this thing though I do think we could potentially see close to $1000 for a short period of time, not for long thought and not if people paperhand (which they will)."

2021-05-30 09:11:35,wallstreetbets,Not selling amc
2021-05-30 09:43:20,wallstreetbets,So what is it expected to go to now in the squeeze? Will we see a similar drop off before it actually squeezes like with GME?

I hope I have the patience to not sell.  I've been doing the math. $100 a share would triple my profits to 13000, but $500 would get me closer to 69000.  

It just sounds too good to be true that this could happen. Hope."

2021-05-30 10:37:27,wallstreetbets,"Hey! Glad you liked my post! Actually, I was thinking of doing a GME post, but I’m waiting the breakout and retest to explain entry points. GME is still consolidating in its own HTF by the way, but we need a breakout to the upside to confirm the pattern. 

My personal opinion is that we will enter a small consolidation period at these prices. I believe market participants will want to test there is no heavy selling pressure at these prices to limit the upside movement.  We need more price action to establish this though. In markets, there is never a certainty of anything but only probabilities."
2021-05-30 06:07:49,wallstreetbets,This is categorically not true. The market was open when it hit the all time high.. do you want me to show you my sell order??? Don't spread misinformation...

2021-05-30 10:57:53,wallstreetbets,I’d really like to see this analysis on AMC500k. Where does this number come from. Who wrote this ?
2021-05-30 10:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Friday was a pretty good drop off the highs, like 35% from high to low. Thing is, every market is different so we cannot copy/paste GME price action to AMC. Best thing is to HOLD and don’t let the volatility make you panic sell."
2021-05-30 13:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Day trading extreme momentum stocks like this one is a great way to miss out on powerful rallies and panic buy at the tops. Unless you have a lot of experience day trading, I would buy and hold through the waves higher."

There's no short squeeze, short interest is fairly low, borrow rates are not bad. Maybe the roller coaster continues for a few more days? Or maybe it's already past the peak? No clue. Good luck!"

2021-05-30 08:55:02,wallstreetbets,"There is so much wrong with this. Your whole post in general is basically correct but it’s like you accidentally got there despite having all the details wrong.

>however, to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts 

Those aren’t 2 different ways of covering shorts. One is covering and the other is just shorting more to kick the can down the road. They did the latter.

>or borrow more shorts form the brokerage

Shorts aren’t borrowed from the brokerage. A brokerage is a middle man. Shorts are borrowed shares. They are borrowed from share owners.

>because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe

A company cannot tell anyone what to do with their shares. AMC doesn’t and can’t make anyone cover their shorts. The lenders of the shorts are the only entity that can do that."

2021-05-30 07:29:54,wallstreetbets,What do you think it will fall down to after the big sell off? And what will it potentially go up to after the collapse? Should you buy first thing Monday or wait till the drop?
2021-05-30 08:32:07,wallstreetbets,Just pray to god they don’t declare bankruptcy and just abandon the market all together. Then just about anyone invested in the stock market in general will be a bag holder
2021-05-30 12:16:13,wallstreetbets,I don’t know that answer. But I would say buy the dips.
2021-05-30 01:57:24,wallstreetbets,I’m a total noob. Can you briefly explain how the volume and price will tell you when to sell?
2021-05-30 07:31:39,wallstreetbets,Yo where the fuck do you get that call to sell? Lol

2021-05-30 10:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Maybe...somehow. Buuuut nobody knows when the actual squeeze goes on.
I think it's important that apes hold as many shares as possible when it happens. Used to have 160 shares, approx $8/share. At the top on Friday I sold 60 of them for $35. 
Will buy back around 100 on Monday with that money.
 So I end up with 200 shares. More than I had before, without spending extra money. 
Seems like a good tactic to me ( not having the money to just buy buy buy all the fuckin time)...
But what do I know... I'm just a damn dirty 🦧 ... Head filled with crazy dreams"

2021-05-30 01:04:25,wallstreetbets,Citadel isn't reporting the shorted AMC shares like they did GME. It's massive. Last estimation of shorts in March was over 2Billion short. 400%of the float. Naked through RH and off the books through IOUs
2021-05-30 01:06:52,wallstreetbets,It's a lie. If they sell you a share and they don't report it as a sale in the market then it's a loophole in the rules that can only be done by a market maker like Citadel. Just like a bank selling you paper silver. They don't actually have the silver.
2021-05-30 10:37:11,wallstreetbets,Two words **Pelosis husband** bought in a couple of weeks ago. That confirmed my suspicions that this AMC thing was real.
2021-05-30 09:25:10,wallstreetbets,"That 20% is the reported short interest, The real number is higher than that."
2021-05-30 09:21:15,wallstreetbets,Synthetics or not we are going to have a squeeze you retard. We just went up 115%(putting pressure on short positions) last week alone and the amount of retail and institutional ownership is huge. How about you do some actual research before opening your mouth.

2021-05-30 14:24:56,wallstreetbets,Yep. Hence the price had to be under it. I am going to bet that 40 is the magic number next week to be under.

2021-05-30 12:17:56,wallstreetbets,there are going to be multiple peaks and dips of over 100% so i would buy afer you see a massive sell off of over like 70%
2021-05-30 11:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Really hard to be brief. We want to see divergence in Wyckoff’s law of supply/demand and effort/result. Also, we want to see signs of a distribution phase.

2021-05-30 16:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Here's what I would do okay, because actually I think GameStop is the better play out of the two, but since you're insisting on AMC here's what I would do, and this isn't legal advice at all, nor is it financial advice in any way, I would flip a coin and every time I get heads I would buy 5% of my money into the stock then wait 2 hours and check again. That way if there's a particularly deep drop in price I can increase how much money I put in, effectively sampling the entire dip and ensuring that it get a good median price, with some control over the value. 

Whatever you do good luck."
2021-05-30 10:55:15,wallstreetbets,lol will probably go $60-$70 atleast
2021-05-29 22:47:17,wallstreetbets,"Well, I think AMC can't do the exact same thing because it wasn't as heavily shorted as GME. But I'm just a simple ape, so there's that..."

They already lost a billion on AMC- that doesn’t scream market manipulation to me, it shows they tried the exact same thing they did with GME and are getting fucked by it. They really don’t understand the ape mentality and I believe they fully expected us to abandon the stock market back in February/March  after the  GME business was over"

2021-05-30 02:36:08,wallstreetbets,First stock I ever bought was GME last year randomly before the holidays bought $800 worth and sold because I was switching accounts off of ROBINHOOD than never rebought and it boomed I’m bitter to say the least but I purchased $800 worth of AMC at $10 a share so hoping this booms as well but man it’s a shame seeing the GME investors bash AMC like we can’t all eat together!!! Not a fan of the negativity we should all be on the same team cmon apes!!

2021-05-29 20:28:59,wallstreetbets,You guys gotta realize that AMC is easier to recruit new investors. GameStop gives new apes price sticker shock. Those hating on AMC don’t realize AMC could be a gateway drug to future GameStop holders. It’s easier for me to talk someone into risking 30.00 bucks than 300.00 when they live paycheck paycheck.

2021-05-29 20:00:41,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀🐵THIS IS AN INVESTMENT APES🐵🚀🚀
Let me explain something real quick that everyone needs to get behind if this is going to work. This is an investment in a business which can 🚀 regardless of our level of support. We have an opportunity here to make history & make this company really takeoff just  like Tesla & Amazon🚀. So here is the important thing to remember. Stay in, no matter what. Even after you hit your goal. Stay in. (You might regret it later) Let me explain why: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀m.h🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Say you get into AMC and plan to buy some thing with your CASH. Let’s say it’s a Tesla for god sake, if this stock hits $100 in value, & you think that’s a good chunk & get nervous & you pull out, then it all avalanches, everyone pulls out. And all this fails. Now say it hits $1000  in value, & you pull out, then it avalanches, then everyone pulls out, & It all fails . Now let’s say we all stay until it’s well into 1k(like Tesla), 2k(like google), 3K(like Amazon) and beyond  (Berkshire Hathaway) 400k 🚀. You pull out a fraction, and you have what you wanted) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY the stock stays strong, and we all win.
Control APES 🐵. Patients APES 🐵. We all chip in, we all stay patient, it’s no longer a meme or a gimmick. It gains legitimacy AS MORE TIME PASSES, other investors develop confidence in it. You get what you want and more, but that means staying in even if you’re sweating bullets and pay out looks sweet. Godspeed everyone. Let’s get rich together. And let’s get our kids rich as well. (Just imagine if AMC got into the streaming service 2-3 years from now) 
(P.S : TESLA was also shorted and squeezed to the moon 🚀🌙 ) Now look at him.......he’s actually going past the MOON. Pun intended."

Eventually, no monkey tries anymore. Then a new monkey is put into the room with the older monkeys. The new monkey goes for the banana but all the other monkeys tackle and beat the hell out of the new monkey for even trying.

2021-05-29 22:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Saturday AM Update: Any major studio executive who is out to prove that the theatrical business doesn’t work can rip up that presentation they had planned for next week about projected streaming revenues.

Because this weekend, the domestic box office finally came back, and no, it wasn’t with Tenet or a movie that’s being released on streaming day-and-date with theatrical.

Paramount’s A Quiet Place Part II is crushing it, having grossed $19.3M yesterday, including $4.8M 
Thursday night previews, for what it looking like a $47.5M 3-day, $57.4M 4-day opening at 3,726 theaters for a $15,4K theater average. That’s a number which isn’t too far from the $60M which the John Krasinski-directed sequel was expected to do in its 3-day opening pre-pandemic! 
 A Quiet Place Part II‘s money is being earned on a pure, unadulterated 45-day theatrical window. The sequel will hit Paramount+ after that time frame."

2021-05-29 20:21:01,wallstreetbets,That’s a silly question it’s at $26 right now and will be on Tuesday it’s gonna go down some but eventually go up higher so you make money so it’s a no brainer of course you can lose it but if you get in now you prolly won’t.....this is not financial advice

2021-05-30 08:15:27,wallstreetbets,100 plus is realistic just based on hype alone- whether it sees an immediate sharp dip afterwards or gets to GME numbers is anyone’s guess though
2021-05-30 17:22:55,wallstreetbets,Ive done that this year. Its awesome.
2021-05-30 10:12:19,wallstreetbets,Don't lie! You're gonna do that as soon as amc goes to 50$ 🤣🤣

2021-05-30 05:09:05,wallstreetbets,AMC - my main focus! This is indeed a once in a lifetime opportunity! Never gonna give it up!
2021-05-30 08:21:50,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Hype alone will propel it to $50 plus on Tuesday- then the sell off happens and it dips until the squeeze occurs and it rockets

 Arent you all diamond hands that believes on RC's vision and long term plan of gme, and not the price? That's the sentiment thrown around with gme holders, the price shouldn't matter if you want to expose the corruption of the stock market.👀"
2021-05-30 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Why do you say its nowhere near. I wont lie i only did partial DD on GME but have done extensive research on AMC so im curious to put both DD side by side. I really think after GME spiked HF's suppressed AMC more creating more synthetics and since they kept the price low retail has purchased alot more synthetics than GME, where GME gamma'd early and purchasing GME could appear more of a gamble for new investors at such an extreme price. Not only that, the movie industry is drawing more attention to AMC. 

AMC is buying up billboards and flight paths to advertise AMC. Why is AMC nowhere near? I really think AMC is too deep in synthetics to lose to the short positions once the truth is uncovered. Yes DFV has $30M+ invested but as a collective and the fact ppl can relate to movie theatres....Save AMC rolls off the tongue as good if not more. Im not against GME I just see it as an equal not the lesser at this stage."

2021-05-29 22:08:17,wallstreetbets,Why cant we all accept that we are fucking the hedges together and they will have to pay up regardless. Amc cost them over a billion dollars alone so don’t down play our power. Why you think GME and AMC made the headlines together.
2021-05-30 05:57:37,wallstreetbets,I’m curious to hear why you believe AMC is more of a distraction and will be a controlled squeeze.
2021-05-29 21:08:07,wallstreetbets,I'm down to double my money $25 to $50 and reinvest into GME. AMC short interest is a lot less than GME.
2021-05-30 10:49:25,wallstreetbets,Why because you own gme and not amc. Amc has out performed gme for months.

2021-05-30 09:21:28,wallstreetbets,Nice to hear:) but as I said. I like both amc and gme and I’m in both. I think if amc squeezes gme will aswell at almost the same Time

2021-05-30 04:55:45,wallstreetbets,I was looking all those breakout dates for GME in January too. The Market was closed Monday 1/18 on MLK day just like this week for Memorial Day. Coincidence? AMC to $60 by Friday 6/4 and $150 by Close in Tuesday 6/8. Buy it now while it’s cheap.

2021-05-29 20:29:16,wallstreetbets,All I want to know is how many true apes are buying GameStop and AMC after this long weekend.

2021-05-29 22:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Was Friday the end of the AMC up trend?

Is it going to tank on Tuesday after the holiday now?

What is going to happen next week?

I got paid yesterday fellow Apes (Friday 5/28).

I was not able to buy anymore shares of AMC because my check didn’t hit my account until after market close. 

Everything I have left over after bills is going right into AMC. 

I don’t want this to end, Apes. 

I don’t want us to look back on this opportunity and think, “What if…”

I have something to ask of you all…

We don’t each need to put in $1,000,000 to keep this trend moving the way we want. 

What if each one of us put in $1 on Tuesday?

What would happen?

Whether it’s $1, $5, $10 or $20, what would happen if we all put in whatever we could afford?

The transactions are all part of the algorithm that governs the momentum of the stock. 

I ask you all, fellow Apes, will you join me and keep this ride going the way we want and need it to go?

Please. 

Let’s not let this opportunity and momentum go to waste and don’t sell unless it’s a hardship.

If we do this together I think we can keep this going forever. 

Stay strong everyone. 

👍✊💎🚀✌️"

2021-05-29 20:29:05,wallstreetbets,AMC has a gap to fill when it jumped from $12 to $17 on daily chart.  Just a heads up!  Gaps get field will it fill by dropping back down then off to races?

2021-05-29 20:44:14,wallstreetbets,Has anyone been able to count the people that were in the GME squeeze in January vs how many people are in the AMC/GME squeeze now? Has the movement doubled or 100x?

2021-05-30 01:09:53,wallstreetbets,"I'll wait for bams updated model tomorrow or Monday, but his last one showed weakness and a flat outlook for next week. Hopefully something changed on his model since Thursday since his model has been very reliable so far."
2021-05-30 01:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Can someone compare the numbers from GME on Jan 27th to AMC today? This would perhaps give us some indicators on what to expect, it would be nice to see 350-450 a share like GME did. I made a small fortune that day. Haha!"
2021-05-30 01:46:05,wallstreetbets,I like macaroni and cheese.
2021-05-30 02:53:20,wallstreetbets,I love how the comments are all about coke and no one is mentioning the TA 🤣

2021-05-30 04:28:16,wallstreetbets,Cocaine is awful but holy crap does it smell nice
2021-05-30 05:45:19,wallstreetbets,Except AMC has already reached 73% of GMEs Marketcap. I don't think there will be any squeeze if GME does not move any higher.
2021-05-30 06:18:10,wallstreetbets,Praying your analysis is spot on. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)

2021-05-30 10:37:53,wallstreetbets,Friday was the prime time for a squeeze but it didnt materialize. I think AMC tops there already.

2021-05-30 10:45:13,wallstreetbets,I’m going to hold GME to the fucking moon because worst case scenario I’m still just an ape and best case scenario I’m Jeff Bezos’s wife landing on the moon

2021-05-30 18:06:46,wallstreetbets,did you bother to look at market cap after all those fantasizing? I would say apes total liquid is around 15-20B according to GME spike.

Not even close. They haven't covered almost any shorts"

2021-05-30 19:56:46,wallstreetbets,I can see cocaine and hookers in sight!
2021-05-30 10:51:02,wallstreetbets,I think you’re a week too late on GME comparisons. Move GME a week ahead and that’s where we’re at now
2021-05-29 21:04:32,wallstreetbets,People still talk about AMC?
2021-05-30 02:22:56,wallstreetbets,"What‘s my next YOLO after making a killing with GME?

My next YOLO candidate is MAXR, also believed to face bankruptcy no too long ago, however, lately is rebounding and probably in November this year it‘s gonna take off. Dropping more than 40% from this year‘s high, here is your chance to get in cheap. Do your DD! This is not investment advice!"
2021-05-30 02:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Hedgefunds gameplan : crash AMC so jockboys get rekt, dump gme at the same time, pretend it's all natural.

2021-05-30 01:17:31,wallstreetbets,Based on what? And why wouldn't you have a position if your think this?
2021-05-29 20:16:18,wallstreetbets,I’m looking to drop like 200$ when should I do it?
2021-05-29 20:24:00,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling it will drop like a rock...last time during the GME fiasco the hedge fund had three long weekends to think or a solution to drop the price down and they did it. Same three day weekend this time during the AMC rally. Hope I’m wrong. I’m in AMC heavy.
2021-05-29 21:24:18,wallstreetbets,"I really wonder what's going to happen this winter when all of the U.S. is (should be I imagine) completely reopened and the theaters can pack everyone in *and* the blockbusters that have been held back (e.g. Top Gun II) are released *on top of* the usual slew of Christmas-time releases.  I would imagine AMC and other similar theaters are going to be raking it in and this should affect the share price.

Thoughts?"
2021-05-30 00:36:47,wallstreetbets,Not too late to redeem your paperhands!
2021-05-29 20:31:19,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I’m cheap, or just poor, but it’s so hard for me to justify averaging up. Dumb ape"

2021-05-30 09:09:56,wallstreetbets,Its had two gamma squeezes I thought?
2021-05-30 15:10:23,wallstreetbets,Reality exists whether you like it or not.
2021-05-29 23:40:54,wallstreetbets,it was a squeeze..and it'll squeeze again
2021-05-30 01:21:43,wallstreetbets,Remember that time when the price went up 40x in a month?

2021-05-29 20:16:48,wallstreetbets,"AMC Also has legitimacy to their rise because movie theaters are opening up.

wish I had bought in more when it dipped to 9 after I bought at 13.90 a while back."
2021-05-29 20:23:54,wallstreetbets,Doesnt matter. Most retail traders are still on RH so if they get shut down the squeeze momentum gets killed anyway
2021-05-30 00:39:28,wallstreetbets,Cashed all my $$$ out of RH Friday morning now I have to wait in order to transfer tired of their 🤬
2021-05-30 14:01:49,wallstreetbets,"I haven't heard this mentioned elsewhere yet, but when GME was squeezing that day I attempted to buy shares on my Ally account and it automatically froze my account that very instant and I couldn't access it for 2 days... I was on the phone for over 2 hours twice with no help... There was no way to speak to anybody so they essentially held my account hostage... otherwise it was working fine before that. I did file a report with the State about my issue and they have been in contact with me a couple times since. 
The moment I finally spoke with someone on the phone, is the exact moment that everything was 'working fine' again. Those POS!"

2021-05-30 12:38:00,wallstreetbets,I have 1k ready to go into AMC on Tuesday. And then I will hold the line. Gonna have 2k total invested and wont sell until it moons. Now who is with me?! Let's go!!!
2021-05-29 22:35:20,wallstreetbets,Same here
2021-05-30 01:11:19,wallstreetbets,I think you'll be good.  $50 by the 2nd.
2021-05-30 02:58:38,wallstreetbets,They where caught off guard with AMC as well. They have just been doubling down on shorting since January. it won’t follow GME to a tee. It might just explode upwards even harder because of this
2021-05-29 20:55:51,wallstreetbets,I'm buying some for breakfast lunch and dinner.
2021-05-30 01:00:46,wallstreetbets,"Not saying I endorse the squeeze thesis but every short has a margin limit at some point where they can I'll be forced to cover. The Clearinghouses can't allow massive positions with no collateral to back them up for very long.

Also AMC has a streaming service but it's not very competitive with the dozen established options already out there"
2021-05-29 22:40:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think people are glossing over this fact
2021-05-30 03:59:02,wallstreetbets,What's the short interest?
2021-05-30 02:26:11,wallstreetbets,Lol which magic fucking hat are you pulling these numbers from
2021-05-29 21:52:22,wallstreetbets,"Oof, your buying AMC? A fool is born everyday"
2021-05-29 20:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Even if so, it’s not worth $25/share let alone $40,$50,$100. But what do I know."
2021-05-29 20:29:43,wallstreetbets,"Was $10 high before? $15? $18? 
What about GME? It was a $4 stock, was $10 high? $20? $50? $100? $150? It went bazooka to $500 at one point.

It’s not a bad idea to chase the highs if it goes higher. But sure is risky af though."
2021-05-30 04:27:08,wallstreetbets,Bullish
2021-05-30 11:00:36,wallstreetbets,This isn’t a theory you just picked random dates and percentages and pressed enter
2021-05-29 21:59:37,wallstreetbets,I got in around $9 and sold most of it around $24. Hard to be upset about 2.5x my money in 3 months... Still holding a small handful of shares just to see what happens but I don't care if it crashes now. Just free money if it keeps going up but I won't lose much if it doesn't.
2021-05-29 20:16:08,wallstreetbets,"I never tried it. Saw so many good people change, you can see it in their eyes and much more. I do not have more control than them I just got lucky."
2021-05-29 20:20:31,wallstreetbets,The time to buy is now. Not financial advice. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.
2021-05-30 10:31:49,wallstreetbets,"I remember looking at the members of WSB right after they were on the news and seeing it jump from a couple thousand to 1.5 million.... 

Thought that many people overnight was pretty much the death of my favorite sub... 

""Now it's squeeze all the money out of these billion dollar hedge funds, they can't and indict us all"" 

i think last time I looked at the number of members there was nearly 10,000,000?

2021-05-30 01:12:02,wallstreetbets,"AMC float is over 6x more, so has to be way more peeps"

Edit in case the winky wasn't clear:  Market is closed monday.  Is a joke"

2021-05-29 20:23:49,wallstreetbets,I’m not addicted to coke….I just really like the smell.
2021-05-29 22:26:38,wallstreetbets,I could have 1000000000 dollars and coke would still be hard to find. I’ll have to rely on my hookers.

2021-05-29 20:13:12,wallstreetbets,There’s over hundreds of millions of individual investors. You’d be surprised what even capturing 10-15% of that could do if focused onto one stock.
2021-05-29 20:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC isn't company that's worth 36$. And everone knows it. It's a game for big players who will short it first, and when it will fall. Yea they can wait to see if it goes up, but they can wait too long and loose milions.   


Imagine you have 5 players, each has 100 000 stocks in AMC, till it goes up everyone is happy, and they want for it to go up as long as they can.  
But first one who will sell stock will get most money, cuz after that there could be panic in the market and price will drop, so other 4 with their 100 000 stocks will lose hundreds of thousends of profit by waiting too long and not selling first.  


See? It's a big game, and yea, they can tell each other not to sell. But can they trust eachother when there are literally milions of dollars and other players are their competition?  
And now add to this milions of smaller players like us,  hundreds of big players and ask yourself. Whill they wait too long and lose profits or will they rather sell first to gain most of it for themselfs?"

2021-05-30 10:25:30,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong. I want this too. But at this point, the 1st squeeze already happened. 

Just because the price is lower does not mean the stock is undervalued compared to another similar stock. You need to look at total (circulating) shares to find that out. AMC has more shares than GME. That is why the Marketcap of AMC is already 11B compared to the 15B of GME while the stock price does not come even near that of GME. 

Marketcap is a great indicator to find out if it can grow at the moment. New members don't get that and only look at the price tag. 

In short : now GME needs to jump up before AMC can move further up. ."

2021-05-29 20:45:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean some basic math tells me that you would lose wtvr the cost of the stock was (so 50 or 250 or 350 depending on when in January) minus the 5 dollars, plus wtvr interest you were paying. 
Considering interest went through the roof, I’m assuming there were some shorts who realized it was cheaper to gtfo in January than to hold and continue to get killed by interest. If we all realized the price wasn’t going back down to 5, you don’t think they did too? In January you could’ve gotten out for 250 bucks a share let’s say, today you still are paying that 250, but you’ve also paid 4 months of interest on borrowed shares. 
I’m fairly confident that most of the old shorts got out in January and February. And that there are a ton of new shorts who got in in the meantime."
2021-05-30 11:43:48,wallstreetbets,So.. what you're saying is... We need to get the press taking notice of the TSLA squeeze in order for my 10x $TSLA 06/04 630cs to have any chance of being profitable since their new car is not debusing next Friday?

2021-05-30 08:12:38,wallstreetbets,"Well first of all any price action in Jan when they cut off buying should not be referred to as the squeeze in any way. That was price movement based on demand from retail figuring out HF r fuk. When you refer to it like that it sounds like you’re purposefully trying to slip it in. So don’t do it.

Also IMHO leave GME and AMC separate. It’s fine if people believe in AMC but that stock is nowhere near the kind of situation GME is in. So when people reference GME to make a case for AMC I am also super sus as that is also a definite fud strategy for HF to distract gme holders or potential gme buyers."

2021-05-29 20:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they are a few months. I have been paying attention I just don't think it'll GME, there is a massive amount of mismanagement by AMC and screwing of retail investors and I don't think that will be changing."

2021-05-30 09:45:42,wallstreetbets,Coke doesn’t actually make you skinny for most people it just suppresses the appetite so they end up not eating for days. But that’s not the case for everyone hence why some people can be fat in spite of heavy cocaine use.

2021-05-30 02:47:02,wallstreetbets,Why would he bail out the shorts when they are trying to bankrupt his company. He will line his pockets even more if AMC squeezes than a payout from short sellers.
2021-05-29 23:05:27,wallstreetbets,"I see. I believe they are the same shorts+ more. With 140%+ SI, they would’ve had to buy back more than literally every single share in the float. It’s mathematically impossible that this could’ve happened based on the prices, charts, technicals, etc. they’ve had to short it more since then to keep the price down. They may have gotten out of some positions, but the majority are still there imo. Idk what you believe, but just some food for thought!"
2021-05-30 10:06:43,wallstreetbets,"well, he has been by issuing millions of shares for shorts to exit their positions before, then they just put them right back on it."
2021-05-30 01:08:37,wallstreetbets,"1. Shorts can cover and exit by buying expiring calls. I definitely believe the amount of exiting reported was a bluff but some exited this way.

2. People/institutions are buying, selling, and shorting at every price. Shorts are not a monolithic entity. It's not just Citron, Melvin and Citadel involved in this thing. Some absolutely got out. Many were shorting in the $40-$120 range. Some were shorting in the $120-$400 range and made profit on the way down.

I do think something fishy and corrupt is happening with GME. I also think a lot of WSB simplifies things to an extreme and refuses to believe anything that doesn't confirm it's hopes. Gotta be careful regardless."

Ton of comments discussing the business etc but if that actually mattered $jmia would be worth $5 still. Stop overthinking, if you think it’s a shitty play it’s probably going to double lol. Then you’ll be all in after it doubles. See you at $16."
2021-05-30 06:45:25,wallstreetbets,I don't wish any evil on anyone investing in the company. But there's no way I can bring myself to invest in a company that is a platform to sell such horrendous garbage.
2021-05-30 07:15:47,wallstreetbets,"not sure why all the hate on $WISH, i myself had a great experience buying little nick nacks, was pretty cheap in terms of price and actually was pleasedbby the quality. 

Way over sold and short interest has been increasing, its definately a wild right now but however longterm will look great. Logistics increasing massively, getting into fintech will also increase its outlook in terms of profitability, millions of user base, quality control and shipping time has been better too, wish local increasing, more types of products are being available as well. 

The current share price brings it market cap under 5bil which is ridiculous compared to its peers. Especially when its holding 2bil in cash. Amazon offered 10bil year ago, Lakers sponsorship, year over year growth, clearly undervalued and oversold. 

Once lockup period ends will be interesting, although I do get  why people see insider selling as negative, its pretty normal for new ipo to sell. Not because they don't believe in the company but because they have to. Look at the class shares, options they have, and many cases selling to offset taxes. In any case holding $WISH for years to come."

When this all went down last march, I looked up shale oil, realized OXY was headed straight to the dumpster (and CLR) and my first options play was to get puts on them.

Wish I had the loss porn for you guys, it was awful. Learned my first lesson in investing, don't fight the fed.

Buffett owns their debt. Blackrock owns their debt. The fed owns their debt.

They're not failing./capitalism or CCP?  


These heavily indebted companies are the reason why the fed and the govt are running inflation up. Next year, their debts will be 50% of what they are now, relative to everything else."

2021-05-29 20:28:05,wallstreetbets,I’m wondering if American semiconductor companies will benefit more from the shortage though. There’s a lot of talk about the US looking to increase US semiconductor production so we arnt so reliant on other countries. Pretty sure some sort of incentive / infrastructure plan is in place for this…

2021-05-29 20:19:33,wallstreetbets,"I like the idea but question the price target vertical integration is true. Intel is going into the contract manufacturing for semiconductors. Apple is vertically integrated. Samsung manufacturing from there own foundry’s. Long term contracts are in by Ford and other manufacturers in need. Not to mention Hp moving manufacturing to US for some of the lower end chips and low cost fpga,s can solve some of the shortage. TLDR TSMC UMC SMIC, NVIDA for arm play and Samsung (SSNLF)  price targets greater than 5% at end of year"
2021-05-29 20:53:47,wallstreetbets,Do not think so. Let’s see

2021-05-30 03:18:15,wallstreetbets,Definitely something to be concerned about but production of semiconductors is the key to their economy. With that being said I’m sure TSM is a top priority in the distribution of water and other resources. If the drought does get extremely serious and manufacturing is effected I’m willing to bet that receive assistance from other countries who rely on them for their semiconductors. I could be completely wrong but considering the circumstances and how key these semiconductors are for every countries economy I’m willing to take a chance on them.

2021-05-29 22:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I prefer Lam Research $LRCX for semiconductor stocks right now, not that i have done much research though.  It's better priced than TSM.  LRCX has p/e of 27x versus 160x for TSM."

2021-05-30 07:29:43,wallstreetbets,All the points are correct... but OP has neglected the fact that IT'S ALL PRICED IN.
2021-05-30 12:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Trains, sir, not trucks. 

The guy who drives a train is the conductor. The guy who helps is a semiconductor, kinda like a copilot."

2021-05-30 11:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Yup and like i said i just learned it yesterday the info is out there and its free dont buy into those get rich quick things our buy our style cuz at the end of the day following 10million ppl for free and what there doing is way more potential for gains and losses.. So start small or even on paper with a deal u would have done follow it and see how u would do before just doing the ""yolo"" thing im sure most of them ppl owned there homes but theres power in knowledge and i know if i had the money to pull the trigger on biontech when the vaccine with pfizer was announced i woulda reversed mortgaged my home had i owned one lol.. And trust me the hedges are all over this site so use your knowledge for u first then show the ppl after u made what u knew u could.. Cuz at the end of the day the hedges love the fruits of other ppls labor and now they make money for companies failing its backwords thinking in my opinion but if its out dated and another company kept advancing and growing we get things like the new tech money idk i tend to go on to much... Goodluck!"
2021-05-30 11:55:40,wallstreetbets,Goodluck! Investopidia idk if i spelled it right math is my strong suit lol but they let you read on how these different methods work learn them all and see what fits you and your thinking best..

2021-05-29 20:47:04,wallstreetbets,You guys and AMC. There’s soooo much more out there that can ring the bell louder than fuckin AMC. Looosers
2021-05-29 20:40:07,wallstreetbets,"ty, so many fucking shares that aren't the porn we want to see"
2021-05-30 02:45:39,wallstreetbets,I did $100k friday. If it opens around $25 you’d be joining millions of us.

2021-05-30 00:06:12,wallstreetbets,Not AMC
2021-05-30 11:18:14,wallstreetbets,Yea pretty sure ur a hedgefund short seller... Lmao
2021-05-30 01:42:05,wallstreetbets,I got some at 7.88 but over all I’m all over the place. My average is probably like 18.00 over all. I’ve learned a shit ton through this process
2021-05-29 20:13:03,wallstreetbets,Yes! Me too. I feel pretty smalltime compared to the people here but it's so great to learn what is practically a new language
2021-05-30 02:46:42,wallstreetbets,Hold ur shares or buy more if u can wall street is shorting the stock.. This means they borrow it and wait for it to fall then return it and keep the profits.. But a short squeeze is when we here force the stock up and they cant borrow those stocks forever so they have to return them at the now higher price which makes it go even higher.. Just trust the ppl and wait at least until you see something similar to what we saw premarket friday then sell 8min after opening if u just wanna do ur first gain and get some confidence then prepair cuz due to the vaccine amc will be up and running again within 6months and everyone will be going to the movies and getting out this is a long term hold to make the shorts cover they got billions invested in the failing of a company it almost goes against what Wall st u think used to want companies to grow but now they can make money off the success and failure of business which i think all of us feel is wrong so make em bleed and we make money! Good luck!
2021-05-29 20:42:58,wallstreetbets,Yes SNDL
2021-05-30 00:12:28,wallstreetbets,GTFOH
2021-05-30 02:55:18,wallstreetbets,He could be on to something people dont have enough money to get on the gamestop boat cuz at the end u want quantity of stocks and if you only got 500 or even 210$ lol lets them get shares and thats why i think amc took off it was so cheap so 10million ppl putting there money into it guarantee quick push up in the price which is why wall street now has 92million shorts up from 87 cuz if it falls any they make some back but dont have ppl switch money now stay with amc make them cober then we move to blackberry or someone might spot something better
2021-05-30 03:00:01,wallstreetbets,That man should be banned from shouting out companies he is making billions cuz he can force up or down almost all he is associated with Michael Burry actually just took a 530mill short position on tesla.
2021-05-30 03:05:52,wallstreetbets,"You have a ""call"" to be able to execute a trade over a period of time without ever having to buy it until it hits a price u expected it to but still being able to buy it at the price u made the ""call"" on 4months earlier or longer but these ppl are not wolf of wall street calling ppl using there money they have the money to execute the trade at anytime i just learned it today and thats about as basic as i can put it"
2021-05-30 03:22:29,wallstreetbets,That guy didnt lose by my math.. And if these lenders of the 95million shorted stock on AMC keep bleeding the hedge funds they will just cut there losses and walk 10million ppl with buying power they never had cuz we didn't ban together sooner actually there going to prolly try to change something and i feel it should be making money off of companies failing thats not what wall street was founded on.. The apes will win just hold and buy when u can especially when u see amc up 20% pre market friday
2021-05-30 04:13:22,wallstreetbets,Expiry?

2021-05-30 08:36:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I get it now.
2021-05-30 11:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Its all fun here im new and wish i would habe been apart of this sooner i thought u needed an invite or something.. It is crazy in here tho but theres alot ppl are teaching and sharing i just learned what a ""call"" option trade was and how it works yesterday and i think thats the way to go but you gotta do research and not commit on a high price to just go higher that would hurt but its got like a stop loss method to it that lets you cut the bleeding... Goodluck!"
2021-05-30 01:26:41,wallstreetbets,Stagnant money is pointless. Either pay down debt or invest every cent over 2 months salary.
2021-05-30 17:18:51,wallstreetbets,Let us see how you do i know how to do a call now but do i need a broker account or can retail investors get these what platform do you use as a suggestion?
2021-05-30 10:58:23,wallstreetbets,Not that i know of but i am for sure that after last weeks amc price rally the hedgefunds took a bigfer short position against the stock in order to help try to gain back some of there losses but we gotta hold our positions its just some ppl have so much money and have such big positions when it hits a all time high one seller can trigger a mass selling frennzy but after that typically they will get back in once they feel they can lebel it out and start pushing it up again... Good luck and just keep em threw till friday any day u see hudge premarket there will be a sell off about 10min after opening...goodluck and try to diversify...
2021-05-30 00:10:06,wallstreetbets,This is the way!

2021-05-30 11:41:32,wallstreetbets,I’ve been trading options since before it was cool. Take the time to really learn them as an investment tool. Most people on here use them like lottery tickets which is fine but they can be utilized in other ways to help hedge against loss and also incrementally increase gains. Good luck to you as well!
2021-05-30 16:07:47,wallstreetbets,Please teach me what you learned yesterday! I'm struggling as to the calls and puts etc. Thank you in advance.

2021-05-30 11:50:37,wallstreetbets,Cool well mayne you can share another layer do you know all the methods well these things really are set up like craps tables but im sure theres other methods too.. Investopidia seems to off free knowledge on what i seen were about 8 different types of ways to trade.. Do you think its a good site with good info? Also how dis you learn how to trade options a friend or course if you been doing it you know since it was a secret lol
2021-05-30 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,"So in what you see in the picture above is a ""call"" options trade. This is basically a agreement on a fixed price for the said stock. In that trade he agreed to buy the stock at .30cents a share but he doesnt have to buy that day. He can wait to execute the buy at anytime during the time frame agreed on. Which in the photo above is almost 1 yr exactly. Each day he gaines the computer knows what the break even price would be at the end of that day so since he already gained that much. The computer will sell if it has to inorder to make sure he doesnt loss what he has already gained. ""Stop the bleeding"" or stop loss. So if he traded friday we would net 33k but he all know its still going to go up so i dont think he sold cuz due to stop loss the computer will do the trade as he set it. Now lets get some gains pre-market for AMC Monday night Tuesday morning. Good luck i tried my best as i said i just learned it yesterday so i could have other variables i didnt take into account. But based off what i see in the data given i think i described it right."
2021-05-30 17:08:34,wallstreetbets,Also the movie theaters are opening again and summer is here so if AMC starts doing well while we hold this is a super squeeze!! Hold strong apes we let the company work now!! Also BUY MORE and hold!
2021-05-30 17:51:41,wallstreetbets,So you can execute a call option on robbin hood try getting something on ur home computer when u wana buy them 20sec lag time difference could mean 20c up or down... So im looking into fast internet with laptop to finally invest in my investment tool the computer and internet and the data... Goodluck buy and hold strong apes!
2021-05-29 23:21:18,wallstreetbets,This is some nice gain porn buddy. Considering the amount of people showing off their small gains from shares....I rather see option plays like these.

I think there is a lot of fear around shorted stocks right now, people seeing what HF's can do when they are dedicated to preventing a squeeze.

2021-05-29 20:24:30,wallstreetbets,You right but it was a risk I had to take...it was either invest with $200 I had available and gain a few hundred dollars and miss out on big profits or take a chance with 30k and turn it into 120k...that's why it's important to do your due diligence before investing
2021-05-30 19:44:06,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Also the share recount is only in USA and maybe Canada as well. I hope not too many are counting on this recount because i feel it wont be a catalyst whatsoever. There are so many people in Europe-asia alone then we got Australia and everyone else to consider.. i just dont see this recount doing much to help us rocket unless they go worldwide..  i have absolutely no doubts the squeeze is inevitable regardless of this recount but they will try to shake off the weak paperhands if this recount proves lackluster with media manipulation etc. And that will drag this out longer. We cannot put a date or catalyst to this as our catalyst is simply just buying and holding. Thats it. Im not selling til freakn' pluto no matter how long it takes and again i am convinced we'll eventually get there. I want all apes to be glorious i mean we own the company we know this and dont need any half azzed recount to prove squat what we need is patience  more than anything. Just my .02.

Speaking of AMC. since they keep saying 100k is realistic.

Apple Inc is worth 2.11T Amazon is worth 1.64T

If you’ve been selling and rebuying your meme stocks do yourself a favor and look up wash sales and how to avoid them. If you fucked up with this you might have to choose between diamond handing your bags and paying even more for doing so or paper handing before the end of the year for over 30 days to realize any loss sales for tax season.

After many minutes of brushing your hair with her fingers, as if you were somehow the victim in all of this, you look up at her and see her frowning at the sheets. You follow her gaze and find translucent wet spots from your tears, and red wet spots from her.

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

Anybody with even a high school level of science knowledge can know that electric won't work for those applications and that hydrogen isn't the answer because there's no hydrogen infrastructure built up. Furthermore, RNG is a carbon negative petrol that's made by capturing terrible methane that we're already creating and then turning it into something that's way less bad for the environment. It's not pulling gas out of the ground and converting it to something or turning coal into electricity.  It's literally just taking something we're already producing that's bad for us and turning it into petrol that's good for us. And we make a, excuse the pun, shit tonne of it as humans. RNG has to be part of the green energy future because it's the best thing we can do with all the methane from our landfills, our cattle ranches, our water treatment facilities and the like. Plus, like 3 weeks ago someone asked him about the same company and he was like oh they're OK.

If we weren't going to RNG, then Amazon wouldn't have made a 1.5 billion dollar deal with CLNE, Chevron, BP, Total, and Shell wouldn't have made partnerships with them, so on and so forth."

So if I were to have purchased the contract for $59 for 1 contract (100 shares) @ the strike price of $17, and sold the option when the share price was at $30, then I would be looking at $30 - $17 = $13, $13×100= $1300.

$1300 - $59 = $1241 profit? And probably some other fees?"

Depending on how quickly the stock price went to $30, your profit may be bigger.  The Greek Theta is time decay.  It eats into your profits as the contract draws closer to expiration.  I am still learning about the Greeks that influence options.  I’m sure there are others that can explain them far better than I can, but they are the reason in your example that the profit isn’t exactly $1,241."

2021-05-29 20:21:22,wallstreetbets,Buy BB before it shoot up
2021-05-30 12:44:20,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

TLDR BUY BB SHARES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-30 01:00:26,wallstreetbets,">We printed a ton more money than China did, that’s for damn sure.

Most of it was QE, so an exchange of liabilities for the Fed. How does this *directly* feed through to inflation? Or did you think the Treasury printed literal notes and gave them to people to spend?

>You check lumber prices recently? Or copper? Both doubled or tripled in the past 3 years. Not like the common man uses wood and copper in anything.

You're conflating what should be a temporary spike in prices with sustained increases in the price level. No one denies spikes in certain items have spiked recently, but they are the result of supply bottlenecks since inventories were run down last year (what could possibly be the reason for that hmm?). Lumber futures are already going down [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) , which is what happens when you have lots of unprocessed timber being processed at a faster rate due to the spike in lumber prices.

I don't doubt there's a possibility of a sustained inflation overshoot, but the nature of  higher recent inflation prints is already documented extensively that it's just disheartening to see people scream hyperinflation with prints still affected by last year's 0% for April through June."

2021-05-29 20:49:27,wallstreetbets,Facts
2021-05-29 21:21:32,wallstreetbets,"So basically if your shares don’t get called away by going ITM, you just keep your premiums and the shares?  I just sold my first CC that expired OTM so kept shares and premium, but wondered if there was something else to do?  As the stock was going higher, it looked like I sold the call for too cheap and I wasn’t sure if there was a way to capture that?"
2021-05-29 21:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Nothing else to do unless you want to buy the call back to close the position (for a profit or loss depending on how the stock has moved) which would ensure you keep your shares or allow you to resell the option again for more premium if it keeps going up. Generally speaking though, if you're selling CCs, you're just hoping they expire worthless (OTM) and you keep your shares and the premium."
2021-05-29 21:28:50,wallstreetbets,"Ok, great!  Thanks so much for confirming that.  I would have had to pay quite a bit to close it out, so I just waited it out and was happy to keep my shares in the end for a bit of premium. But I learned how it’s quite risky with these squeeze stocks that can soar through the target. Not sure it’s worth the premium! Thanks again!"
2021-05-29 21:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Yep I knew I was playing a risky game but i went 5 or so weeks successfully selling and made quite a bit of premium. Based on Friday close price, I only missed out on ~$1600 profit in share price which i had more than made back in premium already."
2021-05-29 21:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I can also see how it could work out pretty well too!  Especially since I bought several calls myself that expired worthless. Someone made money on my past buys!  Glad yours worked out ok (or at least not too bad).  Everything has risk/reward."

Well it dropped ok no problem we bought it for a reason don’t get fooled oh I bought another 500 shares at 26.20 i now have 3500 shares or selling 

Anyway now my story I made a couple  million on Shopify I bought 2600 shares at 30$ per share
It went to 180$ per share I still held because I bought it for a reason well an analyst came out with news rhat they were cooking the books the stock dropped to I think it was 100$ I held my 2600 shares now granted I’m still up on the money but I thought it would moon
Look at Shopify today if I would have sole and had paper hands I would not have a couple million I would have made a few thousand
Now I bought AMC for a reason that reason is still there

Not only does it have more short interest than AMC and GME, but it can be bought at prices it traded for below the pandemic. They will be selling their product at Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in China.   As a reopening stock with growth opportunities it could get a little squeeze action with just natural growth.   
Not to mention more people are moving into plant based diets.   
After Cramer mentioned it the company will probably get even more action."

2021-05-30 18:12:53,wallstreetbets,"ET looks like a good investment. Low PE and good dividend. Options are cheap. Should keep rising. Bit slow for meme stock tho.

SWN looks ready jump higher. Depends on them getting their costs under control.

The whole sector looks nice to me ATM."

2021-05-29 20:10:12,wallstreetbets,"The strikes are a bit low on the options granted to Continenza ($3.03, $4.53, $6.03, $12.00). Although I still agree with your assessment that this is a decent long shot play"
2021-05-29 20:16:52,wallstreetbets,I think some of the options are historical from the beginning of his tenure in 2019.
2021-05-29 20:30:50,wallstreetbets,"From the proxy: ""On July 27, 2020, Mr. Continenza received a grant of a stock option under our Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan) to purchase up to 1,750,000 shares."" Seems like they were granted in 2020"
2021-05-29 20:41:19,wallstreetbets,"I will have to read through this again. I seem to recall at the time reading it as he was granted some but not all. 

They have recalculated his current entitlement (adjusted for dilution) to be 11million shares. Upon conversion of $100,000,000 worth of notes to equity (which converts at $14).

So while his strikes are low, he still cannot exercise until the above milestone. I'm assuming this was a condition of the investors.

Let me know if you think I have misinterpreted this."
2021-05-29 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they haven't all vested yet:

""The exercise price of each tranche was above the closing price of our stock of $2.62 on the date of grant. The stock option vests as follows: 28.57% of each tranche was immediately vested upon grant, and the remaining 71.43% of each tranche vests upon the conversion of $100,000,000 of our outstanding 5% Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due 2021 (the Notes). In the event a portion of the Notes is converted, a corresponding pro rata portion of the 71.43% of each tranche will vest. In addition, if any of the Notes is repaid or otherwise extinguished without being converted, a corresponding pro rata portion of the 71.43% of each tranche will be forfeited upon such repayment. The stock option expires on February 19, 2026.  
  
The purpose of the grant was to protect Mr. Continenza from the economic dilution attributable to the issuance of the Notes, which affected the value of the options granted upon his becoming Executive Chairman of the Company (the Original Grant). This stock option has the same exercise prices and term as the Original Grant and was generally designed to put Mr. Continenza in the same economic position he would have been in had the Notes been repaid instead of converted into common stock.  
  
The stock option vested with respect to 471,405 shares (28.57% of each tranche) at the time of grant on July 27, 2020. The stock option vested with respect to an additional 1,119,665 shares (67.86% of each tranche) upon the conversion of 95% of the Notes on July 29, 2020, and the stock option vested with respect to the remaining 58,930 shares (3.57% of each tranche) upon the conversion of the remaining 5% of the Notes on September 30, 2020."""
2021-05-29 20:56:53,wallstreetbets,This is the perfect play for long expiration options.
2021-05-29 20:01:10,wallstreetbets,$AMC $GME
2021-05-30 09:10:25,wallstreetbets,Please think about what you just said
2021-05-29 22:08:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah well theres no business class on Virgin Galatic.
2021-05-29 22:35:45,wallstreetbets,I think I see what your getting at but it makes no sense cause airlines have first class too.
2021-05-29 22:40:21,wallstreetbets,Tons of influential and rich people have died in a plane crash pretty sure helicopters are still around even though Kobe died in one. Cars kill more people in a day than virgin galactic will in 50 years.
2021-05-30 00:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Ok but you are missing the point.  People need to travel on airlines for business.  Outside of astronauts nobody has any business in space.

Theres currently no need to goto space other than leisure.  So if it gets perceived as being dangerous then its a dead industry.  We've suffered 2 catastrophic failures in the last 35-40 years of Space Travel which if you hack out the fact we havent had a shuttle program in what 15 years is really 2 failures in a 20 year stretch where there were like 5-6 launches a year.  Thats a huge failure rate maybe what SpaceX and Virgin are doing is safer but its still the same concept with same inherent risks."
2021-05-30 00:50:26,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure very few are flying for business in the last year and it’s probably never gonna come back all the way so all the airlines have right now and the foreseeable future is leisure. Virgin has and will have business as well with contracts.
2021-05-30 00:54:27,wallstreetbets,Plus if they do supersonic travel they will take any business travel the airlines have left
2021-05-30 04:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Oh is that what happened with Brititsh Airways, Air France and the Concorde? Unless they figure out a way to drastically lower the ticket prices while also making the aircraft cost effecient from a operation standpoint thats a non starter too.  Heres something to put supersonic travel into view.  A ticket on the Concorde in 97 was when adjudyed for inflation around 13 grand in today's numbers.  The flight was roughly twice as quick as hopping on a 747.  But you could get a ticket on the 747 for around 1400 in today's money in 97.  So almost 12x as much. No business is going to sign off on that expense especially nowadays.  I mean if you could get a ticket down to twice as much as normal air travel then yeah you might be on to something but unless we see some drastic change in engine technology thats a pipe dream.  I'll bet we come up with a way to travel to space more cost effecient than before supersonic travel comes back.

To get to space you only need an ignition source that A)Goes up and B) Doesnt spin wildly out of control.  To do something better than what we have in the air you need something that is ridicuously fast, cost effecient and most importantly controllable."

2021-05-30 09:40:08,wallstreetbets,I see what your saying but the first flight 100 years ago was 400$ for a 23 minute flight look where we are now. Its not gonna happen over night.
2021-05-30 18:24:21,wallstreetbets,"No such formula exist. You have to trade options for those gains. They are 100x leveraged. You need to identify future catalyst to be a successful options trader. Stocks need a reason to go up, which is why you need to find a catlyst before hand. Take ford for example. The electric truck unveiling was announced at least a week before the event. I bought calls because I thought it would go up based on peoples reactions to the event. So if you can find a catalyst let me know. I think we have one in GSAT by years end. I suspect a buyout. The Jan $3 calls are worth buying a couple to stash."

2021-05-30 06:43:05,wallstreetbets,I’m not asking this trying to be an asshole I just really  wanna know how does it feel to be down ≈80k rn

2021-05-30 07:40:23,wallstreetbets,Have you ever heard of Graham's number?
2021-05-30 11:38:05,wallstreetbets,"If you want to really know, actually I am quite good at the moment. Primarily because I swing traded the volatility and actually sold at a small profit around $260 on Friday morning. Lastly this is not money I really need, because why on earth would I buy GME at $247 otherwise. 

Now, assuming that I indeed had a loss of 80k, it would still have been okay. I had worse days on better stocks, a typical daily portfolio swing can go +- $400k, so an 80k swing on either side would be just be another day. 

If you are interested to know what happened next, I saw an opportunity with AFRM on Friday morning, which I bought with the GME money. FTCH is also looking good right now. Both tickers are beaten so good opportunity to buy IMHO. Cheers!"

2021-05-30 15:50:05,wallstreetbets,"I like BYND as a reopening stock. Also it has a lot of short interest. At current prices it looks like an entry level squeeze position.   
Also BBBY may be a good idea for the same reason.   
According to some things I have been reading in Market Watch consumer discretionary and staples stocks may be rotating into favor some  time soon. Stocks like BYND and BBBY could get some squeeze action on that alone.   
I went all in on BYND with my fun money account. I might put a small amount in BBBY. They both have more short interest than AMC and GME.   
I admire the persistence of AMC investors but it looks like every time the price goes up the retail investors start dumping their shares for a quick profit. How are they going to get an infinity squeeze if that is happening? It seems like maybe it would be a good idea to move to something else and make some money. When some of them leave the price will go down then they could come back again later."
