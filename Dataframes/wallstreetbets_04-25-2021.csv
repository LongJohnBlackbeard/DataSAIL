$MBIS calls on Monday?"
2021-04-25 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,"I hope I am wrong, but I took my profits at $18. There has been buyout rumors for atleast a year and this has run up and down because of it.

I'm intrigued with their LiDar announcement this week, but I've also been burned on waiting too long for underwhelming news. In at $10 and out at $18.... I'll take that return any day and wish you all the best, but this has potential to crash and burn also."

2021-04-25 19:39:40,wallstreetbets,Here‚Äôs a question. How much did MSFT pay them in 2020 for this amazing AR technology?? I‚Äôll wait
2021-04-25 19:41:34,wallstreetbets,You might be the only sane person left on wsb
2021-04-25 19:42:20,wallstreetbets,Irrelevant. Their technology is getting out there in a amazing product. If Microsoft decides not to give MVIS what it is worth then they will find another company. FOMO doesnt just apply to retail investors it also applies to companies probably at a higher rate and most definitely higher value. All it takes is one company to show the interest then to drive the price up
2021-04-25 19:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Uh Verb0182, 

First of all, you are disrespecting a very prestigious group of Musical geniuses when you incorporate ""182"" into your username and comment retarded bearish arguments like this

Second, 

Head over to the MVIS sub and please read the DD, check out the great job the mods have done and maybe, just maybe, you'll stop being a virgin and will start to make some money"
2021-04-25 19:46:54,wallstreetbets,"Their technology is so amazing they said this in their 10k 

2019, our revenue was derived from the sale of components, from development contracts, and from royalty fees for LBS technology. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for a well-known customer under a development agreement. **The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low.** Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer.

*In 2020, one customer accounted for $3.0 million in revenue, representing 97% of our total revenue*

* We are not manufacturing any products at this time* 

*We were unable to secure a customer to launch one of our module products in 2020, as planned. As a result, we plan to focus our attention in the near term on strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger of the Company, sale of part of the Company, strategic minority investment, as well as licensing and other transactions.*"

2021-04-25 19:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Literally everything outside of COVID reopening is going against AMC. Streaming is only going to become more of a thing and the WB / HBO Max deal is just the first mover on something that is inevitable. We can certainly talk short term, but this stock is already massively overvalued having declined from 15ish to 7ish in the year *pre-COVID* when everyone was betting on a trend that COVID is just accelerating. AMC's business model has a hard cap on it and innovation really isn't coming here. Add the possibility they dilute in the near future and what's the upside?"
2021-04-25 19:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Because it's a shit company and a shit stock.

Seen the weekly box office? It's averaging $30m/week. This all theaters not just AMC: [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/)

AMC has to earn $100 million a week in PROFIT (not revenue) just to break even! They are burning through cash (borrowed at a 10%+ interest rate) at an alarming rate. AMC was barely making profit even before COVID and it's going to be years before they turn a profit again.

This article sums it up nicely: [https://investorplace.com/2021/04/three-false-narratives-surrounding-amc-stock/](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/three-false-narratives-surrounding-amc-stock/)"

2021-04-25 19:25:00,wallstreetbets,Aron promised not to use them and filed this promise to the SEC so it's binding.
2021-04-25 19:09:58,wallstreetbets,Aron promised not to use them till 2022 but the sec filing on pg3 says the board (who ultimately issues shares) can withdraw the promise and do it anyways. So it‚Äôs a NO
2021-04-25 19:40:15,wallstreetbets,I joined in June- and even then the environment was much better than now. Although GME is starting to fade away so thats good :)

2021-04-25 19:58:11,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't matter. In order for AMC to make any meaningful movements, it needs a catalyst that WSB alone can't provide. That's not coming any time soon."

2021-04-25 19:51:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been here for 5 years. This place was never smart.
2021-04-25 19:40:10,wallstreetbets,After 3 solid months of GME spam I welcome it with open arms.
2021-04-25 19:49:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm indifferent right now. It's no secret that there have been times where WSB was hyperfocused on one particular stock. Typically those didn't last 3-4 months like GME, of course there are exceptions like TSLA. I can deal with the MVIS spam for now because there isn't so much of it that DD and other decent post don't get drowned out."
2021-04-25 19:55:54,wallstreetbets,"Not moved on from the stock, moved on from talking about it here. Time wore enough people down about the squeeze. The mass of the forum moved on to the next get-rich-quick stock."
2021-04-25 19:40:25,wallstreetbets,I love have SNDL and CLOV have no DD but they're allowed to be posted here.
2021-04-25 19:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Nah, just speaking the truth. This place was better before apes."
2021-04-25 19:12:19,wallstreetbets,I mean it‚Äôs a NO on the vote. Only way to preserve the squeeze. We can petition them to issue 1B shares after the squeeze and apes will buy all of them making AMC invincible

I love that he thinks HFT is the reason academia bleeds staff, nothing to do with shit funding, zero job security, shit pay and the toxic grind yourself to dust for the good of the world culture that is used to prop it all up, let alone the shortage of positions for the specialists that get churned out because it's cheaper to hire a PhD student than it is to fill a position with faculty.

Every time I got burned as they end up dropping like a brick

I believe they're a great company. I believe they **should** break 100 soon.

I'm not so sure it will actually happen. They've been peak kang gang for awhile now."
2021-04-25 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Can a smooth brain explain to me if one holds call options, should one sell on the earnings expectations surge i.e. on Tuesday before close or hold them through the earnings until Wednesday? I mean logically, one should hold them through the earnings report, but I'm relatively new to options and I've been warned of an IV crash that can happen after earnings."
2021-04-25 19:20:52,wallstreetbets,It's going to beat earnings and drop because the market is more efficient than analysts and already priced in the high demand. But this year it should break $100. The thing is when demand drops next year AMD will have really compelling products so they won't be affected.
2021-04-25 19:10:05,wallstreetbets,How much of Xilinx will figure into this earnings?

2021-04-25 18:45:42,wallstreetbets,Im not responding to the last 6 yrs though.  All ive been hearing for the last 2 yrs is AMD is gonna get over $100 and keep going up.  I hope it does cause it should be higher.  It just for some reason never does.

I've owned OXY before but it's always let me down. Right now I just have some $30 calls and a few shares. The problem with OXY is it's shit balance sheet due to mismanagement and the Warren Buffet loan. That's always going to drag it down long term. It's a good short term play when oil moves up but I just don't trust it."

2021-04-25 18:02:08,wallstreetbets,Right? Even before the crash of '20 they were on a 2 year downhill slide.
2021-04-25 19:07:22,wallstreetbets,With the current oil price the debt is safe now and they're generating a lot of cash flows.
2021-04-25 19:03:38,wallstreetbets,"probably because of their carbon capture segment, it‚Äôs like fans that suck in carbon and store them into the ground"

2021-04-25 18:43:00,wallstreetbets,Watching futures tonight? Wti
2021-04-25 19:56:42,wallstreetbets,At the current oil price they're making round $30 a barrel. At roughly a million barrels a day. With a 40 billion debt. As soon as OPEC turns on the tap again in may oil will settle lower. My calculator says no.
2021-04-25 19:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we had a couple of those in Europe who weren't jacked to the tits in debt an they sunk faster than a brick covered in lead tied to an anker. But seriously, we printed as much money as the US did to lend it to countries at a zero interest rate BUT only if the majority of funds are used for the big green transition. All big oil companies have positioned to get into solar, wind, hydro and hydrogen for storage. It's what Schwab refers to as ""the big reset"". I rode oxy from 11 to 20 and converted everything to shell. Could be wrong but the play seems to be to prevent more carbon from being emitted, not scrubbing it."
2021-04-25 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Not a short timer. Tonight's, or this week's wti futures not really relevant to OXY, CVX, or MPC, LYB stock price in long term. In any case will be watching real housewives of Atlanta reunion today followed by married to medicine and then finishing the night of with poker. Cheers!"
2021-04-25 19:55:57,wallstreetbets,"initially the carbon will be sucked into the earth by the fans, pushing the oil out of the ground, so it will be carbon neutral 

then later they will have dedicated fans just for sucking carbon and storing it underground, but they will need a shit load of fans or maybe some super strong fans"

Even 3x is incredibly dangerous, as millions of devil's gold traders have learned.

Edit: I was wrong. They employ a long-only equity strategy. Per their website ‚ÄúSystematic Macro is a global strategy that allocates risk dynamically across several asset classes including sovereign debt, equity indices, commodities and currencies in developed and emerging markets.‚Äù

Also did some more digging- interview with IPM here: https://thehedgefundjournal.com/ipm-informed-portfolio-management/

Interesting excerpt that applies to wsb quite well..: 

‚ÄúLeverage aversion is one facet of behavioural finance research that interests IPM. The theory is simple enough ‚Äì if investors cannot use portfolio leverage, then those investors seeking to up the ante of their portfolios will be drawn to riskier assets as the only way to turbocharge their portfolios. This might include high-beta stocks, for instance. Investors might then ascribe higher valuations to such riskier stocks than they would if they were able to apply leverage to less risky, lower beta, stocks. IPM does not face this constraint: the portfolio can run gross exposure up to 15 times and will typically be around nine times.

As for why they don‚Äôt short stocks: ‚ÄúSimply inverting long factor tilts to try to arrive at short signals does not work, he says. And even if it did, shorting entails practical problems of short squeezes and Lindell thinks that shorts could ‚Äústay underwater for a long time,‚Äù as they may overshoot on the upside.‚Äù

Smart considering this interview was before the GME saga..

TLDR: IPM trade everything from commodities and currencies to stock indices like SPY. They don‚Äôt short stocks but rather were leveraged to the tits, trading with a ton of margin with a typical 9:1 leverage to capital ratio."

2021-04-25 18:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Getting whale clients is a lot of work for a hedge fund.  There's a lot of competition.  Let's say you have 3 hedge funds:

* Hedge A claims 14% returns the previous year.  They only use about 20% leverage
* Hedge B claims 31% returns.  They YOLO their entire portfolio 6x, but gloss over that
* Hedge C is claiming 46% returns

Which one do you choose?

If you chose C, then you signed up with Bernie Madoff, and your money is now gone.  So everybody piles into Hedge B, leaving Hedge A without clients and really struggling.  So in order to remain relevant, Hedge A starts levering as well.  Then Hedge D comes along and sees the only way to compete with these other funds is to do the same thing, and they really want to win, so they go 7x.  Then Hedge E comes along and does 8X.  Then B and A see what's happening and do 9.  Then everybody is doing 9.

&#x200B;

Before you know it, 9x leveraging is an industry standard.  Then a correction happens, all the funds blow up, and they go to the government claiming they have no idea how this could happen and how they need a taxpayer bailout because their 4th house in the Hamptons needs a new septic tank.

&#x200B;

If there's one thing Wall Street has proven time and again, it's that if you don't keep your boot firmly planted on their throat, they are guaranteed to go full retard.  I'm Gen X, and I've seen them do it....what, 4 times in a scale large enough to blow up the economy now?  It seems to happen at least once a decade."

2021-04-25 19:19:31,wallstreetbets,"This is going to sound really crass, but when you have ""generational wealth"", the movements of markets over a day, a month, even a year, don't really matter.  Sometimes you get out ahead of it a bit and buy everything back and then some with lower prices, sometimes you just ask your wealth manager to give you an update in 6 months with where things stand and to let you know when they start going up again.  There comes a point where you're in too many markets, hold too many assets, have too much cash in too many different kinds of currency to limit your exposure to inflation, etc. to where you can simply be patient.

&#x200B;

The only way to **fix** this problem is to A) demand the SEC grow a backbone and some teeth - and actually use them, which is something they haven't done in almost 20 years, B) change the rules on reporting assets and distribution by hedge funds and IB's to where they have to lift the veil obfuscating how responsibly or recklessly they're behaving with their AUM, and C) Do a real job enforcing manipulation by firms and HFT's that can simply be set to ""kill economy"" any time they want and drive prices down so that you never know if the result of a drop/correction is organic or the result of fuckery with algos that are more crooked than a carnival game.  Remember, circuit breakers only exist today because programmatic trading in 1987 took things too far on Black Monday and drew too much attention.

2021-04-25 15:54:31,wallstreetbets,Reduced nicotine is bullish. People aren't going to stop or cut back they will just be buying more.
2021-04-25 16:04:14,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion XXII is a bullish play to look at if you want to find ways to profit off nicotine reg.

The sp has risen considerably on expected FDA approval of their VLN (Very Low Nicotine) products and then moved even higher with Biden admin backing reduced nicotine initiative for harm reduction, smoking cessation and to prevent any new smokers from becoming addicted in the first place.

The way I see it is there is still a lot of room to move higher still. As the CEO said - this is their Grand Slam. Final FDA approval will be a massive catalyst which is being discussed as a when, not an if. May 6 is their next earnings, which seems like a nice opportunity for them to show off a clean balance sheet to new potential investors and a company poised to capitalize on these health initiatives. They may also see a spike in institutional ownership with sp > $5 now (assuming that holds of course)

2021-04-25 16:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Though that might seem logical, it's false.

Check out some of the published clinical studies.

Univ of Pittsburgh:

Compared to a gradual nicotine reduction, an immediate nicotine reduction was associated with: lower toxicant exposure, fewer cigarettes smoked per day, greater reduction in nicotine dependence, and more smoke-free days

Participants who were assigned VLNC cigarettes smoked fewer cigarettes per day (14.9) than those assigned to their usual brand (22.2)

Smokers of VLNC cigarettes doubled their quit attempts versus smokers of conventional cigarettes

Univ of MN

VLNC cigarettes produced significantly better results than the FDA-approved nicotine lozenge; even the smokers who ultimately did not quit ended up reducing their cigarette consumption by 37%

conclusion The 0.05 mg nicotine yield cigarettes may be a tobacco product that can facilitate cessation"

2021-04-25 19:44:05,wallstreetbets,"the reason they went down from 70s to 40s was because 1) they were way hyped 2) couldn't meet the hype when they had difficulty getting approval from insurances. 

The major gatekeeper will be medicare because old people get skin cancer. The technology itself is cool and probably works but their major hurdle is getting adoption right now. not impossible but also a very wait and see picture. Finally, their share price was retarded. 70 / share drives away small time investors. Splitting it x 4 to 15-20/share would make it way more accessible."

Comparing ViacomCBS assets including PlutoTV and Paramount+ to At&t with HBOMax streaming, Comcast's Peacock network, Netflix and Disney, ViamcomCBS seem fairly undervalued. At&t, Comcast and Netflix are over 200B market cap. Disney is over 300B, even Roku is 50B.

So conservatively valuing ViacomCBS half or even a third of their competitors value at 100B doesn't  seem far fetched, at least thats my hopes. Half of my portfolio is in Viac."

That is obviously not the case here. However, I do think that VIAC will be a safe play for making decent $$ over the course of a year or so. Prolly never gonna reach $90-$100 again, but $60-$70 is definitely possible...it will take time though. This ain't gonna be the rocket to da moon like I initially thought it would be.
With that said,  if someone was gonna yolo, I would rather see him/her yolo on VIAC(A) than 75% of the other companies being pushed on the forums. It is undervalued and it pays a decent dividend you can collect while you play the waiting game."

Even if it crawls towards the second-lowest forecast (circa $60) this will still have a huge upside on my cheap October calls.

But it's worth keeping in mind that they are trading at shit ratios:

Comcast's market cap is 71% of their EV, trading at 2.5P/S.

Viacom's market cap is about 57% of their EV, trading at 1P/S.

Comcast beat their EPS estimates by an average of 6.85% the past year.

Viacom beat their EPS estimates by an average of 17.2% the past year.

Also, Im in 100% agreement with you on the unpredictability of VIAC(A) valuations. I thought that VIACA wouldn't dip below $45-46...I was wrong.

2021-04-25 14:17:23,wallstreetbets,So I get warrants at discounted price and if I produce car and bring it to market as agreed then stock go up my warrant goes up as stock go up and I make boatload of money. Hymn seems like a merit based. You make crap you get paid for crap you build good you get paid for good. Personal stake gives you personal interest in success. If not interested in your own personal success why bother talking?
2021-04-25 14:02:46,wallstreetbets,"FSR is a speculative stock so it not surprising there's a lot of risk factor. You can be as bearish on the cases as you want, but like any speculative stocks if it proves you wrong it'll pop.

First, Magna or Foxconn may take a stake in the company. BUT that's no difference than if they have to issues shares or get into Billions of debt to make the car. I rather have these companies invest in them then they paying these companies to make the car. So in theory less not more risk by taking this approach.

Profits not a concern here as they are startup. Once they start selling cars even as a loss is fine as long as they get orders and can make the car. Amazon and Tesla was never profitable from the beginning.  They already got what 15,000 (?) deposit for the car? This tells you they got customers. 

So anyway the question one should asked when betting on this stock is do you believe Magna (and foxconn to some extend but we only need one for now) will be able to pull this off and make a car. Magna is a great company and makes so many cars for so many companies and they have vast experience. So ya, I'm confident they'll pull it off. That's the question you should asked yourself when you buy speculative stocks like FSR.

I like and trust Magna so yes I'm bullshit on FSR. Even if they could build and sold just 20 car initially in first year of manufacturing the stock will pop."
2021-04-25 14:20:33,wallstreetbets,"I think that the op is correct in his assessment. Any Ev maker who has to subcontract it's manufacturing has very little leverage in the negotiations with manufacturers. I can't blame the manufacturers to see this leverage and take advange of this. A prime example is Ev start up Canoo. How much tech the start up ev's bring to the table will be important. This brings up an inportant point relative to apple, since they won't be manufacturing their own cars. Apple certainty has the technology and the brand and scale to move the needle with a manufacturer. The question is how much. Nothing has happened yet, but several talks with oem's have broken down and we don't know any details. The dd that was done clearly points out that current ev start up lack the capital go it alone and are at the mercy of the oem's."

2021-04-25 14:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes, startups get a lot more leeway based on speculation that the company will become profitable.  My issue with Fisker is that nothing they have done tells me that management knows how to actually make that happen, and may in fact be impeding the advancement of their own products due to ego.  Take a look at my previous posts for my complete thoughts (linked in the above)."
2021-04-25 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Debate rule (insert #), idk i have a real degree not polisci, but if you are going to reference Lucid then be prepared to debate them. Why, because they are in the same category as fisker. 

Lucid has cars on the road and dealerships in place.  Their preorders, while not binding, are a substantial investment which typically leads to a sale. 

Lucid is farther ahead than fisker on their milestones. Lucid could still fail but it would take a lot more than it would for fisker.  OP was pointing out their observations about sharing profitability in the future. 

If you are going to be bullish and make statements, stick with what you were saying, which was a solid point, idk no proof nor vested interest. Just fine tune that 3rd paragraph and you will be golden. 

Hope you get your tendies someday."

Even if you don't have confident in them, I have full faith in Magna. If the sign the dotted line with Magna I'm going to load a shit amount of FSR. 
There's always risk but I like the chances especially if Magna on board."
2021-04-25 14:55:36,wallstreetbets,You're right. I was just trying to make a point why I think FSR could have potential to run based on Lucid valuation. Not a bear on Lucid either. I'll fine tune it.
2021-04-25 15:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it very well could.  To me though, it shows (from the standpoint of Fisker) that they don't really have a handle on how to run their own company beyond grabbing headlines.  After you secure a partnership with a solid car manufacturer and give them 6% ownership, there is no solid business reason I can think of to start courting another company to start all over on partnering, designing, and producing your second car.  The only reason I can think of is to just keep the publicity train rolling at the expense of the actual products (and shareholders)."

Between MS hololens army deal and the more and more it seems like lidar is required for higher levels of automated driving I think 100 is a minimum.

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSP LEAPS. CTX001 is going to market. If you missed the news, vertex did a cash deal with Crispr therapeutics for a total of 1.1B USD. The deal basically gives them an extra 10% of revenue for the drug ctx001. Crispr therapeutics gets 900m upfront, and will receive 200m upon any regulatory approval.

30 patients have been dosed so far. This drug treats two different diseases-- sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. 

Everyone that has done followup for this trial is symptom free. The people with sickle cell disease have been free of vasoocclusice crises, which is an incredibly painful occlusion of blood vessels. And the people with beta thalassemia have been transfusion independent.

Severe presentations of these diseases cost north of 300k/USD a year to treat, fyi.

Some retard on this board three months ago said the current trial data wasn't enough to mean anything, but it apparently means enough to pay 1.1B USD for an extra 10% stake of revenue pre-approval. So fuck whoever that guy was. 

There's other important shit they're doing but I'm not going to type it all out. Buy leaps."

The future outlook of the underlying tech is fantastic, especially with OP's mentioning of CTX001 going to market, but this is truly a long-term play, given how slow regulatory bodies are with new therapies like this.

I'm in though, will do some research and buy some leaps/shares in the next week or so."

2021-04-25 13:18:14,wallstreetbets,"Transfusion dependent beta thal is incredibly expensive to treat chronically as OP said. Im a medical professional - work for a Medicaid health plan and we pay 100% of the cost to treat our patients, including those with beta thalassemia. I‚Äôd prefer to pay for curative gene therapy over the long-term costs of managing the condition. While the current data is a small number of patients, if the magnitude of the effects are substantial enough, the small population becomes a moot point.

Edit: I‚Äôm pointing out that to say the CTX001 data is ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù is short-sighted. The FDA is approving drugs and treatments across the board for countless other conditions that have far less potential benefit at significant cost."

Added constrain is need because Both sickle cell and beta thalasemia are mostly illness of the less developed countries. A disease like cystic fibrosis which affect most white population is more profitable. But I wonder whether vertex wants to lose their main income. Coming from the field of CF and having to deal with vertex for all these years. My mayor fear is that the upfront money is so vertex can prohibit crispr from developing the cure for CF."

2021-04-25 12:37:22,wallstreetbets,"In just a few years there have been a number of rather impressive tools made, namely base editing and prime editing. This stuff is pretty exciting so ill give a brief overview.

My understanding here is that the crispr-cas complex causes double stranded breaks, which in turn causes unwanted indels that decrease the efficacy of the edits. It's enough to do gene suppression by the looks of it (which is what nearly all clinical trials have been doing), but not enough to correct for faulty genes. With base editing this problem goes away.

One of my favorite collaborations in the space is between beam therapeutics and verve therapeutics. There is a mutation inside of the pcsk9 gene that is naturally found in a small percentage of African Americans. It results in an **80% reduction in the chance of having a heart attack over a persons life**, as it causes LDL and triglycerides to be significantly lower over a person's life time.

They were able to induce this same edit in non-human primates and saw similar reductions in LDL and triglycerides. If they were able to do this safely in humans, I dont see why anyone would want to go without it as about 1/3 people die of heart attack."

Viacyte is probably one of the most interesting companies in medicine atm as they have a functional cure for type 1 diabetes that removes the need for exogenous insulin, but their most mature products require immunosuppressive drugs.

The company has been around since 1993 with a mere 80 employees and they got 0 revenue to show for it.  The CEO is brand new, just started.

Ofc they got an extension, that's the only way to save existing investors.  I'm not saying the company is 100% worthless it just isn't the money-making slam dunk it's peddled as.

2021-04-25 14:29:31,wallstreetbets,"You know nothing about SDC's if you think autonomous driving will have a high demand for LiDAR.  Even the CEO of Waymo, THE LEADER by far in SDC's has said it's possible autonomous driving may not even happen in our lifetime."
2021-04-25 14:30:06,wallstreetbets,Check my history I'm just responding to specific points and defending myself at this point.
2021-04-25 14:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Bro, not everything is FUD.  I shared a few negative opinions on MVIS and my inbox is literally flooded with 100+ angry MVIStards."
2021-04-25 14:25:21,wallstreetbets,So care to share concrete numbers on how they're going to turn an actual profit?  Basic earnings or revenue forecasts?
2021-04-25 17:45:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't think those numbers will be transparent until Thursday. Honestly though, if there is a company that has ""cracked"" near-eye-display for AR we are looking at some serious potential in a market that literally every major player wants to be in.

&#x200B;

MVIS is absolutely a speculative play, it was at $3, it is now, but stop being disingenuous and calling it a P&D"

2021-04-25 14:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Again, you clearly don‚Äôt know about the company or it‚Äôs products(some in development and some already developed).  Buyout is inevitable, it‚Äôs only a matter of time"
2021-04-25 14:38:23,wallstreetbets,"""Buyout is inevitable"" heard this scammy shit too.

All rumors have originated and circulated on Reddit / Stocktwits.  Only thing concrete is ""we are for sale"" from CEO.  Which pretty much any R&D company is basically.

This is just Reddit playing the fucking telephone game."

I don't regret that I missed canine currency either because it was not predictable with the information I had."
2021-04-25 14:45:10,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs predictable if you know what MVIS has.  Just go YouTube MVIS product. Research their patents as well.
2021-04-25 14:49:47,wallstreetbets,Their only thing on LiDAR is a 2 minute hype video.  That's the most hyped aspect and SDC's currently have 0 viable products.  Likely not for decades as anyone that follows the SDC space will tell you.

2021-04-25 14:55:08,wallstreetbets,I bought in at .94 I‚Äôve sat through all the BS I‚Äôve believed in this before lidar was even a thing with it.
2021-04-25 14:56:26,wallstreetbets,Ok that totally makes sense.  At .94 this is a bargain for a chance at smth big.  I stated similar in my other post.  But at these prices it feels a lot more risky.
2021-04-25 14:59:49,wallstreetbets,"I just feel differently man,  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs risky at all.  No hard feelings. Good luck with your investments, future and present."
2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Yolo worthy? 
2021-04-25 05:05:02,wallstreetbets,"short term PLTR calls? 

yep, you hate money alright"
2021-04-25 10:13:56,wallstreetbets,"OP godspeed but I have been watching PLTR every single day for like 3 months and you're doing 2 of the things that almost guarantee you to lose money w/ PLTR calls.

1) you're buying them for a week when the Fed is speaking. J POW talks on like Wednesday and/or Thurs (not to mention Biden). He might not say something bad but recently the market always acts like he is going to until he actually speaks. This is largely what causes the stretches where PLTR bleeds down to like ~$21.50.

2) you're not buying the dip (when it's below or at least @ $22/share). You bought them when PLTR is doing reasonably well by its standards recently.

Seriously, like 1/3rd of the S&P is reporting earnings this week which could make things volatile as fuck. Also Biden and J pow are speaking. I'm not saying I know what's going to happen, I just know at LEAST one day is going to be blood red and perhaps catastrophic. And Jeronimus Powell can make the whole week red if he wants to with a simple flick of his forked little tongue. There is also of course the chance that everything moons but... It's PLTR lol. 

Luckily you could be saved by the Monday morning rip. This could be great if you pill it off. Usually no matter what, PLTR will rip for a second first thing in the AM (it might dip first), but after that there is a real chance of it cratering and bleeding out for the rest of the week.

Best of luck, if I were you I would sell as soon as I make any profit whatsoever and re-up when PLTR craters this week during the volatility. I've lost so much money doing what you're doing and have gotten it back by:

1) buying pltr calls on the dip (sub 22)
2) doing 2 week expiry minimum to save my ass incase anything happens 
3) paying attention to the fed schedule

Bias: I bought May07 PLTR puts @ 23.50 on Friday. but you can bet your ass I'm going to buy as many calls as humanly possible this week if it crashes

best of luck !"
2021-04-25 03:44:21,wallstreetbets,Sell at the morning rip.
2021-04-25 03:13:38,wallstreetbets,Yikes

If it breaks 24 again, it can go to 25 in the same week.

2021-04-25 08:40:30,wallstreetbets,"So if these calls would give someone the right to buy these shares at $25 before this Friday why would they buy the calls and exercise them instead of just buying the shares outright? Are they saving money by buying the shares through the calls?

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Calling all apes: CLF cleveland cliffs, diamond hands? Why not steel hands? Edit\* position 232 shares followed by 20 call options spread across the year

Hello, today I am going to try and convince you why you should buy CLF, before we go any further you should know I have about 1/3 of my total cash invested into CLF. Here is a list of catalysts.

**1.** Steel Prices continue to rise with no sign of slowing down.

according to this chart [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) Steel has been trading at all time highs week after week. This is due to a supply shortage. Steel demand has not gone down since Nov 20 2020.

**2.**  Infrastructure spending trends worldwide are on an upward climb

This chart is a prediction of future infrastructure spending globally  [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/four-big-infrastructure-trends-for-2021/) but aside from this prediction it is not a secret that Biden plans to compete with China and Russia on infrastructure, In his press conference when he released his infrastructure bill He said he wanted to beat China. Most if not all infrastructure spending will involve steel or other building materials in some way or another. If 3 main world superpowers are fighting over economic dominance in infrastructure this will continue to raise steel prices.

**3.**  CLF is not a stranger to massive increases in stock price.

Back in June 6th 2008 it rose to 104$ a share and then in April 8th 2011it rose to 98$ a share. These were due to similar circumstances we are seeing in the steel Market today with these non stop increases.

**4.** We are currently in a commodity super cycle.

If you look around you will not only see steel vastly increasing but you also steel OSB sheets of plywood now going for 70$ a sheet. Other commodities increasing on a similar scale to steel are. Bitumen, Nickel, copper. With all of these commodities increasing at the same time its safe to assume demand keeps going up with the anticipation of the infrastructure plans as well as seasonal summer construction.

**5.**  China plans to cut its rebate on steel.

according to this [https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/steel-traders-alert-for-china-steel-export-rebate-cuts/) China plans to cut its steel rebate dramatically. Its not a shock that with rising steel prices they wouldn't want to purposely take a hit to their trade export revenue. If China cuts the rebate down it will spike Steel prices worldwide.

**6.**  China plans to cut steel production to meet carbon emission goals.

China is finally going somewhat green. (finally) With china lowering steel production this would drive steel prices up substantially due to supply not being able to meet demand. Scarcity could be a short term catalyst but a catalyst nonetheless.

If you ask me this looks like the perfect storm to make some easy Tendies, Fellow apes will you join me?"

2021-04-25 11:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Your point number 4 doesn‚Äôt entirely follow logic. 

Demand is up, supply is down, costs rise. But eventually the rising costs will make the demand fall, and if the demand falls and supply remained steady then costs will fall. Odds are better though that demand will decrease, supply will increase, and prices will return to a more stable ‚Äúnormal‚Äù even if that is slightly higher. 

Large projects are run on budgets and ROI. If you‚Äôre building a high rise with steel, or an apartment building with lumber, you have a budget price and an idea of how long it will take to recoup your money. How fast you can recoup your money is based on supply and demand of the real estate markets, which aren‚Äôt extremely connected to construction since there are already a lot of buildings out there that aren‚Äôt affected by current building materials increases. 

I personally have known several commercial construction projects that the owners have put on hold because their material budgets rose so much. If they‚Äôve figured a 5 year ROI, and their costs double their ROI is now 10 years. That‚Äôs a lot of play in the schedule where they can just wait for material prices to come back down. The owner would have to be pretty sure prices aren‚Äôt going to be reasonable again for another 5 years to just forge ahead with a significant increase to their budget. 

Demand is going to taper (it‚Äôs already started to do so). The inflated prices won‚Äôt stay this high. 

That may or may not materially affect your take on the company, but you‚Äôre just overlooking a major component and assuming that prices are going to just keep going up and up when the market just can‚Äôt support that."
2021-04-25 10:44:19,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve played with CLF stocks for the last 6 months. It has steady growth but not a flashy business most investors see pop.

2021-04-25 17:19:32,wallstreetbets,CLF bought MT USA assets. MT is a global operation.

I‚Äôd like to by back in around the $14-15.50 but knowing my luck it won‚Äôt lol. They‚Äôre in a good position. They supply the ore and now produce steel as well. However it‚Äôs going to be a while before we even see what the infrastructure spending will look like, let alone when the cash actually starts flowing. It would also to be prudent to look into the ‚Äúmiddle man‚Äù distribution companies. Worthington industries would be one example"
2021-04-25 11:03:38,wallstreetbets,Well I‚Äôd like to inform you that the aero frame structures of 7050al (Boeing spec) attached at certain points with fittings and mounts made from a special heat treated stainless. It‚Äôs also very common in medical device instrumentation. I‚Äôm well aware that the majority of the airframe is made of AL something to do with that lift thing
2021-04-25 14:42:24,wallstreetbets,your guess is asgood as mine but if I get some shares Im  holding until at least October
2021-04-25 16:51:59,wallstreetbets,"I had a stock United States Steel (X), which I bought couple years ago for 10$ a piece. Sold recently at 24,50$. Their book value back then was juicy. Even now it's 17$ per share or something. I'm still just unsure if I should get into steel again. There's plenty of that stuff in Russia, so all it requires is a little handshake smile between Biden and Putin when they meet, and steel prices plummet when Russia starts the real export."

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MP is about to soar! DD MP Materials is about to pop off!  (And to my GME followers, still holding on strong there - two stocks is diversification right?!?!)
 
Well MP sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the Cali-Nevada border.  [They sit just south of Las Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/mp+materials/@35.4652108,-115.5387785,17915m/data=!3m1!1e3) right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore. 
 
Well let's start with what they do: rare earth materials mining.  Not the sexiest job on the planet, but it is necessary for all things tech.  Rare earths are a key component of clean energy, IT, defense, industrial applications, and neat little magnets.  [China was by far the #1 producer with 83% of the total worldwide production](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-wret/assets/palladium/production/mineral-pubs/rare-earth/mcs-2017-raree.pdf) but now with MP Materials pumping out ore [they have fallen to only 58% of total worldwide production](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-rare-earths.pdf)    
 
The market isn't going away but China could pull it's supply which is a huge risk to the US tech industry.  On top of this, demand will be skyrocketing with a [projected increase in electric car production from 2.5M per year now to 31M per year in 2030!](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html).  More specifically the annual demand for [rare earth magnet oxides are expected to increase 5x in the next 10 years to $16bln](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/astronomical-rare-earth-demand-growth-forecast-2020-09-29) - and if that isn‚Äôt enough potential revenue then also consider next year [MP will have finished their own on site processing facility to produced finished metals instead of ore](https://mpmaterials.com/about/).
 
Also worth considering [China is only the leader because their population bears the cost of production that will likely see boycotts or backlash as new facilities are available](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-07-28/china-rare-earth-tech-pollution-supply-chain-trade) and [MP has created a sustainable process for extraction](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/), so likely the top brands will start pushing for more sustainable processes with less negative impact and potentially force China to clean up their act / increase cost.  
 
The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point.  [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue.   The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).  
 
[The price of rare earths is rising, and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mp-materials-quarterly-profit-jumps-on-rising-rare-earths-prices-2021-03-18) - the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further.  Though the stock price jumped, it did plummet on news that they were [issuing some additional shares, about 10%, to fund new green energy initiatives.](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2021/MP-Materials-Announces-Pricing-of-600-Million-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx).  With a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects, it makes $MP a prime target for eco-conscious investors.  
 
In my opinion, the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below it's fair value.  10% dilution rocked it to a 30% price dive that it is coming back from strongly now.  It‚Äôs also worth noting the share offering was at $35, which is $5 more than the current price - meaning the serious buyers know the value of the stock is well above its current value.  $MP doubled the analyst estimates for EPS in Q4 last year and don't look to be slowing down.  [Looking ahead, the forward looking EPS estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 p/e ratio](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates) with $0.38 EPS in 2021 - and they‚Äôve only been operating for four years!  2022 EPS is expected to jump more than 50% to $0.58 and that is **before their processing plant is even open!**.  It‚Äôs not too hard to see that growth continuing with the addition of selling finished materials, increased demand, and increased price of the rare earth products which is on pace to continue for the next 10 years.  
 
MP materials hasn't been around long, taking over the site from failed Molycorp, but appear to be hitting it at a good time.  Now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly, but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths.
 
If you look at their earnings presentation: https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf, the story keeps getting better though.  They had 100% YoY revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production.  Modest for Q4 YoY, but 25% for the entire year.  
 
So that‚Äôs the basics of MP, but why the hell should you buy now?!?!?  Well, let‚Äôs look at the [current short borrow utilization](https://imgur.com/gallery/EJFwoFR) - that big drop - it wasn‚Äôt people selling, it was an 18M share short attack! Now the short utilization is up to a whopping **93% and climbing!**  (Note: I prefer FF on loan for Ortex because it tracks the SI much closer than their estimated SI).  So now the price is climbing again, they are almost out of shorts to borrow, and shit out of luck.  As they cover over the next month or two - we can expect the price to rise easily back up to $45, especially with the Q1 earnings call around the corner.  And when they beat earnings‚Ä¶.. It‚Äôs gonna fly!  
 
On top of that, the growth stocks have all been on a severe downtrend over the last month - but are popping back into fashion now.   With the huge SI, low share availability with only 130M shares, and momentum of growth stocks in vogue today - shit‚Äôs gonna sail.

Edit: I did some digging and [estimated the Q1 EPS based on actual REO prices from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021, and came up with $0.27 EPS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit?usp=sharing) or more than 3x analyst estimates.  A further very conservative estimate for the year puts it just under $1 EPS, way above analyst estimates as well!  When the Q1 earnings come out, this shit's gonna go REE!

2021-04-25 17:33:28,wallstreetbets,"Something that I think is very, VERY interesting: MP Materials came to the public market originally as a SPAC by Chamath, our favorite Indian Chad. However, all the companies he's been involved have been taking a BEATING as of late.

And yes, the entire SPAC space is hurting right now, but Chamath's picks have been bleeding a lot more than any others. Seems... I don't know, personal?

If short interest is really that freakin' high, oh boy. This thing could pop with just a little nudge in the right direction.

Might load up with some more shares."
2021-04-25 08:45:07,wallstreetbets,Did not realize short interest was so high on MP
2021-04-25 09:34:54,wallstreetbets,"So you‚Äôre essentially betting that the Chinese don‚Äôt just crush the margins whenever they want to? 

Run it up bigly and then I‚Äôll buy some puts, thanks in advance"
2021-04-25 09:13:54,wallstreetbets,"I was doing some research into MP Materials 2-3 months ago. Their presented plans and projected numbers looked pretty good, but then I started looking into the companies that were operating the mine in the past. If I remember correctly, [their stock had a impressive increase in the beginning, but took a big dive shortly after](https://www.investing.com/equities/molycorp-inc./) which didn't stop until the company shut down. The simple problem with getting about 83% of rare earth materials from china is that they control something along the lines of a monopoly. If they decide to lower the prices for only a short period of time to the point that MP Materials operations get unprofitable, they're going to bleed out very quickly. This exact circumstance was [the reason why Molycorp failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp)."
2021-04-25 04:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Haha, at which price did you buy OP?"
2021-04-25 10:16:39,wallstreetbets,I get why the narrative of this company is great. All anyone does is talk about the narrative / story. What I haven't seen is fundamental analysis. I don't want propaganda earnings presentation from the company. I want intelligent fundamental analysis with a first principle approach

2021-04-25 17:15:42,wallstreetbets,"Definitely think this is a good play and MP has room to run up. After this last year with everyone realizing how important it is to have domestic production in critical industries, I can‚Äôt see the US government letting MP fail. Way too important from a military perspective to have REO production in the US when it‚Äôs needed for all the advanced weaponry/tech."
2021-04-25 12:06:15,wallstreetbets,MP sends its minerals to china for processing. Now if they started to process what they mined that would be a catalyst.
2021-04-25 12:08:10,wallstreetbets,That Indian guy said it‚Äôs good so I buy
2021-04-25 15:52:04,wallstreetbets,Such a great recap.  I have been watching the closely.  Bought 10k worth and then bailed for a tiny gain.  Need to put a real position in this and sit on it for awhile.  Thanks for this.  I‚Äôm going to make this happen soon.

2021-04-25 11:53:10,wallstreetbets,I would wait until the lock-up period expires on 18 May

2021-04-25 06:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Well, MP seems ok-ish. Whole company, business model, all the background.  
But.   
MP is a hot topic for quite some time.

Our beloved cocaine snorting bear ball licker waving hands on telly and shitting his pants about betting on tickers with high short interest mentioned it at least twice. Saying it is vital. In the beginning of April. Meaning there's a whole bunch of hillbillies already bought it in the first weeks of April. So it was already overbought to start with.   
Betting it will rise a little bit in next few weeks to almost 32 and then will gradually die in high -teens :( A shame, because company is ok.  Maybe good play for a very long holding, but I would wait for hype to fade in month or two."

2021-04-25 17:48:26,wallstreetbets,short interest was 14.22% as of Friday BTW. Probably dropped as all shorts are decreasing on the SPAC front
2021-04-25 11:35:49,wallstreetbets,"this is some very lackluster DD. you didn‚Äôt once take into account how unfriendly it is to the environment to mine and refine rare earths - that‚Äôs why china is a leader; they don‚Äôt give a shit about the environment and do it way cheaper. 
maybe look into why mollycorp failed next time."
2021-04-25 19:33:55,wallstreetbets,MP broke its support around $29-30. Good company but the chart says it will go down.
2021-04-25 18:25:06,wallstreetbets,TLOFF is a better long term play in my opinion. I also believe there are a ton of Canadian Nickel and Lithium mines doing better than MP.
2021-04-25 16:17:17,wallstreetbets,More reason to squeeze?
2021-04-25 11:40:35,wallstreetbets,cuz it sucks
2021-04-25 10:14:58,wallstreetbets,"If they do, I can guarantee tariffs will fix that right quick - right now we don't have any tariffs on Chinese REEs, and any price manipulation will be met swiftly"
2021-04-25 08:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Bought some at 45, then a shit ton at 28.5 this week during the dip"
2021-04-25 12:06:26,wallstreetbets,"Right - so let's talk numbers then and what I expect to see for Q1 2021 results as an example.   I took a look at the average price of Dysprosium and Neodymium (since they make up 84% of demand weighted by price) and found their daily price from beginning of Q4 to end of Q1.  The average price went up 50% from Q4-Q1, and MPs costs have remained the same (or even went down) over the last year.  So with that in mind, it's pretty easy to calculate the projected Q1 EPS at $0.27 alone! [The spreadsheet I used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit?usp=sharing) can also be used if you want to run scenarios for the rest of 2021.

Given the price has remained relatively constant through the first month of Q2 - it's not a long shot to predict the Q2 results should be similar, and if I take the pessimistic look for Q3-Q3 and say the price drops somewhere between the prices of Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 - the EPS for all of 2021 assuming only 2% growth of output per quarter works out to be $0.98 EPS for 2021.  [When you look at analyst estimates here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/mp/earnings-estimates) the high estimate is $0.53 EPS for 2021, and it'll get close double that with my conservative estimate!  Part of the play is for Q1 earnings - the estimate of $0.08 for Q1 is a third of my calculated EPS which is based on actual market data.  So when Q1 earnings come out and they absolutely crush earnings, this is what my current strategy is targeting.  Along with the high SI and super high utilization, it won't be vulnerable to the typical earnings short attack that funds have been known to do.  

The longer play is harder to calculate given we don't know what will happen to the price of REEs, but the fact they are this profitable so early on is really exciting for me.  At the very least the Q1 earnings play is super strong"
2021-04-25 19:08:33,wallstreetbets,"I got in originally at cost basis 41, but super small position - just got assigned a single CSP.  Ended up doing more research and went in deep on Thursday when it dipped down.  Wouldn't call myself a bag holder here - rather did the research to see if I should skip out or not."
2021-04-25 17:20:05,wallstreetbets, Nothing wrong with bag holding if you like the stock.
2021-04-25 12:06:59,wallstreetbets,They have a facility which will be complete in 2022 to do just that!
2021-04-25 12:08:46,wallstreetbets,Didn't that already end considering the CEO sold a small number of shares?
2021-04-25 10:56:38,wallstreetbets,"I can't blame you given the GME madness happening, but with the price tanking on no news for the past few weeks and the price of REOs only going up - when the SI increases at that rate it is pretty demonstrable of short pressure keeping the price down rather than an actual sell-off."
2021-04-25 09:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Did buy a little at a 41 cost basis, but then waited until it was mid 28s and YOLOd a shit load on to it - so I'm up currently!"
2021-04-25 08:40:58,wallstreetbets,"The TA says otherwise, looking at the [4hr timeframe, it has been hovering at oversold for the past month](https://imgur.com/gallery/ssXK9pI) and at the [1D timeframe as well](https://imgur.com/a/7DeFIOz) with both timeframes gearing towards fat gainz"

2021-04-25 12:26:21,wallstreetbets,Nice legwork. I'll dig into your spreadsheet here in a moment. Are there any share lock ups or anything like that to be concerned about? Per SEC SPAC stuff all of that is getting categorized differently and its something we need to be aware of. Especially looking at the recent MP dilution. It is a little worrisome throwing money at SPACs (even good SPACs) and it ends up just getting passed along to insider shares selling or dilution. I agree it is a good short run play. Anytime the price goes below 30 I've been selling puts.
2021-04-25 17:37:50,wallstreetbets,"Bag holders do their ""dd"" after they start bagholding in an attempt to rationalize their decision of getting into that particular stock and when it comes to trying to convince others of how good the stock really is, you know what they say,"" misery loves company."" 
Haha."

2021-04-25 18:52:45,wallstreetbets,Utilization went up which is what I look at for a more reliable number since it's tracked better historically with reported SI and is gotten from the brokers rather than calculated.

The narrator‚Äôs job is to assess the need for a recall. If the legal penalties are less than the cost of recalling the cars, they don‚Äôt initiate a recall. 

So if the FTC starts issuing penalties for FTDs on the shorts, that comes out cheaper than properly buying back stock to properly cover the shorts."

2021-04-24 21:58:09,wallstreetbets,Yup. The votes is gonna be insane. Every ape is voting. And won't even vote all their shares.
2021-04-25 00:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Lack of volume = no one is buying this shit for this high and no one wants to short this shit because they don't want to blow up , holding does not make the price go up"
2021-04-24 21:40:25,wallstreetbets,"When y‚Äôall ready for something new, we‚Äôll be here."
2021-04-25 09:03:58,wallstreetbets,He never did get them Duke boys
2021-04-25 08:35:23,wallstreetbets,I even loved the first few seasons.  And this scene is my favorite in the entire series.
2021-04-25 11:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, watch the entire series you can‚Äôt imagine how absurd and hilarious it is."
2021-04-25 11:27:01,wallstreetbets,Ya first couple seasons are beyond PC haha different times but the characters evolve and it‚Äôs a great laugh
2021-04-25 07:17:35,wallstreetbets,Yea I think once Danny Devito takes a main roll in the show
2021-04-25 18:55:25,wallstreetbets,First season is the ‚Äúworst‚Äù but also the shortest. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad season but it isn‚Äôt until Danny Devito comes onto the show in the second season is where it gets awesome
2021-04-25 05:50:21,wallstreetbets,Thank you man
2021-04-25 16:17:16,wallstreetbets,The gun control one had me laughing my ass off. Fucking love that show
2021-04-25 18:09:16,wallstreetbets,So many shows where you have to ride out the first few seasons lol
2021-04-25 15:48:41,wallstreetbets,"I wish I could watch this show for the first time again.

Frank‚Äôs intervention episode might be the greatest thing ever"
2021-04-25 10:01:31,wallstreetbets,Boat
2021-04-25 10:08:22,wallstreetbets,Also now longest running live action sitcom!
2021-04-25 08:26:17,wallstreetbets,Psh Jabroni over here forgetting about the claymation episode.
2021-04-25 12:08:39,wallstreetbets,All seasons are on Hulu at the moment
2021-04-25 12:41:28,wallstreetbets,Say what you will but Disney+ is the top collection of AAA contact. Avengers. Star Wars. All the Pixar.  All the Disney of course. Really the best streaming collection for those looking for ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù big name movies.
2021-04-25 15:26:18,wallstreetbets,It's on UK netflix if you got a VPN
2021-04-24 23:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind the number of shares held by apes will ge greater than the vote due to europoors not being able to vote, e-toro, and every share bought between April 15 and June 6."
2021-04-24 22:10:45,wallstreetbets,"But that means the next rise in market price will force a gamma squeeze.
Think about it. No more float but options traders need to buy shares that arent there to buy.
Maybe Monday really could see something."
2021-04-25 10:16:18,wallstreetbets,But it‚Äôs the *implication*.
2021-04-25 01:48:45,wallstreetbets,If it's overvalued and been trading sideways why not short it? What could make it blow up if it's not shorted to hell?
2021-04-25 01:39:47,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my tsla stock.
2021-04-25 09:05:17,wallstreetbets,Well whatda ya say boss hog?
2021-04-25 11:31:40,wallstreetbets,Dennis and the psychologist may be my favorite scene. Or the implication. Maybe the whole hate crime and lotto ticket episode too lol
2021-04-25 19:46:18,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs no discussion of bird law at the bar.
2021-04-25 16:04:21,wallstreetbets,The superbowl one with Charlie‚Äôs superstition in the bar is insane!
2021-04-25 09:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it‚Äôs definitely worth a watch, show is hilarious. I don‚Äôt normally watch any sitcoms religiously like I do other shows that are more serious or are superhero shows, but this one is an exception."
2021-04-25 10:30:25,wallstreetbets,Renewed for season 15 and 16 too!
2021-04-25 11:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Woah, you keep using this word jabroni and it‚Äôs awesome!"
2021-04-25 12:36:16,wallstreetbets,Damn...don't pay for that either.  Guess I'm hopping on the pirate boat.
2021-04-25 02:23:28,wallstreetbets,">if it's not shorted to hell?

But it *is*.

How many times does this need to be explained?"
2021-04-25 09:43:06,wallstreetbets,"It's basically a ticking time bomb of volatility, once it makes its move up or down its going to get wild. It is not an attractive risk/reward ratio for most investors, there are plenty of opportunities in the stock market everyday, they are just choosing less risky ones."
2021-04-25 17:23:04,wallstreetbets,Do you like it? It‚Äôs very generous.
2021-04-25 16:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah the hate crime one is so funny, they do good on their skits."
2021-04-25 14:05:49,wallstreetbets,Ahoy Cap'n
2021-04-25 15:34:42,wallstreetbets,"That doesn't make any sense. If it's *not* shorted, there is almost no real risk in shorting it now. It can not blow up like it did in January. There would be no need for all these dark pool trades occurring nor all these relatively new accounts posting DD on reddits next ""short squeeze target"" and citing CNBC as a source. Wsb mods removing the karma requirement and letting all these new accounts flood the front page has been hilarious."
2021-04-25 19:04:03,wallstreetbets,The smell! You haven't thought of the smell you bitch
2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I bought 1 share of Blockbusterüåö 
2021-04-24 20:17:52,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre now probably the majority share holder.
2021-04-24 20:17:04,wallstreetbets,He bought THE 1 share
2021-04-24 20:48:03,wallstreetbets,Damn that‚Äôs things gotta be at least $0
2021-04-24 20:21:32,wallstreetbets,The year is 1996 and you are one lucky man!
2021-04-24 20:17:54,wallstreetbets,Dang...now I want one
2021-04-24 20:32:07,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze imminent
2021-04-24 20:16:06,wallstreetbets,Where can I short it?
2021-04-24 20:26:37,wallstreetbets,Literally can‚Äôt go tits up
2021-04-24 20:18:00,wallstreetbets,Here we go
2021-04-24 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,Why the F doesn't Blockbuster come out with a movie streaming service. Their brand is known by everyone and brings back good memories of movie nights. I can smell the buttered popcorn right now for Christ's sake.
2021-04-24 22:40:25,wallstreetbets,"Question.  

Years ago, I took over the furnishings of a failed daycare. 

There were two tvs in it.

One tv had a VCR built into it.

In that VCR was a copy of Inspector Gadget that was never returned to Blockbuster.

Do I give it to you, or....?"
2021-04-24 20:47:08,wallstreetbets,Diamond hand lol
2021-04-24 20:28:20,wallstreetbets,That share belongs to Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen. He was number one.
2021-04-24 20:27:36,wallstreetbets,"How can we get printed docs like this?

EDIT: Lmao did not expect these many replies. I don‚Äôt want it that bad lol. Thought it was free."
2021-04-24 20:29:45,wallstreetbets,BB Liquidating Inc. had a spike up of more than 9%.
2021-04-24 23:41:54,wallstreetbets,You actually paid $100 for this? Anyone can buy the same copy from Scripophily.com here: http://scripophily.net/blinspstce.html
2021-04-24 20:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Still one Blockbuster in Bend Oregon , enjoy your empire!"
2021-04-24 20:30:21,wallstreetbets,"You can call any random person over 40yrs old and demand late fees, they'll instantly begin to soil themselves."
2021-04-24 22:13:48,wallstreetbets,"How has Blockbuster not capitalized on their branding? Everyone knows who they are, what products to expect, etc. Sure Netflix beat them to streaming, as did everyone else, but who cares? They could go into the streaming market and DVD/Blu-ray/VCR Cassette by mail and still get customers purely on nostalgia.  They could make a VR store and you could browse the aisles and see what's available.  It could be amazing."
2021-04-24 20:35:57,wallstreetbets,I'll give you 10$ for it
2021-04-24 20:32:20,wallstreetbets,How can I request a paper copy?
2021-04-24 20:15:38,wallstreetbets,Is it 1- or 2-ply?
2021-04-24 20:54:00,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúYou too, can be a Lord in Ireland‚Äù"
2021-04-24 22:33:46,wallstreetbets,That certificate looks like it cost more than the share...
2021-04-24 21:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Now that I am majority shareholder, all of your late fees belong to meüåö"
2021-04-24 21:07:48,wallstreetbets,"BLIAQ

that's the ticker. 

I'm buying $1000 worth Monday. Who else is in? $50 worth would raise the price lol.

Deadly serious.  Monday I'm buying."
2021-04-24 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,This actually feels wholesome
2021-04-24 20:48:46,wallstreetbets,True diamond hands.
2021-04-24 23:40:44,wallstreetbets,"For those of you who are wondering the ticker for Blockbuster is BLIAQ, you're welcome. üòÅ"
2021-04-24 20:49:57,wallstreetbets,Honestly in 30 years this physical share will probably be worth a decent chunk of change as memorabilia for a collector of some sort
2021-04-24 20:42:48,wallstreetbets,DeepFuckingValue Jr
2021-04-24 20:32:24,wallstreetbets,Jake Peralta?
2021-04-24 22:19:30,wallstreetbets,"I've gotta say, I do really miss BlockBuster. When you went there, you could get basically whatever movie you're looking for. Now there's a ton of different streaming services and they all have different movies at different times, so half the time you can't even watch what you're looking for."
2021-04-24 20:58:12,wallstreetbets,I have one of these for Enron any buyers out there?
2021-04-24 22:07:32,wallstreetbets,"If anyone could bring back Blockbuster, it's WSB!"
2021-04-24 23:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Man, I miss Blockbuster. More specifically, I miss working for Blockbuster. It was only my second serious job when I moved to a different state fresh out of high school to get away from an abusive home life. I had no money, no license, no prospects, just a friend willing to share an apartment. I'll never forget interviewing with the manager, I wish I could remember his last name because he was amazing but his first name was Christian. I was this super timid kind of stupid teen with next to no self esteem being interviewed by this charismatic man that was incredibly easy to talk to. At the end of the interview, he asked if I had any questions so I asked if I got the job, which made him laugh and ask me what I thought, so I said yes and he actually did end up hiring me. 

Growing up, I liked horror movies but working at that store turned me into a fanatic. It wasn't long before horror and foreign films were my knowledge niche and any customers looking for those kinds of films where sent my way. You developed a relationship with your regulars, got to know not just about their taste in movies but their lives. Between Christian and the good will of some of our regular customers, I was really able to blossom and start being my rando weirdo self in a place where it was encouraged rather than judged. They even helped me a lot with transportation when they found out I was walking back and forth to work. Aside from the job I have now, which is also crazy encouraging, this was the most wholesome place I ever worked for. I'm pretty sure that was largely due to the excellent management but it makes me think fondly of the company itself all the same. I really wish there was a way for them to make a comeback. I also wish there was a way I could find Christian and let him know how much his taking a chance on a derpy kid still means to me as an adult."
2021-04-24 23:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Bro don‚Äôt, people will take this serious."
2021-04-25 03:47:31,wallstreetbets,Blockbuster to the moonüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-04-24 20:24:20,wallstreetbets,Shut up and take my money
2021-04-24 20:38:22,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they still have one location in the south or something still could make a come back
2021-04-24 20:58:54,wallstreetbets,"That brings back wonderful Saturday night memories. Going to the local Blockbuster with my girlfriend to get a VHS and pay my over due fines. Then next door for a bottle of Tickle Pink and movie treats. Ahhh..., such innocence. Good times!!!"
2021-04-24 21:16:56,wallstreetbets,Can you still get a share like this from its liquidation stock? I‚Äôd honestly love to own it as a nostalgia thing.
2021-04-24 21:26:41,wallstreetbets,When did they stop issuing stock certificates? I have never seen a physical one.
2021-04-24 21:33:25,wallstreetbets,Penny stock

2021-04-24 22:18:14,wallstreetbets,Stock prices went up by 9.52%. your already in the green! Soon it'll be worth 3 cents
2021-04-24 22:22:03,wallstreetbets,Wait if each stock is like 2cents. If we all bought a bunch of stocks and maybe put like 10 bucks in... Could Redditors become the majority stock owner?

2021-04-24 20:46:19,wallstreetbets,Maybe a stupid question but would it be possible for Blockbuster to have a surge similar to GameStop ?

2021-04-24 21:49:06,wallstreetbets,How much is worth today? I bet that paper is worth more than what 1 actual share of Blockbuster was ever worth.
2021-04-24 22:18:55,wallstreetbets,"Oh fiddle-faddle with that humbuggery.  You could barter that today for a nice sack of tobacco, salt, or your choice of several other spices."

2021-04-24 22:58:31,wallstreetbets,TIL Blockbuster was still issuing paper shares in 2010. Guess there was more than one indicator of a business that just can‚Äôt stick with the times...

I wanted to do this for a friend, but what I googled seemed convoluted.

Ended up making a fake stock paper and giving him the money for him to buy it himself, but I would love to gift people paper ones. 

I didn't wanna use one of the commonly found sites because they upsell a lot of stocks by printing it for you so hopefully it wasn't that route."

2021-04-25 10:29:10,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs bring blockbuster back
2021-04-25 10:29:34,wallstreetbets,"Blockbuster is an outstanding contrast with Gamestop. Blockbuster began its turnaround into a destination for movie and game lovers with qualified staff WAY too late; I had no idea what the stores had become until they were already shutting down.

It wasn't internet streaming that killed them - remember Netflix was a mail service back then - it was that the experience of having a robot serve you was cheaper, easier, and less annoying than having a person hired only to have functioning arms and legs and a barely functional sense of vision was. Since Redbox only requires like one guy for a huge number of access points, boom, customers went there instead. The robot was better.

The lesson to take away from this is be superior to the robot. Gamestop still has time because the frontline employees there still care about video games and such and that managed to never change somehow."

You get to act out action sequenced from movies while shooting real guns at targets and we film you doing it so you get all these hilarious videos of grandma's in action scenes blasting bazookas n shit like Rambo.

The first ""scene"" in the theme park is you in a car being driven by a professional stunt driver. You stand up through the sunroof of the car and you're blasting an AK at these targets in a fake city while the stunt driver is racing around the place and explosions are going off. It would all be super safe out far away from the city. We will keep score and people can compete against each other for the title of ultimate action hero.

Did it with a few other shows too I think."
2021-04-24 22:57:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah? Perhaps you missed the convo. OP said he'd like to open a store that looked like a Blockbuster from the outside and functioned like a Blockbuster inside, however he would set it up so he also had the ability to put on shows. Movies, TV series, all sorts of stuff I assume. I'm also assuming, without going into too much detail, it would be more like a giant living room than a theater.

This being said, I don't know what the licensing agreements would entail or exactly how this would work, but I'm sure there's a possibility. It would be a niche market sure, however I think there's potential because, to me and evidently OP, it sounds pretty cool. I don't think it would function like your average movie theater."

2021-04-24 23:25:23,wallstreetbets,"The rental store always had like four video tape re-wind machines just sitting there ready to go. It was not an inconvenience to them. Pop it in shut the lid. Wait for it to pop again. Easier than a toaster.

I used to flirt with the female employees to try and get them to erase late fees or let me rent an NC-17 rated movie. I was probably 13-14 and usually failed. But it was a fun game to play.

Going to the movie rental place was an enjoyable weekend night endeavor back then. A person could spend a half-hour there, maybe socialize a bit, see what's new, and walk out with a killer movie or video game that you were committed to."
2021-04-25 00:09:34,wallstreetbets,"I worked at a video store. At least at Roadrunner, we rewound the tapes, but it was kind of a rare thing because most people rewound them. I guess the fees were good motivation...like carts at Aldi."
2021-04-25 00:42:54,wallstreetbets,"I used to work at a Movie Gallery in college. I can tell you from the perspective of an employee I gained an appreciation for the re-wind fee. At the end of the night we would have a bin full of VHS that had to be rewound before closing at night, or stop what we were doing to rewind if someone was waiting to rent. On a busy Friday or Saturday night there could be 50-70 tapes to rewind. It was also another source of revenue for the franchise."
2021-04-25 00:28:01,wallstreetbets,I remember some stores had coin slot to unlock a cart. Never recalled seeing a lose cart in those cases. Its amazing how organized people can be when their money is on the line.
2021-04-24 23:25:03,wallstreetbets,Leaving carts behind in a parking lot is job creation . Silver lining.
2021-04-24 23:38:40,wallstreetbets,I worked at a video store. We had a video tape rewinder. It wasn‚Äôt inconvenient at all. Took about a minute.
2021-04-25 00:31:03,wallstreetbets,Remember there where vhs tape rewinders so you didn't wear out your vcr? Mine looked like a corvette
2021-04-25 00:50:50,wallstreetbets,"The video store I worked at would rewind every tape just to make sure. 

On another note There used to be this thing where if a movie was really bad they'd leave the movie unrewound where they stopped watching to warn the next people that it was a crappy movie. At least that's what my dad said he was doing. Kind of pointless though if we were just rewinding everything anyways."
2021-04-25 00:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Having worked at both a video rental store then and a grocery store now. You're not far off. But trust me someone is doing that rewinding and cart collecting lol.

I don't remember there being a fee though. They definitely inconvenienced other people. Usually employees."
2021-04-25 01:31:58,wallstreetbets,"Our rental store, Hastings, had a habit of charging late fees no matter when you returned the game. I still kinda miss them though."

2021-04-25 18:18:39,wallstreetbets,When I was a kid my Mom had a machine to just rewind them since rewinding them in the VCR made the heads wear out faster. lol
2021-04-25 19:38:23,wallstreetbets,Fuck that. It is a mortal sin to return your VHS's without rewinding them. It was agony getting your new rental home and having to wait 5 mins before you could watch it.

As someone who almost pulled the trigger on buying a movie theater, I can assure you owning a rental store and a movie theater are two completely different games. If you rent out movies and try to do showings you need to ""buy permission"" and give a cut of the profits (different percent depending on how new the movie is). It's a huge hassle, but possible. Just don't know why you'd want to mix the two business models and pay double licenses. It wouldn't be profitable unless it got you extra main business, like showing movies at a pub drives business. Showing movies at a rental place probably wouldn't increase rental sales much at all."

Across the street was a gas station that also had movies. 

Everybody suddenly had a VCR around 1988 or so and renting movies was the cool thing to do. I lived in a small college town and you could rent tapes at a couple dozen locations. 

There was a place in my town that had VHS rental/arcade/tanning salon. It was called Tapedeck."

Lots of great discussions and introductions were had to music and movies...and selecting a cd or dvd/vhs was an experience, from cover art to watch/listen.  Going to the movies (next to the mall) was another great time...and everything was interlaced.

Instant access/gratification has its pros, but goddamn do I miss 1999. It was pinnacle for the era of tangible/physical media/entertainment. I am hopeful that there is another 'social' consumer boom that pulls people away from home streaming after everyone (yeah...I know) is vaccinated.

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MinMed is a bubble Edit 1: Tried to warn y‚Äôall

As an MD, MPH going into psychiatry residency, I‚Äôve been following this stock for a while. Never bought into it because I‚Äôm not an OTC special kinda retard. What is it? Multinational Pharma research company dealing with psychedelics such as psilocybin and MDMA. It‚Äôs about to be listed on the NASDAQ on April 27th under the ticket $MNMD. Friday, the stock price jumped 65%.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, these therapies are on the path for FDA approval... eventually. The research insofar has been promising for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. But MindMed doesn‚Äôt have anything past phase 2 clinical trials. THERE IS NO INDICATION THEY WILL GET ANYTHING ONTO THE MARKET IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. According to the FDA, about 33% of drugs which make it to phase 2 actually pass onto phase 3. That being said: if you‚Äôre willing to take those odds and have disposable income, have at it. But also think about the clinical practicality. On the company‚Äôs website, they describe their therapy as giving patients psilocybin, blindfolding them, and giving them headphones with a special playlist so they can vibe out FOR 8 HOURS.
How is this practical in an outpatient doctor‚Äôs office? Until there is an abortive treatment for psilocybin trips, I don‚Äôt see this working out on a large scale.
Sure, the stock will likely pop off for a couple days. But it has been WAY overhyped by stock subreddits. I‚Äôm planning to play this with deep OTM CCPs and buying puts for 1-2 months down the road when they become available. üìâüìâüìâ üåà üêª

If you had done solid DD you would know that LSD is their #1 psychedelic for therapy. ... You didn‚Äôt even mention their blockbuster, 18MC, either. 


Also their clinical trials have a much better shot at advancing compared to other types of drugs. Most trials don‚Äôt consist of compounds that have been used for decades (centuries for some) and have a well known safety profile that just needs reassured to the FDA through the proper pathways. 


Also it‚Äôs been known for a solid year that they have an off switch for tripping. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/psychedelic-pharmaceutical-company-mindmed-develops-lsd-neutralizer-technology-to-shorten-and-stop-lsd-trips-301044721.html

2021-04-25 11:20:34,wallstreetbets,"They're also way more expensive ü§î 

All other EV companies are still half a decade behind tesla in terms of cost and tech. Tesla could make a car to stomp those ones (roadster 2021/2022) but that's not really their goal, their goal is to be a general electric car company, and general companies are far far more profitable than niche fancy cars.

I don't own any tesla stock, but you gotta be realistic about each companies respective position in the game"
2021-04-25 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoint on LUCID.

The cars look gorgeous inside and out(been to one of their show rooms here in California) but their entry level price point is not at all competitive at 65k, moreover they have absolutely no self driving at that point whereas as 40k Tesla does. 

NIO‚Äôs at least a little better at 50k and has battery swap to keep it competitive and a foothold on the largest market on the planet.

Polestar(by volvo) also interests me but it also has LUCID‚Äôs price point issue."

2021-04-25 11:05:18,wallstreetbets,"Can‚Äôt forget about the US unemployment insurance that gave money to people in need during the pandemic, then turned around and slapped 1/4 of the people using that system with a felony charge of fraud, and asked them to pay 1.5X what they received in benefits. 

People already living without jobs, because they lost their jobs during the pandemic, used government money to feed themselves, their kids, keep a roof over everyone‚Äôs head, etc. all the while unemployment insurance agency was planning to hit them with the 1.5X payback rate.

People are running rampant because of this. People are taking their lives because they can‚Äôt feed their children nor themselves, and they take their own life because they know a foster care would give their child a better life than they could. That is the state of the economy currently, maybe not in whole, but it‚Äôs happening. Your speculation with the US having problems is totally correct. 

Remember when the pandemic hit and news casting officials spoke about our streak without a public shooting in America. There has been over a dozen since this year started. 3 public shootings per month. America has its problems, and they are bad. Can‚Äôt defend a country that screws it‚Äôs own people."

2021-04-24 22:10:07,wallstreetbets,It was mainly a correction from earlier this year.  The last offering was sold at $19/share.  This should sit well above that price on any given day.  But with all the attention this surely will fly to above $30 soon.

2021-04-25 11:58:31,wallstreetbets,I think that is a good analysis that everyone has. But think about it. It is going to rocket in your analysis. Why would people wait for the dip before getting in? This is the most watched stock right now. People will be competing for an entry point against hundreds or even thousands of people and there are also people looking to add more shares on their portfolio on Monday. This will just rocket.
2021-04-25 00:24:49,wallstreetbets,Future rich?  Only if you inverse me.
2021-04-25 12:17:55,wallstreetbets,I want to see that dip to see if I can get a standing order filled on a May 23c that will leg me into a 23/24 call spread at a net debit of .07 and uncover my leaps position so when the rocket takes off my upside is uncapped.

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NrdRage's Friday DD...on a Saturday. Market is as confused as a Zoomer exposed to good music, so instead of something new, let's re-visit the last DD's, see where they shook out, and update them (DD ""Where are they now"" 30 for 30 edition) Hola!   NrdRage here.  My apologies  for not posting this yesterday, but  Reddit, with their extreme ethics  (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for  upvoting a couple of comments my  daughter made about motorcycle  safety.  Good to see their priorities are  in order, An upvote from the  same NAT, that's way more important than  employment background checks  on pedophile enablers, right Reddit?

Given   that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously,   embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to   find a layup for everybody next week.  Think I've found one, but with   that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to   name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act   of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty  more  of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to  normalize  the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in  the world).   So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I  haven't deleted  because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and  update them and  where I am with them.  This should hopefully, for at  least a day, stop  people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and  jumping in then  wondering why the trade is different.  Oh, who am I  kidding, I know you  fucks, nothing will stop that.  At the very least,  it should shut up the  small group of people who played the trades wrong  and declared them  broken.  Let's start from February, so right after  the first round of  people who ""liked the stock""

# DD #1:  $PLTR.  Original Date January 27th, 2021

&#x200B;

[I tried to tell you retards](https://preview.redd.it/pqrvl3j266v61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59d3513e9581b0babd63301fc9dd1cb8482387)

**URL:**    Ended up deleting it - not because the DD was wrong, but because the   Palantards got it to about -700 karma and I decided to let them get   crushed.

**Original thesis:**    $PLTR (then $35) was wildly overpriced based not only on their market   cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a   result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years,   their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended,   but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad,   George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he   controlled for ""ethical reasons"" (hah!).  Oh, and because Peter Thiel   participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech   elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to   harm his ventures.

**Original price target:**    I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people  should  open $25 puts expiring in late March.  In later comment updates,  I  stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly  eclipsed  25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around  22, as  that's its rangebound territory.

**How did it work/what has changed:**   Not a single thing.  It was literally impossible to screw this trade  up  unless you went against it.  So, of course, most of this sub did  just  that and lost money.

**What the smart play is on it today:**   I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I  buy  a biweekly $22 call.  Easy money that I will then put on the end of  a  fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard.

**Trade rating:**  10/10.  15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub.

# DD #2:  Weed Stonks.  Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rsk2tbc566v61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf756ce0a9fad711fd9fce0af241b7768ec065c3

URL:  [Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6ttf/pass_the_bong_and_gather_round_bros_were_gonna/)

**Original thesis:**     You're the bad kind of retarded if you were throwing money into  SNDL.   If you wanted a ""cheap"" stock, you should go with one that  doesn't put  fucking rubber and plastic in their weed - so to buy a  stock like  Organigram instead if you could remember their stupid  fucking name.   $APHA and $TLRY should be joined at the hip and either  APHA must come up  or TLRY must come down.  Talked about $CGC and $ACB,  though didn't  endorse them.  Matter of fact, I didn't really endorse  any of them.   This DD was more about ""well, I can't tell you not to do  this stupid  thing, but if you're going to do it, at least make less bad  choices  amongst the stupid ones"".  Way to make me feel like a pearl  clutching  Boomer parent, assholes.

**Original Price Target:**    I didn't give any, because it was all obviously a bubble and I was   mostly advising people to be careful with the play, but to pick better   companies if you were going to jump in on it.

**How did it work out/what has changed:**    If you read between the lines and TRADED (read:  Scalped like Crazy   Horse) these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared   pretty well.  All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started   their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while   before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY).  My own   results were originally mixed on this.  I made a lot of money scalping   Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it   collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners.  I made some   pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it   all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on   the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on   Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a   complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a   chance.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    Don't touch any of them.  The reality is, long term, these Canadian   companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even   if the product is federally legalized.  But, more importantly, the one   thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they  are  absolutely TERRIBLE at execution.  This is why you don't make  stoners  CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're  passionate about  the product.  They've got the easiest product out  there to sell, and no  matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find  a way to trip over  it.

**What you should play instead if you want to get in this space:**     $MO.  Yeah, you heard me, $MO.  Think about this a moment:  These   guys sell tobacco.  A product that they are forbidden from marketing or   even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores,  which  has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or  even  being MENTIONED in public because of regulations.  A product  which in  some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in  your  vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job  and  question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5  minutes  of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's  to  finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a  year.   Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers **know how to execute.**    And they're already in America.  You don't think that they won't be  at  the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized?  You don't  think  they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf?  You don't  think  they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF  store  they can find once they're allowed to?  Fuck outta here.

**Trade rating:**    8/10:  You made money if you followed it and got out a week later,  you  made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire  sector  and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of  Sundial  like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short  time later,  so the upside was very limited.

# DD #3:  $BB.  Original Date February 12th, 2021

&#x200B;

URL:  [Right here, bitch-o](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liezfr/nrdrages_friday_dd_theres_still_one_meme_stock/)

**Original Thesis:**    Using another company that pivoted from enterprise applications to   automotive ($NUAN) and has no competition, extrapolated long term   earnings potential of a company pivoting from phones to secure   automotive and fleet management.

**Original Price Target:**    87.50.....in 2023.  My positions were very early, so my average PPS  is  7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game.  I  have  since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of  like  80 cents.

**How did it work out:**    Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number   reflected a mammoth spike in equity price.  The only reason this  company  isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart  vehicle  dominance is because of the damned chip shortage.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer.  Grab   the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no   more than 50 or 60 cents).   You'll still be a massive disappointment to   your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're   starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your   refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise.  Hey,   speaking of....

**Trade rating:**    5/10:  I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge   profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to   consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst.

# DD #4:  Cruise lines.  Original Date February 19th, 2021üì∑

&#x200B;

[Not mine.  But I wants it.](https://preview.redd.it/onkncs8c66v61.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b139c61852f25bfc1b0a4d831afc7aa42eebf86d)

**URL:**  [For you poor bastards who missed this boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnpqrp/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_bermuda_triangle_and_you/)

**Original Thesis:**   The cruise liners were one of the last Wuhan-fucked plays   out       there     who hadn't taken a true turn at the recovery wheel   just   yet.      Which   made   them smooth sailing for easy tendies

**Original Price Target January 2022:**  $NCLH 46, $CCL/$CUK 47/42 respectively, $RCL $90.  My     positions      were    established a month and a half before the DD, so     my cost   basis    was    different.  I was holding 700 1/22 25c's in   $CCL and   2000 1/23    $42.5c's    in $NCLH.

**How did it work out:**    If you jumped in shortly thereafter and played the stocks      right,     you    made enough to buy your own boat.  Sure, maybe it  was  a    17'     Bayliner    that all the women at the marina called    ""adorable""   and  were    clearly    conflating towards what they    assumed was your    pathetic 2.5""    penis size    at diamond hardness,    but it floated, it    had an engine,   and  dammit, it    was yours  and   you had enough left    over for a   captain's  hat and a bunch     of   beer money.  This one  was   hard to screw   up -  especially since  it    was   the first one I   started  providing   updates on  and made  sure    everybody   knew to take   profits  at 32 on   NCLH and buy   back at  29  (and  to continue     playing that  range), etc.    People  in  these   from the date  of posting   who   didn't  just buy and    hold likely    have turned at least a 6    bagger by now.     This trade  was,   and to   some  extent is, still solid    gold.

**What's happened since then:**              In spite of none of the companies in question needing to    issue        shares   as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued    shortly  after    that    DD,  $CCL  immediately copied them, and $NCLH    followed  suit a    couple   of  weeks   after $CCL.  At least none of    them tried  to pull  an   $AMC  and   have the   CEO go on TV and  give   zero credit  to retail    investors  for   saving the   company  and   instead taking  all the  credit   before  diluting   and then    paying   himself a fat ass  bonus  for doing   nothing  but issuing    shares like     some sort of  conquering  hero.  The   amount of  the  dilution   in   question   meant  that the  resistance  price  of (to  use  as example,     $NCLH) of $32 a    share  already  represented a   higher  price than   the   pre-virus share   price.    Ditto  for the  other  2.   Investors   haven't seem   to have  noticed,    however,   and these  stocks  still   trade in the  general   range,  though the     resistance  level is now    more like 31/25/85.    Also,  the  sailing    schedules  for  the   domestic  cruise ships has  been  pushed   back  as a   result of     somebody high up at  the CDC  obviously  shorting    these  stocks,  as    that's  the only  explanation  for why they're   so   focused  on trying   to   send these  companies to 0   by  preventing   sailings.    Norwegian  is  resuming  cruises  outside  the  US in the next   couple  of   months.

**What the smart play is today:**              These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result  of     the        dilution, but they're still good swing traders within   their       respective     channels.  I'd put up a picture of some   charts to  show      those, but I     already told you where the   resistance is,  grow a      wrinkle and learn  where    support is.

I          have since   exited  my positions in $CCL (and was never in    $RCL),     and   have   drastically  reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I    do  still     maintain a    skeleton crew  of January calls for them.

**Trade rating:**              9/10.  It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you    just        didn't   believe me. And it's still a live trade.  The only    thing  I       could have   done better was post it sooner, but I  make   sure my    trades     are   established and going the right way  before I   talk  about   them in     depth.

# DD #5:  The Semiconductors:  Original Date February 26th, 2021

&#x200B;

[And before you ask, yes it is.  Took this the other day when I   decided    to    start working on this. In retrospect, should have   washed first.](https://preview.redd.it/y6vlid9g66v61.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bfae5eeadc261cda360675c53f44c33d6ca1582)

**URL:** [For you poor, broke ass souls who missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)

**Original Thesis:**          While everybody was spooging over high end chipmakers like  Theta        Semiconductor, $AMD, and $NVDA (and, to be fair, I had been   telling       people to buy $NVDA 545/580c's, which were all   multibaggers), the   real     action was in the commodity level   chipmaker space,  specifically    American   companies (or companies   that could masquerade  as them) who    would line   up to the trough to   get some free  government money to go    from being   nofab to fab   companies.

**Original Price Target:**          $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3  months,       $MRVL  to 75 within that same range.  And I didn't give a  price   target     for  $UTZ, just that it would go up.

**How did it work out:**          LAMBOS for almost everyone!  Supposing you could order one,   given      that  they can't get the chips they need to build the cars.       $NXPI   got   to  214 before pulling back to 202.  $ON hit 43 2  weeks   before I     predicted  it would.  $MRVL failed to live up to    expectations and has     been  essentially dead money since that    posting, but if you'll  recall I    was  very explicit that I was    bullish on them ONLY as a 5G  play,   whereas  the  others I felt had    more range and scope.  So  short-term   $MRVL play  was a  loser if you    moved up the timeline I  liked.  Oh, and   $UTZ printed  for   everybody   that just bought in  because they liked the   product.  It   was a   nice  little pocket play.

**What's happened since then:**          The trade ran its course to perfection.  As I've been saying  for  a       little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are  not     presently    an interesting trade because there's been a  rotation out  of    them  after   this period of growth.  I am still  incredibly  bullish  on   the  sector as a   whole, but they need a  breather and  some time  out  of  the  sun before   continuing a leg up.   They're not  even good   rangebound   trades right now.    And LOL @  any of you  clowns who bought   $TSM  anyways  because Cramer  and his  cult of  Shortbus All-Stars   told  you  they were  the best in breed.   Suckers.    In the case of  $MRVL,  they  acquired  another company and  now are  going  to  ""officially""  become a US  company  instead of that  tax  dodging shit   they've been  pulling, which  means the  thesis  about  them lining up for   gubmint  money is sound and  will happen   down the  road.

**What the smart play is today:**         Ignore semis till at least June; probably July.  I have exited   out    of   all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the      commodity   semis.  I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the  top,     though I am   willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range  if  it    happens.  Don't   be sad that the trade is over, be glad that  it     happened and you might   have been there.  Or at least be happy  that I     was there and am   appreciative that I got to stack a bunch  more  paper    I'll never spend.    Either way.

**Trade rating:**  9/10.  Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning.

**URL:** [Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass ""DD"" on their stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/)

**Original Thesis:**         People are finally willing to take greenhouse gas emission   capture      seriously, and the infrastructure and transport sector is   finally   ready    to start moving away from diesel and traditional oil   based   products  in   favor of carbon negative renewable natural gas -     especially  companies   making carbon pledges or located in states   where   progressive  leadership   is going to demand emission reduction.     $CLNE  was uniquely  positioned  as  the nation's leading provider  of   that  fuel source and,  unlike all  the  other green energy   EV/charging   companies out there,  actually has a  real  product that   they sell in   large quantities, making  it a diamond in  the  otherwise   pipe dream   green energy space.

**Original Price Target:**  $17 by late May, $31 by next March

**How did it work out:**         I said to buy it as soon as it got under 11.  It got under 11  the      very  next trading day.  Then immediately shot up almost 50%  within   10    days  and was one of the few stocks out there  consistently   finishing    green  while the entire market was tanking.   As long as you   played it    smart and  heeded warnings about stonks  not always just   going up and    taking profit  after parabolic rises  and looking for   re-entries later,    then you made  enough money to  put RNG high powered   engines in both  your   boat from  cruise stocks  and your Lambo from   semis and convert  your   entire house to  being  powered by cow farts   before the green  energy   sector got   skullfucked.  If you held, you'll   feel this trade  didn't   work out   (though it still will, if you   picked the June target  date like   I  said)  and, if you re-entered   after taking profits, you've  either    been  averaging down lately as   this has been getting unfairly  dragged    down  with the entire green   energy sector or else you're   underwater on    it....but you'll still be   fine.

**What's happened since then:**         A LOT.  From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the     way    to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major      partnerships   with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion      dollar deal  with  $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to      Washington DC  flat-out  stating that methane capture is a capstone  of     their green  energy plan,  there has been nothing but good news  coming     out of this  company.  And  yet It got absolutely PUMMELED  with the     sector for the  last month, and  then this past week  started Monday     morning up 27% only  to not only give  all of those  gains back but  lose    another 20% by the  close of trading  Tuesday  because of a  combination    of market  manipulation by a hedge fund   that shorted the  stock into    oblivion for a  hit and run (do a search  on my profile by  posts and  look   up my Wednesday discussion if you  want to be  absolutely fucking    infuriated that someone borderline  committed a  crime) coupled with them    paying off an analyst at RayJay  to run a hit  piece on the $AMZN deal  to   try and sink  the stock  price even lower,  right down to that hedge   fund  suppressing  the  price of the stock  for 2 weeks to keep it under   $12 so  the most   popular options for  April would expire worthless.    This  company has,  in  short, been  subjected to a biblical level of   fuckery  that was  probably  was some  Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1   bet, and  it's  still  standing and  ready to spring. Oh, and somebody   informed  me  that they  got some  airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th.    Jimmy  Retard  is luekwarm on   them, and you should always inverse him,   so  balls to the  wall, baby.    Especially since he tried to compare the    2009 version of  this  company  (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat   gas)  with the 2021   version (where  governments are going to force   people  into this type  of  product and the  transport industry is   finally  transitioning away  from  oil).

**What   the smart play  is today:**    My thesis, as written back then, is  EXACTLY  what I would  write even   today.  I stand by every last thing  in there,  including  the strike date   and price, in spite of the hedge  fund  bullshit that  artificially tanked the stock for no reason other  than  unmitigated  greed.  It was my   favorite stock in the whole  market then,  and it  still is now, just   balanced against the  knowledge that, as a  very  small midcap bordering on   a small cap,  it's easy to push around  and  very clearly fucked some hedge fund  manager's wife or something. If  you  don't believe me, every   analyst  out there says this company is  worth  double what it's at now. My  original position still exists, except now  it's bigger and I'm also the  owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares  on top of it that I was  gobbling up like a porn star eating all the  money shots in an episode  of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.   Nobody was talking about it before that DD.  You made a   multi-bagger in  just a few days if you jumped in, and even though   you're battered and  bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because   of the manipulation  from a hedge, you're still going to make mad   tendies with this one.   They've got EVERYTHING going for them,   corporate America is looking to  them for the carbon negative fuel as an   easy way to lower their  footprints, no competition other than a  shitty  (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first   capture plant  who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians   demanding  carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they  reside  in,  actually have a product and make money.

**URL:** [Lazy bitch can't even search for it yourself?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3mhkm/nrdrages_friday_dd_spring_is_in_the_air_the_birds/)

**The thesis:**     The clusterfuck in Texas this past winter, combined with  California's   annual inability to provide even basic electricity to its  residents as   the state burns to the ground and they try to push  everybody into  EV's,  created a unique opportunity for a green energy  company that  existed  completely in its own space:  Weather immune  green energy  microgrids  that could scale to any size, literally NEVER  go down as has  been proven  by large-scale pilots in Delaware and Cal  Tech,  and  didn't have the  drawbacks of batteries.  Oh, and  politicians finally  acknowledging that  our utility grid is well beyond  end of life and hot  garbage and not  wanting voters blaming them for  citizen deaths being  willing to spend  taxpayer money to address that.

**Original Price Target:**  70% conviction of a $32 price by mid-April, 45-50 by August, and a long term target of $72

**How did it work out:**    I  had the unfortunate pleasure of posting this DD right as the  entire   green energy space was being crushed by big money rotating into   ""value""  and later into ""the 10 biggest companies in the S&P to  make  SPY go  up"", so things haven't gone as planned to this point.  The   stock has  actually fallen from the 27's all the way down into the  22's,  though it  has rebounded this week and looks to be starting a  fresh  run.  It's a  bit of a hail Mary, but that 5/21 32c that I was  hyping  back then....it  might still print.  Though even I rolled over  my May  calls to August at  the same strike to buy more time to make up  for them  getting dragged  down with a bunch of companies that aren't  even in the  same space as  these dudes.

**What happened since then:**     They haven't announced any big deals, but I know they're working on    some.  And they set up a new global office in Dubai to start marketing    their products worldwide, which should only give them tailwinds going    forward.

**What the smart play is today:**     I still stand behind everything written in that DD, with the only    thing I'd like to change is the expiry date on the calls from May to    August.  And again, if you're sitting on May calls that are way, WAY    down....I wouldn't cut bait with them just yet just because they're    already almost worthless and there's still a puncher's chance they fight    back.  This thing has started to get some life, and I wouldn't bet    against it being able to hit that strike in a month - well, I wouldn't    bet a lot.  I would just feel better if it were 4.  Long term, this is    still going to be a great investment.

**Trade rating:**    I was  going to give this one a 2/10 just because it had been going   almost  straight down for weeks now killing the May expirys, but the   longer  calls and shares are still very much alive, but I'm going to   upgrade it  to a 3.5 because it's made some good movement, and I will   cross my  fingers that, by this time next month, I'll call it a 6.

**URL:** [How was this one of my most popular DD's?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8inij/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_absolute_shittiest_company/)

**The thesis:**     Simple:  A re-opening play.  $RYCEY is one of the only companies in    the world that has not rebounded from the pandemic, and as soon as    people start flying en masse again, demand for their engines (and    maintenance contracts) will start buoying the stock price

**How did it work out:**     I said buy shares and tuck them away.  The stock hasn't really moved    since that DD, and should still be tucked away.  The condition for   their  recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore,   it's  not their turn yet.

**What happened since then:**     People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows.  Especially    the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to    qualify as being in a pandemic.  Dumbasses.

**What the smart play is today:**  Same as it was then.  Buy shares.  Hold.  My positions haven't changed.

**Trade rating:**  4/10.  Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there.

**The thesis:**   One of the  few biotech companies in the world worth betting on long  term.   Transformational technology, market leader.  Also, gave me an   opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because   of my, to be charitable ""un-PC"" vernacular, she declined to put her  name  on the DD).

**Original Price Target:**  50 by mid June, 60's by 2021

**How did it work out:**    We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are  still  developing and can't yet be judged.  The stock, typical of every   biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market.  It opened up   big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that   point.  The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the   thesis is still sound.

**What happened since then:**   The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued,  especially after President Harris  proposed increasing the cap gains  tax to the highest in the world.

**What the smart play is today:**    I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still   attractive.  I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's,   however.  My position has not changed.

**Trade Rating:**  Incomplete.  Still developing.  I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart.

# DD #10:  $NEE.  Original Date April 9th, 2021

**URL:** [You're late, but here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnksim/nrdrages_friday_dd_ill_take_a_mackinnon_jersey_2/)

**The thesis:**    The $ICLN ETF, which was mostly just $PLUG, was rebalancing in a big   way; Blackrock would thus be purchasing massive quantities of shares of   stock in the new companies.  $NEE was uniquely positioned because it  had  the stability and rotation safety of a value stock, but the  multiple of  a growth stock

**Price targets:**  I said definitely take profits at 83, and my positions were June 75's and 77.50's.

**How did it work out:**    Flawlessly.  The stock basically rocketed to $80 as Blackrock   purchased shares much more aggressively than anticipated, and anyone who   played this trade with me and watched volume would have noticed the   volume fell off a cliff and took profits before it started creeping back   down (as everybody else was taking profits, too).  I exited my   positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned,   humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power.

**What happened since then:**    The share price has started to pull back, which was expected.    Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play   earnings in this environment.

**What the smart play is today:**    This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a   rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots   of money.  This is still a really well run company but the short-term   thesis is no longer valid.  The DD will stay up only as a display of  the  company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you  want  to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor.  I pulled out  all of  my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.  Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete,   and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies.  No   matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was   green and stayed that way the whole time.

# DD #11:  $ISRG.  Original Date April 16th, 2021:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ms2pwzhs66v61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d5a30b34e00bb9b21c4571cbc053739206ce54

**URL:** [Thus proving I'm not the Zombie Jew](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms51jy/nrdrages_friday_dd_a_robot_may_not_injure_a_human/)

**The thesis:**    A pure earnings play that I didn't really want to write, but my 1st   idea ($PLUG puts) ran its course before Friday.  Analysts had been   lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was   saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar   quarter.  Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are   still closed.

**Price Targets:**    As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested   going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the  stock  fell by 60 or 70 bucks.

**How did it work out:**    Not even slightly.  At all.  Absolutely TERRIBLE call.  They blew the   doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered  analyst  expectations.  Sales were up.  Procedures were up.  Everything  was up.   Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot  up 5% and  blasted through all-time-highs.  This was a big time loser  of a trade.

**So why did it happen:**   I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did  all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off.  It turns out  $ISRG  accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment,  and  also had an increase in inventory.  This means that they had a bunch  of  extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them  to  medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many   more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales),   and also lowered their expenses for the quarter.  These are neat tricks   that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG   to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the   wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment.  So, in a   way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have   been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to   account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale   pricing to ensure a quarterly beat.  Which is something I'll remember   next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies   almost 90% of  the time.

**What the smart play is today:**    The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and   then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going   to go up.  However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even   long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't   already in, you should probably stay away from.  However, buried in that   DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I   wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in  them.   I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read  between  the lines,  to say you covered your puts after that and went  into  calls.  So those are paying off.  As the green energy sector is  starting  to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that,  so  there's a play there.

**Trade rating:**    1/10.  It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had   read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there   about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this   otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.

All my love

2021-04-25 01:18:31,wallstreetbets,u/NrdRage I feel ya on $CLNE and all your points seem solid. What about public sentiment however?

2021-04-25 00:03:43,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-25 03:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Solid write-ups. Thanks for sharing. I missed the cruise ride up, but came out with solid gains on the way down right from the peak a few weeks ago (mostly RCL). I also managed to get some NCLH puts the evening before the last dilution, which printed nicely (I paid $0.01 per and sold them the next morning at over a buck each). 

This is why I missed the ride up (aside from not seeing your DD, lol):

I personally do not understand even the current valuation of any of the big 3: RCL, CCL, NCLH. The ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù targets being thrown by many analysts out there (up to $40!) are little nutty, IMO. For example, NCLH peaked at around $60 before the collapse. At the time, they had about 213M shares outstanding. Today those shares are trading at about $30 and there are at least 368M of them out there. Their debt shot up from ~$7B to ~$12B during this time. Cash on hand of about $3B is still burning daily and will be until at least midsummer (with a very good possibility extending to at least mid-late fall). How is this a 30-dollar stock, currently? Even with bookings being back up to what they were pre-covid (although I remember the RCL CEO taking about very favourable 2022, not 2021, just a few weeks ago -> more cash burn), on the balance sheet it is not the same company as it was in January 2020.

Furthermore, they currently don‚Äôt really have any revenue and burning cash daily. There is a lot of uncertainty about the future, like shitload a lot. There is also a good likelihood of some green regulations coming rather sooner than later, which all the cruisers will need more cash for.

Their market cap went from ~$13B to the current ~$11B, while EV from ~$20B to ~$18B. All rough numbers, of course. IMO, this valuation is beyond bullish. 

Personally, I do not see what all the excitement is about, but I will gladly collect the tendies when they are coming."
2021-04-25 08:24:25,wallstreetbets,"u/NrdRage , love the concept of this DD, love to see old DDs being revisited and reviewed.

Question for you: what do you expect to be the stocks on your list that grow the most over the next few years? I mean your price target for BB (which I‚Äôm long on too) is about 10x current price which would be so incredible haha. 

Anything you‚Äôre hoping comes close to it for share price growth? CLNE / RIOT perhaps?"

2021-04-25 03:08:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm still giving that some thought.  On the one hand, this ""highest capital gains tax in the world"" thing is never going to happen.  On the other, merely sabre rattling about it can cause money to flee the markets.  I've got 3 calls next week alone about possibly divesting some equity assets and moving them into something that isn't subject to that sort of thing (read:  Real estate) just as a hedge against any potential tax increase or attempt to make them retroactive.

&#x200B;

For the record, big moves upwards in $SPY is almost always caused by low volume.  It also typically means that money is flowing into only a handful of the 500 companies represented."
2021-04-25 03:17:18,wallstreetbets,"So, a constructive criticism:  


By ""quite a few tech companies"", I hope you mean ""pretty much all of them"".  But that's not the thing we need to discuss.  What drew me to your comment was your relation of $AMD to the chip shortage.

&#x200B;

I feel you may not fully understand the company you've invested in.  $AMD isn't experiencing a chip shortage.  Both they and $NVDA are churning out product at full capacity, as are their AIB's on the GPU side.  The chip shortage ONLY exists in the commodity level chip sector (so chips for cars, 5G towers, low performance systems, etc.), not the high performance sector.  The fact that you can't find any of their processors or GPU's is not because of a shortage of silicon but rather because of a generational level of demand due to a whole confluence of happenings.  Which sounds good on paper, but what this actually does, in effect, is places a cap upon $AMD's earnings ceiling.  

&#x200B;

I'm not saying $AMD is a bad company.  Su Bae made me a lot of money, they fire on all cylinders, and they crippled $INTC with one of the great ambushes of all time.  I'm just saying your thesis of them having some sort of blowout of earnings has a flaw in that it's predicated upon something they don't experience, and most of their sales are baked in because analysts understand what their total production capacity is."
2021-04-25 16:07:51,wallstreetbets,"That was the result of having to copy/paste it 300 times trying to figure out what the automod was angry about. Every time you do that, Reddit starts inserting white space."

2021-04-24 20:30:09,wallstreetbets,"That was just another attempt at a hit piece, I think.  What securities fraud?  The executive leadership has been BUYING shares of their own company, not dumping them, so clearly they think things are going OK.  There are no accounting irregularities.  There has been no controversy.  The only thing I can think of is some investor looking to make a quick buck is going to try and claim a problem because the $AMZN deal involves issuing warrants for shares (which is very similar to what $PLUG did with $AMZN, except $CLNE put a real price on them).  I called that law firm on Friday to get some details, but they wouldn't even take my call.  I'm calling bullshit."
2021-04-25 06:51:52,wallstreetbets,"I did as well. Misinterpreted the DD as the buying would start on the 19th, not finish then. I copped 80c after the earnings dip.

2021-04-25 12:55:19,wallstreetbets,"Did the meme companies that BE gets associated with (ie PLUG) get in as well?

2021-04-25 03:46:34,wallstreetbets,"That's how it's always been.  But influential people understand, I think, that electric is not feasible for long-haul transport.  You simply can't have a truck stopping for 4 hours to recharge every 300 miles.  Multilayer solid state battery cells are still years and YEARS away.  And companies like $QS, who are trying to make it reality, might never be able to figure it out.  Electric only works for passenger vehicles.  Meaning long haul is either going to have to go hydrogen or nat gas.  Hydrogen still isn't built out in terms of infrastructure and they're still figuring out how to make the damn batteries work.  Nat gas, on the other hand, is already built out and so long as you route your trips properly, you can go from one end of the country to the other with a nat gas engine.

&#x200B;

$CLNE's big mistake 10, 15 years ago was that they were trying to change the world by getting consumer automotives into that fuel source. That was never going to happen.  Over the last few years, they've shifted their focus to commercial and heavy duty, and that's starting to pay real dividends.  Once $CMI announced they had built a new RNG powered engine for semis, the move started."

2021-04-25 15:46:28,wallstreetbets,"NEE was my first options trade. Bought a single 5/21 80C after the DD at around $1.50 premium (so $150 for the 100 shares). Premium went up to around $2.75 a share (so could of sold this call option for $275), but didn't sell thinking there was still a month to go for the stock to go up (and simultaneously the option). 

This call option is currently floating around .90-1.00 (so can only sell this call option for $100)."
2021-04-25 03:32:29,wallstreetbets,"So the 20c is aggressive at this point, though 2 months is a long time for a stock that can move 10% in a day and nobody would even consider it weird.  

&#x200B;

I guess, if it were me in that situation, I'd look at doing 1 of 3 things depending on my financial situation:

&#x200B;

\-If I had the powder and owned, say, 10 contracts at 1.15, buying 30 more at .2 to take the average down to .44 and hoping for a big up day to get me cost neutral and get the hell out of the trade or at least get me out with a bare minimum of damage.  IV crush isn't going to get you with this type of equity.

\-If I didn't have the powder or had no confidence I was going to be able to close that gap, I'd probably cut bait at .2 and find some more reasonable strikes at .4 and go with half of the option calls on them.

\-Or I'd roll them over a month further out, which would cost a similar amount to no. 2

&#x200B;

At $18 a contract, hardly worth even selling them at that point; for that price, I'd just ride it out and hope for a miracle."

2021-04-25 08:13:22,wallstreetbets,"What about battery swapping?

BTW, I'm a truck driver. Most of our deliveries are inside 150 mile range and 300 round trip. That's a 8 hour shift with loading, unloading, and dot mandated 30 minute unpaid break.

300 mile range isn't suitable for long haul unless they can swap batteries. But for travel from distribution centers and crossdock logistic points to nearby stores and factories it's totally doable for a significant portion of truck shipping. With energy recovering breaking systems trucks used for multiple stop deliveries in cities (like from a Napa warehouse to regional stores) could probably go even further with current battery tech. Those guys are out and back to the warehouse in about 10 hours leaving  14 hours for recharging.

A shuffle of the routes to reduce shifts to 8 hours could allow truck utilization for 16 hours a day with two 4 hour charging periods."

2021-04-25 19:55:37,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt know about the shareholder perks. Interesting. Is that really a thing though and will people be grabbing shares because of that? I did a quick search and all I could find was that owners of at least 100 shares get an on-board credit of $50 to $250, depending on the length of sailing. That credit is not compatible with any other offers however (discounted cruises fall into that ‚Äúcannot be combined‚Äù category, from my understanding, and that is all it‚Äôs going to be about for while, imo; just go to the deals on their webpage and see the hefty discounts they currently offer). I am thinking that instead it will be greedy investors who will be grabbing those shares on any hint at some positive news, disregarding the fundamentals. But that works just the same and probably better, lol. 

Regardless, yours was a good call. There appears to be some solid support just above $26 and it is at a resistance now; the next resistance seats at ~$33 (these numbers are from a quick glance), so there are some swing money to be made there. Due to the way of the current market, there surely will be some swings to take advantage of too.

Thinking cruising can also be pitched as a safer way to travel given the vaccinations and increased safety procedures, while covid rips through most of the world.

The herd mentality coalesces around mods, punishing contrarianism, be it humor or stocks unsupported by the group. This produces group think. People seek approval from perceived power sources, instinctively eschewing underdog challengers. No one cares to risk being allied to a losing team.

\- Astrazeneca also applied for EUA with data form UK but FDA deliberated and delayed its EUA because its blueprints for teh trial were not matching the FDA expectations. FDA wanted single trial like Pfizer Moderna but astra inlcuded trial data from 2 different countries and not messed up the efficacy details.

I'm not quite understanding. 

How does direct offering of common stock affect that stock's price and shares?

Are the shares new shares? If so, wouldn't that cause dilution and cause stock price to go down?

Can anyone explain how this news translates to speculation that the stick will double ?

Only thing I can think of is if it does Not dilute shares...

It will take at least a month or two to transfer the manufacturing process to another production facility. It's going to put them that much further behind in the US.

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FUBO - Stock Analysis (Warning - Long DD) # Company Description:

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market¬†(TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV‚Äôs sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.‚Äù Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we‚Äôve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today‚Äôs closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.‚Äù FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, ‚ÄúWe not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.‚Äù I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 ‚Äì 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) ‚Äì (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

I've had people, my own country men, threaten to kill me and I have one stalker psycho who tries to rile people up to do it. It's terrifying being a whistleblower. There are literally no protections.

2021-04-24 23:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Lots of comments about ‚ÄúHow did this happen in America?‚Äù

Well, there are plenty of non-3rd world countries where activities like this can occur. Just because it‚Äôs a relatively civilized country (although, where is the bar set for the USA these days) doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immune from private or military foul play.

The same way the US can send some goonies over to any fine country in the EU (yeah, I know some aren‚Äôt that fine, I‚Äôm Bulgarian lol), is the same way any foreign government or entity can dispatch some people over here.

I hope that this isn‚Äôt as bad as it looks to be, but if you think about it, the folks involved with this stuff have extensively trained to perform these tasks, and nobody ever told them ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre only gonna disappear people in this city!‚Äù

When you‚Äôre either calling the shots on something like this or actively participating in it by doing the legwork, you don‚Äôt really care about the country you‚Äôre in. People are just people, and it‚Äôs easier to do in some countries than others.

The rise of electronic surveillance, dragnet intelligence gathering and so forth has really neutered the good ol‚Äô cloak+dagger stuff we see in movies.

Or better yet, put the key in a purse with some random items and a wallet with a little money, and leave it on top of the car. I've seen women accidentally leave their purses on top of their cars more than a few times."

It was somewhat successful, we sure as hell haven‚Äôt seen everything he has fucked up and lot of fear within his own panel.    

Trump also used the tactic of using his money to silence people which is a common tactic that corporate America and the wealthy do.  Law suits, counter suits, using media against itself and its own people, Allowing massive conglomerate media that aligns with his views to buy smaller stations and further propagate shit, I‚Äôm not even sure trump is or was a Republican‚Ä¶ I think he probably just realized that easier to manipulate a large population of republicans but echoing single issue ideas and being a man of disruption and business.  reason I say idk if trump is even a Republican (even if he acts that way) is I don‚Äôt think trump even remotely understands politics even now after serving as a pres."

2021-04-24 22:49:09,wallstreetbets,True but I was only speculating .....but even professionals make mistakes .....being over eager for the car to disappear temporarily so the authorities would find it in the hands of petty criminals and contaminate any evidence or tracker that is in the car to it's last known locations prior to it being found again ( all modern cars have a tracker in them) also referred to as the black box because it records last few minutes of when vehicle was running.  That aids law enforcement in case of a vehicle accident or crime. These professionals could be somewhat aloof either not knowing about bait car stings or knew but took a calculated assessment to guarantee the car gets taken even if it was blatantly staged.

2021-04-25 09:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Just being a sting operation is never considered entrapment, nor is being undercover.

To be entrapment the officer has to actively persuade you to do the crime, *and* it has to be proven that you would never have committed the crime if you were not persuaded.


If the cop was standing at the side of the street repeatedly telling you to steal the car, say threatening to harm you if you don‚Äôt, then it would be entrapment.

If you just show up to a car and steal it when nobody is persuading you to do it, it can never be entrapment. 


Likewise even if someone is persuading you, if you just show up to a car with all the tools you need to steal the car already on you, then clearly you have a predisposition and it can‚Äôt be entrapment, you had intent before persuasion. (This commonly comes up in drug stings)"

Entrapment has a very high burden of proof historically, very few entrapment defenses are successful.


Situations where entrapment were successful include an incident during prohibition where an undercover cop harassed a guy non stop asking for liquor every day more and more aggressively for months until the guy got him liquor to shut him up.  They determined that the level of harassment was so high that an otherwise innocent person would have decided to commit the crime to end the harassment.

Another common example is when a judge or other credible state official instructs you to do something that is actually illegal while telling you it is legal while acting as a state official and a reasonable person would believe them, say if a cop instructs you to lie and then tries to charge you for lying."

2021-04-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HUYA DD Round 2 WTF ARE THESE NUMBERS I recently did a HUYA DD post and I recommend reading that one first here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx7xxg/will\_huya\_print\_tendies/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx7xxg/will_huya_print_tendies/)

This post will make papa Burry and DFV proud. The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. 

https://preview.redd.it/3se5sge395v61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca701e6aec738f0c3c6223162bc1c9b030b2ba7

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the float)

https://preview.redd.it/evbe7l9i95v61.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76db8d2fe90767a78cbbe271b1399bda533d5fd

Per my previous DD post and per the above screen shot 34.4% of the float is shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491 gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get 11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has 11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us retail gamblers.

Practically the entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it comes to analyzing stocks.

Now I just need to decide if I sell out of literally everything and put it into HUYA"
2021-04-25 04:10:17,wallstreetbets,Doing God‚Äôs work my friend...finally someone talking about this
2021-04-25 10:30:59,wallstreetbets,"The major issue with this is that its Chinese. I say that becuase there are a slew of big time companies that were caught committing fraud and lying about their sales numbers al la lukin on their submitted sec filings. 

The numbers are from unaudited released filings for 2020. I always take a second look at the filiing history of the company to make sure there wasn't any delays or issues on their filings and not getting audited and releasing anyways is shady as fuck. 

That's not a knock on the DD here. The analysis you provide if the numbers are accurate is compelling from the first DD specifically. But the risk here is that they are fudging the numbers to get the buyout with tencent done at a nice valuation.

Also there's the political risk associated with any Chinese company that might have a connection to CCP military apparatus. 

I got burned with luckin so I try and stay away from Chinese listed companies especially ADR listed chinese companies as they have to follow less stringent filings (only yearly 20-f as opposed to 10K). 

Tldr: Chinese companies especially ADRs are notorious for reporting false numbers and pose a greater political risk."

2021-04-25 10:47:28,wallstreetbets,I think this is absolutely a reasonable concern. My counter-point and how I digest this is: China's economy is red hot and I know that real and amazing industries are taking off there. There is the added risk about lack of transparency/data/etc but I think the bigger risk is not taking part in it. When I see big companies very excited about it coupled with western companies being very excited about it... it gives me a lot of confidence about my own opinions

Then new retail flees with their low conviction plays and the shorts become succesfull. Then  institutions go long again to get the upside. However this one seems strange with so much institutional owners. China in general is to easy to short in the US and retail is getting played here. This is all a theory but what i do know is that i am probably to dumb to know what their play is.

So the end result would be .75 share of HUYA but the price paid to get it would be different. The reason why I‚Äôm not, at this point (I might still), long on DOYU is because the merger isn‚Äôt guaranteed. I generally make large positions when I make a decision and HUYA is the safer bet that wins in either scenario. Going long on DOYU isn‚Äôt a bad idea; DOYU isn‚Äôt shorted and HUYA could easily get squeezed so I want to be in it for that reason as well."

2021-04-25 09:11:24,wallstreetbets,"I get your point. Hydrogen makes sense to me if you consider that In times of cheap energy (when it‚Äôs windy and sunny) it can be profitable and smart to use cheap energy to produce hydrogen. Later when energy is scarce and there isn‚Äôt much wind or sun you can profit from turning that hydrogen back to electricity in a time when energy is expensive. It also enables more renewable energy sources to be built because hydrogen creates more demand for it. 
In many countries we now rely on fossil fuels as that power and we can‚Äôt build more renewable energy because we are creating a situation where we sometimes have way too much energy and sometimes have way too little."

2021-04-25 13:50:17,wallstreetbets,"No, but that company is developing technology that would (if it succeeds) reach a lower cost in the production of hydrogen than anyone else. However, they are expecting it to be ready for markets by 2030 so they aren‚Äôt really in the game yet. 
This is Hydrogen Pros website: 
https://hydrogen-pro.com"
2021-04-25 09:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats the problem with residential solar.  It only works during the day when its sunny and no storage.  The thing is who is gonna pay for all this?   People love renewables but nobody wants to pay 40% more for their fuel and also inflate up everything else like transportation, food, housing etc.  somebody has to pay the bill.   We act like the government can do all this and it will be of no cost to us.  Lets face it, even EV cars only make sense with government subsidies."
2021-04-25 10:06:46,wallstreetbets,Plug to the moon in the coming week$$$ $$$
2021-04-25 04:56:04,wallstreetbets,"Plug - 80%
So it's better but thsts not a terrible figure to have started at. And one small tweak on that patent and you've got yourself the same tech."
2021-04-24 21:15:36,wallstreetbets,"FYI - Xebec is a Canadian company which focus's on RNG and Hydrogen and they've recently taken a massive pounding due to earnings, lowering guidance and firing their COO. 

I'd say they sound pretty similar this (slightly bigger market cap). They are also involved in building hydrogen fuelling stations."
2021-04-25 09:43:54,wallstreetbets,True stuff. A good place to start would be to stop subsidising fossil fuels and subsidise green energy and storage solutions. If we fail at stopping climate change the bill will be significantly heavier so I hope that governments around the world can implement policies that include negative externalities from the burning of fossil fuels and also take a good look at comparing the costs of for example hydrogen infrastructure compared to damage from inaction in the fufure (and present). Of course there are some carbon markets and stuff like that already but they ain't radical or broad enough.
2021-04-25 09:47:56,wallstreetbets,"this EU report says: ""Analysts estimate that clean hydrogen could meet 24% of energy world demand by 2050, with annual sales in the range of ‚Ç¨630 billion.""

2021-04-25 19:24:17,wallstreetbets,"Yep can.   But will it?   We can power most of the US with solar and wind if we are willing to pay the price.  I hope it works.   But just know they also said this 20 years ago.  Im all for it, just skeptical since its yet to be proven on any large scale."

2021-04-25 00:03:50,wallstreetbets,"I have bet the farm on AMD Calls, if they hit the Upper $90 range, I could seriously consider quitting my job... Which I think is more than possible. $AMD is expected to earn $13.54B in revenue for 2021, giving them a Market cap of $135B (10x P/S), which is 36.5% greater than its current market cap; so if the Markets value AMD at the full expected 2021 revenues, their share price would be \[1.365 \* $82.76\] $113!

AMD has been hurting due to XLNX Merger (approved, and have had plenty of time to be digested), reports of Chip Shortages (doesn't affect them as much, TSMC has increased wafer supply), overhype of INTC (new foundries that won't be producing anything till 2023) and Nvidia (their ARM chips will be severely underpowered by 2023 release, half of EPYC 2023 performance), and overall Macro weakness that have been attracting Shorts like Flies to horseshit.

I believe AMD Q1 report should put all these worries to bed, from TSMC own Q1 report, their 7nm Revenues, from which AMD is now their largest customer, has increased 25% for the quarter, and now makes up 35% total revenue for them. Also, AMD has been rumored to increase 7nm purchases at TSMC by a whopping 80%! -  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html)

2021-04-25 08:51:50,wallstreetbets,Wait hold up. If they beat earning then shouldn't the price of their shares increase?
2021-04-25 16:23:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah. We prefer stocks that have negative P/E ratios thank you.
2021-04-25 17:14:08,wallstreetbets,Why?

2021-04-25 02:10:44,wallstreetbets,100% chance it will go 50% chance down every time chance % times.
2021-04-25 09:31:07,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, not with buyout rumors. I believe they were doing a couple private demos this month, but pushing their earnings to an earlier date is a good sign, so hopefully they have an announcement to go with it, but I‚Äôm not betting the farm on that. I may sell some more shares leading up to Thursday and hold some through it. If it dips, well, I‚Äôll buy back in and hold until a hopeful sell."

2021-04-25 06:26:31,wallstreetbets,I mean you could be right but with it appearing to have lots of resistance where it is at $150ish if it squeezes again it could easily reach new highs. Obviously would not last long.
2021-04-25 11:44:47,wallstreetbets,"They did not change the ec date. They issued earlier PR months ago that A sample components were in hand and april milestone was on target. That includes samples and data to tier 1s amd other interested parties.

Should receive guidance o  royalty revenue. Dont expect revenue numbers to have changed given timelines."

The market does not operate in a practical or rational manner."
2021-04-25 09:18:09,wallstreetbets,"Telling you now. Its had its day(s). 

Too many buying opportunities now after the selloffs. And short interest is like 20 percent. How is it even possible üòÇüòÇ"
2021-04-25 09:23:39,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, that's what everyone was saying the last 2 times it shot up.

I'm not all in on GME or anything, but the stock has shown us how irrational the market  operates."
2021-04-25 09:36:12,wallstreetbets,"If you do some technical analaysis that can all be explained. The cult wont admit that hedge funds actually bought gme shares at 40. It dipped so much obviously because of the squeeze. It then stabilized in the hundreds before it squeezed again to nearly 400. The difference is, hedge funds made money off the second squeeze and then began shorting it right near the peak. I guarantee you hedge funds are making more off the volatility than the retail investors. However since some losses were regained, they no longer require massive recovery profits in gme. Hence the short interest at about 20 percent(which is more than fair considering gmes current market share) 

Most shares are now held, with some already getting bored of the endless amounts of dates being thrown around. 


It will be another bad week as the broader market does well next week, resulting in a small selloff back to double digits very soon."
2021-04-25 11:38:55,wallstreetbets,"They have a royalties contract since 2017. Everything is under a tight NDA. Unknown if IVAS is part of that agreement or if there will be a new one.

2021-04-25 12:22:27,wallstreetbets,"They also have 300k revenue right now, 0 product pipeline, no inventory.  Like you said just some royalties, licenses, etc.

Does MVIS have a solid deal with MSFT already?  Everyone talks about this 22B contract like MVIS engineered or made it happen.  Do you have any source on numbers of HOW MVIS is actually going to make money on it?  How much?"

2021-04-25 00:34:19,wallstreetbets,"Well buddy, let's talk about the math.  First of all, their financials aren't as strong as peers.  They have the lowest Current Ratio in the class at 1.21 as of MRQ versus average of 1.6 and the next lowest is Sportsmans Warehouse at 1.4.  They have debt to equity of 0.71 versus an average of 0.05 -- and yes it has improved, so have all the others in this group.  Big Five actually paid theirs to zero.  ASO paid theirs down by 50%.  But it's the highest of any comp,  and in fact most comps have none.  To finish the lecture on financials-- ASO gross margin TTM was 30.48% vs average of 32.57; net margin of 5.43% vs average of 5.50%, and ROA of7.09% vs average of 9.21%.

My source on this is, I've done the math.  All of this is per the annual reports of every publicly traded sporting goods retailer. 

As for valuation--

My numbers are as of 4/6 so the figures will have changed slightly.  

ASO was at 0.47 P/S versus average of 0.64 -- too low.  Average would put it at $42.54

P/E was 8.30 versus average of 12.38.  Catching up to peers would bring it to $46.45

Price/Book was 2.38 versus average of 2.65.  That would bring it to $34.62

Average of these is $41.20. And as discussed, it's not in better financial condition than any of its peers. 

 Still a lot of room to run.  Your calls will print.  But let's be realistic."

Everything has changed now and people are ready to take vaccines (once available). 

Personally, I feel its a mix of panic, bad politics, and obviously virus. 

IMO virus isn't going anywhere - its more about how can it become a 'regular' virus. And, regarding the market, as someone said, they are irrational - I also wanted to buy the bear index probably for the short term."

2021-04-25 13:39:33,wallstreetbets,"1. Lower effectiveness is better than no vaccine.

2. There's a lot of misunderstanding regarding ""effectiveness"". For example, J&J has ""lower"" effectiveness than the others but that's mainly due to a different testing method and time period for when its tested. Had J&J and Pfizer been tested at the same time/method, the difference may be significantly lower. ou can learn more about it here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A tldr if you didn't bother to watch: J&J was tested during time when there's mutant/variants of Covid19 and increase in number of cases (fall/winter 2020), whereas Pfizer/Moderna were tested against during a time when there's only 1 strain and lower infections(summer 2020). This logic can be applied to the Chinese vaccine as they are ppredominately used in South America, Middle East, and Africa where there are cases of multiple strains/mutants. Therefore their data will also be gathered from these areas.

3. The chinese vaccine is ""100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases."" This is actually the **most** important aspect you should read into. This is the effective rate that prevents hospitalization. Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55642648

>But Butantan stressed that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases.
>Last month Turkish researchers said the Sinovac vaccine was 91.25% effective, while Indonesia, which rolled out its mass vaccination programme on Wednesday, said it was 65.3% effective. Both were interim results from late-stage trials.

All in all, I'm NOT saying the Chinese vaccine is better than American/EU versions. However, they are definitely good enough and you should take it if that is the only one you can get your hands on."

2021-04-24 23:12:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm in healthcare myself and actually did my undergraduate work in analyzing healthcare systems so I'm well aware of how Medicare Advantage insurers work. What you're ignoring is that traditional health insurers have to drive healthcare costs up in order to continue growing their profits because of the 80/20 rule. In order to make money on Medicare Advantage patients the best long term strategy is to improve health outcomes by aggressively providing preventative care and close followup with your patient population-that prevents your population from getting hospitalized or requiring as much expensive cancer treatments and the like down the line. Traditional health insurers have two competing incentives here-they actually will make less money in the long run if they actually successfully lower healthcare costs, because their traditional healthcare side of the business requires that healthcare costs continue to skyrocket for profits to continue to grow so you're going to have executives having to choose between optimizing for either their Medicare Advantage plans or optimizing for their traditional health insurance plans.

There are plenty of privately held Medicare Advantage insurers/networks that are highly profitable, so for you to make it sound like traditional insurers are guaranteed to win here is absurd. Have you done your research into looking at non-public Medicare Advantage firms?

Now you are correct that Clover as it stands is spending big to onboard physicians, but claiming that this is an inducement is nonsensical. They're not telling physicians how to bill, they're paying high amounts per patient to build out their network of physicians which is 100% legitimate. It's extremely common in healthcare for physicians to be paid above the revenue they generate because of long term cost savings and profits that can be realized with good care. Look at how much money hospitals spend [subsidizing the revenues of their hospital physicians](https://hospitalmedicaldirector.com/how-much-should-a-hospital-subsidize-a-hospitalist).

So yes, Clover is small and spending big to fuel high growth rates like a tech startup. But I honestly think the purity of vision here is a big positive. Like why Tesla has done so well with EVs compared to traditional auto firms (which are only now finally catching up). Being a pure Medicare Advantage play means that they can grow aggressively and that they don't have internal conflicts for their incentives. Tesla didn't have to worry about cannibalizing traditional car sales because they had none, and Clover doesn't have to worry about hurting the profits of traditional health insurance plans because they have none. They're small, but I think they have a ton of room to grow since their geographic footprint has been so limited so far. You're going to see massive growth rates from them over the next several years."

Also you do realize that figures such as ‚Äú5x revenue‚Äù mean absolutely nothing without context right? 5x revenue is in fact pretty damn high compared to their competitors which are almost all trading less than 1x."
2021-04-25 12:46:48,wallstreetbets,"When United health grows revenue by 40% they would get a valuation of 5x revenue too... they can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre a value trap. 

You‚Äôre comparing a mature company to a startup and it‚Äôs ridiculous 

Yes, I believe the lawsuits are frivolous and they are seeded to scare people from buying the stock. This is a common tactic in a short attack. Yes I think there are large hedge funds and institutional investors on the short side that are going to get their ass kicked - that isn‚Äôt a conspiracy, that‚Äôs how two sides of a trade work. You have one side, I have the other...I‚Äôm going to buy more shares than you can short"

2021-04-24 20:47:17,wallstreetbets,"Ive made more money from Cramer than GME & I'll stick by that man to the moon. I support the movement & it's great, but these 2 things are are the same side. The random hate against Jim misses the mark. He has always been on our side. Always will. The Stewart interview proved that. Not many people would even go there & do it, & be accountable since then. I've read 5 of his books & those books taught me how the market works, which lead me to become in this movement. It also teaches common sense which is not to hold on the end of a gamma short. This false narrative that Jim somehow is against WSB only shows that people are falling into the political trap that allows the rich to divide & conquer us. This is why the left & liberals get divided & lose to the alt right. This is why the alt right & conservatives lose to democrats & so on.

In the end people who see eye to eye on 99% of things will let 1 comment get twisted & perverted here or there & then allow the other side to use it so much against them that it will backfire in the end. 

Mark my words. Wall St isn't stupid. They know what you're doing & they are better at it. You've won a couple battles, but they will win the war if this is the long term strategy. You should already be well ahead with the next move. For example rotating the biggest short stocks (say 1 per month) with a mobilized force & moving the money from rich to poor. The fact all this money is sitting there in GME still is literally making it easier for them to transfer the wealth back to the big boys while the guys who lead you here get rich & the millions of ""apes"" take the fall. It's a ponzi scheme if you don't make the next move. Even the best of intensions will go south without further organization."

Their weekend crew is cool but no where near as knowledgeable as their dedicated options desk which is closed till Monday.  Going to have a talk with them in the premarket and maybe swap out my shares for options in the AM.  Thanks for the insight.
2021-04-24 23:55:30,wallstreetbets,I think it's a marketing problem. A bunch of our Netflix favorites disappeared these past couple weeks and they are only available on P+. We'll likely sign up for it.

2021-04-25 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,"Great thing about options is that you can have multiple plays at the same time!

You can do an 80 delta, which would pretty much let you capture most of the upward movement without the capital outlay while also acting as a stop loss.

Then, you can also use the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù to get some 40+ delta, which can boost your return"

2021-04-25 00:21:22,wallstreetbets,Why do you think they will moon before earnings? Aren't they trying to get acquired and don't have any significant earnings???
2021-04-25 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,"The information is out there

* Use ""The Google"" 
* Watch YouTube videos (I love the Khan Academy series)

2021-04-25 10:49:36,wallstreetbets,If we get another good day or two early this week then I'd say I did my research?
2021-04-25 12:04:37,wallstreetbets,"Because they have a few big things expected to be announced at earnings and moving up earnings is a very bullish sign from what I have looked up. We already expect BIGLY good news and MVIS seems to agree they have that news. 

I think it‚Äôs going to keep running because earnings could be anything from ‚Äúhey look how much we make from that Microsoft deal‚Äù to ‚Äúgoogle is buying us for $$$$$ per share‚Äù. Combine that with shorts keeping the price down already and I think 35$ before earnings is very likely."
2021-04-25 12:04:54,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-25 18:33:58,wallstreetbets,"100 shares at strike price $100 + premium $1,000 with a break even price at 110 

$100 X 100 = 10,000 + premium $1,000 =$11,000

11,000 is the total for 100 shares .  You have to account for the premium of 1k that you dont get back. Your breakeven price is what you're paying total in the end Factor that into your ""share price""  still can be a great deal for long term hold if you expect it to soar."

2021-04-25 12:06:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah seriously this is not the place to learn options. You have to be very careful with them, the risk is equivalent to the reward, very easy to lose more than 50% of an investment in minutes"
2021-04-25 09:55:35,wallstreetbets,"If a buyout is announced for $35/share, people would pile on at whatever the current share price is to make easy money selling at $35 when the buyout happens. The share price will thus rise to $35 and stop rising."

2021-04-25 17:18:16,wallstreetbets,My puts are up 5% right now. I bought them as soon as the SP got close to $19 around lunch. I‚Äôm hoping the stock goes up Monday and I sell these things for a small loss but if there is a dip I have these to sell and then buy some shares or even more calls.
2021-04-25 17:19:03,wallstreetbets,I just realized I said ‚Äútoday‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMonday‚Äù sorry for the confusion.
2021-04-25 10:32:48,wallstreetbets,"if a buyout is announced nobody will be able to buy at much less than $35 or enough to make anything, why would you think if it were announced (usually when the markets are closed anyhow) their would be time to but much lower?"
2021-04-24 22:34:51,wallstreetbets,Bro that guy drank all of the kool-aid and didn't spare any for anyone else. He's a goner.
2021-04-25 03:17:11,wallstreetbets,In low liquidity stocks it may make sense to exercise a contract that is slightly OTM. But very rarely.
2021-04-24 20:49:21,wallstreetbets,"You may be right, it sounds like you know their product mix pretty well, personality I know ZIP about them or what they do, my response and other responses I‚Äôve posted are about comments people make that have no basis in reality, are more wild hopes with little chance of success.  Buying GME May 1000 calls and posting how the stock is headed there is just moronic and usually posted by someone with little experience in the market.  One guy bought $50,000 of out of the money calls (far out of the $) with expiration the next day.  As someone whose invested and studied the markets for ~50 years it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and disappointing that money is being pissed away and trying to entice others to join you.  Maybe it‚Äôs having seen clients make lots of money over time, then going to a discount firm and lose half of what they made in a month."

2021-04-24 21:14:50,wallstreetbets,Its literally not being a contract buyer. Which the majority of this sub likes to lose money on.

Some people freaked out at first because it meant potentially more dilution, but then people began to realize that it was a necessary step for Canadian companies to file the shelf prospectus and f-10 with the SEC before being uplisted onto the NASDAQ. This could be somewhat explained in this video: https://youtu.be/RbnNb7jccHA - skip to 3:45. That is why the stock actually skyrocketed from $2.98CAD to about $3.70 CAD the next day. So yeah, it was basically POTENTIAL up listing news that caused the spike after the news was released.

Dickhead was driving about 60 in a residential neighborhood. He didn't even stop. At 17 years old, Wally was the oldest soul I'd ever known. I didn't get a license plate because I was running as fast as I could to Wally. By the time I got to him the truck was gone, and so was Wallyüòû.

I think this is gonna mess me up for a while boys. I loved that cat, he was essential to my premarket routine, and he was a great friend. I've got a bad case of the sads."

I confidently told him that I represented team thetagang while shoveling a huge portion of potatoes onto my plate - probably had some stupid fucking smirk on my face too honestly.

And trust there‚Äôs no bag holding thus far. A lot of us who have been in for a while have been mentioning it here consistently over time. What happens in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù outside of the market does actually matter. Just like people still saying Tesla is a ‚Äúminor player‚Äù when Tesla‚Äôs are everywhere if you just go outside. Overvalued or not, good luck betting long term on them not being the EV hegemon for at least 5 more years. My friend does clinical psychology with patients at a major hospital in the NE. Whole department has begun discussing psychedelics. Other friends in medicine all over. Psych integration into pharma and med is moving much more rapidly and being taken more seriously than med weed was at this same stage in its introduction to market. Yes there is immense stigma. Of course only successful clinical trials will move this forward. Of course there‚Äôs a bear case and this company specifically deserves your own individual investigation and conclusions just like any other. The stock market element is actually the most discouraging part as someone who cares about the deep historic role of psychs in society and their potential to solve serious mental health problems and transform society. I don‚Äôt want to see pharma do its usual dirty work on something this important. Anyway, psychs are not weed. Get right or get left"

He's into ultra distance running and has a treadmill on cinder blocks because apprarently a 20% incline with a weighted vest isn't enough, and my girlfriend is up walking on that treadmill right now, but we had to dig up a birth certificate to send to Russia a couple weeks back and in this binder of documents was a newspaper clipping of him running a sub-3:00 marathon at the age of 30.  I'm on his Strava and see him running 20 miles every other day kind of slow, and he's always encouraging me to get out and bike more, but never once brought up the fact that he could run 26 miles at a 6:00 pace.

2021-04-24 21:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Some earnings/happenings next week. Stocks that might suit your personal financial interests, but for whatever reason may have flown under your radar because all you look at is GME. Obviously do your own DD:

AMD: Semi-conductors. I think the stock will drop after earnings (even after beating expectations and positive outlook), but then rally HARD. It's getting a ton of market share. 

MVIS: Microcap stock, they do LIDAR and people here will absolutely not stop talking about them. 

ZYXI: Based on what I read, prices dropped last February as the company fell short of analyst expectations... but I do also have somewhat of a soft spot for what they do (pain relief). 

MNMD: Speaking of pain relief, this is another stock WSB will not talking about. Expected to start trading on NASDAQ on Tuesday. Magic mushrooms.

QCOM: idk just a giant tech company, solid forward P/E and PEG ratios (based on Y! Finance data).

WPC: REIT. Sells long-term leases. Also has a higher dividend yield than SPG. Got hit hard by COVID. I think there's a lot of room to run still.

UXIN: company that sells used cars in China, and holy bejeesus this thing exploded last week. It's still at such a relatively low price that I might just FOMO into some of these.

Disclaimer: I have positions in AMD with a short-term neutral-bearish outlook. I plan to open positions in some of these in the next 72 hours."

A big point of incorporating is to shield you from being liable for a failed business or a lawsuit etc.  You should always be keeping your personal money and assets away from the business.  If you have excess capital it should be taken from the business and stored personally you can always loan the business money and secure.it against the businesses assets and receivables should the need arise to recapitalize.

2021-04-25 14:09:20,wallstreetbets,Nope. Selling CCs only have two downsides which is the risk in holding the underlying security and limiting your potential upside.
2021-04-25 14:10:25,wallstreetbets,If you sell the CC too early you miss out on some profits. Some premiums are pretty abysmal and not worth the opportunity cost of the allocation. Take PFE for example garnering about the same premium as something that costs 1/6th the price
2021-04-25 14:14:00,wallstreetbets,"The stock could rise far beyond your target and you ""miss out"" on potential gains. Then again, the same thing happens if you just sell at that price. Maybe you sell at the top? Maybe you sell before a parabolic takeoff. 

But, if you're comfortable with selling at that strike price, then there's no real downside. You sell at your price, plus you collect premiums. The buyer may ride a potential increase higher, or they could crash, but you're out of the market by then, and have no more risk exposure."
2021-04-25 14:11:12,wallstreetbets,"Well, if your target price is unreasonably high, the premiums are laughable.  If the target price is reasonable, you may lose on growth beyond target, which on volatile stocks can happen overnight.  

If you genuinely have a fixed target price based on analysis and trading strategy, (üòÜ) then you literally cannot lose by selling CC at target."

  the worst part is many of these people will probably never try to learn beyond buy and sell. but have the confidence to tell others what to do, and the arrogance to refute anything else."

Lots of extremely bullish activity on the board of directors. If they announce strategic partnership or buyout they should quickly equal or surpass LAZR market cap of 6-7B, which is somewhere close to $40PPS. 

Bear case: the stock always pushes and pulls back after the news fizzles. They don‚Äôt have much revenue right now and lack partnerships. We don‚Äôt know their LIDAR was successfully developed or ‚Äúbest in class.‚Äù There will probably be a better time this week to jump in even if everything is going well for them."

2021-04-25 15:58:42,wallstreetbets,"I just mean people aren‚Äôt going to flock to theatres to watch half hour episodes of TV. Think about it. So your example was The Mandalorian. Presumably fans of the show are already paying for Disney Plus. Then Disney starts showing it in theatres. Let‚Äôs say they decide to make it really cheap to see in theatres (unlikely...) and it only costs, say, $8 a ticket. 

These people are already paying whatever the cost of Disney Plus is per month (10 or 15 or something I‚Äôm guessing?) and they have access to the show at their home as soon as it‚Äôs released. You think they‚Äôre going to pay almost as much to see one episode in theatres as they pay per month for the whole streaming service? Just to go out and watch one 28 minute episode or whatever on the big screen? I just don‚Äôt see it. Maybe, *maybe* for finales of really popular shows, but can‚Äôt imagine this idea really generating revenue in any other situation."

""Research onpsychedelics continued, but slowly and on the fringes of medicine. Legally procuringa Schedule I drug is not easy or cheap. Clinicians require licenses and enhanced oversight to work with these compounds. Then there‚Äôs the issue of stigma. Psychedelic researchers were for a long time outcasts from the medical community. What changed? Mental health went mainstream. Over the past decade, growing societal awareness and acceptance of these disorders as a real disease has driven into action a search for new and innovative treatments. Psychedelic research published back in the 50s and 60s resurfaced, shining a light on these compounds‚Äô curative properties. Then in October 2018, cannabis was legalized in Canada. The stigma around illicit drugs began to fade. This has helped accelerate interest and investment in the psychedelics industry, but the space ought not to be compared with cannabis. Given psychedelics‚Äô uncertain safety profile, researchers, executives and the general public have for the most part agreed that the optimal path to market is through the clinic."""

Plus - you can‚Äôt patent psilocybin. MindMed has multiple promising molecules they have patented, like 18-MC which is an Ibogaine derivative which supposedly is less cardiotoxic but still effective at treating opiate addiction. They also have a molecule that will kill LSD trips. 

So they can actually milk way more money from those than anybody can milk from natural, non-patentable psilocybin.

Which is why I know one of the other big plays in the psychedelic sector is working with a derivative of psilocybin."

2021-04-25 13:11:10,wallstreetbets,"I will be buying multiple Put contracts for the 4/30 and 5/7 expiration dates at multiple strikes starting at $10 down to $8. My decision is based on chart history of the previous lock-up share date ending on 12/1/20. If trading history repeats itself or is similar to the last ‚Äúlock-up drop‚Äù, I could see a majority of the price drop happening before 4/30. Why? In my opinion, it will be a ‚Äúbuy the rumor‚Äù situation, or in this case sell the rumor, just like previous dates. It appears this company is and has been trying to inflate the stock price with false news and meaningless PR. The extended lock-up has placed many early investors in a terrible situation. They have had to watch their incredibly inflated shares bleed while NKLA continues to burn through cash. The technology has a potential- but NKLA has over promised and under delivered at epic levels. 
TLDR: NKLA +20-30% fall BEFORE Friday 4/30 ‚Äúlock-up dump‚Äù and continued decline in to the following week even after the dust settles. How far will it dump? I don‚Äôt know.

You seem to be happy, as you would like nothing more than to tear down the systems that everybody else seems to enjoy because they've found ways to implement a form of artificial meaning in their lives via what we've managed to invent over the past few centuries. You're unpopular.

The agricultural revolution was not the worst thing to happen to humans because most of us, when faced any alternative for the rest of our lives, would not have it any other way. And, as it turns out, the revolution and subsequent developments in history are the product of the good things that most humans pursue. Because a majority of humans are able to implement their will against a minority, and thus over a broad span of time that allows for such averages to manifest themselves in human life, if a majority of humans pursue what they think is good, then what is good for a majority of future humans will manifest itself. This is undoubtedly the case and, for this reason, the agricultural revolution was a good thing that happened to humans, if we judge it through the lens of what a majority of humans actually want (which, in this case, I'm sure is a vast majority). This applies to many other more important things in modern life as well."

2021-04-25 12:38:22,wallstreetbets,Shorts overplayed their hand but that was with GME below $10. At $150 and shorts being out it's a completely different story.
2021-04-25 13:22:26,wallstreetbets,I was agreeing with you. Bill miller bought into gme and sold at $70. That tells me where one of the best hedge fund managers values the stock.

2021-04-25 12:50:34,wallstreetbets,"As I said, they only have real presence in North America. If I've travelled across most of Europe and never seen a Gamestop shop, what does it tell you? Southeast Asia the same. That doesn't mean most people in the world know it, not even close. If I open one office somewhere in Europe, doesn't mean my company is known by almost everyone in Europe.

What have gamers, entertainers have got to do with building a game selling platform? Gaming is already powerful, it's probably a bit toppy now.

Fortune 500, who cares really, S&P 500 matters. It has loads of competition globally, from Steam itself to many local stores both offline and online. Game stores are nothing special, here's a box and here's my money kind of a deal. It's sort of like saying KFC has little competition globally, yet somehow KFC doesn't enter most developed markets because they couldn't compete."
2021-04-25 15:03:53,wallstreetbets,I know how you feel. There are a lot of people on here that are gme cult members but luckily there are some with a functioning brain.
2021-04-25 13:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol that tells me your just one person traveling through Europe. I'm Portuguese and I travel through Europe and I've seen them. At one point 1/5 of their stores where in Europe. As far as your next point I think you and I are straying from the original topic a bit. Honestly correct me if I'm wrong, I believe our argument was: Why would anyone want gamestop when they could have started their own business. Now I'd imagine you want to start a business to make money, but there's alot more overhead that goes into making something brand new (hiring, training,, building,, advertising) you may not even turn a a real profit for the first few years. So if given the opportunity why not fast track it and buy a company that's already established and basically gives you 37 years of corporate experience, connections, and assets. Look at Blockbuster, sure their company was slipping they were hitting hard times. Their problem was they didn't know how to pivot, they should have looked harder for their ""Ryan Cohen"" some one who can think differently and make positive change. Netflix wouldn't be what it is today had blockbuster thought of it first, and that's what it's about. Gamestop is an established company, nothing you open tomorow is going to come anywhere near where they are today (unless you have the next netflixesque gaming idea). That's why even companies buy or absorb other companies it easier than making your own to branch out."

2021-04-24 23:15:54,wallstreetbets,">This is a proposed change to the tax code? 

Changing the number they pay without closing loopholes makes the tax meaningless and only puts greater pressure on using the loopholes for those that actually pay their taxes legally and fairly already.

>Also, corporations are the biggest leeches of government money in history. 

US goverment doesn't spend TRILLIONS on subsidies..... They do spend trillions on welfare programs...


>Just have a look at the $750B Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility that the Fed created in 2020 to ensure that indebted companies could find a buyer for their scrappy bonds in order to maintain dividend and share buyback programs.


The FEDs ended the program in December and was only used to keep the market from tanking to stop a panic so there wouldn't be a negative feedback loop that would have collapsed the economy as a result of global pandemic.... 

It did what is was supposed to do. Are you going to bitch about the goverment handing money to the people they told couldn't work."

2021-04-25 09:40:26,wallstreetbets,"The last bit is why I am in, barely any downside potential (maybe $5.5 at worst)...yes they have lots of stuff going on and no doubt eventually will be a very valuable company. I know if I wait it out there will be a pay-off, my concern is how long do I need to tie up investment dollars. First, until a drug is approved it cannot make money, if they did nothing else now but get what they have approved they would go up 50X..but when will that happen? Their management seems very focused on technology but are poor on investor relations which artificially depresses the stock. Finally, BlackRock, Inc owns 6.7% of shares and  there has been a  huge short position from who knows ...these guys know the value and can keep the stock depressed for as long as they like (unless some sort of buying stampede happens) and collect cheap shares. They have no timeline, they would rather have it blow up in 2023 with 15% of shares than this year with 6.7%. So...I am in but long on stock, not calls (impossible to time with this stock) and with funds I do not need to touch for some time."

Glad everything worked out for you in the end. Yes that is the problem with big companies. There really isn't a head to it, it is just a mass of economic interests. So it really doesn't make sense to be a ""company man"", better to use employment as a stepping stone to either get credentials, or learn skills to utilize in your own enterprise."

2021-04-25 03:23:40,wallstreetbets,"It's not a straight forward answer. Their potential for growth is in Paramount + but is offset by cord cutting from traditional media. I think traditional media will shrink but will not completely disappear not for another decade at least. However, they have an edge when it comes to carving out a piece of the streaming pie. They have long standing contracts with the NFL and many other sports. They own their own studio and have experience producing their own original content. They can fund their growth organically because they generate a significant amount of cash, 29 billion and 18.4 billion in net income in 2020 and 2019 respectively.

To put it another way, they're showing up to a poker game with a really good hand, but the players on the table is some of the best players there is. How much of the pot they can take depends on how they play their hand.

So short answer is yes they have some growth potential, but there are caveats as to how much they can grow."

2021-04-25 05:10:40,wallstreetbets,"Nuclear investment has two general issues which the ""Small is better"" crowd want to solve. 

The first is that large parts of the modern west is kind of utterly shit at executing large scale infrastructure projects, and this breaks the budget. ""5 billion for 1650 mw"" is a fine deal.. if you have a project manager whos head will not explode trying to corral a five billion project.  The idea is to make the project smaller and faster so it actually gets done on budget. 

The second, and far more important problem is that anti-nuclear activists have successfully killed a whole lot of nuclear projects *after* very large amounts of money was sunk into them. Even when capital is recovered, investors do not want to be parasites who are getting repaid by rate payers for not delivering a product, they want to produce power and get paid for that. 

This history of ""We successfully built the thing, and then idiots refused to let us turn it on"" (Shoreham. Zwentendorf. ect) has caused capital costs for nuclear in many places to become utterly unreasonable, you cant get a loan for less than 9, 11 % in the US. 

The modular folks want to fix this by making their product portable. If they build a reactor for Pleasantville California, and Pleasantville subsequently gets a dire infestation of the Vapors and backs out, the investment is not lost, they can pack it on a freighter and sell it to French Guiana. This should drastically lower capital costs, and thereby real costs."
