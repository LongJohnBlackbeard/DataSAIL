2021-04-24 19:40:47,stocks,"Intc fell for a few reasons.
Data center performance was poor, Nvidia jumping into data center market and then happened to trade with Qualcomm on a downgrade.

Your post is weak DD but yes I'm long Intel. Earnings beatdown made an incredible buying opportunity."
2021-04-24 19:32:19,stocks,"No offense but this info isn’t too valuable for anyone looking to take an idea and do their own DD. What are the reasons Intel is trading so cheaply? Why are the competitors trading at such a large premium? What does the sector look like going forward? Tailwinds, headwinds? Any other financials you could’ve discussed? Even discussed some items from their earnings report? 

And I’m an Intel shareholder. Your post needed more substance, sorry."
2021-04-24 19:46:20,stocks,Intel makes shitty chips so uh
2021-04-24 19:42:42,stocks,"> What are the reasons Intel is trading so cheaply?

To be honest, no idea. I can understand future earnings having problems mid-term but right now? Company shits gold. 

>nVidia making server chips

Way too far off the volume and strength to counter intel's current dominance.

>amd's better processor tech

Crippled by TSM's inability to provide supply.

>Apple's M1 threat

Not bad but nobody buying windows laptops since forever is enticed by apple's premium extra cost. Buying intel windows laptops makes the most sense financial - performance wise.

So for this year and the next I don't see Intel's coffers being under attack at all. Long-term growth is already propelled by the new CEO's investments. If anyone has reasons to justify Intel falling I'm all ears."

2021-04-24 19:09:40,stocks,"I have no idea what your baseline is, so I'm going to assume ""no investing experience"".

The r/stocks [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post) has a good writeup on key fundamentals that you need to know, otherwise all the DD in the world won't help. Investopedia is a great resource, and they have their own [guide](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/due-diligence.asp) to DD that you can read after you make sure you know the fundamentals from the previous link.

That should be enough of a starting point for you. If you've never read SEC filings before then I suggest starting with something like [Apple](https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/default.aspx). You don't need to invest in Apple, but reading the SEC filings of a stable company with nothing to hide (they make money hand-over-fist, they don't need to risk the bad PR) serves to illustrate what an honest report looks like. It's your baseline so that if you come across something fishy in a different company's filings you won't fall for it."
2021-04-24 19:23:08,stocks,DeepFuckingValue actually has a YouTube channel and some of the earlier vids he goes into how to do DD and read balance sheets it’s really informative if you can sit through it all. YouTube is RoaringKitty
2021-04-24 19:51:41,stocks,"I learned a lot about DD when I started teaching myself technical analysis. Whether you believe in TA or not, understanding what the indicators are meant to reflect about the stock really opened my eyes to what actually drives stock price.

For example if the stock price is dropping, and volume is also dropping, then maybe investors are losing interest and the price is likely to keep bleeding unless something changes. If price drops but volume is rising, maybe investors are losing confidence or profit taking, maybe you can expect a quick rebound and see the drop as a good entry point.

From there the question is *why* is the volume dropping/rising and you can start learning what events affect the stock's price, etc.

Just one example, I don't lean on TA very heavily but it did challenge me to look under the hood of a company to learn what mechanics are driving its stock price."
2021-04-24 19:00:26,stocks,"It’s honestly just looking at everything about the company, from qualitative to quantitative. Yep, you gotta look at numbers and read the financial statements, annual reports, etc. You’ll never get a good gauge on management without looking at annual reports and conference calls. 

I like to look back on prior year annual reports and conference calls because a lot of the time, mgmt will set their goals and expectations they want to achieve a few years out in these calls. If they don’t achieve these targets like they said, they often don’t even talk about it and set new goals to redirect investor’s attention."

2021-04-24 18:05:05,stocks,"If the market is at an all time high, many stocks are going to be at an all time high too.

If you're looking to minimize risk you're just switching out one stock at or near a a high for another, but the question is how much would it go down in a bear market? 

The tech growth stocks that have high P/E ratios have future revenue growth already priced in, which means they're exposed to larger drops in bad times.

Companies that have a stable consumer market, but there isn't as much future growth expected, will offer income through dividends, the P/E is usually lower, but you don't expect the price to swing up very much or drop as far in the a bear market.

There is some truth that many investors have already been making these changes, which makes the prices higher of stocks that are less risky.

But you're not looking for companies with a large amount of growth to come anymore, you're looking for things less risky that still will net you some smaller gains or income. Also, don't forget much of the gains people make on value stocks come through dividends and dividend reinvestments. It won't show up as a 'unrealized gain' on your broker's website, but your cumulative gain is there."
2021-04-24 17:01:33,stocks,In 12 years of full time trading the most important lesson is we go in cycles so when your late to the party as you are right now in Risk Off assets just HODL cash and wait for a pullback and lighten up on your Risk On assets on the way up because that has to be our next leg up. Though banks on a relative P/E are actually CHEAPER on earnings then they have been most of the last year.

2021-04-24 15:01:12,stocks,"We don’t hold any bonds in our portfolio at the moment with a planned 25 years to retirement.

In part of the portfolio I’ve actually purchased some large cap “safe” dividend focused stocks to act as bond proxies with a weighted yield of approximately 3-3.5%.

I’m well aware that bonds are vastly different from stocks, even those that are considered on the “safer” side in terms of risk profile, and right now I’m fine with that trade off.

If we were only 5-10 years from retirement, I don’t know that I’d feel the same way."
2021-04-24 15:17:04,stocks,Reason I prefer bonds to cash is that bonds still have better returns. I have a savings account with 0.3% interest rate. Then I have a mutual fund investing in Euro high yield bonds according to an index. Now one year returns are 4.86%. The returns can be lower but for any time longer than year they have been better than 0.3%. The downside is it takes two days to convert the fund shares into cash.
2021-04-24 16:21:16,stocks,"If you are a boomer and retiring, they provide a more stable asset with predictable returns. 

For anyone else, normally they can provide the same, at the expense of losing massive returns to stocks simply to avoid volatility. 

However, in a rising interest rate environment, they lose money as well (to the extent invested in bond funds). 

So - only good for a limited purpose."
2021-04-24 15:38:46,stocks,"Im in the same boat. I tried to keep 50% cash since last year. The stock gains however have eroded the portfolio balance though I still have the same cash.

I agree. Ive been going 1 month fixed income every now and then for meager returns but I dont want long term bonds. That said, I still have a sizeable amount of preferred stock in companies i have confidence in. Those still pay over 6% and I had bought them at a steep discount last year. Kind of wish I bought more but hindsight and all..."
2021-04-24 15:48:17,stocks,I'd probably take 5% that you would normally have in bonds and keep it in cash. Otherwise it would depend on your time horizon. If you were in your 20s I'd be 95% stocks and 5 %cash.
2021-04-24 16:09:07,stocks,I have about 8% at 35 years. I feel like 25 to 30 years is still a long ways away.

2021-04-24 15:44:07,stocks,Whether you opt to do it or not since bonds have been shit for a long time.  the rule of thumb has always been to use your age as the percentage of bonds in your portfolio opposed to stocks.

2021-04-24 16:00:18,stocks,"I don't think the arbitrage strategy is what's really happening right now. If you calculate how much HUYA you are essentially getting by buying DOYU you  still get a giant discount.

I have been long DOYU for a few months now and I like both HUYA and DOYU. I think HUYA is the safer play and as you said probably the better pick if the merger doesn't go through. I like the additional upside tho.

Nonetheless, there are some major risks you did not mention. Chinese stocks could get delisted, user numbers could be fake, the merger could get blocked and growth could slow down dramatically."
2021-04-24 16:43:34,stocks,"Being primarily a value investor, I take issue with what you said about P/S ratio. If I'm looking at a value stock, anything over 3 is getting high. Of course when you are talking about growth names, projected future values and being in tech the average is going to be higher.

Just please understand a P/S ratio of 2.6 isn't inherently ridiculously low. That's actually the high end of the ""Value"" range. 

I do agree that for HUYA, with pretty insane potential for future growth this is a phenomenal number and a great price to establish a long position. I do have HUYA in my portfolio and I view it as an undervalued growth stock. 

For reference, I've been holding UNFI and they have a P/S of .07. now that's an insane number."
2021-04-24 16:09:21,stocks,"Could someone explain in further detail the impact of going through with the merger and blocking the murger?

Thanks in advance."
2021-04-24 16:09:09,stocks,"I think the merger getting blocked is bullish for HUYA so I welcome that. There are a lot of headwinds, generally. 1) China's economy is booming so hard right now that fiscal tightening is on the horizon (impacts growth stocks/tech stocks first just like in the USA). 2) China stocks getting delisted but I am not concerned about this. We have 3 years from when the bill was passed end of last year AND our economies are so intertwined it is dramatically unlikely. 3) Sure growth could slow down but I am bullish on the industry. It is expanding too into south america with Nimo etc. 4) Regulation pressures and uncertainty surrounding Tencent and Tencent is a primary stake holding in HUYA. 5) etc.. There are always a lot of headwinds. Valid to say that they should be mentioned but I am focusing on what I see as problematic. Fiscal tightening, Chinese delisting, etc are short fleeting pressures that give me a better entry price. Buy when things are uncertain and fear is in the market. Do good fundamental analysis."
2021-04-24 18:18:23,stocks,"It’s incredible value relative to it’s growth, I don’t think it’s fair to compare it to deep value names, they are very different businesses."
2021-04-24 16:18:50,stocks,"I feel you. Though, I don't think the merger getting blocked is good for HUYA. Sure, if your theory about the arbitrage strategy is correct the stock might rally for a few days, but in the long term the competition between HUYA and DOYU is definetly bad for either one of them."
2021-04-24 18:26:57,stocks,I agree completely. I just wasn't keen on how OP was talking about p/s as a metric but beyond that I thought the rest of the write up on HUYA was great.
2021-04-24 16:20:45,stocks,Agreed it is not as bullish as the merger going through. That’s just why I play the HUYA side
2021-04-24 12:48:03,stocks,"If you have one share at $100 and that share drops in value to $50 (to keep it very simple) you have now seen a reduction in value by 50%. Now to gain that 50% back, you now need 100% growth in that stocks value. 

100-50=50 
50*2=100 

This is why non recorded losses can be such scourges to your portfolio. Many people just think “I’m down 50%, therefore I need a 50% return on share price”. This is far more common than you would think. I guess those algebra classes all those years ago were worth paying attention to.

The above thought process would yield a share value of $75. 


Edit: formula"
2021-04-24 12:43:47,stocks,1 share is 1 share. It drops 25% and that just means your share is worth 25% less than it was. It's still 1 share.
2021-04-24 12:52:12,stocks,"Let’s say it’s $100. It drops by 25%. Your new share is valued at 75% of the original $100. In order to break even, you don’t need a 25% increase because 75% x 1.25 is only 93.75% of the original amount you started with. You actually would need an approximate increase of 33% to get back to the original $100. Why? Because percentages are based off a base amount. 25% of $100 is not the same as 25% of $75. Make sense?"
2021-04-24 12:46:32,stocks,"U buy one iPhone for $100. When u go sell that iPhone market value is $75. Your iPhone is worth $75. If you wait a few months and try to resell, your iPhone might be valued at $100 again. At which point ur back to ur starting point. 

Stocks are the same. U buy 1 share at $100 if it drops 25% ur stock is now worth $75. If stock prices goes back up, so does the value of ur 1 share with the same amount.

Only time this is different is when trading OPTIONS 🤯lol 

Hope that helps!"
2021-04-24 12:50:34,stocks,"I think what you are confused about is how the concept of the percentages are being applied. 

If you have 100 and it drops by 50%, you have 50. 

If you have 50 and it increases by 50%, you have 75. 

The Reason it works that way is because the number you apply the % to is different.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
2021-04-24 11:47:33,stocks,Yes! This is what I wanted! All the analyst estimates and the details in a single place for the upcoming week. It’s going to be a mad week...Thanks!
2021-04-24 13:06:31,stocks,"That's an incredibly comprehensive review of the week coming, thank you. At least I know exactly why I'll be down at least 10% next week."
2021-04-24 13:01:56,stocks,Just want to say that I always appreciate your posts. Keep up the great work!!
2021-04-24 12:35:03,stocks,"Thanks for the almanac trader.

Personally I don't focus too much on individual stocks and instead pay attention to the overall markets. If the Nasdaq goes down, pretty much all stocks go down with it.

Nasdaq currently at 14016 with a 52 week high of 14175. SP500, 4200 appears to be the target number. Guessing both targets need to be hit  for at least a MINOR market correction/dip/entry point. Biden has a big speech on the 28th and he's known to set new market records every time he talks.

My best guess a dip Mon/Tuesday, Wed/Thur new market records because of Bidens speech and Friday no idea."
2021-04-24 12:36:02,stocks,How about cannabis sector?
2021-04-24 12:44:20,stocks,"Next week doesn’t matter unless you’re a day trader. The coming implosion is what’s important. Anybody that is falling for the “economy is on fire” is delusional. 
Investors can’t cry “the numbers are fake and these reports are fraudulent” on one hand yet trust other data that comes out when it suits them. 

Simply use common sense - look around - prices have skyrocketed on tons of product - it’s not temporary. Companies are increasing wages and incentives just to get people in the door. There are still to many people working from home - or on unemployment. Children will eventually go back to school nationwide and daycare bills will resume. The mortgage foreclosure moratorium is coming to an end soon along with the student loan moratorium. The stimulus will finally end. The never ending bull run will come to a close. Company’s with 1100% P/E will drop. 

Better to prepare yourself for the buying opportunities that will come later this year."
2021-04-24 11:43:16,stocks,Nice. thanks!
2021-04-24 17:56:05,stocks,Where do you get the image in the thumbnail? Is a live chart like this accessible to everyone? Thanks.
2021-04-24 18:18:58,stocks,Any idea when talk on the hill begins about this rescue plan and suggest tax increases? Times and dates or a calendar would be helpful
2021-04-24 15:57:11,stocks,"> Biden has a big speech on the 28th and he's known to set new market records every time he talks.

Wait, really? I need to watch this. JPow speeches do the opposite."
2021-04-24 18:47:17,stocks,"There's a lot of sense in this. 

But this mania could keep going for a couple more years so"
2021-04-24 17:56:02,stocks,"SP500 reaches a new record each time.

I had his bigger speech history dates in a notepad somewhere. There's his inauguration, first presidential address, infrastructure plan and whatever he said on Wednesday. I can't find a speech on wednesday where he mentions capital gains taxes? Regardless the market did reach all new highs the day after he mentions raising taxes lol"
2021-04-24 17:57:18,stocks,True! Just struck me as contrarian opinion with people saying Biden brings market down. Not the case obviously.
2021-04-24 19:14:45,stocks,"I don't think he spoke on Wednesday, the news just came across the tape. It's weird as it was something that was known in the morning, but then Bloomberg reported it and everything got hit just after lunch. 

Also, Powell speaks=the market is automatically going to go down is entrenched for people now, but I swear outside of March 4th, with this year at least, this dude mostly has luck that is so, so awful. Not that I care to listen to him, but here is some of the things that have happened around when he's talked:

January FOMC: Meme stocks and a huge volatility spike took over. Cyclicals had also been struggling like mad heading into that sell off, but it was getting hidden because tech is so freaking good at hiding problems when it has it.

February 25th (day after Powell finished speaking to Congress): There was a completely horrible bond auction. If TNX is moving too fast, it's going to torch everything most of the time, which is exactly what happened there, and nothing could've been done to change the outcome of that day.

All of March outside of March 4th: March is a big quarterly rebalancing month every year when you get to the last half of the month and there was apparently a fair amount of deleveraging going on. There was again nothing that could've been done.

Now March 4th, it was definitely him that caused the sell off. He caused a major hissy fit in the bond market on that day which spilled over to stocks. I headed out before it happened, but I can still remember checking TLT (bonds) on a hunch on my phone and being shocked when I had seen how badly they dumped."
2021-04-24 19:22:19,stocks,"A lot of the commentary here about Biden bringing the market down is politically motivated, which is why Thursday was a total mess. There was so much hysteria then that I now think that this time period of weakness that's happened after every monthly options expiration in 2021 is doomed to fail (and it was starting to lean toward failing anyway), and I was wondering if this would be the time that you'd see an actual price correction instead of it mostly being a correction in time.

Also, read above for my commentary about ""Powell speaking"". I swear it's mostly about luck for him in 2021 so far, or maybe him needing to speak is bad luck for the market."
2021-04-24 19:01:18,stocks,"JPow does bring it down lately but Biden usually don't. Sure, saying scare-words like ""taxes"" might make it shiver slightly but it'll be back on track soon enough. Biden wants tax money and taxes don't get paid unless people work and the economy is growing."
2021-04-24 19:26:43,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-24 19:37:58,stocks,"The last time the S&P and Dow fell more than 5% at any point was in late October. The S&P falling just 5% still leans more toward a ""correction in time"" then ""correction in price"". 

As I've told others, the real story of mid-February and on is basically what's shown here:

https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1384946504746639360

The biggest non-S&P stocks (and I think Nasdaq-100 stocks too?) peaked in mid-February, and after this Nasdaq correction ended, the Nasdaq-100 has done most of the work to dig the Nasdaq out.

If the last 3 days wasn't fake in the Nasdaq, small and mid-cap tech might finally be back, and that's not exactly a sign of this index stopping anytime soon, but it's still too early to tell, as I think you saw some of this initially in March, but until the last 3 days, this push has mainly been Nasdaq-100 fueled."
2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"JD.com upcoming catalysts that could drive this stock to $90 Ok so, here are my reasons why $JD is extremely undervalued. I have a pretty heavy position in this company right now and I would love to argue if anyone has a bear thesis.

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.



4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.



5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.



6. Cathie Wood has been adding to her JD position for the last week. She is pretty heavy in this company. She carries it in multiple of her ETFs with a significant holding.

My positions:

7x Jan 2022 70c

Don't believe me?.. go visit dataroma.com and see for yourself.."
2021-04-24 14:11:52,stocks,"I'm holding BABA, here's hoping the veil of worry is lifted from all the Chinese stocks soon enough.

Curious why you like JD > BABA?"
2021-04-24 12:34:04,stocks,"I own JD, that said, I’m super worried about the competition in this space. Historically they were up against BABA but now it is BABA, Meituan and Pinduoduo. Pinduoduo is primarily tier 3/4 cities so there may be less competitive overlap, Meituan is the one that scares me.

I always liked that JD controlled their own infrastructure and Chinese friends I have say the wealthier people in tier 1/2 cities prefer them which brings higher margins. Anyways, I feel like this company is in a much tougher competitive position than a year ago. I’m still holding though. 

It sounds odd but I actually weight anecdotal evidence higher than what Wall Street analysts say on this company. Do you have any Chinese friends that have a point of view on JD?"

2021-04-24 10:18:06,stocks,"Depends how you define “greatest investor”. 

Bill Gates and Warren Buffet earned most of their money from their roles in their respective companies. 

Jim Cramer was a successful institutional investor. 

Roaring Kitty is a smart guy who timed the GameStop saga. If you watch his videos, he dives deep in detail about the value of GameStop. 

I can’t give you a person right now but I would define a great investor who...
- has a history of investing in companies that have grown a lot
- times the market well (foresees problems in the economy)
- adapts to current market conditions (looses less money in market downturns and makes more on the upside)
- understands the trends of the world years in advance
And more of course...

So you could say Warren Buffet because he has built a multi-billion dollar business. But his business has underperformed the S&P500. 

Bill Gates has been investing into renewable energy and climate change so it’s hard to determine his ROI. 

Gary V was an early investor in social media companies like facebook, snapchat, and Twitter so he’s worth millions. He’s now into NFT and sports cards.

They have for the most part kept the 1 stock = 1 stock over their lifetime. The other reason is because it weeds out traders, you won't see people trading berk stock cause of it's high price, so it keeps price stable. Additionally, it also means that only experienced investors buy in, and since they are experienced they know what's going on and can react to the company situations appropriately. Atleast this is what I think."

Kinda breaks the cycle and defeats the whole purpose if they take the money out and give it to shareholders, where it won’t generate anything for the company.

nobody should invest entirely due to dividends, there are some good reasons to consider dividends an important part of overall strategy. 

most importantly: a company paying dividends is a strong indication that they're profitable and have free cashflow. 

there is also lots of data showing that most growth in the stock market comes from re-invested dividends, not from capital gains or increases in stock price. over long periods, decades, investing in companies that pay relatively higher dividends is more profitable than investing in companies that pay no dividends or low dividends.

This stat to me doesn't sound any different from saying ""the majority of the growth in the market comes from the best performing companies"" - like yeah, true but that doesn't mean you can apply that backwards. Seeing a company that pays out big dividends doesn't tell you any more about future performance than seeing a company that grew 10% in stock price the last quarter.  Assuming future performance based on current results isn't viable on its own as an investment strategy.

it's not to say dividends are good or bad, theyre just part of overall return on investment. some companies aren't really able to grow their market cap anymore so they create value for shareholders with dividends, some  companies can grow and create value in that way. end result is money for shareholders either way."

2021-04-24 08:58:26,stocks,"I think there's an app called ""Henry"" that allows you to open up custodial accounts for your kids where they choose investments with deposits you give them, you also have to approve the investment on your end of the app. Downside is I think its like $10 a month, but its also a bank so they could work on budgeting as well. I would lean towards having it in your name with them as a bene (god forbid) and then just sit down whenever and do a mini class when they have money to invest in the account or to review the existing holdings, if the app thing doesnt osund good to you.

Personally I'm not on the 529 train, I overfund the crap out of a small variable life insurance policy that way it doesnt count as an asset for financial aid purposes and it doesnt lose any tax benefits if the kid doesnt go to college."

Ages 14,12,9 they really like it get to see how much they’ve made really encourages them to put in more. I do have some 529’s for them as well but stopped adding to them as fees were ridiculous"

2021-04-24 08:57:09,stocks,This is pretty convincing.
2021-04-24 09:00:37,stocks,That app sounds very cool. Can you elaborate on your point about overfunding the life insurance account? I haven’t heard much about that strategy and am interested to learn.
2021-04-24 11:04:48,stocks,Sounds cool! I have Fidelity and they allow fractional shares for stocks and ETFs.
2021-04-24 09:17:14,stocks,Capital gains in custodial accounts go to the parent until the kid gets to the states age of maturity
2021-04-24 09:09:15,stocks,"Yeah so for a specific example with me; i have a 100k VUL that costs like $16/mo for my daughter. Maybe only $2 of that goes into investments, the rest covers the actual insurance. So I put in $50 a month more, and that extra $50 goes 100% into the investments. Downside is there isn't as a robust investment platform, just mutual funds or ETFs, but generally in education funds are more broad and diversified in your approach anyway. Upside is god forbid something happens your kid has life insurance or has a cheap policy when they get older you can give to them. Also, the money you withdraw is basis first (meaning tax free, no matter what its used for) then the gains (taxable at income), only thing you have to watch out for is withdrawing too much to lapse the policy, unless the insurance part isn't an issue for you."
2021-04-24 09:15:21,stocks,"So the logic is, you protect the insurability of your kid; whether from a tragedy at a young age, or say when they're 30 and go to get their own policy and they end up being diabetic and the policy costs way more. Also like I said orginally, if your kid doesnt go to college or need all the money the 529 will lose its tax benefits and be a regular old account that's fully taxable anyway"
2021-04-24 11:15:18,stocks,I would just go thru them then. Problem with 529’s is what if they Decide not to go to College or if they get a scholarship or government makes it free. I wanted them to be able to use it for whatever they want weather that’s starting their own business buying a house or just getting a 15 yr jump on a retirement fund.
2021-04-24 09:25:38,stocks,"No, what do you mean? The account is of the kid."
2021-04-24 09:34:27,stocks,Interesting. Thanks!
2021-04-24 11:16:06,stocks,I hear you. It’s been a hard decision. If necessary I could take the hit and convert it to a regular brokerage. Not ideal for sure. The other possibility is to keep it anyway and maybe a grandkid would need it. But also you can use it anytime in life for lots of different educational experiences. Like if my kid decides on going to college when she’s 30 it’ll still be there for her.
2021-04-24 09:29:23,stocks,"Yes, someone has to pay taxes, there's no getting around it haha. Custodial account law is while the kid is a minor the parent pays taxes, same thing with UTMA/UGMAs. Even if a random relative opens the account for your kid, you will have to pay the taxes on gains, which is crazy to me. Unless the law has changed in the last like 3 years, which I doubt."
2021-04-24 09:33:52,stocks,"I looked it up. It looks like it’s partially true. There are different rules for custodial accounts that ease the tax burden but the parent still pays the taxes. But, we wouldn’t be selling stocks. This is more about teaching long term investing.

2021-04-24 11:17:44,stocks,"Maybe it depends on your 529 but mine also charged me $50 every time I bought some super annoying, I wanted my kids to be able to just throw in 20-50 a month  at $50 fee even if you deposit $500 your 10% down. Good luck either way"

And the advice is- stay away from Poland.

The managements are not very competent to say the least - chosen from political allies and acting on behalf of government and their propaganda. They will pay out huge dividends even if it’s gonna hurt the company in the long run but the dividend will make state budget look better so they can finance buying more votes with social spending, they will do business only with political friends (or simply own families) etc. Just as example Orlen-  the biggest oil firm in the country recently bought over a 100 of polish small newspapers from German publisher. Losing business, business they never had anything to do with and the price you could expect when the seller knows the buyer is forced to buy. The company is not doing great over the last two years because of incompetent management yet they do such a move and they’re happy and claim big success for polish nation in freeing the press from German occupants ;) The very next day they start exchanging the editors to make sure all that is left in circulation is government agenda. You wouldn’t like to be invested in such circus. It is such a swamp you are not going to be able to navigate it without being immersed in Polish politics and daily press - impossible if you don’t read Polish easily.

You should take cyclicality of the business into account. P/E ratio is just based on most recent earnings and is really a snapshot. You should look at their financial results over a longer period of time, especially for hit-driven business with long development cycle like CD Projekt Red. CD Projekt Red's video games have a long development cycle and the sales of their games are very frontloaded. The current PE of 16 included the launch of Cyberpunk 2077. Their earnings in the following years will not nearly be as good as last year, so the company isn't as attractively valued as it seems imho.

But that's based on their most recent FY result which included the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.

Some folks will be working on those online games and I think recall there were only 50 on the phone apps. So lets say maybe, 200 folks here (probably not but lets just say that).

So in summary, there are about 500 workers unaccounted for... Thats twice as many as they had on W3 and they have been missing for a long time ;-)

They screwed up, they acknowledged it, and they are actively trying to fix it.

I got the game on PC and it worked fine from day 1. I played it and it was fun though not my cup of tea (I really prefer a fantasy setting or more futuristic setting). Mind you I have a 8 year old PC... GTX 980 and at the time a i7 3770. Ran it near high no problems. I though the disappearing NPC's was hilarious more than anything else but that was the only obvious ""bug"" if you want to call it that. Its obviously a memory optimization issue. Didnt bug me one bit any more than the questionable design options in every game ever created.

Really the only people who got the short end of the stick were the console guys and mostly its been PS4. The XBox version was made playable pretty quick due to sharing code with the PC counterpart. PS4 is what it is, harder to work with just like Nintendo.

But if you think about, every company has done similar or worse. Bethesda has FO4 and FO76. FO76 was trash for a loooooong time. FO4 story telling was garbage and gameplay wasnt much better than CP77. Do you think that will stop 20m people from buying the next Elder Scrolls? LoL no. Or the next Fallout? I doubt it."

2021-04-24 09:43:14,stocks,No 90 day restriction from opening a position. But you could switch out of margin account or just open a new individual and transfer the funds.
2021-04-24 11:38:06,stocks,"Really? In **ALL** logic you are going to tell me that removing a feature to protect you from pattern day trading and then continue to make more than 3 trades knowing you don't have 25k or that trade making you 25k and having your account restricted is **NOT** irresponsible?

WOW"
2021-04-24 09:47:25,stocks,"Yeah so this was my original question. If I’m restricted for 90 days, can I just use a different brokerage and be fine?"
2021-04-24 11:42:20,stocks,No. I did the same thing. I didn't know what pattern day trading was. Then I learned about it after I was flagged. My restriction is lifted on april 30th. It's my money and it's a stupid rule that you need 25k to day trade. The irresponsible thing would be to risk more than I can afford which I did not do.

2021-04-24 07:35:06,stocks,You likely just need to just adjust your risk strategy to most aggressive. Then it should allow you to chose level 3.
2021-04-24 11:04:37,stocks,Fidelity takes the regulatory requirements more seriously than Robin Hood when it comes to trading options. RH tends to play fast and loose. It’s harder to get approved at most firms compared to RH.
2021-04-24 08:51:25,stocks,I got approved for level 3 but in order to trade spreads you have to have a minimum of 10k in account. You can buy options and covered calls below. Atleast that is how my account is structured.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) and Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF (RYLD) I have seen many a post here about Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD) and was wondering if anyone here has looked into or invested in XYLD or RYLD.

&#x200B;

These two funds do the same writing of monthly at-the-money CC's but against the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 instead of the NASDAQ 100.

&#x200B;

So as a retired investor and looking for high yield income what are the thoughts on diversifying into XYLD and RYLD along with QYLD."
2021-04-24 11:55:18,stocks,"My biggest concern with QYLD is that because it sells covered calls against 100% of their holdings it leads to little to no capital appreciation, is highly sensitive to market downturns, & takes longer to recover. But if you're parking a large amount of money for a few years, the dividends should outweigh the depreciation. Excluding distributions it's down 15% since 2014, but it's cumulative return is 87% for the same period. 

Another fund that caught my eye when researching QYLD was the new QYLG. Launched in November & the volume is still ridiculously low (~3000 shares daily). It sells covered calls against 50% of it's holdings & keeps the other 50% long. It captures 50% of the Nasdaq's upside & pays a 6% annual distribution paid out on a monthly basis. Not holding any yet but thought I'd bring some attention to it. 

Also thanks for bringing these two funds to my attention. Definitely adding to my watchlist"
2021-04-24 06:36:57,stocks,I have just started to invest on them. Small position in QYLD and RYLD. The latter seems to have better growth also. Im mixing them with another pure growth etf later on after compounding with the first two. Growth etf km thinking but have not invested yet is GXTG.
2021-04-24 06:16:41,stocks,"QYLD went from $24 to $17 in the 2019-2020 covid transition... at ~$22, it hasn't even recovered, where most everything has done better than 100% return from the covid draw-down... and it doesn't issue dividends.  I guess they've been writing calls, only to see them have to deliver the underlying only to need to buy more at the new higher price.  Wake me up when the market moves sideways for a decade or more.

I can't see why anyone would invest in it, especially if you're looking for retirement income."
2021-04-24 12:51:10,stocks,"This is actually a great example of why you should really understand what you're investing in and not just chase performance without knowing where those returns come from. If you don't know how covered calls work and when or why you should do them, you shouldn't buy QYLD, and certainly not only because it pays some super high yield. Look at the historical returns, QYLD has a 10.9% annual return over the last 5 years. However, since it writes covered calls on QQQ, how would you compare this performance to it? Well QQQ returned a whopping 25% annually the last 5 years, more than double QYLD every single year. If QQQ crashes tomorrow, QYLD would also crash, but without the previous years of return to soften the blow. 

Why is there so much underperformance? One reason is that covered calls limits your upside. This can be a good strategy if stocks are at all time highs and you want some protection in the form of higher yields. Would you sell covered calls when stocks have already crashed or corrected and then limit your upside and recovery? This is the real problem with something like QYLD that perpetually sells covered calls no matter where stocks actually are. Over the long term, you will greatly underperform the index it's using this strategy on and we haven't even started talking about expense ratios and tax efficiency yet."
2021-04-24 13:26:48,stocks,"You are right to be concerned, QQQ performance absolutely blows QYLD out of the water. I really don't get the fascination with these covered calls ETFs. You are basically forced to write covered calls at a market top AND at the market bottom, when you should be using the income you get from covered calls to buy on corrections or crashes, not keep adding protection when stocks have already crashed. How you want to use covered calls is after spikes in share price to lock in some of the gains. If you do this when the stock price is low, you are literally locking in losses. Over long term boom and bust cycles, this completely destroys your returns."
2021-04-24 14:27:34,stocks,"Yes I too saw the announcement about  QYLD.

&#x200B;

In the announcement they also talked about  [**Global X S&P 500 Covered Call & Growth ETF (XYLG)**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001432353/000143235320000379/xylg497k.htm)  

&#x200B;

I plan to incorporate some of these two halfway funds into my retirement portfolio to have some growth opportunities along with the income stream."
2021-04-24 06:26:26,stocks,"QYLD does pay out a monthly dividend, although technically it’s the premiums from the covered calls. The yield is actually pretty high, around 10% annually."
2021-04-24 11:33:43,stocks,QYLD with its monthly distribution (about 1% per month) is functioning as my high interest savings account. The share price is relatively stable the last 7 years and the distribution is solid. For every 100 shares it basically buys you another share with drip
2021-04-24 10:42:45,stocks,"Do you expect post-covid crash returns every year? Also, the crash didn't negatively impact QYLD distributions; they actually increased. If that could be assumed to be the case again in the future, it'd mean it's an excellent defensive position."
2021-04-24 14:05:48,stocks,"A counterpoint though; while QYLD had only returned 10% vs QQQ's 25%, that's 10% mostly in dividend payout. You'd need to sell your QQQ stocks to get that 25% gain, whereas for QYLD you can just hold those stocks indefinitely and have the returns to spend. Not to mention that with a DRIP, QYLD could purchase more shares of itself at a faster rate than QQQ could. A little bit ago I actually did the math on what a $1000 investment into QYLD would look like with it's previous 5 years of costs and dividend payout. Across 5 years, if you reinvest dividends, an initial $1000 deposit in April of 2016 would be worth $1,634.82, and pay you a monthly dividend of around $16. If QQQ returns 25% over 5 years, with a 0.53% dividend reinvested, you'd have a bit over $1,250.
That being said, if you look at the numbers right now, $1000 in 2016 would actually be closer to $3,300, so it's more of a case of whether this year's 68% return is a new normal or if it'll go back down to the average 25%

Edit: today on ""I didn't realize it was 25% per year"", yeah the QQQ investment being 3,300 isn't an anomology from the past year or anything like that. I guess it really is better from a growth standpoint."
2021-04-24 06:32:41,stocks,over that 12% range.  I bought it after the crash in the $19s and it's been damned good to me.
2021-04-24 06:37:18,stocks,my charting indicates no dividends are being issued
2021-04-24 06:47:16,stocks,"My main observation is that whatever yield is produced (not well documented in most stock charting... fucking ETFs), it has only existed during massive Fed stimulus and market support.  I am reminded of that inverse VIX ETF that blew up when the market did something different."
2021-04-24 11:36:29,stocks,"That's nice.  I'm glad it's working for you.  There are economic conditions under which it won't work well.  The ETF's documentation of its distributions don't work well with typical debt/equity screening mechanisms.

Might be interesting if the FASTGraph folks ran one of these things through their system.

I'd also point out that distributions and dividends receive different tax treatments under various circumstances.  Those tax treatments can have a very large impact on their function as a source of retirement income."
2021-04-24 11:05:10,stocks,I have no way to understand QYLD distribution performance through the covid crisis because it's just not documented in the systems that I use to look up and analyze ticker performance.
2021-04-24 06:42:48,stocks,"Because they’re not technically stock dividends. They’re distributions. You can see the yield% and the distribution calendar here. I’m not making this up, they pay out monthly.

2021-04-24 12:55:02,stocks,"https://investorplace.com/2018/07/understanding-differences-dividends-distributions-invtlk/

Two issues:

1 - dividends have a $40k exemption (depending on a bunch of circumstances) before they start being considered income

2 - distributions are going to probably incur a much higher future capital gains tax

If you do either out of your Roth IRA, none of that matters."

I’m also not rich. I didn’t grow up rich, so my friends and family aren’t rich either. It’s hard to only invest $1000. If a correction is oncoming, then I sell some tax lots that are losers and buy puts on my most volatile stock. You can’t make these types of decisions with only $1000."
2021-04-24 06:51:41,stocks,"When he gave you the money to invest, did he indicate what his risk profile was? 

Did you explain you only invest in FT100/250, AIM, ETF,  Pennies, Derivatives, FX?   


If my inlaws give me £1000 to invest, perhaps there would be some indication of expectations with regard to what you invest in.    


Evostick at 100/1 riden by Willie Whackem in the 3.30 at Epsom  isn't an 'investment'"
2021-04-24 05:54:29,stocks,Bro if you’re investing €1000 should’ve EASILY invested into the dividends market and let that money grow over time.
2021-04-24 08:20:50,stocks,"You don’t owe him anything, if you were up front with the risk involved you don’t owe anything.

I personally manage my parents funds and have for years. I don’t really do much but deposit whatever monthly money they want to save in their IRA/ROTH accounts. Buy or reinvest dividends into index,ETFs, or a few blue chips. Their portfolio is set and doing well. 

Day trading someone’s money is your mistake."
2021-04-24 11:54:03,stocks,How did you turn $1000 into $0 simply investing in stocks? Did you buy drugs?

2021-04-24 07:13:39,stocks,Don't give it back she asked for it..but yeah fuck that. Did some with money of family and just last month was able to get them even again
2021-04-24 08:07:53,stocks,"Unless it's my parents I always just say get an S&P index fund, when it's my parents I ask which companies they like and I check them out and run through it with them but leave them still with total autonomy to do what they want and I control nothing"

2021-04-24 12:24:57,stocks,He lost his money investing in you.  You don’t own him his lost money.
2021-04-24 14:59:47,stocks,Plus tax implications if you do make gains off their money. Definitely a no for me.
2021-04-24 15:16:45,stocks,"1) why didn’t you just tell him to open an acct and invest himself? Not hard to do, and you could have helped him if he didn’t know how. 

2) wtf did you put his money in to lose it all? I mean that’s on him for giving you the money but why not play it a bit safer if you were already nervous about the situation. Unless there was a certain stock he was asking for you to invest in, in which case it would be completely on him."
2021-04-24 06:36:05,stocks,I had a couple of petitions  from friends to do the same  and I declined both  . I could have paid back  the amount they were willing to risk in a worst case scenario (more than what the OP lost but it wasn't a fortune either). But I didn't want that responsability. I don't know how people dream of owning a mutual fund or a hedge fund. It would be a nightmare to me.
2021-04-24 06:55:34,stocks,It's gone. Tell him

I've worried enough about  losing my own money, let alone somebody else's"
2021-04-24 08:42:54,stocks,"in most cases, one should never accept other people's money, except if that person is willing to provide a written agreement stating that the person who is responsible for investing the money is not liable for losses. then again, there might be other issues with the law that may come into play, so the best way to avoid the hassle is to refuse the money."
2021-04-24 10:04:06,stocks,Truthfully anyone that asks me to invest their money obviously has 0 clue what they are getting into. So I expect lots of negative energy if it goes south. Which also means I'd rather invest my own money since I always have more than I'm willing to invest anyway. Being nice doesn't help everytime you lose and youre the enemy you win and all you did was make someone else money. Eff that.
2021-04-24 12:24:03,stocks,Don’t give him his money back then? You warned them. Your fault for taking it but not your fault it got lost. Tell em to get fucked and learn lmfao
2021-04-24 12:57:33,stocks,"I think you mean “day trading”, not investing."
2021-04-24 14:46:52,stocks,"Bro how the fuck did you lose all of it? Any time someone asks me to invest for them, I just buy an index fund. It’s not hard."

2021-04-24 14:55:41,stocks,It's not a good idea to mix friends and family with money anyways.
2021-04-24 15:15:05,stocks,I would literally tell him that he lost the money and that it was an investment risk and he took it upon himself the moment he handed you the money. I would literally be like “tough luck”
2021-04-24 19:35:33,stocks,"My uncle begged me the whole time I was home on vacation to take his money and invest it, I just simply told him no that’s illegal but if he wanted to mirror my investments I would let him see. People will ask you for favors and never even try and help you out. Then when you don’t come through they have the audacity to say shit. Don’t take favors from people who expect you to do all the legwork, people like that are accustomed to using people for what talents/experience they have to get what they want. Sorry, ranted a bit much but yeah I feel your pain."
2021-04-24 08:35:36,stocks,The fact he wants it back shows he's just lazy and incompetent

2021-04-24 15:28:37,stocks,"My friend gave me $25k to build miners back in 2017.  I built him 10 high end miners, each with 7 video cards and he earned quite a bit of returns for the first couple weeks.  Then he suddenly lost interest in mining and told me that he wanted his money back.  I told him he could have the hardware that I purchased for him, but he said that I better have a check for $25k that Friday.  I ended up giving him my own money and was stuck with 10 miners that I didn’t want, since I already had 15 of my own.  I will never again invest money for family or friends."
2021-04-24 04:58:45,stocks,"Its not your mistake, it's theirs."
2021-04-24 04:56:11,stocks,Did you buy weed stocks with it?
2021-04-24 07:21:22,stocks,"I have 3 questions:
1) Isn't that illegal because of tax consequences?
2) What did you buy to loose 100%? Stocks typically don't go to 0.
3) Are you planning on giving them ""their"" money back?"
2021-04-24 09:00:10,stocks,"So... what did he expect? Some super short term gain on $1000?

Did he think you were just some type of bank?

I don't understand how a grown ass man thinks he can pressure someone into investing $1000 of his own money and then just expect to break even immediately. Like... you're already even."
2021-04-24 05:48:47,stocks,Listen to this guy. It ain’t worth it.
2021-04-24 06:44:54,stocks,"Since you didn't mention an agreement, you probably didn't have one. Either don't do it in the future or have an agreement. Family always apply undo pressure to a situation  especially when they want something from you. Do your best not to fold under the pressure. Next time give the the app name or direct them to a website with information on how to invest and let them do it themselves."
2021-04-24 07:14:10,stocks,"Hey, you refused multiple times and you kept being bugged about it despite warning your family. You're not at fault. The fact that he wants the money back is ridiculous & shows he had no idea what he was doing. Don't give it to him, even when you do have it on hand."
2021-04-24 07:27:10,stocks,"time to own up to it

tell them what you said might happen, happened. it's all gone, should've kept your money."
2021-04-24 07:43:41,stocks,his money should have been put in an ETF
2021-04-24 08:15:37,stocks,Maybe they should’ve listened to you the first time lol.
2021-04-24 08:43:32,stocks,"Dont give it back , he wanted it not you ."
2021-04-24 08:58:07,stocks,"I don't understand how you can ""lose it all"".  Options?"

""Hey, invest my money""""Sure.""

And I proceed to buy shares in apple, Tesla, msft, etc.

100% guaranteed I won't ""lose it all"", extremely high chance of making a nice profit, and if it drops it will be a couple % loss. People acting like it's normal in investing to ""lose everything"". I don't know wtf are you guys investing in.  


This sounds like you got his money and yoloed it in crazy options, you deserve whatever you get."
2021-04-24 11:31:45,stocks,I would never tell people stocks to invest in for this reason. But I happily suggest VTI and chill. I need to take more of my own advice ha
2021-04-24 11:56:54,stocks,This isn’t real. They begged you to invest a fairly small sum of money for a grown man... you did. You instantly lost it all. And they all of a sudden want it back? Whole family is whack or this story is bogus
2021-04-24 11:57:39,stocks,"My father and sister both asked me to invest for them. I told them that I will only consider it if they give me the money and have complete acceptance that they will lose it all. I keep half of the profits and gift them the other half, with taxes coming out before the split.

So far it’s been more of a proof of concept since I’m playing with less than ten grand, but the results have been positive. Pretty sure they both agreed as a way to fund my understanding of the market."
2021-04-24 12:01:52,stocks,Tell him the money’s gone.
2021-04-24 12:06:34,stocks,I don't usually comment but you're a dumbass.
2021-04-24 12:12:10,stocks,Complete moron
2021-04-24 12:15:09,stocks,Send him an invoice for investment services rendered - 2% is normal.
2021-04-24 12:15:59,stocks,I'm more than happy to invest other people's money as long as they understand that I could lose all of it.
2021-04-24 12:18:03,stocks,"If you're investing someone else's money, particularly a parent's, it's easy.  Just put it in a low-risk, possibly high-dividend ETF.  It is irresponsible to put it into high-risk stocks."
2021-04-24 12:24:40,stocks,">  And now he is asking for it back 

Did you tell him that's not how it works?"
2021-04-24 12:28:54,stocks,Tell him he should be a man and understand the risks associated with the stock market next time. You should've written up a contract
2021-04-24 12:30:01,stocks,"Just explain to him that this is investing, sometimes you win sometimes you lose. Why is he even asking for the money back? He knew that he is taking a risk by asking you to invest it."
2021-04-24 12:30:05,stocks,Personally I would just refuse to give his money back. If he was more than happy to fling you 1000 thinking you would quadruple it. Now he wants it back because he seen that you couldn’t do that. Yeah just refuse..
2021-04-24 12:31:28,stocks,Nah dude. HE lost that shit.
2021-04-24 12:41:55,stocks,"Sometimes the opposite gets you in trouble too; I once told a relative about a success I had in picking a stock and she told and aunt of mine who was all like “If he knew that was going to happen why didn’t he tell us?”  The reason of course was because I didn’t know with any degree of certainty it was going to happen and didn’t want to cause a relative that had no idea about the risks to lose money.

I think the lesson is; don’t talk about specific investments with family / friends."
2021-04-24 12:50:39,stocks,"One, it's super illegal unless you're licensed. Two, taxes. Three, money ruins relationships. Four, you lost it all. 

My dad asked the same thing and i sent a very long, polite list of the reasons there was no way that was going to happen, but if he would like i can set him up with a licensed investor in his area, or my investor that handles my retirement funds. (No fucking way I'm allowed to get my hands on my retirement lol, by my own rules)

Never, ever EVER NEVER do money type shit between family or friends."
2021-04-24 12:55:02,stocks,How is it possible to lost it all though?
2021-04-24 12:55:17,stocks,This guy can’t day trade without asking his fiancé’s kid to do it for him? Then demanding you just give it back like he wasn’t begging you to make him rich quick off his astonishing investment. What a Melvin.
2021-04-24 12:58:54,stocks,Oh man. Yeah... never invest anyone else’s money
2021-04-24 13:35:27,stocks,"You lost it all?  Even if you bought GME at all time high and sold at all time low, you couldn't lose 100%.  What the shit dude."
2021-04-24 13:50:03,stocks,How do you lose all of it?  Did you trade options?    What did he want you to do?  Turn it into 10000k overnight?  Losing everything is almost a feat in itself.
2021-04-24 14:09:38,stocks,"My sister once asked me. I told her I would give her 2% returns and that's that.

I would take the money and just stuff it in an index etf anyway. But I would give 2% no matter what.

That's the only way I would do it. People don't understand that it's not always smooth sailing. It's hard to get returns at every point."
2021-04-24 14:40:47,stocks,"When my parents asked me to invest some money for them I sat down and told them I'd invest there money on 4 conditions, they choose the amount they want to invest, I help them make a brokerage account, in their names (I don't have the log in info), the investment must be medium to long term, and I would only recommend low risk investments (basically very big ETFs). So far this has worked fine. Returns are small but consistent and everyones happy"
2021-04-24 14:56:16,stocks,could you not have just put the £1000 into VUSA or VMIG? or did they see you 3x your account in a month and assume that you could 30x their money every year for them
2021-04-24 15:07:55,stocks,so you told him you could lose it all and you didn't want to do it. you then did it and like you warned it all went tits up. how can he ask for the money? you told him and it happened... sounds like an idiot to me
2021-04-24 15:47:37,stocks,How’d you lose it all? The stock dropped to zero? Business crashed?
2021-04-24 15:57:56,stocks,"You would’ve been better off telling them to take it to Vegas and betting it all on black. 

If you lost it all you must’ve done options or something.

You should’ve stood your ground and said “no” more firmly. But if you were going to do it, you should’ve put it all in an index ETF and left it for a few years."
2021-04-24 15:59:06,stocks,"Is it even legal to invest other people's money without some qualifications, licenses, and pages of paperwork?"

2021-04-24 16:17:42,stocks,"Out of interest, how did you lose all of it? I mean you must have been doing something very very risky?"
2021-04-24 16:45:23,stocks,The only way you lost 100% of an investment is if you were in options. I’d reconsider what you think investing is.
2021-04-24 16:54:10,stocks,how bad are you that you have a total loss?
2021-04-24 16:56:18,stocks,Sounds like a him problem
2021-04-24 17:36:33,stocks,Don’t give the MONEY BACK. Tell him that investing doesn’t work like that. You guys don’t have a contract so you’re not obligated to return the lost money.
2021-04-24 17:43:20,stocks,"You need to develop this very important life skill that gives you the ability to tell people to f*** off.

These kind of people usually prey on your feelings of guilt and try to take you for a sucker.

Tell them the money is gone and end of story. You explicitly told them there was no guarantee and that life sucks. 

Don’t give him a penny back out of your pocket."
2021-04-24 17:57:49,stocks,Give him fake paperwork that shows he has had solid returns to buy yourself some time. Then find new investors to cover the money you owe him. But convince him and the new investors to keep their money invested while you use their money to buy yourself expensive gifts. Quit your job and continue finding new investors to keep you afloat in case one of the investors pulls out. In essence borrow from investor B to pay investor A. I’m pretty sure this is legal just don’t let them know what you’re doing and NEVER stop finding new investors.
2021-04-24 18:01:54,stocks,So the foolproof way is the opposite pester someone to invest your money and then if they lose it make them pay back and if they make sweet gains you pat them on the back lol this is a joke.  Was probably this aholes thinking all along though.  It’s sad but trust people at your own risk nowadays.  Even family.
2021-04-24 18:03:54,stocks,Show him the south park “...and it’s gone” clip. That should clear up any confusions he may have.
2021-04-24 18:10:19,stocks,"Tell him this is a teachable moment for him. Never give your money to a non-professional to invest for you in the market. Tell him he’s getting a family discount on that lesson.

Also: how the hell did you lose it all? Did you put it all into options that went the opposite way?"
2021-04-24 19:05:57,stocks,"Tell him he can get his money back but he needs to give you more first, and its possible that you might lose that too."
2021-04-24 19:10:20,stocks,Great advice. I speak from experience. I don't even tell people what I'm invested in anymore. Except one friend who invests himself.
2021-04-24 19:31:57,stocks,Don’t you need a license to invest other people’s money anyways?
2021-04-24 19:50:15,stocks,"I tell my family members who ask me to manage their money this ""I will manage your money on one condition, I get a % of profit and any money lost is your problem, not mine"". Then I put it into a market-tracked ETF such as S&P 500 and sit back."
2021-04-24 07:01:39,stocks,I got into stocks in January just before the GME craze. Gave some bad advice to someone who is still down $600 lol. I try not to tell people what to do with their money anymore even now that I have learned much in the last 4 months.
2021-04-24 05:30:14,stocks,This is so true. Had to tell my parents no numerous times over months.
2021-04-24 07:29:29,stocks,Sounds like you did not invest but rather traded - I can't feel sorry for someone risking it all while gambling.
2021-04-24 09:23:27,stocks,Wow. Anyone who needs this advice definitely shouldn’t even be investing their own money.
2021-04-24 09:34:11,stocks,Im pretty sure HE lost it :)
2021-04-24 08:17:12,stocks,Are you even allowed legally to invest on their behalf? Dont you need to be a CFA to manage other people’s money thats where the not a financial advisor meme stem from right?
2021-04-24 09:12:50,stocks,Fuck that! You give him nothing! Thats the way stocks work. So I'm taking it everyone in the world should be going to Wall Street right now getting that money back
2021-04-24 09:22:41,stocks,Your mom’s fiancé is not kind. He expects you to support his lifestyle by making money FOR HIM. That is a big red flag for your mom and the family
2021-04-24 09:30:49,stocks,You shoulda gotten a contract bruh lmao that’s your own fault
2021-04-24 06:54:42,stocks,How could you lose £1000 just like that?
2021-04-24 08:33:01,stocks,"$1000? And you guys actually talk about it still? Seriously? I gave more than that to friends over the years when they needed it and never thought about it again. Some paid it back and others didnt but who the flip cares about $1000 if its family? 

Actually this was a really good thing that happened to you. Now you know who isnt really family and it just cost $1k. Never deal with that turd again."
2021-04-24 07:36:13,stocks,You shouldn’t have invested his $. You should have kept it and told him you lost it on stocks. Stick it to that silly cheap man lmao. I do this to idiots who want me to gamble their $. Came up $750 on Blackjack with some dudes $ he gave me to play for him.
2021-04-24 06:58:44,stocks,"Generally speaking, in the US you have to be licensed and generally registered before you can invest someone else’s money. Always a good reason not to take someone else’s money if you’re not already in the business."
2021-04-24 08:35:24,stocks,Fuck that dude. He knew the risks. He risked it and lost it.  What an asshole he is.
2021-04-24 10:04:45,stocks,Just tell them what to invest in but always end with but idk tho for legal reasons
2021-04-24 14:59:14,stocks,"sounds less like you invested his money and more like you gambled it in a casino, weird"
2021-04-24 08:00:57,stocks,"This is common, here take 1000k make me mad returns if it don't pan out I want my money back. 😤 You have been had. He used you for risk free investments. 🤷"
2021-04-24 05:46:13,stocks,That’s ok I would of considered it my takeout budget too
2021-04-24 07:15:44,stocks,"Well, if they're asking for it back, tell them it's gone. If you were going to accept it anyway, the first rule is 'Take this money as gone and deleted'. I invest a humble amount of money for my foreign mother. Despite any small gains, I always repeatedly tell her about the risk of losing it all."
2021-04-24 07:30:35,stocks,"I feel like the same should be said for ""retirement accounts."" people are just putting their money into an account for someone else to gamble with. Honestly its almost worse because these accounts come with fees if the people gambling your money are successful but do not give back when they lose."
2021-04-24 07:33:36,stocks,How did you lost it? Any world index ETF would give pretty good results
2021-04-24 07:44:18,stocks,I always tell them the fishing story with the own stick.
2021-04-24 07:45:18,stocks,"Sorry to hear that, ya definitely not a good idea. There are loads of options for people to invest themselves so I really don't see the need for doing something like this anymore.
Nat saying it happened here but it could also be a way to launder dirty money..."
2021-04-24 07:48:45,stocks,"The unspoken rule that even wallstreetbets wouldn’t break, never play with money you can’t afford to lose. 

No borrowing money just your own fun money. That way you don’t lose money plus go into debt afterwards."
2021-04-24 07:53:57,stocks,"Sucks / 💩 situation but you shouldn’t have to give it back. If they would have asked you for the profits there’s no reason why they should be let off the hook for the losses.

For people like this I just maintain a google spreadsheet with the weights of my portfolio on it, copy me if you want, or don’t idc, but don’t come crying to me after if it was a bad ride because I was on the same ride."
2021-04-24 08:04:23,stocks,"What you do is give them a list on paper and then tell them.  ""Here is 3 stocks that I would buy right now. Buy 1 or all 3 up to you."""
2021-04-24 08:15:50,stocks,"My buddy offered me same and i said ok - but you need to be aware that I can lose it all and if I do, money is gone.. sorry.
He agreed to such terms, though for now i’m 300 up ;)"
2021-04-24 08:17:20,stocks,"it can be done in a better way

like you if you invest through a service which allow copy other people trade (like Etoro broker)

this way you would be able to invest and help them , but yet they would be fully responsible about there money , since they can withdraw it anytime and any gain and losses would be in there hand"
2021-04-24 08:17:58,stocks,"Several comments placing blame on you, questioning how you lost it all, etc.  It was £1,000.   If they haven't lost (or made?) a thousand in short order they probably aren't taking very big risks.  Maybe if it was then only  £1000 he had maybe risks were excessive? 

I have no idea what the conversation was between you two regarding investing the money. Like if it was ""oh yes this is very safe you can make a little bit every month."" I doubt that was it, but if it was it would have been misleading to go invest it in something high risk.  Maybe the conversation was like ""yo there are these pot stocks,  the next big thing.""  

Either way it's the stock market, you can loose money, It's not a savings account.  Is it your ""fault?"" He could see it that way. Maybe it's his fault for not understanding risk or maybe you didn't evaluate his risk tolerance correctly or maybe he overstated his risk tolerance. 

I think the moral of the story is here just don't discuss investing with family or friends.  That can avoid this whole issue and a bunch of other ones. Like them thinking oh he's making *free money* let me mooch of him, etc. Furthermore discussions will be taken as investing advise and when they loose their own money they will blame you (even though it's not your fault obviously).

It would have never occurred to me to take someone else's money to invest. I'm not even sure legally I could do that here (US).  The most I would ever do is help someone open a brokerage account themselves and show them how to use it. That's probably never going to happen either because as a rule I don't discuss investments so it never comes up."
2021-04-24 08:22:14,stocks,"1. Yep it was a dumb idea, but hey you learned. 
2. Did you write a contract of the money handover? (There are templates for these) 
No? Sucks to be him then. 

And if there would be a contract I wouldve stated that. ( I, as a dumbfuck handing over a 1000 sterling pounds to the other dumbass that could lose it all and I am only liable for all the potential damages.)

Thats how its done. You both learned a valuable lesson."
2021-04-24 08:27:58,stocks,Professional advisor here. Would you share how you lost all of it? Options?
2021-04-24 08:48:14,stocks,I was thinking of soliciting people's money to invest in the stock market on their behalf. A few of my favorite tickers have been on a downward spiral and I just wish I personally so much more money to 'buy the dip' that *surely* I could lure a prospective investor if I compared their potential DCA to a bagholder like myself. I see why people start ponzi schemes now!
2021-04-24 08:51:14,stocks,Also it's basically illegal unless you register as an investment advisor.
2021-04-24 08:53:56,stocks,"Idk, did they explicitly state that they accept the risk of losing it all? It's on them, except if you knew they needed the money...then you definitely shouldn't have taken it."
2021-04-24 08:55:32,stocks,"It's a lose/lose situation.

Don't talk about financials with others and certainly don't handle their money."
2021-04-24 08:56:50,stocks,"Hugs buddy. He gave you money knowing you could lose it all. It’s on him and your mom for pressuring you. 

They didn’t lend you money to invest for yourself they gave you money to invest for him. 
Big diifference. 

He is probably going to be lisses but his angry should be directed at himself."
2021-04-24 09:01:40,stocks,Just tell them you lost it. If you started with that like you said then there is no problem. They agreed to it.
2021-04-24 09:02:57,stocks,I think your moms BF is the idiot here.
2021-04-24 09:08:24,stocks,"Tell him he knew he was taking a chance, and he needs to fuck right off.

But I agree with your point. This is risky business and everyone should be responsible for themselves.

I don't understand though, how can you lose it all? Did you have investments in stock, or were you trading? You would have to make shit investments in trash companies to lose everything buying and holding."
2021-04-24 09:10:40,stocks,"Don't advise people *at all* because if the stock goes up, they will blame you for not investing more. If it goes down, they will blame you.

Don't even talk about it casually.

I was talking to a friend about a potential merger. While on the phone, they bought about $500 worth if the stock. I was like, "" No, no, I have no idea if this is going to happen."""
2021-04-24 09:18:30,stocks,"No shit, haha."
2021-04-24 09:18:45,stocks,That’s why there’s a disclaimer from brokers and financial planners at the bottom of the page.
2021-04-24 09:20:44,stocks,Honestly it sounds like you didn't invest it. Sounds like you gambled it. Next time just invest the money.
2021-04-24 09:20:56,stocks,"Yeah I just started trading last sept. Made gains on the EOY bull rally. My parents wanted to give me 100k to invest , I declined."
2021-04-24 09:24:01,stocks,Index Fund it and do nothing. VTSAX and you would have been fine.
2021-04-24 09:24:34,stocks,All you had to do was buy VOO.
2021-04-24 09:25:14,stocks,Hey at least nobody will ask you to invest their money again!
2021-04-24 09:26:57,stocks,I never conduct business with family.  I know it can work in some scenarios but generally it’s a bad idea.
2021-04-24 09:30:07,stocks,Lose*
2021-04-24 09:34:12,stocks,"Never heard of someone doing this, actually. No one should ever do this. If someone wants to invest or, with how volatile some of the popular stocks have been, gamble high amounts of money away, they can make an account and do it themselves. Seems silly to do it for someone considering how easy it is to set up an account."
2021-04-24 09:34:52,stocks,Tell him to contact Judge Judy if he wants it back.
2021-04-24 09:34:59,stocks,I don't get it at all. Why couldn't they have just opened their own investment account?
2021-04-24 09:35:43,stocks,My mom asked me to. I eventually said yes and have doubled her $1000 in 8 months. Figuring out how to split the tax bill when she wants to cash out will be interesting though
2021-04-24 09:39:35,stocks,You don’t lose unless you sell.
2021-04-24 09:42:32,stocks,"Also don’t talk about your stock market performance to people, or stuff like this happens."
2021-04-24 09:45:17,stocks,"A scenario I had in my had when I actually make some considerable amount one day. I probably just make an example on how risky it is to invest in company A like I did. 
Apart from helping them setting up and etf I won’t do investment for anyone"
2021-04-24 09:47:58,stocks,"My close aunt/uncle asked me if i could ""do something"" with 30k like 2 years ago. No! I cant do anything for you. Just offered to teach them what an etf is and to help them open their own account. 

Although it wasnt the case with them, often people are looking to just pass off the responsibility/risk of losses to you. Also agree with the other giy about taxes."
2021-04-24 09:48:09,stocks,Tell him to quit having paper hands. Tell him to give you 2k more. Buy some options and swing for the fences.
2021-04-24 09:50:39,stocks,Just don’t pay him back😂

2021-04-24 09:55:22,stocks,"Excellent advice. My hubs gets asked often. He will offer tiny bits of advice but only general. Ie: they want to sell it all bc profit, maybe sell most and keep original investment in there. Nothing they can put back on him. It’s all their own decision."
2021-04-24 09:57:10,stocks,Pro Tip: don't ask other people to invest your money
2021-04-24 09:58:34,stocks,"My FIL is the absolute model of how NOT to manage money. Hair brain business ideas, fail business after business, no follow through, and just wasteful as hell. He's always looking for some way to be a millionaire overnight. When I suggest ways to make money that require only an investment of time and not money, he won't put any effort.

He gambled away my mother-in-law's 401k and life savings on ""day trading"". I put it in quotes because day trading implies some sort of research plan and discipline, none of which he exhibits when it comes to money. What little he did pick up in his adventure, was eating up by penalties because he never paid any taxes on it.

They had a foreclosure on their house because when the house values in Florida went skyrocketing, of course he took a home equity loan, and pissed it all the way and couldn't pay back. So they walked away from the house and let the bank repossess it.

My wife and I have done very well for ourselves, good jobs, smart investments. We have rental properties, other forms of generally passive income, and a 7 figure balance in the bank.

My mother-in-law recently inherited some money from her parents who passed away and whose house was sold and split up among the siblings. Of course my father-in-law can't wait to piss that money away too. My mother-in-law is basically penalist, and we are going to have to take her in when he dies, because he's basically leaving her with nothing. Meanwhile he sends me and my wife radio control cars.

He has repeatedly asked me to invest for him. I absolutely refuse, because I know he's expecting a get rich overnight situation. And I want nothing to do with his fiscal insanity. He thinks I'm some sort of genius, when actually I'm just not an idiot with my money. I've been investing in 401ks and other investment vehicles for probably 22 years now. 

I recently told my wife to accept his request, and send us what little money they have left. I told her it would be on a condition that I put it in a very conservative mutual fund account with Vanguard, in her mother's name only, and basically restrict any and all access and knowledge from him. But my mother-in-law won't do that."
2021-04-24 09:58:37,stocks,The number of people confusing investment with speculative trading is too high....
2021-04-24 10:08:09,stocks,"I left this for a few hours and damn its blown up, im going to read all the messages now!"
2021-04-24 10:10:59,stocks,"I always tell people ""You're making the purchase. I can only recommend what to look at."""

2021-04-24 10:13:06,stocks,Fuck that you don't owe that dude a cent.
2021-04-24 10:13:28,stocks,Just tell him to wait. His money is not 'all gone' unless you sold at a massive loss. Anyone who expects big gains in a small period of time has no business investing.
2021-04-24 10:13:37,stocks,"When someone tells me to invest money for them, my first question is « can you afford to lose it all? » 
They always say no they can’t, and it stops there. 
I don’t like to mix money and relationships (family or friends)"
2021-04-24 10:13:41,stocks,"It's also illegal. You also are on the hook to pay their taxes on those gains. I always offer to teach them, which no one ever has accepted. People are inherently lazy and think it's just free money."
2021-04-24 10:14:46,stocks,"It's like margin, but with someone you have a personal relationship with."
2021-04-24 10:17:54,stocks,"Fuck that, tell him that’s the risk he took"
2021-04-24 10:18:27,stocks,"What kind of risky ass play were you making with someone elses cash? You lost ALL of it? I agree you shouldnt invest other peoples money, but you would have had to have been incredibly irresponsible for that to have happened."

2021-04-24 10:29:33,stocks,Did you give him a disclaimer when invested like: the value of your investment can go down as well as up and you may not back all the money you invested !
2021-04-24 10:31:48,stocks,"Don't pay your mom's fiance back. He took the risk and lost out. Welcome to capitalism. Also, your mom should never have pressured you into doing this. Look up codependence. It might be something you struggle with and your mom may be taking advantage of you because you struggle with it."
2021-04-24 10:40:07,stocks,"Don't you dare give that money back lol. That guy is not only brain dead for giving it to you, he is doubly brain dead and an arsehole for wanting the money back"
2021-04-24 10:40:21,stocks,You should tell them that you tried your best and that it wouldnt be fair to give money out of your own pocket. People need to he aware of the risks
2021-04-24 10:47:34,stocks,"Yeah, what you did was pretty dumb and potentially illegal (depending on the jurisdiction & specific circumstances). 

The good news, for you at least, is that it is very unlikely that you can be held legally liable to return that money (again, depending on the specific circumstances). 

The social consequences, however, rest squarely on your shoulders."
2021-04-24 10:47:47,stocks,"There’s no benefit to investing for someone you care about. If you make them money, you don’t get anything out of it financially. If you lose them money, that could cause an issue with your relationship. It’s lose lose."

2021-04-24 11:00:28,stocks,"My sister wanted me to do the same, I convinced her to just open her own account and give me the login data for organizational purposes. Solves the problem: her funds under her name"
2021-04-24 11:01:42,stocks,You're risk assessment is awful if you were worried about investing someone else's money then dumped it all in options whne you caved.
2021-04-24 11:03:54,stocks,"Absolutely, there's no reason to. Investing is easy enough for a 5 year old to figure out these days. Refer them to an easy platform and the rest is up to them. If they are too lazy to do it themselves that's their problem."
2021-04-24 11:05:45,stocks,"You don't ""lose it all"" by investing. Were you trading options on something stupid?"
2021-04-24 11:05:56,stocks,It’s a business. Run it like a business. Do the paperworks next time. Get everything down in black ink and white paper.
2021-04-24 11:06:05,stocks,Also if you have a friend or loved one that invests don't tell people about it. My bf trying to be supportive keeps telling family I'm an investor and could give them advice...I have to say no so many times it gets tiring
2021-04-24 11:10:03,stocks,How did you lose it all?  Did you buy options or YOLO into a company that went bankrupt?  I agree I don't even give leads to people because they lose money in the short term and sell then blame you for it

2021-04-24 11:13:13,stocks,"So I know this is dumb, but I’ve got a question:

A millionaire friend put 5% of his net worth in an account and is asking to give me the password, letting me manage it.  I’ve said repeatedly I could lose it all and he’s not buying that excuse.  “Ehh that’s fine, it’s just 5%”.

Is there a simple legal way for me to just log in and execute trades, without taking any pay or commission?  Or would this make me legally a “fiduciary”?"
2021-04-24 11:14:30,stocks,How did you lose 1000 dollars of someone else’s money should you even manage your own funds lol
2021-04-24 11:16:23,stocks,Did you loosen it or lose it?
2021-04-24 11:19:49,stocks,"Ignoring the fact you probably shouldn’t do it in the first place. Why the fuck would you go high risk with someone else’s money? I helped my mom out with stocks and put her in safe and diversified stocks, even though that’s not how I trade. Because I know that it’s her money and her risk management is different."
2021-04-24 11:21:41,stocks,"Look on the bright side, no one will ever ask you to invest for you again and it only cost you $1,000 tops!"
2021-04-24 11:22:13,stocks,"You literally told them you didnt want to and could lose it all, and then they pushed it. Fuck them. I would have taken 1000 and told them i lost it even if i doubled it. They are stupid as shit for giving their money to someone who doesnt want it and then expecting more back."
2021-04-24 11:29:14,stocks,Just tell them to find shitty meme stocks on reddit like the rest of us
2021-04-24 11:30:52,stocks,Never tell family you made money in the stock market

2021-04-24 11:32:32,stocks,"Well, first off you aren't a licensed investment professional (most likely), so you aren't even legally allowed to do that anyway. Of course, two seconds of google is too difficult for people, so good luck to your situation. Besides, no one should invest for others. You can suggest things, but those decisions have to be made by them or someone who has experience managing money if they don't have the time to."
2021-04-24 11:34:02,stocks,"I've been asked to manage investments several times. I always tell them the same thing.. Almost all brokers offer some sort of managed portfolio and they have a much better record than me. I get lucky sometimes, but it's just that, luck. Luck comes it two forms. If you want to gamble your money, you don't need my help."
2021-04-24 11:34:57,stocks,"They never should have put you in that position, sorry this happened to you. If he keeps bothering you I suggest going to court, he knew the risk, you warned him that you where unqualified. You have not any obligation to give him any money let alone the full 1,000. It sucks that it’s your (I’m assuming) soon to be step-dad. But it’s better than giving up money you don’t have."
2021-04-24 11:39:03,stocks,I pretty sure this is also illegal to do in some states unless you are licensed.
2021-04-24 11:40:09,stocks,"Wrong, just throw it all in SPY and tell them to walk away for at least 5 years. The failure here is not telling the person ""I might lose literally all your money if you want to be risky"" and forcing them to really understand it"
2021-04-24 11:40:36,stocks,"“Asking for it back”

Lmao like no dude that’s the gamble"
2021-04-24 11:42:06,stocks,"I’ve invested on behalf of three people in my life. Each time I had them come with me to the bank to sit down with the notary and had them sign a document stating that the $XXXX is a *cash gift* under no promise of return in any way shape or form. I also specifically stated that I am not licensed with the SEC or FINRA nor am I a majority stakeholder in any publicly traded company and I am not a financial advisor. 

I’ve been way, way wiser with their money than my own and entered very clear plans based on fundamental and technical analysis and always returned the money, plus their returns, minus tax. The first was my SO, she gave me a grand, and I multibagged on AAVE during the crypto run up before/during the GameStop Saga Episode I: The Hamptons Menace. I showed her the trade confirmations and broke down the taxation on the trades since we realized short term gains. She paid the taxes on it and gave me a commission! Love her for that. We used the gains as a down payment on a new car for me.

But, the other one was not as clean cut. Old friend from high school made it big in real estate after TSLA ran up and wanted me to invest on his behalf. I told him to get a brokerage that has live portfolio managers, that’s what they are there for. JPM does it, Fidelity does it, TDA does it. Leave me out of it. He was insistent he did it with me. So I went to a lawyer I worked with on a criminal case when I was a juvenile and had him draft a legitimate contract similar to the notarized ones I had my parents and SO sign for their investments. I included in his that since his *cash gift* exceeded $15,000, I would be immediately deducting taxes for the amount. He signed without even reading. I told him he really, really needs to read it. I even gave him another blank copy. He just signed it again and left the check. I made a shitty move on a couple of individual tickers and was down maybe 10% two weeks in. He calls me up demanding his money back because he “needs it.” Okay, no problem. Give me 3 days, I’ll return whatever I have and keep my taxables.

2 weeks later I get served. Lmao okay I saw this coming from a mile. I had my lawyer send his lawyer the two contracts he signed and the case never hit the courtroom and I never heard from the guy again.

Do what you want, but make sure unless you are a licensed financial advisor, anyone who gives you money understands that it is a cash gift under no promise of return."
2021-04-24 11:42:18,stocks,What did you invest in that it went from 1000 to 0?
2021-04-24 11:42:56,stocks,How did you lose it all? It sounds like you were taking an extremely risky investing strategy. You should have discussed his risk tolerance ahead of time and put it into some low risk blue chips.
2021-04-24 11:43:27,stocks,How did you manage to wipe off the entire amount? As a general lesson don't invest others' money in such risky securities especially if they don't understand the risk involved.
2021-04-24 11:44:34,stocks,Should have just put it in an index and charged a 1% management fee per year.
2021-04-24 11:45:32,stocks,How it you lose it all?
2021-04-24 11:45:53,stocks,"You didn’t lose like an idiot, could’ve happened to anyone. But your future stepdad is an idiot for thinking he can get the money when there are gains and also get the money when he loses. Why not just ask for a 1000 dollars if it was so easy."
2021-04-24 11:47:17,stocks,Well you should have told him that the liability is all on him and if you lose the funds you lose the funds. Make them understand what they are risking.
2021-04-24 11:48:20,stocks,"Or, you know, just dont speak about you ""making money in the market"" in a first place."

2021-04-24 11:51:48,stocks,Should of written a contract with the basis of “only invest with what you are willing to lose” and that you aren’t responsible for any losses.

It actually did just finally went back up about 2 months ago and how$1000 is actually about $3000 right now.   

I'm still holding as i think that stock is still undervalue, hopefully in the next 5-10 years I'll get him about 10-20k so a 15 years investment. That's about 100% every year right now."

2021-04-24 11:58:43,stocks,Yup did this once for my friends. Lost half the money and decided I’m going to pay them back and never invest for anyone but myself again.

Imagine the hubris it takes to blow 100% of a portfolio, particularly after only managing a small return for themselves over a single year.

Both OP and fiancé got what they deserved."
2021-04-24 12:09:26,stocks,"That's a hard no. It's so easy to open an account of your own. If you want someone else to make your investment decisions, there are so many professional brokers out there who can do that."
2021-04-24 12:11:08,stocks,"Think you should go back to WSB if you're going to YOLO it on calls.

Why did you get them to open something like a Nutmeg account, or a free trading app and buy ETFs?"
2021-04-24 12:11:44,stocks,Go to the local bank and open him a savings account.
2021-04-24 12:12:25,stocks,"OP: I'm too shy and uncomfortable to help you invest or tell you no


Also OP: OK I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY LET'S GO BALLS DEEP ON OPTIONS BRO"
2021-04-24 12:12:30,stocks,"I just tell people that I’m really good at high risk gambling. And that they can do it too, but it’s high risk gambling. So far it’s scared everyone away ^.^

Honestly, I’m amazed you have the emotional integrity to weather stocks, but got pressured in by family. 

After watching doge swing around wildly, I feel like I could tell someone they have cancer without it giving me depression. It’s a mad world out there!"
2021-04-24 12:13:36,stocks,"Why would someone not do something like this.
I will not invest for you however I will walk you through opening an account and share what I do with stocks. From then on, 100% your responsibility."
2021-04-24 12:15:19,stocks,"He knew the risk involved, didn't he?"
2021-04-24 12:18:12,stocks,"This is 100% a rule to live by, I learned the hard way. I told my gf I was all-in on Tesla back in 2013. When Tesla started to sky-rocket in 2020, she wanted me to start investing for her too. I eventually caved and bought her some shares in QQQ which I felt was pretty safe for her. It ended up doing pretty well, but put so much stress on me that it ended up ruining our relationship and we broke up (variety of other reasons too). Never get money involved 👍"
2021-04-24 12:20:46,stocks,"Even if it's a really safe investment, like a very broad index tracking etf, there is guarantee of having your money back. Thats why there's disclaimers you can lose everything in investment banks. Just because someone is lucky, to give them money is also stupid.
And it's kinda illegal to invest other peoples money. And if tge SEC finds out, it will rain blood."
2021-04-24 12:21:58,stocks,"Talk a load of this story. So my uncle begs my dad to invest with him in this pharmacy chain company startup a few years back. My dads not running it or anything, just had some type of early investor access. After a while, my dad caves and lumps my uncles money with his and they invest it in (what could be considered a startup). A year later when it goes bust and both of their money is gone, my uncle sues my dad on the basis that he gave him a loan. Even though that asshole received dividends on the investment. Been in courts for almost 3 years now. 
Yeah never invest any money but your own. What a fucked world we live in. Your own older brother coming after you. Sheesh"
2021-04-24 12:26:11,stocks,Risk analysis? What's that?
2021-04-24 12:31:46,stocks,You warned em
2021-04-24 12:32:14,stocks,Rule of thumb: don’t invest other people’s money unless you’re a licensed RIA/IAR.
2021-04-24 12:35:26,stocks,"There is a reason everyone always caveats ""not financial advice"".. Unless you are a professional financial advisor, you've got no business giving anyone else advice.  At the very best just tell him how to open a brokerage, bonus, get your free referral stocks. Then tell him HOW YOU make your investment decisions. And what made you successful in the past. Then let him learn for himself.  At the very worst, tell him you'll do it. But make him realize if he wants high risk high reward you could potentially lose it all and you won't be responsible if you do.  (Even then I'm not recommending this.)... your problem is you basically got taken advantage of.  He didn't care about your respect.  He saw a risk free investment.  Either you double it, and he says he's happy and takes the profit.  Or you lose it and he threatens to get it back from him. Seems like he was too coward to trade on his own and figured he could pawn off responsibility on you if the trade goes south.   Unfortunately you dug your hole so you have to figure out your next move. At least you learned from it and are now helping others"
2021-04-24 12:40:51,stocks,Ur moms a he? Damn
2021-04-24 12:44:21,stocks,OP used to work for Lehman Brothers or Bearstern?
2021-04-24 12:44:50,stocks,"Here's the thing, he lost the money in a bad investment, end of story. We don't get our money back when we do this."
2021-04-24 12:48:16,stocks,"Had people at work do the same thing, said I’d show them account setup. Go over all the risks.

I’m hesitant to do tips of what I’m doing in case it turns out poorly, as they won’t be ready to manage the situation.

I’ll add that the dude should know shit goes up as well as down."
2021-04-24 12:56:28,stocks,I'd say you can help other people invest but learn how to draw up a freaking contract before anything gets exchanged!

2021-04-24 13:06:37,stocks,"My sympathies. I have resisted pleas like this from my mom and no one but she, my partner, and my brothers know that I invest, for exactly this reason. Thanks for sharing this advice; it reinforces my resolve. And best of luck to you in recovering the money and refusing further involvement."

2021-04-24 13:10:04,stocks,If anyone asks me for advice investing my answer is to stick it in a robo-advisor account that auto-invests in index funds.
2021-04-24 13:14:21,stocks,I just tell them that I like the stock.
2021-04-24 13:15:35,stocks,I would never put someone else's money in anything more risky than a moderate risk ETF. If they want to roll the dice they can go buy a bunch of long calls like an idiot themselves.
2021-04-24 13:15:51,stocks,I dunno that seems very basic to know. I for sure thought that would be a dreadful idea when people asked me to do it. I hardly even tell people what I invest in simply because I fear they copy and may loose money and blame me.
2021-04-24 13:20:11,stocks,They took the gamble on allowing you to invest their money. That was their decision and they can accept the consequences.
2021-04-24 13:21:11,stocks,I mean the guy clearly didn’t need it if he was so willing to give it to a beginner trader after being told the risks
2021-04-24 13:21:57,stocks,"Was there no talk about time on return?  He expected you to make him rich overnight?  That's on you if you didn't explain.  How exactly did you ""lose"" the money? Do you mean your investment choices are down and he has to wait years before it grows again?  Or did you do some yolo shit with his money and literally lost it all?  Sounds like expectations were not set at the beginning, that is on you.    You don't owe him shit though either, but it's going to make for some awkward family get togethers..  shitty situation."
2021-04-24 13:23:37,stocks,"If anyone gives you a hard time, it's illegal to trade any securities for others without a brokers license. Just say whatever app/bank you use is really strict about it.

Not line they're really going to pay attention to a few thousand, but it is illegal."

2021-04-24 13:24:04,stocks,"Not sure how taxes are done on your side of the pond, a non professional investor can claim a capital loss up to 3k USD. Maybe offer that jackoff the tax savings you got by claiming a capital loss but nothing more. And tell your mom to dump that loser. If he is going after you after 1k, what is he going to do with your mom’s assets after he marries her?"
2021-04-24 13:27:45,stocks,How the hell did you lose it all though lol
2021-04-24 13:28:17,stocks,"It's gone, not your Problem anymore"
2021-04-24 13:28:49,stocks,Kind of your mistake that you did not warn them first....
2021-04-24 13:28:51,stocks,You learned the wrong lesson here. As others have said what you were doing is gambling not investing.
2021-04-24 13:29:30,stocks,I did this with a friend but I flat out told him the risk. Luckily in my case we invested in doge and literally quadrupled his money overnight
2021-04-24 13:29:48,stocks,"So you bought options? Lmao that’s literally the only way “you lost it all”

You’re dumb, your mom is dumb, her fiancé is dumb. Not sure who the biggest dunce is though"
2021-04-24 13:32:00,stocks,"I have a friend that asked me to invest for her. At first I was like no, but then she reminded me her parents will be leaving her like 2 million, maybe more, when they pass. She literally told me that even if she loses everything she doesn't care because she has that as a fall back.

I still would feel like crap if I lost it all though, so I took the very low risk boomer strategy. She is basically invested in mostly mutual funds and large blue chip stocks with a couple REITs for the dividends. So far so good. She even throws me some extra cash every now and then for doing this."
2021-04-24 13:32:58,stocks,This person had absolutely zero knowledge of how the stock market works? I certainly hope you don't give him a cent. Sorry this happened.
2021-04-24 13:32:59,stocks,How is someone so stupid they cant download an app and invest their money themselves?
2021-04-24 13:33:30,stocks,"Man, I don’t even like giving investment advice to friends and relatives any more as soon as they take a loss they ask me “what happened”?"
2021-04-24 13:36:45,stocks,How are you losing money? Your doing it wrong
2021-04-24 13:41:00,stocks,IMHO I don’t see how you can shoulder too much of the blame for it. I mean he is the one who kept pushing when you said no for so long. He has as much if not more of the lesson to learn than you do.
2021-04-24 13:41:08,stocks,better is to give financial advice buy gme at $350 he said it will be fun he said
2021-04-24 13:45:36,stocks,"The way I see it, you said no on multiples. They pressured you, if you explained the risks, he can go F himself. 
However, if you told him you’d make him money and it’s a sure thing, he should still go F himself for pressuring an inexperienced person to invest money. Don’t give someone your money to handle if you’re not prepared to lose it. It’s that simple. I don’t think you did anything wrong honestly. You consistently expressed your reservations in the first place. They disregarded. It should be a lesson to them, not you. The only lesson you should take is to be better in your DDs and your investment strategy."
2021-04-24 13:46:13,stocks,Your money is your problem. My money is my problem.
2021-04-24 13:48:32,stocks,The trick is to just pretend to invest that money. Then give it back a year later. No one is the wiser and there’s no pressure. You just say it was up but that the market hasn’t been great and you’re inexperienced.
2021-04-24 13:49:17,stocks,I would have purposely lost it all in like 3 hours.
2021-04-24 13:50:45,stocks,"I indeed invest some of my friends money but its all disclosed in a personal contract that If I lost their money its not my fault etc and they all agree to sign it. I mean by that you cant have conflict if before investing you explain clearly what can happen and if they agree then its all good. Ive made them money, Ive lost too but It never was a problem. Just be careful the person you take the money from."
2021-04-24 13:52:41,stocks,They knew the risk - it wasn’t a guarantee- you lost - they lost
2021-04-24 13:53:52,stocks,Never. Majority of people who even consider asking for others to invest for them illegally don't want the responsibility of a loss. All they see is 100% Return of Investment. If it doesn't go their way you are always the one to blame regardless.
2021-04-24 13:55:14,stocks,I would have said 20% if gain and no obligation to pay back loss.

2021-04-24 13:59:28,stocks,"1) Don't do this unless you're a professional. Your gut instinct was correct. 

2) ALWAYS get terms and conditions in writing ANY TIME money is involved AT ALL. Just a statement saying ""There is a risk I will lose your money and I cannot be held accountable to give it back."" Is enough to either scare them off or at least give you a legal advantage."
2021-04-24 14:00:44,stocks,ummmmmmmmm.... yeahhhhhhhhh... that's a hard pass.  Serves him and you right.
2021-04-24 14:02:05,stocks,I wouldn’t give them shit. They knew the risks.
2021-04-24 14:04:44,stocks,"All you gotta do is find another investor that will invest whatever you owe your step dad and some. Then afterwards if you can’t come up with the money to pay back the new investor, then just find another new investor again."

""Learn how to communicate properly and humbly, that you aren't experienced in the stock market, and that there are true risks associated with investing"" 

Because if you started with that disclaimer. You'd be no different to any other broker."
2021-04-24 14:06:53,stocks,You weren’t investing though you were gambling lol
2021-04-24 14:08:54,stocks,"If I ever ask someone to invest for me, then I follow the rules. I only hand over what I'm willing to lose.

If I hand it to my friend (that I trust) and he loses it, then I'm not going to sweat it. Why? because it was ""disposable"", I could afford to lose it."

2021-04-24 14:09:59,stocks,"Funny how  he wants all the reward but none of the risk!!! I’d tell him to jog on. 

Whenever I get asked I just blame taxes as a reason for not being able to do it."
2021-04-24 14:13:13,stocks,Just set them up with a Fidelity Go account. That's what I do anyway. Automatically gets invested into domestic and international whole-market funds based on their risk tolerance. All they have to do is deposit the money.

2021-04-24 14:16:00,stocks,How the hell did you lose it all? Thought in a worst case scenario you’d be like 80% down

I mean what did they expect, you had only been trading stocks for a year. They were dummies for assuming it was a safe bet and even dummer to expect the money back."
2021-04-24 14:23:58,stocks,The title should be: Learn what gambling is and apply those rules to stonks. Teach other idiots the same rules.

2021-04-24 14:26:43,stocks,I had someone seeing my blackberry gains back in January or whenever. I kept declining the offer to advise them on my investment and they saw that as me being selfish and not wanting them to make money. Looking at where bb still is now I am very glad of my decision

2021-04-24 14:27:25,stocks,"How did you lose ALL of it? Options? 
Damn dude it takes some real balls to lose EVERYTHING."
2021-04-24 14:31:20,stocks,How did you lose it all? Most stocks don’t go to zero so I’m assuming you were fucking with options.

2021-04-24 14:42:59,stocks,"I think you did your mother a favor and saved her from marrying someone who doesn't treat you like a family member and more like a cash cow until you can't be milked. 

Ask your mother to reimburse and short the fiance. You can pay her back for your mishap later."
2021-04-24 14:44:48,stocks,"This whole problem could’ve been avoided if you put his money in steady stocks. If you’re not comfortable with managing someone else’s money, why would you put it in volatile investments?"
2021-04-24 14:46:23,stocks,"I'm just going to go ahead and echo the astonishment that you managed to lose every penny.

But yeah as long as you told him clearly it's risky af and could go to 0 what can you do? 

You made every effort and lost he knew what he was getting into.

Or not but yeah I'll risk mine but no way am I being responsible for that shit!"

2021-04-24 14:56:34,stocks,I hear ya. He does mention he had a yr of experience and told his mom that he wasn't experienced. As for the rest I didn't get into that as it is clear he is not a professional and was doing it based on family pressure. Obviously he shouldn't be investing for anyone but himself for tons of reasons. But I also understand trying to help family. It would be easier in the future for him to tell them about the app he uses and/or direct them to info that will help inveset them selfs.
2021-04-24 15:08:10,stocks,"Eh, I have them open their own brokerage then tell em to dump it into Spyg or voo so I can ignore em. If they want tips beyond that I'll just tell them my picks of the day, amd, baba, ect ect."

2021-04-24 15:41:43,stocks,Well first of all tell him the money is invested and that he shouldnt take it back yet. That should buy you some time. Then return the original 1k maybe some more or less and say the market is crashing but i rescued your investment.
2021-04-24 15:44:02,stocks,Initially I would say it's his fault for risking his money in hands of a non-experienced investor. But now I say it's your fault for knowing the risk of losing his money and still accepting his money to invest. This should've been common sense.

2021-04-24 15:56:13,stocks,"If your gonna do it make them execute the trades themselves, and any losses are on them as its a fucking casino.

Also tell them you want payed a small finders fee for the stress of making risky recommendations that could still damage a relationship you value.

If they really want to invest they will set up their own account. In that case I always suggest TD if they’re serious about any type of investing. Step dad sounds like a Robinhood kinda deal. At least you could sucker him into making a RH or WeBull(which is way better than Robinhood and as close to TD except a bit more user friendly/ offers free stock incentives for signing people up IMO) moral of the story you’re step dad is an idiot and he should have lost the 1,000 himself. I do agree with everyone else though if you put it all on options it was a bit of a bonehead move but maybe you can elaborate a little more on what you lost the whole kit and kaboodle on?..."

2021-04-24 17:32:17,stocks,Don’t pay them back please! You warned them. They made their bed now they have to lay in it.
2021-04-24 17:46:46,stocks,"No offense OP, but this is an obvious faux pas.

The less obvious one that I see people consistently doing, is giving friends/family investing advice. It may sound innocuous, but even if you warn people about the risks before getting them excited about an investment, they will still come back and blame it on you if they lose their money.

Finances are best left unspoken about with people you know."

That’s the game you play. 

I would be more concerned about the tax consequences being on your shoulders if any gains were made. Individuals don’t have the correct structures in place to invest other people’s money, so please don’t do it. For example you would pay CGT on over all gain and then only be able to pay net back to him. If this net amount was a profiting believe he would also have to pay CGT"

2021-04-24 12:15:58,stocks,"Unless you’ve been investing for at least half a decade, I would go as far as saying all gains or losses are random. Like this past year, either people sold everything or gained a shit ton and most of it wasn’t because they were smart. It’s shear luck. Quite honestly I’ve been disgusted by how the stock market discounted people’s lives in favor of profits. 500k died in the states and the rich got richer. I guess what I’m trying to say is that the market is brutal and I’m only for long term value investing."
2021-04-24 13:06:04,stocks,"Grow a pair, and tell him you lost it. That's the way it goes."

2021-04-24 13:42:44,stocks,My solution to this is to deduct an amount equivalent to the cost of taxes. And you make it crystal clear to your client that they have to pay for taxes out of their gains. So they technically pay double tax by going through you. And if they don't like it then too bad.

I write down the stocks on a white board so everyone who comes over can see what im buying and selling. I never disclose the amount I buy and sell and I never tell them what to buy and sell just show them what im looking at currently. I update the short term side daily and the long term side weekly.

I’m from the US and I’ve had family members and friends ask me to invest money for them because I’ve done well with options trading. Our short term capital gains taxes are a bit different and most retail platforms don’t require a broker fee. It’s would be possible to invest 1k and turn it into a sizable return if you do it right. That’s where I’m coming from when I commented but I totally understand your concern. I was surprised too when I saw the amount of upvotes and comments.
2021-04-24 13:30:06,stocks,I think it might be a grey area in the US because how would the government know unless the other person is reporting the income on their taxes. So if they don’t report then yes it’s definitely illegal. Just a bad situation all around.

What I mean by that is that investing should not be thought of as binary - win big or go to zero. It shouldn’t be like gambling. If I only invested money I was prepared to lose - should I have a few grand in equities and the rest of my money in a savings account? Because that’s all I’m prepared to lose. 

I’m okay with fluctuations. I have decades to retirement. I’ve been down 25% in a year and I don’t sweat it because...like I said I have decades...but I have a diversified portfolio - some high-risk plays, lots of blue-chips, ETFs...if I’m ever in a situation where I’m facing losing all of it - that means the world is fucked and paper money probably doesn’t mean anything anymore."

2021-04-24 17:17:05,stocks,"Search topics you're weak on on investopedia.

There are some websites to do “paper trading“ where you can make transactions with fake money and see how you would perform if it was your hard-earned money. That way you can trade with no risk while you learn. 

When you've got a decent base of knowledge and want to start researching stocks, use screeners like [finviz](https://www.finviz.com) to research stocks and their fundamentals. 

Once you learn EBITDA, EPS, P/E  etc.etc., you can use finviz to screen thousands of stocks for whatever criteria you want. I've been investing  for 10-11 years and i ALWAYS use finviz to dig deeper before i buy. 

I'd give you specific books or articles, but i learned finance and stock investing on 30year old books like *the millionaire next door* and *motley fool* (which has turned into clickbait nonsense now).

Just read as much as you can. Stock fundamentals never go obsolete, that info will ALWAYS be relevant.

- When you're first investing, i'd advise sticking with  dividend-yielding stocks. They're generally stronger stocks and the dividend-yield will soften the blow when you choose a poor-performer. 

And i prefer using DRIP. Dividend reinvestment plan. Your brokerage uses the dividends that you earn to buy more of the stocks, but in fractions. So instead of getting $.13 per share every quarter back to you, you get 1/100 of a share (or whatever the dividend equates to in relation to the stock). The benefit of this is obvious when you consider how much faster a stock share can grow in value versus say $.13 just sitting in your account.

- use a cheap brokerage that has low fees on trade commissions. I use e-trade, but there are plenty out there

2021-04-24 10:08:10,stocks,"Im inclined to disagree. Normally when family gives you money to invest, its after seeing your returns during a bull run. They dont want index fund returns, they want those crazy profits you just got. Its impossible to convince them that the risk you took on for that kind of money was enormous, that its a one off and probably wont happen again for a while if ever. They'll try to convince you that they're ok with that kind of risk, even though they have no clue what kind of risk they're actually taking on because they dont understand derivatives. So unless you get really lucky, you're stuck either doing the same thing and them getting mad at you because you lost all their money. Or they get mad at you because their own returns are pitiful (aka normal) and they think that you're hiding your ""secret"". In this case, I would say that the step father is completely to blame, never trust anyone who isn't certified with your money. Odds are you're not related to the next Warren Buffet, and they should have realized that.

2021-04-24 06:50:23,stocks,"You are a nice person but this is not sustainable. They will want more of the gain, and eventually they will send you more and more. $250 is not a lot, but if you are not earning millions it will add up.

Imagine they start sending you more, like $10K, 100K, then are you obligated to give them $2.5K and 25K back in return?

You have to start saying NO and also don’t give them any return, just tell them that you didn’t invest, you did nothing wrong, you already say NO in the first place."

$1k is practically nothing between family and friends. If it is, then what you have isnt family or friends. You have people who you happen to know who are less valuable than $1k to you or vice versa. Dont need to be rich to understand that."

He can’t be arsed to put in the homework himself, so I just told him to dump it all into a whole market ETF and forget about it.  Occasionally if I spot a really good swing setup that I go for, I’ll tell him what I’ve done so he can copy if he wants to.  I’m guilt free on that too because if it goes wrong, I’ve lost too and can just shrug it off."

2021-04-24 07:28:21,stocks,"That's simply the wrong way to do it. It's easy to open a friends and family advisor account (don't need any qualifications), then people (you know, friends and family) can open accounts under you that can you trade in. Or someone can create an account for you that accesses their normal trading account, but you need a power of attorney for this. These would be the *correct* ways to trade someone else's money (in the U.S.). I'm not sure trading someone's money in your own name is even legal, though I assume it's a bit gray because there is no official agreement that you are the custodian of someone's funds."

2021-04-24 13:02:38,stocks,"The money I gave her is supposed to server two purposes: Be an emergency fund she can use if needed during school and to be a way to expose her how the markets/investing works.

The point of insuring it is me intending it to be a confidence boost so that she knows she can take some risk while still learning about stocks and not have one early mistake define her. I've worked to minimize that risk by asking her to invest X% in companies that I gave her a list of with the DD of why. I feel confident in the list I gave her and it'll teach her life long financial lessons which are worth way more than what I gave her initially.

On a more personal note, I have escaped post-secondary poverty. I have had to deal with predatory student loans/sky rocketing education cost like many of my friends, but even when I graduated May 2020 I was able to come out on top and now I'm doing very well for myself. I know a lot of friends who have not been nearly as fortunate, and I'm worried about her future when she graduates. It's more than just stocks/money to me, I want to see her able to manage money, investment streams, and be a very financially literate person. I want her to learn those skills and thrive and not let a single investment mistake turn her off from investing and never learn those skills. That's why I'm insuring it."

2021-04-24 12:52:08,stocks,Another nuance to the statement - only invest what you’re prepared to lose - on any _single_ investment. This is why we diversify because we’re not prepared to lose everything on a single stock.

2021-04-24 07:57:44,stocks,Let's say you have $1K and spend $2K on stock (50% on margin).  Stock drops by 50%.  Now you have $0 when you pay back the $1k margin you owe.

Then it's been going sideways since then and I opened up my business in January after I had a fight with my boss and quit before new years. I really was supposed to open the business with him but I had to do something quick because it was now or never type of situation for me.

He still comes by my office sometimes because his apt his 5 mins away and mentions that he lost 600 now since it went up slightly. I should've told him to buy veqt or something so don't be like me.

He says that he wants to buy stocks and when they go up he wants to sell and buy something else and just keep doing that..."

2021-04-24 09:24:47,stocks,"That is a speculative ETF and should be considered a risky investment. When people talk about ETFs that are buy and forget about it, it's more like SPY, QQQ, USD, XLF, etc."
2021-04-24 09:33:58,stocks,"I didn't say EVERY etf was risk free, I meant put it into the low risk ones not speculative ones.


As in ""put it in an etf THAT has a worst case scenario of losing 2 percent...""

Not ""put it in any etf as THEY ALL have low risk""

There are ETFs out there that perform annually every pretty much year okay, and rarely ever go less than like 2/3 percent down."
2021-04-24 19:14:38,stocks,"Just so you know in the future, stock investments are taxed on gains. 

I.e. (Price you sold stock at $1005) - (Cost to buy stock originally $1000) = gain of $5

Turns out if i ever opened my mouth they would lost tons of money, while i would be up more than ever, what i think today might not be the same as tommorow, i can react properly, adjust my positions, make tons of more investments and forget about the one that is lagging behind, or sometimes i simply have a lot of patience.

Heck sometimes i talk about stocks i never bought myself or have nothing to do with myself. Like i see attractive investments, want to talk about them, but when it comes to doing the DD and putting my own money, very late i can come to conclusions that its definitely not worth the investment at all and never put my money there.

Giving advice itself can be entirely different field. Even if the investor is great, it doesn't mean he is great at giving advice that won't crash and burn completely."
2021-04-24 14:57:33,stocks,Yeah but like come on dude. This guy should have known better than to ride options with somebody else’s money. Like wtf

2021-04-24 15:27:49,stocks,Obviously my family is worth more then $1000 but you seem to be kinda spoiled in a way. Money is money and you having an attitude of “hahaha you consider losing 1000 dollars bad” is kinda making you look like an asshole

I think in this case it is more of the latter, more causal like, “wow you are earning in the market, help me invest my spare cash will you” scenarios.

But I am pretty sure by your method, then it’s alright to invest for someone (friends or family) since it is legal binding and the profit and losses are black and white."

There’s always been talk that this is what happened to Madoff, especially when the conservator was recovering funds.

Also the battery technology isn't rivaled yet.

Biden and his energy infrastructure plan.

People say its overvalued, I kinda agree in this immediate timeline it is.
But if you ever walk back with most the retail stocks in the past 5 years, their value have shot beyond the 100% profit mark.
Who's to say TSLA  won't do that?

But then again what do I know, I got 10k worth of GME in my portfolio haha."
2021-04-24 12:54:34,stocks,Quite the opposite.  Been holding TSLA since 2014.  Plan to hold TSLA past 2024.  I don’t think you understood the point of the original comment.

Options, you’re up 30% within 7 minutes of entering the trade. You answer a phone call and 13 mins later your account is negative and you’re being margin called. 2 days later, you’re homeless and sucking d for Cheetos."
2021-04-24 15:00:17,stocks,"It was, had a blast. Also got a bit depressed lol, making, losing then making that much was a wild ride.. Was up about $15k late August then the correction hit and was down about $3k then hit that $12k lotto which brought me outta the whole. Then I bet big on NIO and lost most of those gains, unfortunately I was a dumbass and my options weren't far out enough, NIO wound up going on a fucking tear just days after my options expired.."
2021-04-24 07:59:41,stocks,Fun
2021-04-24 11:25:44,stocks,"> He says that he wants to buy stocks and when they go up he wants to sell and buy something else and just keep doing that...

Shoot, I wish I'd thought of this."
2021-04-24 09:46:06,stocks,He wants to try to time the market? If it were possible we’d all be rich already.
2021-04-24 09:25:47,stocks,Well he just said ETF. That is an ETF.
2021-04-24 13:55:13,stocks,Sounds like it was peer pressure.
2021-04-24 14:59:00,stocks,Why though? Hes not educated enough to make safe plays then why would you think he isnt vulnerable to peer pressure from family?
2021-04-24 07:16:28,stocks,"Yeah, but I would heavily emphasize your second sentence. *Completely fine if they know what they are doing*"
2021-04-24 08:35:20,stocks,Yea because if someone is going to give you hundreds or thousands of dollars to invest for them they will not spend 10 minutes with you opening their own account.
2021-04-24 07:45:19,stocks,More like an inverse ponzi scheme. Cause the one who started it end up losing lots of $$
2021-04-24 15:56:51,stocks,I’m not “charging” anything. My dad is retired and told me to play the market for him. My sister is a marketing manager at a big tech company in the Bay Area. The money is a drop in the bucket. I think you missed the point of my comment. It’s less that I’m investing for them and more that they want me to learn the market and make mistakes now so that I’ll have more knowledge for the future.
2021-04-24 15:47:45,stocks,"That's his goal.  ""Hahaha you plebs care about $1k, hahaha.  I used to care about that, but I'm rich now, not before where I made 3x poverty, but now I'm rich hahahah"" - this guy probably."

2021-04-24 09:03:28,stocks,Hey just short whatever I buy and we will go even.  Same as a savings account ;)
2021-04-24 16:39:49,stocks,"Yeah, it was gambling money to begin with, he wasn’t worried about payback, I wouldn’t have accepted if it were anything different. I still have the whole 500$ but the investment is down. I added more to it of my own money. Still have faith lol."
2021-04-24 12:14:31,stocks,Don't take someone's money and buy stocks 'for them' inside your account. That is a recipe for disaster.
2021-04-24 07:09:10,stocks,I believe OP is in the UK based on how they noted their currency in pounds (£).
2021-04-24 07:08:32,stocks,Where do you live? Might buy a flight ticket
2021-04-24 07:15:52,stocks,"Of course there's nuances to it but more or less yeah. explanation from my bank's homepage below

>The capital gains tax (KESt) is a withholding tax, currently levied at a rate of 27.5%, on domestic investment income and foreign investment income drawn in Austria. KESt is directly deducted from interest, bond coupons and dividends. With the 2011 Budget Accompanying Act (BBG 2011), the taxation of capital assets was reorganised and, among other things, extended to sales of securities. Since April 2012, profits from sales of capital assets have been subject to KESt (price gains tax). From 1.1.2016 the capital gains tax was increased from 25% to 27.5%."
2021-04-24 07:10:11,stocks,"Used to, now with IBKR I do my own taxes but when I started I traded through my bank, and since I'm an austrian resident I get taxed there. It's not where I trade but where *from*.

While we're at it, there is an option to get taxed through income tax instead of capital gains tax."
2021-04-24 16:04:52,stocks,"It's still also a good idea to not invest for other people. As other commenters have said, it's better for the personal relationship if you give them the sense of ownership and so everyone can handle their own taxes."
2021-04-24 15:34:00,stocks,I would also say don't invest for other people. Give them advice on how to open their own account and what information to look at.
2021-04-24 13:16:51,stocks,It's still a bubble
2021-04-24 12:55:48,stocks,"I guess not, because the two stocks you mentioned have both made money and likely still will continue to do so 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-24 13:00:03,stocks,"Money Claim Online, £25 to file and the other party covers the cost. We’ve never lost one and it requires maybe 30 minutes to do it so it’s worth it."
2021-04-24 09:09:54,stocks,"Can you stop saying this nonsense.

It doesn't matter how the agreement is made, like other have said, some things are harder to proof than others, but they are all perfectly legitimate.

Oral agreements can be easily proven with recordings, but can also be proven  by witnesses, especially when they are independent.

On top of that, if it goes to court, you could be asked to testify under oath, and if it comes out that you lied, you are in deep deep shit."
2021-04-24 07:58:32,stocks,"Oral agreements are just as valid and binding as written agreements. Proving the nature of the agreement is harder though. 

Taking notes and having b witnesses is paramount. 

Any transaction I’d write down in my log:  4/23 John agreed to sell his car for $20, Tim was also present."
2021-04-24 17:09:50,stocks,"Well, written agreements also mean jack shit if you dont have prove of them or am I wrong?"
2021-04-24 14:16:34,stocks,"Should've just gotten hookers and blow instead, blame it on options."
2021-04-24 06:26:19,stocks,OP should count his blessings that he only lost 1000 🦑 to learn that options are dangerous as hell.
2021-04-24 06:07:13,stocks,"Sure, maybe saying ""what was he expecting"" was wording it wrong as he probably expected the returns to keep coming :D What i meant I don't get how could he go from not wanting to handle the money at all to handling it in a most risky way possible. Well the only thing imo that matters is what did he disclose to his family. If he didn't say he was going to put the money into options I'd say it was as shitty of him as it was of them to pressure him."
2021-04-24 11:51:08,stocks,But this is like “no I don’t like jumping....okay I’ll try and jump from this roof to another.” He didn’t want to take the money and then took it only to yolo it all in options. Dude is an idiot and so is the guy who gave him money...match made in heaven.
2021-04-24 08:05:48,stocks,"Well you were quick to dismiss the idea that it could be margin, so I just pointed out a simple example where trading on margin could result in what happened to OP (even though I think in this case it was probably options trading)."
2021-04-24 11:44:22,stocks,"You don’t understand. He only wants to buy stocks that are going up. OP messed up and accidentally sold him a stock going down. The guy specifically requested a stock that would go up.

What’s so hard about this to understand?

(/s, obviously)"
2021-04-24 10:21:02,stocks,"He said 

>an etf with a worst case scenario of maybe losing 2 percent or somethin

Not 

>any ETF"
2021-04-24 10:02:43,stocks,Fair point. Goes to show the need for very specific language when doing this.
2021-04-24 14:52:39,stocks,"If you’re a novice, why risk someone else’s money on options that can drain the account to 0? Do that in your own account. He should’ve been buying blue chips in his moms fiancé’s account instead of YOLOing someone else’s money"
2021-04-24 18:04:55,stocks,"Normally the leaening curve in investing goes from ETF to stocks into options. So he should have been very aware that ETF and Stocks are much safer safe than options. 

Maybe he wanted to Impress him ""look I doubled your money!"""
2021-04-24 08:36:33,stocks,"Oh sorry I'm literally just thick haha. Thought you could open accounts in others names in US, I gotta get me some coffee"
2021-04-24 15:58:31,stocks,If you wanted to learn the market why not trade with a paper account? Zero risk involved there
2021-04-24 16:32:45,stocks,"WTF? I am from Iraq where we had bombs dropped all around us for months on end to make sure we couldnt sleep. They wanted to demoralize the people to stop supporting the government as if any of us supported them to begin with. Only spoiled brats here are you. My dad delivered pizza when we came to the US.

You people seem to have absolutely no perspective. You think money is more important. It isnt. You are running on a hamster wheel. Though the wheel can be fun, I enjoy making money and yes, I am rich now, its not important and never will be. Thats why, even when I had no money, I didnt care. It wasnt important. Perspective."
2021-04-24 13:23:08,stocks,I literally watched a stock go up and down while I was looking at it and looked away. If only I weren't an idiot I'd be able to capitalize on my abilities.
2021-04-24 07:18:31,stocks,Good catch. I think EU does has capital gain tax as well. But I am not sure the exact amount.
2021-04-24 07:14:54,stocks,"Singapore. Is a small country, you can check it out."
2021-04-24 07:57:56,stocks,Oh ok. I was wondering why someone would go to a US forum talking about the US stock exchange and assume someone else is taking about the austrian tax system
2021-04-24 13:22:27,stocks,"Ooooo
I got in at $700 in March. You think I should pull out while the getting can still be got?"
2021-04-24 12:59:43,stocks,I’m not sure you’re reading this thread correctly.  Lol.  Scroll up and try again plz.  Have a nice day.
2021-04-24 13:13:10,stocks,"My limited english is a challenge right now, but i'll try:

Is that the next step after debt collection? Like, A owes B money, B sends a bill, then a warning, then sends it off to a debt collection agency then to you guys who fill out a form online and (if A don't cough up the cash) take A to court over it? (Have to keep it simple since i don't know the fancy words) 

Or is it more common in like a and b went to the pub and agreed to split the bill. A paid, b was to pay bacl half later. Never did. A go finds BREW, 'cus he wants some brew?"
2021-04-24 09:37:59,stocks,"No, he was asked to invest the money and he did that. He followed what was said. They didn’t agree on a 10% return. It is known that in investing a person can lose money. Thereby, he is British. In Europe we don’t sue everyone like the USA"
2021-04-24 10:46:04,stocks,"I have an audio recorder, but I'd have to be pretty paranoid to always leave it running in case I need it for legal proof and/or blackmail."
2021-04-24 10:15:00,stocks,"Oral agreements, without proof, will go nowhere fast in court."
2021-04-24 09:12:22,stocks,"Oral agreements can be much easier to proof. You can record them.

In theory you could also videotape the written agreement, but assuming it wasn't done, you could argue state of mind, forgery etc. Not saying this is common, I wouldn't know, I'm not a lawyer or anything like that, but yeah."
2021-04-24 12:25:36,stocks,So they’re not just as valid if you have to take double the efforts to prove the oral agreement even happened. Tim could just lie lol
2021-04-24 14:19:06,stocks,Think man opts
2021-04-24 11:19:30,stocks,Exactly. To everyone that’s so perplexed at how he lost all $1000...avoid options. Your mind will be blown to shit.
2021-04-24 06:10:48,stocks,"When it works, you’re genius. When it doesn’t, you’re Reddit stupor material. I think he got that beginners false sense of confidence and went back to what worked before, after reluctantly taking the money. 

Not fully understanding the market and risk profiles, hence his original trepidation with the entire thing, came back to bite him. Honest mistake many of us have made. Me included."
2021-04-24 12:21:07,stocks,"Lmfao. Ouch. I think it’s more emotion than intelligence. He was overwhelmed with fear and then was peer pressured into doing it. Then good ole greed and the desire to actually do well with the money popped up. It didn’t work and then he chased the dragon(likely had a failed options trade and then made a couple more subsequent ones to try and make up for it). 

Options are a lot like heroin. When it works, you want more. When it doesn’t, you want more. Either way, it’s addictive. #HeGambled"
2021-04-24 08:17:20,stocks,"I was saying the margin wasn't the reason he lost 100% of dude's money.

Margin would be how he lost 200%

2021-04-24 15:10:48,stocks,just buy the next amazon ... duh
2021-04-24 15:50:43,stocks,That must be the mistake I'm making
2021-04-24 10:22:05,stocks,"Well then his whole comment doesn't make sense, for such an ETF that follows stocks doesn't exist."
2021-04-24 14:55:09,stocks,Is this a joke lol
2021-04-24 18:16:08,stocks,"If there's zero risk, he's not learning how to manage his own risk."
2021-04-24 17:16:43,stocks,"Lol.  Who said it was more important than anything? I think you grossly underestimate what poor means.  Let's start with people who are so poor they don't even -have- that thousand dollars! Omg what stupid people for valuing money. 

Idgaf where your from, I'm from America where kids are shot daily for sitting in classrooms.  We're all demoralized, doesn't redefine what poor means.

2021-04-24 08:42:58,stocks,"UK CGT allowance is 12300 tax free, and then on anything over this it depends on your tax band. If you’re in the 20% tax bracket, you add the gain to your income and on whatever portion of it comes under the next tax threshold, is taxed at 10%. Anything that makes it into the 40% threshold (or if you are a 40% taxpayer already) is taxed at 20%, or 28% if it’s a residential property (but there are all sorts of exclusions here including if it was your main residence)"
2021-04-24 08:47:30,stocks,"Depends on the country, where i live if the capital gain is less than 50k € annually, you pay zero tax."
2021-04-24 07:35:09,stocks,"same here. grateful for the zero tax on capital gains. 

been investing for about 7 years and making some decent gains. wife wanted in on the action and she follows my philosophy of expensing that entire amount and never expecting to see it back again. last year my cousin too wanted me to help her with her investment and it was after many rounds of explaining before i got into doing it for her. as usual, the stock price dropped the moment i bought in but she was chill because i went through with her on the reasons i’m buying into this stock and she wasn’t in a hurry or in need of cash. 

thankfully everyone is in the green right now."

2021-04-24 13:02:18,stocks,"I'm not sure you're commenting on the thread correctly.

When musing about how someone might have lost all their money, you suggested ""must've YOLOd it into those money makers instead of boomer stocks"" - neither of which results in losing all of your money.

Unless you dropped an '/s', this seems ... an error

Since my last comment didn't make the question clear enough, What *did* you mean?"
2021-04-24 13:21:26,stocks,"You’re pretty much correct with the first option. 

It’s more for defined debt where they agreed to a service but haven’t paid the invoice. So you apply online and the court reviews it and sides with one of you. If they still don’t pay you can use that online service to send round bailiffs to remove stuff to cover the debt. 

It would be a bit more difficult with a verbal agreement but you could in theory do it for whatever you want."
2021-04-24 10:34:02,stocks,"I'm not replying specifically to this case, just about oral agreements in general.

I'm from the Netherlands, but that has nothing to do with anything. Oral agreements are just as legitimate as written one."
2021-04-24 12:01:36,stocks,Why would this be the case. You can just record it with someones consent to record the verbal agreement.
2021-04-24 10:46:08,stocks,You’re wrong. Source: am lawyer
2021-04-24 13:11:22,stocks,"The point most people are trying to make is that oral or written arguments are equally valid and binding.

Say, for example, a kid down the block mows my lawn for $20/month.   


I hire the kid for a year to mow my lawn. For the first 11 months I pay the kid $20, but the last month I do not pay the kid.

In either situation it doesn't matter if we had a verbal or written contract. There is a pattern of an agreement that has been made, acted on, and executed. By not paying the kid, I have broken the contract."
2021-04-24 13:31:23,stocks,"I’ve been trading options for a long time...I’ve had my ups and down, but I’ve never risked blowing up my account. The thought of taking somebody else’s money and doing that honestly makes me sick. 

But then he tries to paint it as a “Omg you should never trade other peoples’ money” which (while I very good thing to live by) isn’t the lesson he should be learning. The “don’t take extremely ridiculous risks with other people’s’ money” should be the lesson. I mean damn...if he used these kinds of methods and was a broker he’d be sued.

This is what happens though when people think they are smart because a historic bull run and some memes take them to the promised land."

2021-04-24 18:21:49,stocks,I suppose but honestly if he’s still learning about the market he should probably just use a paper trade account. I get risk is important in learning the market but he should probably start with the fundamentals first
2021-04-24 17:44:12,stocks,"WTF kind of perspective is that. Do i need to post the odds of being shot in school? This just reinforced how much you lack perspective and how spoiled you really are.

As for being poor, guess what chump? Even if you made minimum wage, $1k is still nothing.

Minimum wage makes about $30k without bonuses or OT. So dont BS me, I went through that too. Since its low, you barely get taxed and you get healthcare and other perks for free. Your education is free and you likely get housing assistance. $1k isb arely 2 weeks worth of work. You are so spoiled you dont realize it.

Anyway, do what you want. Good luck."
2021-04-24 08:36:14,stocks,Ahhh I see. Good to know. 👍🏻
2021-04-24 08:47:18,stocks,So the income tax and capital tax are combine till you exceed 40% tax bracket and it is cap at 20 or 28%? Am I understanding correctly?
2021-04-24 08:48:19,stocks,That’s great. This mean the average joe usually won’t be capital taxed.
2021-04-24 07:46:27,stocks,That good to hear. 👍🏻 Cheers to zero tax!!

2021-04-24 13:24:08,stocks,Yeah it’s really great that it opens it up for the “smaller guy” to get what they’re owed without the need for expensive lawyers.
2021-04-24 11:40:49,stocks,"There’s no consideration, so no contract is formed in your example. In the real world, oral contracts happen all the time, and the evidence is the behavior of the parties, their deposition testimony, affidavits, and testimony at trial if there is one.

Sorry, I didn’t see you said “no proof,” but there’s always some evidence—remember, sworn statements and testimony *is* evidence, then it just comes down to a credibility determination and what makes sense, considering the burdens of proof at play."

>• DAUs were 280 million in Q1 2021, an increase of 51 million, or 22%, year-over-year.• DAUs increased sequentially and year-over-year in each of North America, Europe, and Rest of World.• DAUs increased sequentially and year-over-year on both iOS and Android platforms.• For the first time, the majority of our DAUs for the quarter were on the Android version of our application.

The stock is up after the report dropped.

**Outlook**

>Q2 2021 Outlook• Revenue is estimated to be between $820 million and $840 million, compared to $454 million in Q2 2020.• Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between $(20) million and breakeven, compared to $(96) million in Q2 2020.

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive.

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price.

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of growth figures is required to get great returns."

It is probably the biggest beneficiary of Facebook doing everything they can to make their own platforms miserable. That said, I will not invest in it on its current valuation. I think Snap will have a difficult time raising revenue in the long run. It is only so much they can monitor it with advertisements before people get too annoyed."
2021-04-24 11:19:33,stocks,"The Market cap compared to the share price is too high, the revenues are growing annually but earnings are down heavily, for me the costs to get higher revenues are too expensive, I guess they have to think about it!!!!"

2021-04-24 14:55:53,stocks,"Snap needs to increase ARPU domestically and scale internationally. Compared to Twitter, which has less DAU, Twitter has great ARPU and so does FB.

I am a long-term bull on Snap. been in since IPO. Ultimately is my bet on the future of social, which isnt FB or feed based format."
2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"How you find hype stocks(20% increase or more within a shorter time than a year) before they are inflated Hello everyone, 
I started to learn about investing a few years ago.mostly about YouTube. Over the last year I also picked up some books. A mix of Jack Bogle, day trading and a few to value companies on fundamental basis. 
That’s all fine and it makes sense to me , will try to invest as much as I can in safe assets like msci world or sp500 .
Especially the whole gme debacle showed me that I don’t want to trust a random guy on YouTube or Reddit about stocks. I can do my own work now and check it his statements make sense, but I feel like I’m missing something about finding good stocks. 
Maybe there isn’t even a way and it’s all luck, i don’t know so I want to ask here.I’m not talking about gme like stocks here. But anything that’s at a potential to gain more than 9 percent a year. 
How do you find such stocks? Are there people consistent at finding them? 
Are there good books or sources? If I try to look for sources about this all I get are YouTube gurus telling me why I need to buy their book.
I just want some source that has some kind of seriousness to it, if there are any.I’m willing to learn, it does not need to be fast or anything.but I always feel like I’m hearing about it a stock or industry after its already inflated. 
If anyone had this question and found anything that helped him answer it, I’d greatly appreciate it. 
And I know this sub isn’t a gambling sub, but the gambling ones are inflated with people that have much opinion without any knowledge ,also the gambling ones are still flooded with gme. 
Thank you very much for reading :)"
2021-04-24 06:29:00,stocks,"Just go through social media sites like Reddit and look at what tickers are trending. There’s also the BUZZ etf which is an etf that bases its holdings on social sentiment, aka hype. Look at its holdings, and evaluate some of the stocks that catch your eye. Also people are really smart so I wouldn’t be surprised if somebody has created a website that does this for you, just explore"
2021-04-24 07:38:45,stocks,"The goal obviously would be to find these stocks before the end up all over reddit and twitter. My suggestion would be to examine the industries that are getting hype and looking for low market cap stocks with strong financials. Those are the best odds of running into something that pops, but at the very least if it doesn't you still own a good company that hopefully has a bright future."
2021-04-24 11:23:09,stocks,"IMO it's very time consuming. 
One thing is clear: small and mid-cap stocks have a better chance of jumping than big tech or most S&P .

I was able to buy AL/PP + AB/ML both at 0.32 so basically 10X or more .
Same with MA/RA 2.88 10X 
AMY/ZF 0.28 (4X)

It might also involve buying and selling (timing the market) which is not easy. 
I was at 200% profit before GME changed everything and now only 50% since mid-Nov. 

I spend a lot of time on Reddit and Stocktwits.  Stocktwits is very good cuz posters recommend other stocks . I do very little research.  Look at float + volume + ownership mostly 

Someone pointed out that if a smaller company has already grown 100% or much more then they have a better chance to keep growing.

I have several that jumped recently 
PLBY up 70% in 3 weeks + BRLL 55% 3 months + ARBKF 22% one week"

2021-04-24 11:56:42,stocks,"The stocks with the potential to rapidly make large gains are the stocks with the highest risk. In any financial market, the return on an investment is your compensation for taking risk. The more risk you take, the greater the potential return, and at the same time, the greater the chance that you will lose your money.

So in general, looking for the highest potential return is equivalent to looking for the greatest risk. You need to find stocks that a lot of people think will go to zero (GME was one of those companies). If that's your goal, you should look at smaller companies, growth stocks, stocks that are currently pricing in a high risk of bankruptcy, etc. Note that you can also increase your risk and potential return by applying leverage (through options for example) on relatively safe companies. But that's not to say it means the investment is safe, since you are using derivatives to transform it into a risky investment."
2021-04-24 14:52:18,stocks,"Okay, so take this as a grain of salt of advice but I look for companies at 100 million dollar market cap or higher. Don’t immediately invest in them but keep them in your watchlist. In my experience, some of these companies were the ones that blew up to be known to the greater public months later. I made the mistake of not investing in them because I was chasing momentum stocks instead."

2021-04-24 07:59:02,stocks,"At this point flipping and getting 200% is a lot harder then it might sound. Leveraging options and futures can help but they have an added level of risk to consider. Reason I've made 200% on a stock before is because I go into it with a long-term mentality. Otherwise if you're just trying to get 200% in a week it takes a lot of lucky and everything can turn against you really quick. Low market cap stocks is what to look for, but again, very risky and should still be a stock you might be willing to take a loss on or hold and wait for profit."
2021-04-24 09:39:38,stocks,Yes I know.but I don’t want to do it by betting on someone else’s dd.I want to learn the tools to research myself. And I felt a little lost because media is polluted at the moment.that’s why I asked for sources that help.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Amazon's stock price too expensive? I have many conversations with individuals who say that amazon is too expensive for them to invest in. Obviously this is not related to the metrics of the company but rather the fact that they don't want to fork over 3300 for one share. 

I own multiple shares of the company because I believe in what amazon is and will be in the future, but all the discussions I have where people refuse to buy into the company makes me think that it loses many opportunities because of its price. 

It's been stated that Bezos is probably keeping from a stock split because he wants to keep frequent trading by retail investors away, but I believe it might lead to an increase in stock price. 

If the price was lower, say after a split, would you be more inclined to purchase the stock?

Edit: so people's perception on the stock based on this post are a) stock splits are stupid, everyone can do fractional shares b) not everyone can do fractional shares c) yes, it is expensive and therefore stupid to buy d) the stock is great, the price is undervalued and I wish I could buy more."
2021-04-24 01:29:18,stocks,"I'd like to add that fractional shares are a lot like Instagram to boomers. They just don't do it, and even people I know in their early 30's refuse to buy a stock if its price is too expensive, even though they have the option of fractional shares."
2021-04-24 01:42:05,stocks,"I thought this was a totally fair point to make. I started investing a few months ago with 1000$ CAD, and one of the first companies I wanted to look into was TSLA.

Even before I did any DD, I decided against it because just the one share would've taken up 90% of my portfolio at the time, so I decided on AAPL and MSFT instead, among others.

I think it serves the exact purpose Bezos and the company want, to discoursge inexperienced investors/traders from buying their stocks, while investors with more capital have no problem investing because they know the company is worth it"
2021-04-24 01:37:54,stocks,I’d absolutely buy a ton of Amazon if it was lower.
2021-04-24 07:02:45,stocks,"In terms of value, I’d consider AMZN a great buy. The P/E has stayed within its long term range so it hasn’t bubbled like so many other stocks. Furthermore, it’s traded sideways for quite a while and will likely take a big leap in the not-too-distant future.

When the stock hits 4000 or 4500, questions of whether 3300 is expensive will be painful to reflect on.

Furthermore, the company has so much potential to grow. They’re in cloud, they’re in streaming. What’s next - Amazon banking? Amazon mortgages? I see London has an Amazon supermarket now - I personally believe they’ll be the largest company in the world in the next few years.

If you’re more reflecting on the cost per share, that shouldn’t matter with fractionals and is probably all the more reason to buy now. When they do eventually announce a split, you want to already be in."
2021-04-24 00:34:32,stocks,Absolutely
2021-04-24 01:07:37,stocks,Yeah I would buy amazon if they did like a 10-1 split. Hold no shares at the moment because I think there’s way more opportunity for your money instead of parking a bunch of it with one stock
2021-04-24 00:35:22,stocks,Technically it’s not too expensive as anybody can own a piece of Amazon. Most brokerages now offer partial share ownership and you can own as low as $1 of any stock.
2021-04-24 02:14:45,stocks,"Yes, I’d love to hold AMZN (and GOOGL) but I already hold other big tech and the price makes it too difficult to keep sector allocation in check. Fractional shares aren’t available to me."

2021-04-24 08:45:20,stocks,I wouldn't buy more or less. This has no impact on me personally and I really dont see an advantage to making it more or less accessible to folks.

2021-04-24 06:26:11,stocks,"For me it's not about the share price but the market cap and price vs future earnings. AMZN has been putting up record numbers during the last year. And that's awesome. But I think that their ""traditional"" business model won't keep expanding at the rate they are, I think that their sales will increase, but not enough to move their enormous market cap. I also think that this past years performance is already priced into the shares, which is why they've been trading roughly between $3000-3400 since July. 

I think that AWS is going to be the key driver for any future revenue and FCF, and share price, growth.  The problem is the competition is fierce in that sector and there are a number of other companies that AWS has to complete with. They don't have a very good moat like they do with online retail. They tried breaking into the telemedicine industry and bailed on that. If this earnings report coming up shows AWS increasing in terms of revenue, clients, etc then I think the price will start to climb again. If AWS is flat or underwhelming, I think AMZN will continue to trade sideways. If they get into something else, that might also be a catalyst for them as well. 

I think we'll see gains, but not outpacing other growth stocks."
2021-04-24 04:02:55,stocks,huh. a companies stock price alone says nothing about whether or not it’s overvalued
2021-04-24 03:00:14,stocks,"Still wouldn't buy because the valuation is higher on paper compared to the other big stocks.

23bn operating income, grew extremely fast but everyone was in lockdown.

GOOGL is slightly smaller and operating income was 41bn. 

MSFT is slightly larger and is on track to make 60bn+ operating income.

AAPL's larger still and I think it's possible for them to make 100bn operating income this year up from 66bn last year. They did 33bn in the first quarter (iPhone 5G).

FB is half the size and did nearly 33bn in operating income.

If MSFT or AAPL share price was at AMZN levels I would still buy them over AMZN."
2021-04-24 05:06:36,stocks,"for nearly Amazon's entire history, the stock has traded at roughly 25x operating cash flow

i agree that Amazon should do a split. it's currently too hard for smaller investors to buy into the company. Bezos just hates poor folk"
2021-04-24 04:19:18,stocks,"Not splitting stock into ""affordable"" territory can have both negatives and positives. Perhaps they don't want people investing tiny amounts into their stock. Perhaps they don't want volatility and liquidity and people being forced to sell due to life expenses. If you can only invest 20$ what says rent doesn't come early and you have to sell?

There is a high chance that a stock split leads to an immediate rise in price, but what happens afterwards? It might then drop to below split levels if enough people think the spike caused by these new investors is a good chance to sell and then not enough people find enough reason to buy again at even the beginning (pre stock split divided by split ration) price.

Some companies want to always stay below 100$ a share, some never split, just look at Berkshire Hathaway."

Whether you have 1 share or 1000 shares what actually matters is the percentage ownership of the company your share holding represents. Retail trading is not setting Amazon stock price even if it splits 1:10. That’s not how this works.

But honestly that only a 23% increase from their current value, and its very bullish price target. Id say there's an equal chance it falls 23%. The way I like to look at stocks is not their price, but more so the potential percentage changes. Id rather a stock that can jump 60% but only fall 10% rather than AMZN where its kinda 50/50.

Look, if the stock is over $100 or so you probably already missed the boat on it. If everyone already loved it you’re too late, most of the time, to buy enough volume to be worth it.  I look for stocks no one knows or cares about because they’re too stupid to see it’s undervalued, not the stocks getting promoted in the media that are getting taken for a ride.  I will probably never invest in Amazon at this point, just no reason, it’s dominated by institutional investors at this point and if you haven’t sold you probably should (I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice just my opinion), because the only place Amazon stock is going is down."

that's why if you look at the top holders of any given stock, lets say GME, you will see the banks and brokerage firms like Charles Schwab near the top. this isnt just their investment banking arm. they're holding those shares for their retail clients too

if you want to own the shares yourself, you have to have a cash account and request that your broker registers the securities in your name. this isnt usually worth it unless you own millions of dollars worth of shares"

lets take apple for example.

i have 100 shares, i routinely sell covered calls against them every time they expire (collecting the premiums along the way to buy more shares in various things). if apple didn't split last year, my 13k in apple would only be 25 shares, with $52k in apple being required to sell covered calls.

Something I’ve not seen mentioned yet is the prominence of retail traders (particularly those of us newer to picking individual stocks, or with less to put into the markets) using free or very cheap brokers. Trading212 being one example. Some of these brokers (including T212) don’t allow shares to be moved to another broker; and most don’t allow fractional shares to be moved."

Fact is institutional money drives most movement and I don't think institutions care much about SP (again not taking into consideration options).

Not sure if I get what you mean by your first question. Those two things sound like the same thing. Market cap is essentially the total value of all a company's shares of stock. Multiply the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares and you'll get market cap. Divide the market cap by its total number of outstanding shares and you'll get the share price."

My thing isn't about who is doing the investing, but the volume of trades. Lower price certainly means higher volume of shares moving, and higher volume implies higher volatility, from everything I've read. What I'm not sure of is if volume of shares moving or volume of value moving is more impactful on volatility."
2021-04-24 08:12:16,stocks,"Right. From what I've read, yeah there is a general correlation between volume and the chances of volatility but the important thing there is the type of trade orders. Huge volume with no real imbalance in orders won't result in a lot of volatility. In the real world liquidity comes into it as well as options so there a lot of variables.

At the end of the day, I don't see why Amazon would be too fussed about their share price. Do they need to raise capital?"

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Spy options and Wash Sales If someone day tradings or swing trades one specific underlying security, in this case SPY, does selling at a loss then buying back within 30 days at a different strike or expiration count as a “substantially similar investment” and thus cause a wash sale?

This would mean day/swing trading one specific asset is extremely tax inefficient. 

Is this the case?"
2021-04-23 22:24:37,stocks,"Yes, options count.

Selling a share and buying an option in that same security also counts. And vice versa.

The tax implications are not as bad as you think. You need to read the whole rule and understand it. Yes, your loss is disallowed, but the loss is added to the cost basis of the security when you rebuy. 

Ultimately, when you finally sell the security without rebuying  your losses and profits from every transaction that was strung together by the wash sale rule gets netted out. You only pay taxes on your net gain.

The rule becomes a problem when you string together transactions across multiple tax years. You may end up paying on your gains in one year, while all your disallowed losses get carried forward to future year.

Example, Dec 1, you buy one stock at $100. Dec 15, you sell the share for $1 taking a $99 loss. Someone calls you a paper handed bitch, and so you rebuy the share at $1  on Dec 16. 

On Dec 30, you sell the stock for $50. Again, someone calls you a paper handed bitch, and you rebuy Dec 31 for exactly $50.  Jan 2, the new year,  the stock goes back to $1 and you sell and decide that you will stick to giving handies in the alley behind a Wendy's.

In year 1, you pay taxes on $49 gain ($1 to $50). The $99 loss from $100 to $1 is disallowed. 

In year 2, you get to report $148 in losses. The $50 rebuy on Dec 31 has a cost basis of  $149 (equal to $50 purchase price, plus the $99 loss that gets added to the cost basis). When you finally sell the stock at $1, you use the high $149  cost basis, for a total net loss of -$148 in year 2.

Net over the two years, you show $98 in losses ($49 profit year one, $148 loss in year two).  Checking the math, you had $100 at the start, and sold for $1 twice, so a net loss of $98 over the two years looks right."

Key differences being home office deductions and MTM election however you must qualify as a trader in the eyes of the IRS. See this: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429

You probably need to be trading 300+ days a year, multiple trades a day, and the holding period for securities is short. This can be a tough hurdle for some who are casually getting into when used to just being an investor.

You: hmmm let me go ask some morons on the internet"
2021-04-23 20:55:20,stocks,Then there’s your answer.
2021-04-23 22:26:40,stocks,"https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2010/feb/sec475mark-to-marketelection.html

Scroll down and read the **Traders making Sec. 475 election:** section. 


MTM means you get to ignore testing for wash sales, straddles, or constructive sales and everything is treated as ordinary income gains/loss. There is no capital loss limit like there is for an individual. 

Every security holding value is marked up or down to the market value at the end of the year and gains/losses are realized as if there was a constructive sale. So that $10 share you bought that is now worth $100, you owe $90 in short-term cap gain tax at end of December and it is marked up to $100 market value on your books. Your cost basis is now $100 with $0 unrealized gain/loss. 

That link above should explain the concept as well as the pro/cons of it but if you still struggle then it would be good to consult a CPA before you seriously consider trading as a business."
2021-04-23 21:37:14,stocks,"Account that does my taxes < someone with actual experience filing taxes and doing business under that status. 

Not all accountants are tax lawyers or have experience with trading just fyi"
2021-04-23 22:29:15,stocks,"Omg that info slid over my smooth brain like a fried egg on a new Teflon pan. 

It basically means if you have stocks that are losing money at the end of the year you can take the loss without selling the stock?"
2021-04-23 21:39:10,stocks,Yea Ik I was just making a joke
2021-04-23 22:37:10,stocks,"That is correct. However the same also applies to any stocks you have a gain on.

Stock A: Bought for $50, now worth $100 at 12/31.     
Stock B: Bought for $100, now worth $25 at 12/31.    

At end of year, you do not sell either. But due to MTM, there is a ""constructive sale"" meaning you must treat it like a sale even when a sale didn't happen. They both get marked-to-market, adjusted to market value on your business balance sheet.

Stock A: $100  <-- new cost basis  
Stock B: $25  <-- new cost basis     

**Balance sheet asset account:**     
Held-for-trading Securities  $125    

As a result you recognize a gain of $50 and loss of $75, which nets to a operating loss of -$25 for your net income. No tax is owed and you now have a NOL to carryforward and apply to profit in future years. 


As an investor, not being able to control when you realize your gains to have optimal tax treatment can be pretty scary. Not every trader will opt for MTM election. It is also pretty challenging to even meet the status of ""trader"" versus investor in the eyes of the IRS. Usually it is only really high volume trading hedge funds or quant traders that manage to do it given the <30 day holding period and 1-2+ minimum traders per day.

You also of course tally up whatever gain/loss you have from sales earlier in the year and that nets into the gain/loss at 12/31 from the constructive sale when doing MTM adjustment. Everything is taxed at ordinary rate so no long-term capital rate benefit."

If you knew you were going to pull money out of the market at some point in the next 2 years to finance a new home purchase (just an example), you would pull the money out this year instead of next year to get the preferential tax rate. 

If you’re investing for the long term, the tax rate shouldn’t matter as much, because even after the higher tax rate, stock market gains probably still outperform anywhere else you would otherwise move your money to. 

Therefore, investing in the market is still the preferred alternative, it would simply be less profitable due to taxes. 

As with anything, there will be exceptions to this.  For example, if you were on the fence between pulling out $500k of the market to buy a rental property, this might push you to do that sooner than later. 

An increased tax rate could have an opposite impact even: you might decide to leave your investment gains unrealized longer than planned to avoid paying tax.  In which case, more money stays in the market."

I've seen first hand these kind of tax kills a business.  It was estate tax in this case.  The father passed away and left his kids with a business.  The gov wants their cut for the tax.  The kids did not have the fund to pay and had to sell the business.  They made out well after tax but the business is out of that family forever."

2021-04-23 21:03:22,stocks,"10% of a rich man's salary is nothing, 10% of a minimum wage salary is your food budget for the month. That is why it's regressive."
2021-04-23 21:24:59,stocks,"You have no clue what a regressive tax is do you?

Technically they are paying the same amount, that’s the definition of a flat tax, each one pays the same _percentage_.

What you attempting to say is that they pay more _absolute dollars_ which is true, but glosses over the entire definition of a regressive tax.

Since the price of goods is fixed, (i.e. a gallon of milk costs the same for everyone) having fewer empirical dollars materially reduces a person’s ability to buy goods.

Ex: you need to buy $500 / mo of groceries to feed your family.

“A” makes $1000 / mo, “B” makes 10k / mo, “C” makes 100k / mo. Flat tax of 25%

A has $250 left after groceries (25% of total), B has $7,000 left (70% left), and C has $74,500 (74.5%). The tax’s impact for A is massive, B isn’t much, and C is laughable. 

But lets switch it up and say, A pays 0%, B pays 25%, and C pays 40% (progressive taxation). A has $500 left (50%), B has no change at 7k and 70%, and C has 59,500 (59.5% left). A can now afford a bit more in life but by no means are they going to become wealthy on the savings. B is doing just fine with 70% to go to whatever. And C does give up some cash but still has 5 times the annual income of A _per month_ to burn on whatever they want.

The rich ($1MM+ per year) have the _capacity_ to bear the cost of these taxes because the cost of living is an immaterial percentage of their total income. The poor have no capacity to do so without drawing on assistance which inherently increases the cost to run the government and therefore drives a need to raise taxes again."

Taxes should be a flat sales tax only with 0 write offs, and the rest should be voluntary(like stocks) imagine investing in things you actually want and being able to restrict funding if the government is sucking at its job.  Quarterly reports would show where the money is and the flat tax would provide a general fund.  

You want universal healthcare?  Donate and you're signed up.  Like roads? Pay for em.  Like firefighters?  Check that donation box.  Don't like meter maids? Let someone else fund them.

You didn’t actually read it then because they are there. They pay more _absolute dollars_ I said as much... They are paying the same percentage so it’s a matter of perspective of absolute vs percentage.

from the article:  The current housing boom is far more stable than the last one and poses  fewer systemic risks, economists say. A downside: There are [more barriers to entry](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-threatens-to-widen-racial-homeownership-gap-11600614000?mod=article_inline), and it’s more difficult for buyers who aren’t already homeowners to make that first purchase. 

 Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, are maintaining tight standards—buyers are  drawn to the market by historically low interest rates, not by easy  access to credit. Rising home values also mean that even if homeowners  can’t afford their mortgage payments, they can likely sell their homes  for a profit rather than face foreclosure.

I don't really want this to be a rkt vs uwmc pissing match. They are similar but different plays.

My point has been uwmc has a strong case for near term price rise due to the expected earnings and they are under priced, which analysts agree."

37 up votes, but I don't think this is factual at all.. reddit please read 10Ks, 10Qs, 8Ks

I'm a UWMC bull and have been recommending it for months, see below, but your numbers are wrong. 76% of their Q4 business in 2020 was refinance. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc\_seems\_extremely\_undervalued\_to\_me/gn0zzvw/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc_seems_extremely_undervalued_to_me/gn0zzvw/?context=3)

* UWM’s  purchase volume for 4Q2020 increased to $12.1 billion, as compared to  $11.6 billion in 4Q19. For FY20, purchase volume decreased to $42.9 billion, as compared to  $49.8 billion in total purchase volume in FY19, primarily due to a  strategic reduction in the jumbo and government purchase business.
* UWM  originated $42.6 billion in refinance volume during 4Q20, as compared  to $20.3 billion in 4Q19. UWM originated $139.6 billion in refinance volume in FY20 and $57.9 billion  in FY19. **UWM’s 2020 production mix was comprised of 76% refinance and 24% purchase.**
* UWM’s primary focus is originating conventional loans. In 2020, conventional loans represented 84% of total production.

3% margin on all loans (54billion worth for Q4 2020)

>“Closed loan volume” and “Total gain margin” are key operational metrics  that UWM management uses to evaluate the performance of the business. “Closed loan volume” is the aggregate principal of the  residential mortgage loans originated by UWM during a period. “Total  gain margin” represents total loan production income divided by total production.

giving them 1.37b for Q4 profit - which they reported in the 8k [here](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398).

You can see the breakdown of that 54 billion below. 3/4 is refinance.

[https://imgur.com/a/zTu0RpJ](https://imgur.com/a/zTu0RpJ)

Of the purchase loans they do, conventional loans are their leading area and the area they'd like to target and grow in. They are a good company and have a lot of good shit going for them, they originate fastest in the market, they're not giving out shitty loans (their average client has a 758 credit score and a 36% DTI) and the wholesale channel is growing and their chunk of that channel is also growing. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books.

Now they do note that with increasing rates their purchase volume [did go up](https://content.bamsec.com/0001564590-21-014601/gz10gtccfgdk000008.jpg) and that they are and do want to focus on origination of purchase loans, but that doesn't mean that a lot of their growth wasn't [from refinance in the last year](https://content.bamsec.com/0001193125-20-296072/g72619ex99_1p38g1.jpg).

>We  seek to have a balanced loan origination business model, with relatively higher purchase over refinancing mix which we believe has demonstrated the ability to deliver strong, stable and consistent growth  in mortgage loan origination volume and profitability through both high  and low interest rate cycles.  Our model is focused on the origination business, with a specific focus on purchase loans; this area of the  market has grown consistently over the last several years and, we  believe, is more durable with respect to interest rate fluctuations than  the refinance market. Historically, residential purchase mortgage loan  origination volume has experienced less volatility in response to  interest rate movements than the refinancing mortgage loan origination  volume. Consequently, we believe that by focusing on the purchase  business we will be better positioned to deliver consistent growth in  increasing and decreasing rate environments. In rising interest rate  environments, we believe that our demonstrated reputation for excellent  client service and short loan closing times will drive continued  purchase mortgage volume, our broad client base will allow us to  capitalize on lead generation and our cost structure will allow us to be  more competitive on margins.

I've been buying a bunch sub 7.99 but I'm only somewhat bullish and turning more neutral towards them. Their margins are good compared to the competition and they do make a lot of money from origination, but the industry is cyclical, and while I'm thinking the market remains hot for at least 1 more full year, I don't know how far I see it growing beyond that. I'm happy to buy at these prices and have a slow melt upwards, but this isn't something I think reddit has the patience for.

If it doesn’t, Its a stock that can be managed to make 30% over the course of a year. There is no reason for it to be this low, so with its 5.4% yield.

With the nature of this industry I rather go for the lower P/E option that has captured a significant market share of a core industry."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Why Leave Robinhood? I’ve been investing with Robinhood since 2018, but up until the GME craze it was purely passive ETF buys. GME sucked me into the world of individual stocks and, more recently, options. I’m now neck deep in LEAPS and covered calls. After the whole GME debacle went down, I told myself I would leave Robinhood. I opened up a Fidelity account, but dragged my feet on the transfer because 1. I was holding a couple GME shares waiting for another takeoff, and 2. I was really not a fan of the Fidelity mobile app UI. Now that a couple months have passed, there are some key things about Robinhood that make me want to stick with them, and I’m wondering if someone smarter than me can counter these things to convince me to leave. Reasons why I’m wanting to stay with Robinhood over other brokerages:

1.       Commission-free option trades. I recently opened a Tastyworks account to try out (and take advantage of the 100 free shares promo) and am paying $1.14 per option trade. I’m on option trade #33 for April so far (30 of them on Robinhood). That would be $37 of fees for April alone thus far if I completely moved to Tasty. If it matters, I have no plans of expanding my options plays beyond LEAPS/CSPs/CCs.
2.       Free and low-interest margin rates. Yes I pay $5 a month for access to margin, but with the first $1K being interest-free, that $1K used wisely can make up for the monthly fee and more. After the $1K, it’s only 2.5%, way lower than the other brokerages I’ve looked at (Tasty is at 8% for $0-25K).
3.       Robinhood mobile UI is so intuitively easy. Yes I keep reading that “real” investors don’t rely on mobile apps, but I’m on the go at work for most of the trading day and have limited opportunity to access desktop applications. During the periods I can find the time to get onto Tasty, it feels a bit overwhelming with more info than I need (granted I haven’t watched any tutorials yet).
4.       Commission-free crypto. Yes I know it isn’t true crypto, but I don’t have much interest right now in owning true crypto, and I’ve been having some fun lately playing around with the price swings between Doge and Bitcoin.

I’ve read and heard several times that once your account grows beyond the $50K-ish range, you need to graduate to a real brokerage, but honestly I’m finding the benefits are outweighing the risks of staying with Robinhood.

I also hear that we are Robinhood’s products, not customers, and that they don’t truly care about the retail investor. But do any of these brokerages actually care about the retail investor?

Why should I leave Robinhood?

Thanks!"
2021-04-24 06:14:46,stocks,Yiu forgot the fact that you don’t have to buy a full share at Robinhood that’s the only plus if you ask me. Yiu can’t buy half a share of a stock in fidelity. Do I have this right guys ?

Are they really going to have the earnings to justify much more of a valuation, or even that one? It seems there are no mega-cap gambling companies, the revenues and earnings just aren't that high. 

The highest market cap I could find is Las Vegas Sands (LVS) at 62B in 2018. That was on 13.7B in revenue and 2.4B in earnings. Those heights are going to be tough for DraftKings to hit.

do they stand to see any big money from the[ atari hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qnJhmahxxw) that are starting to pop up in places? not sure if they're running them themselves or if they licensed it out (and subsequently how the financial agreements on that look), but at that price, that could be an interesting stock.

even if atari doesn't see a big payout from the hotels directly, it seems possible that it could work wonders for restoring some of their big ip's and making them relevant again.

and on a side note, what brokerage did you actually buy it on? schwab is charging a $50 fee because it's international, while webull and robinhood don't seem to have the stock available for purchase at all.

I also have a tiny amount of TQQQ. In a future crash, I might try to buy a lot more, but right now I’m just holding it so that I have a reason to keep watch of it and see how it does. I’m back to being up on that position, but it definitely was red for bit just because it’s insane volatility. 

Aside from that, I really try to avoid insane risks. Right when the hype was about to get really strong, I hopped into that G stock around $16 or $19, sold half at 60, sold more at $200, the rest a little lower. That was a wild ride, way outside my comfort zone so I’m glad I made a bit of money, but I’m definitely paper handing that one from the side lines.

It's great that you averaged down and you're now at breakeven but that strategy itself is risky. For example, if you bought Cisco in 2000 @ $70 and we're down 30%, averaged down to $50 it still had another 80% to fall and would have taken 20 years for you to claw back to breakeven.

Belief can get you into a stock but your own investing rules and risk tolerance should govern how you allocate funds to it.

This is coming from someone who bought into Nio at under $4 last Spring and sold at $45 in December. It was an amazing run but I just don’t think Nio has a lot more room to run at all.

That being said, one of my first bigger investments (in terms of my portfolio which is still really small) was in Tencent music right as it was about to peak. This was a big lesson for me as I only looked at it from the perspective of growth potential and where it would stack against something like spodify in its own market. Then the whole audit thing hit and it crashed by like 50%. I was panicking and thought about selling it to cut the bleeding (I didn’t sell). 

Now a month later I’m out of the red and in the green even if it’s ever so slightly. I’m glad this happened early in my experience as I didn’t throw in a ton of money. It also gave me perspective on my approach to losses, research, and choices."

Anyways I've got a diverse account(s) and am wondering when you know to trim a position, especially ones that have done well.  I thought the general recommendation was around 5%, but I realize that's just a guide.

Anyways, in particular my AAPL position has now grown to 11% of my portfolio and I don't really want to sell as a long term investor. I know Cramer is always saying to ""take profits"", but I don't know!

So my AAPL is up 45.35% as of today.

Do I just keep letting it ride or put some of it into something else and bring it down to 5% or so?

I feel like just letting it ride.  Am I wrong?  Is there a general consensus on trimming positions?"

I would say to base it on your taxes and how much you can put into retirement funds.

If you dont already have a 401k or IRA or Roth IRA, then cut as much as you need to max a Roth which will be a big advantage later on.

Then its just a matter of how much more tax you want to pay. Long term capital gains have brackets and in theory, you could pay 0% tax if you make no other income. In such a case, definitely take advantage of that by selling enough to have $40k of capital gains or whatever it is now. Cant beat tax free! After that it becomes around 15% or so."

My advice is Enbridge + Exxon

Try not to invest in companies like BP who are investing heavily in renewables- you won't get as much exposure to fossil fuels and renewables are extremely competitive, capital intensive, and low margin, especially as prices per KWh go down for renewables."

I, unfortunately sold all my enbridge in March like a fool. But I kept a small position in exxon and I have bought more recently because I started keeping up with the oil prices more.

Exxon is great value and aren't going to dilute their value by investing their limited capitol in speculative, competitive green energy. I think their carbon capture plan will grow in the next few years/decade. The stock is purely unloved because they realize that gas and oil isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and they're sticking to their guns. And wall street is crazy on green energy right now. 

On that note, I also do like chevron because of their deal with toyota and providing infrastructure and clean hydrogen for batteries. I think that is a step in the right direction.

But for green hydrogen exposure that is safe, I like my APD. I think energy companies should limit exposure to hefty investments in that space rn as it seems a far ways out."

I think oil is going to do well under Biden, he wants it expensive so companies have more incentive to go green. Also carbon capture is going to be come more mainstream. BP, shell, exxon and chevron are great buys. 

Chevron also just made a deal with toyota about creating cleaner hydrogen for their fuel cells and what not. ( paraphrased lazily.)

Which one of Shell’s classes are you holding?  Class B seems more sense to me but wanted to check. 

Also, BP doesn’t withhold international tax on div, right?  I thought UK companies didn’t but wanted to check."
2021-04-23 23:40:52,stocks,100% accurate.
2021-04-24 16:39:17,stocks,"The best class to hold depends on your status as a taxpayer (i.e. where you are tax resident) and perhaps also on your currency for trading at your broker. This is not financial or tax advice, this is just my own understanding. I would guess for many people the RDS B shares on the London stock exchange are a good choice.

For certain companies able to arbitrage tax credits and for Dutch taxpayers I believe the A shares are best.

For most people around the world , B shares traded on the LSE has the least chance of incurring withholding tax since the UK has no dividend withholding tax. Though there might then be foreign exchange costs. If you trade on the LSE (and possibly other exchanges) I think you may have to pay UK stamp duty of 0.5% on the trade. 

For US holders, the B ADRs would seem a good bet. No foreign exchange costs and no extra tax. However for a non-US citizen the US ADRs are a bad choice; even with a W8-BEN the tax rate is 15% probably. Unless you are holding in a recognised pension wrapper such as a UK sipp in which case the W8-BEN will let you receive dividends from US ADRs without 15% withholding tax. You might also need to pay that 0.5% even on the ADRs. I'm not sure. I know you have to pay French dealing tax on Total even if you trade the ADRs. 

Long story short: B shares, in your local currency / nearest exchange. 

I think they trade on some euro exchanges too (Germany?) in euros and that might be handy for EU investors. 

UK companies don't withhold any dividend taxes that I know of. 

However if you hold the ADR version (the US listing) of any European or UK company and if you are holding it outside the USA, there's a US withholding tax depending on W8-BEN and depending on tax treaties between your home country and the USA."

So I started investing in the end of January and I was very tech bullish. I’m a student with 10k invested. Getting around 300/month from a job. January turned out to be a bad time to start in tech - especially the popular speculative stocks. Anyways I made some mistakes but am fine holding everything I own for the long term. I need to start investing into broader sectors. Here’s my portfolio atm :

AAPL : 32%

PLTR : 12.3%

NIO : 10.4%

ARK (F,G,K) : 21%

XPEV : 6%

TSM : 2%

UAL : 3%

AMD : 2%

NGA : 5%

IPOE  : 5%

I need to start putting a small amount each month into something like a VTI though I’m hesitant right now at ATH so looking for a SPY pullback. There are still quite a few stocks I really want to get a hold of (DIS, MSFT, BABA, TSLA) but they also are too expensive right now. 

Should I be focusing on just building up my index fund position? If I do that I won’t have much at all left to buy my highest conviction watchlist stocks. And even less to build positions in other sectors. Is that even necessary?"

Honestly, if you know you should/want to start putting money into VTI or something similar, just start doing it. There's no telling what the near term (or even long term) holds, so best to just be in the market and let it run, especially since you have a very long time horizon."

Also there is a saying when it comes to stocks, ""sell/avoid when everyone is happy and buy when they are unhappy."" Needless to say, right now people are so sugary about tech that its almost vomit inducing."
2021-04-23 23:00:43,stocks,"I'll tell you what I have if it helps. I don't know precisely the % but it's close enough:

TDOC - 5% 
COST - 5% 
WMT - 5%
0-3% each - PLTR, DKNG, SoFi, an OTC battery recycler (don't want to get the post removed), Pro terra and Micro Vast. 

My portfolio typically moves twice that of an all SPY/VTI. If you include low beta blue chips I'm over 50% index funds/safe stocks. 

My highest conviction is Tesla, however I've spent countless hours researching the company over the last three years. I'll say that Tesla is as much an energy and AI/tech company as they are an automotive (robot) manufacturer.  People have strong opinions when it comes to Tesla so you have to figure that out for yourself. Don't just listen to me or others blindly. Or the media for that matter. Would you hold during the March meltdown last year? That's a question to ask yourself. 

If you do increase into Tesla I'd reduce your ARK holdings (other than ARKG/ARKG). I wouldn't expose more than half of your portfolio to highly volatile stocks/funds. That's just me.

What if Tesla were to announce that instead of selling a car for say $50,000 ... it sells it for 1 bitcoin instead (regardless of the $-value of bitcoin). Right now bitcoin is ~$50,000 so its about an even tradeoff.

Now... what if Tesla were to instead sell that $50,000 car for 0.1 bitcoin? Do you think that Tesla's pricing would be powerful enough to shoot the price of bitcoin higher (theoretically up to 10x)? 

If bitcoin goes up, Tesla could make a pretty penny on its stake if it decides to sell.

Would this even be legal lol? Is it totally insane? 

Now that I wrote it out this seems insane and like market manipulation. But funny to think about. I do wonder if Tesla will ever sell its cars in pure bitcoin rather than dollars, and how that would work."

2021-04-24 02:53:26,stocks,"Currently since the production capacity of Tesla is limited, it would be impossible for them to sell enough cars to move the price of BTC enough.

If Tesla was able to produce infinite cars then the price of BTC would rise...basically it would be just like selling every single car on Ebay and letting people bid, instead of setting a fixed price.

So if the car is worth 50k$ the price of 0.1 BTC would probably settle around 30-40k"

2021-04-24 15:49:41,stocks,"That's fair, but look at how high Bitcoin moved immediately after Tesla announced it would accept bitcoin as payment. They didn't even offer a discount, and it pushed the price of bitcoin up and revitalised the rally that was beginning to lose pace. What if they were to say that they would sell Tesla cars for a small, but not insignificant discount to those that bought their cars in bitcoin (For example, $1100 cheaper if bought with bitcoin/2% off value of car). People looking to buy a Tesla would buy some bitcoin, use what's required to buy the car, and then hold the rest. That's a pretty sizable purchase of bitcoin. 

Now Tesla sold half a million cars last year. Assuming nothing changed, and 50% of buyers try to grab a discount, that adds up to about 250,000 bitcoin used in transaction, at the current price. If the price of bitcoin were to drop further, more bitcoin, if not less bitcoin. That's about 13 billion in bitcoin. If bitcoin were to run to 80,000, that 13 billion is now worth about 22 billion, possibly more considering that they bought 1.5 billion in bitcoin well below the current price"

So the company he bought it through is Financial Programs Incorporated and it looks like he purchased 57 shares of Financial Dynamics Fund. I even have his old account number and the name of the guy that helped him.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 23, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

In other news, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report blew past analyst expectations for the second straight, signaling improving conditions in the labor market and corroborating the pick-up in economic activity as the economy reopens. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended April** **17:** 547,000 vs. 610,000 expected and below last week's total of 576,000
* **Continuing claims, week ended April 3:** 3.674 million vs. 3.650 million expected and below last week’s total of 3.708 million 

**Highlights**

* Kathy Entwistle, managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), “we’re going to have our own form of the Roaring Twenties.” [(Full quote here)](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-economy-own-form-roaring-183205436.html)
* According to the[ Department of Commerce](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf), new home sales surged 20.7% in March compared to February, well above the  14.2% expected for the highest monthly surge since 2006.
* The U.S. manufacturing sector's preliminary purchasing managers' index for April rose to 60.6, from 59.1 in March,[ IHS Markit reported Friday.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/u-s-business-output-expands-most-on-record-ihs-markit-says) This marked the highest level since the firm began tracking the metric. 
* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,"" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.
* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles.

&#x200B;

If I buy a company's stock at multiple time points over several years and then decide to sell a portion, am I taxed with the IRS assuming I sold the oldest stock first or is it based off of when I last added that companies stock to my portfolio?

&#x200B;

For example, if I buy 10 shares of a stock each month, and then in 3 years after I started buying I decided to sell 100 of those shares -- does the IRS tax it as short term or long term capital gains?"

The pace of tech is growing to fast for any legacy company to keep up.  The important thing to understand is not whether or not they are doing well compared to others auto makers but compared to the whole economy.  So many people invest w/o understanding that the equity market is basically the tail end of the economic machine.  Even if VW returns 10% yoy on avg over the next 10 years you will still be losing value.  This is simply because the hurdle rate is tied to the M1 if the money supply is expanding at 25% a year then you need a 25% return to keep the  value of your wealth. Ok so maybe in the best case VW keeps up with the M1, as the overall market will, and does 25% a year you would still be adding 0 value to your portfolio but you would protect your wealth as your percentage of the economic pie will not change. Is VW stock better than holding cash?  Absolutely, is it safer than most stocks for sure, so if you want to treat it like a cash asset then no argument here.  But while you will make some money invested in it you may be losing value overall and you could park that capital else where in higher yielding companies.  Why do you think growth stocks have been so hot over the last year?  The big boys understand this concept and need companies that will beat the hurdle rate in order to grow their wealth its that simple."

- revenues increasing
- advantage to Amazon due to superior infrastructure navigation in South America
- fintech in Mercadopago that operates sort of like a credit card in a way. 
- eCommerce is growing in general and Brazil is growing rapidly economy wise.

Here we have a payment method called boleto bancário that people use often and it's not available in the local branch of Amazon, and personally I think the site is pretty shitty, so I don't see Amazon taking over here soon. It seems like they are not even making an effort, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, this is a point for ML.

BUT our economy is in shambles. It will get better after the COVID restrictions are lifted, for sure, but as long as Bolsonaro is in power we are doomed to get worse. It's his third year, first term, and he has a reasonable chance of getting reelected. The highly educated and talented people are moving to better countries. There are no jobs for the young people. Sooo there's that.

At least I could say that I mostly use ML for imported products, and the lack of local options due to the economic crisis kind of helps that. So maybe it's possible to profit from our downfall. Not a experienced investor here, just an average citizen, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

If you are in fact susceptible to endorphine addiction (gaming, gambling, r/WSB) you should actually consider conciously not checking your portfolio every other day. It is an unhealthy habit and it may become worse if you don´t pay attention to it."
2021-04-24 19:39:46,stocks,"Some days I check it obsessively. Other days I'm too busy and forget. Therefore, obsessing just means I don't have anything better to do. ""Unhealthy"" would be if you put it ahead of your work, cancel social events, and neglect other important things.

Further introspection may reveal obsessive behaviour in other areas too. To be more productive, plan your time each day. For me, I would say ""I'm going to read this book in my lunch break"", and that would stop me refreshing stocks or social media obsessively. 

Make a routine time when you'll check your stocks. After market close would be a good time, as there would be no reason to check it again after that, but you could still check daily and know how things are tracking. Reason with yourself ""Am I going to make a trade today? No? Well then it can wait until after market""."

It's worth glancing over when you are buying and selling a stock. Unfortunately for me I move about 10 stocks a week so I end up checking it every day more or less. 

If you are a long term investor then it's best to just track the company and not the stock. If you are a WSB user like me then try and become a momentum trader and not a long term bagholder. 

Sometimes the best decision is to cut losses early and let winners run... Selling and buying back in with TA is on your side (even if this means it being a higher price) has saved me a lot of stress and money."

Eventually, after six months or so and your portfolio is starting to hold its gains rather than dropping into the red everytime there's a downturn (that is, if it's built on good companies with solid fundamentals and not meme stonks), the excitement and fun will wear off and it's just boring watching your tickers trend up and down by pennies by the second.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: I'm not buying this dip. After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX. Also, I had to remove 2 links to some of my figures/research due to this subs policy, so you'll see I just refer to ""an analyst."" Most everything else is cited though.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets (link removed).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, an analyst (link removed) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Does Anyone In This Sub Take Risks? Or is Everyone Just in SPY/Funds/Big Tech? During this major \~10 week long correction for growth stocks, I can't help but notice that the vast majority of people on this sub seem to have changed their investment strategy completely(unless most people are just new and super bearish because they lost money). Any mention of any growth company gets met with negative, pessimistic and unrealistic attitude. Everyone says to stay away from 'reddit stocks' which seems to be the new term for 'meme stocks'.

Ever since everything that happened with Gamestop, it now seems taboo to invest in anything that isn't MSFT or AAPL or SPY. There used to be more discussion surrounding undervalued stocks. Discussion surrounding anything other than value has diminished almost entirely and everyone asking for advice surrounding growth just gets the same mindless response from the zombies that infest this sub. ""No revenue = Shit company,"" ""Don't buy anything you see people talk about on reddit,"" ""Hype for growth stocks is dead"" so on and so forth.

Ignoring the fact that 95% of all growth stocks just dropped anywhere from 30-70% in the last couple months(and some are prime for loading up), why does everyone still seem to think that everything is overvalued? Why does it seem like almost no one is talking about investing with the future in mind. Everyone is only talking about today/short term, and most people seem very bearish about literally any investment. 

I never really think to follow this advice, but in my opinion I haven't seen this fearful of a market in the 3 years I've been investing. I haven't been around for the longest but I do know that most of the pessimism surrounding growth right now is unreasonable and downright stupid. I've been using this opportunity to 'be greedy when others are fearful'. I have allocated a decent amount of my portfolio betting on growth stocks that get all the hype when they're going up, but everyone hates them when they're going down. 

'Last years picks' is a term I hear a lot lately, and I find it funny. Everyone wants a piece of the pie that no one can afford but when everyone can afford it, no one talks about it. It's really interesting to see how many people are willing to jump into a S.P.@.C. or a growth company after it shoots up 300%, and when it corrects people don't make the reasonable conclusion of 'maybe I bought the hype and now I need to ask myself if it's worth holding and if I like this company'. Instead, the overwhelming sentiment becomes 'Man, this company is shit. Why the hell did I buy it? It would be better to sell at a loss, forget about this company and put it all into SPY, the safer play.' I don't know who has noticed, but value is at all time highs and growth is at all time lows. Which has more room to grow, and which seems like the better investment right now? I think it's obvious.

When most sectors are down on no news, it clearly has nothing to do with the company. EVs, Gene stocks, growth stocks, S.P.@.Cs, etc etc are all down rn. That doesn't mean the companies are all garbage and going bankrupt like most people are saying. If one stock drops 30% because of bad news, understandable, but that's not the current situation."

\---------------------------------------------------

**PART I - DILUTION, DEBT, DOUBT**

\---------------------------------------------------

On its surface, KemPharm looks particularly depressing. A casual glance at the KMPH chart will show you their stock price seems to know only one direction. Down.

A deeper dive into their financial history doesn’t improve their outlook either. Dilution, debt, and doubt. The triple-Ds of woe that spell out doom for any company that dares to enter the biotech arena. Their earnings are dismal and their quarterly reports are depressing. Dreary forecasts and dreadful prospects detail a dismal decline of depleted reserves and desperate delusion.

In a word… dangerous.

So why would anyone invest in this company? Better yet, why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open? Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion...

But on March 3, 2021… everything changed.

[**Meet Azstarys**](https://azstarys.com)

Azstarys is KemPharm’s latest FDA-approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD. A once daily pill of **serdexmethylphenidate** and **dexmethylphenidate**. This is undoubtably decent news but, despite the medication showing promising potential, this alone wasn’t enough to convince me to make my investment.

The first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared, like most things about this company, in the smallest of details. If you have ADHD as I do, you may have noticed that you’ve never heard of **SER**dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate, the more active isomer of methylphenidate, is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the **SER** is a new development.

Looking deeper into Azstarys, I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a **prodrug**.

And the only other ADHD med with that designation is **Vyvanse**.

I was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR. But I wasn’t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper.

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

...until I found a thread...

A thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006. A year where a man by the name of Dr. Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery.

>“Prior to founding KemPharm, Dr. Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse®, a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated $17 billion plus ADHD market. The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD, pain and thyroid dysfunctions, which Dr. Mickle was responsible for creating, led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $2.6 billion.”

Source: [https://kempharm.com/team/](https://kempharm.com/team/)

In 2006, after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals, the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs. Shortly after his departure, New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of $2.6 billion. I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around $2 billion dollars in revenue every single year.

Subsequently, Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of $62 billion but this information will come into play a little later.

**So this begs the question; how did Vyvanse, a single ADHD medication, create such eye-watering returns on an, at the time, equally eye-watering $2.6 billion dollar investment?**

The answer, once again, is hidden in the itty bitty details. Vyvanse is a **prodrug** of dextroamphetamine known as **LIS**dexamfetamine. And here is where the pattern finally begins to align (after 800 words of backstory, damn).

Basically, a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule, a ligand in Azstarys’s case, that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body's metabolic processes.

In summary, **it only work if you eat it.**

This has quite a few benefits. Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action. This ""gating"" effect even has the potential to reduce side effects. **Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication.**

But the more important distinction is that **you can patent it**.

Shire already had experience with ADHD medications. They’re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off-patent. This would expose Shire to the profit-decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse, being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine, for its brand new patent. Considering Shire’s experienced sales team and established connections, converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor’s and pharmacies of Vyvanse’s improved qualities.

**SO WHAT?!**

“So what?” I hear you ask. Apples and oranges. That’s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys? I promise you, all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential.

\------------------------------------------------------------

**PART II - CONTRACTS, CORIUM, CAPITAL**

\------------------------------------------------------------

Azstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc.

[**Meet Corium**](https://corium.com)

The sales contract between the companies offers up to $590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from \~9% to \~25%. This contract was recently renegotiated from $468M to $590M with a new higher top-level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for $28M less on the upfront. All in all, a decent agreement. Not earth-shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future.

**But this still isn’t enough to warrant an investment.**

Guarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell. Sure, Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can’t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn’t have the sales experience of Shire.

**…but what if they did?**

>“We all know that having the product is key, but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster. More than a decade ago, Vyvanse was picked up by Shire. Shire had an ‘ace team,’ led by **Perry Sternberg,** that did a superb job in commercialization.”



The current CEO of Corium is **Perry Sternberg**. The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire. That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium’s website and look at their “Leadership” page: [https://corium.com/leadership.html](https://corium.com/leadership.html)

Tell me if you can spot the pattern:

Robyn Lynch, Head of Corporate Strategy - **Former Chief of Staff for U.S. Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire.**

John Miller, CFO - **Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire.**

John Neeley, Head of Market Access - **Former Head of Market Access at Shire.**

Jamie Spaeth, Head of HR - **Former Head of HR at Shire.**

When I saw this I couldn't help but ask myself, ""Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium?""

The answer… **Gurnet Point Capital.**

>Travis Mickle, CEO: ""Why are we co-hosting this event today with our partner Corium? We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019. Corium is a GPC portfolio company, and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm. \[…\] We're excited about this, because through our license process, to look for the right partner, certainly, at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense. Certainly, Takeda had their own agendas, and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they've had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415. Certainly, this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this, and it's a very exciting opportunity.”

Ok... **so** **who is Gurnet Point Capital?**

[**Meet Gurnet Point Capital**](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com)

Gurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a healthcare fund founded by **Ernesto Bertarelli**, former CEO of Serono.

>“The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.  
>  
>Consistent with the amount of capital, time and energy that it dedicates, Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be, over time, the majority – or at least principal - investor in each of its companies.”

Source: [https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about)

In late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of $500 million. The former CEO, Peter Staple, was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019. But it wasn’t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride. GPC made a point to acquire his entire team. **Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success.** So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire?

The answer… **Azstarys.**

Obviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I’ve detailed so far:

1. KemPharm looks ugly.
2. KemPharm’s drug Azstarys approved on March 3, 2021.
3. Azstarys is a prodrug.
4. The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse.
5. Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle.
6. Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm.
7. Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium.
8. Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse.
9. Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital.
10. Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli.

The thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open. You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions. But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part.

\------------------------------------------------------

**PART III - MARKETS, MONEY, MATH**

\------------------------------------------------------

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS —**

What follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm. I want to be very clear that **this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company. As always, do your own research.**

With that warning out of the way, let's talk about **the stock.**

During KemPharm’s latest Earnings Call on March 11, 2021, Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months:

1. Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8, 2021.
2. No debt as of FEB 8, 2021.
3. $77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10, 2021
4. 28.3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10, 2021
5. 38.6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10, 2021

Source: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020)

All of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH. But taking these new developments into account, a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm’s future.

The current stock price as of the very moment I’m writing this is $8.70.

Assuming a full dilution of all 38.6M shares that gives a market cap of \~$340M. Accounting for Cash on Hand, that means that \~$260M of this company’s worth is attributed to Azstarys, Apadaz, their pipeline, their technology, and Dr. Mickle’s brain in a jar.

NOTE: This doesn't account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional \~$80M and bring their CoH to \~$150M. This will be clarified in the next ER.

Taking all of this into consideration, I asked myself 2 questions:

1. What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm’s operations for the foreseeable future?
2. Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products?

To answer the first question, I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole. The \~$18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes:

1. Amphetamines
2. Methylphenidates
3. Non-stimulants

The current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping **13%** of the TOTAL market and **18%** of the stimulant category (class 1 & 2). Competitors like Focalin XR & Concerta comprise about **1%** each.

So we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach. My question is, what is the bare minimum performance required to simply **NOT GO BANKRUPT**.

According to KemPharm they have a projected **Annual** **Cash Burn of \~$4M** [**(source)**](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)

Considering this and assuming a low-ball **10% royalty rate** (\~8-25% potential) with only **5% of the potential $550M** in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period, how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a **worst case scenario?**

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH —**

(operating expenses) = (total annual market)(required market share)(royalty rate) + ((milestone payments)(percent received))/(10 year period)

x = required market share

($4,000,000) = ($18,000,000,000)(x)(0.1) + (($550,000,000)(0.05))/(10)

4,000,000 = 1,800,000,000x + 2,750,000

1,250,000 = 1,800,000,000x

x = 0.00069 = **0.069% required market share**

This obviously relies on guesswork and doesn’t account for things like CAGR, taxes, manufacturing costs, or inflation, so let’s make it even harder for KemPharm and **double the required market share.**

So in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt, assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time, Azstarys needs just **0.14%** of the market or **$25.2M** in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of $4M. Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild, speculative assumptions. Helps to keep things in perspective.

So that's the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes. Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around **1%**  you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm's stock price even with a below-average P/E ratio. And given their partner Corium's experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there's very little reason to believe that this goal couldn't be achieved.

**Furthermore,** **I believe that Azstarys will exceed it.**

\------------------------------------------------

**PART IV - ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS**

\------------------------------------------------

**It is my personal belief** that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs.

**I believe** that KemPharm's partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys's success.

**I believe** that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD, myself included.

**I believe that KemPharm is** **extremely undervalued**.

To view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information. It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential.

The arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn’t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys **has** **no therapeutic equivalents** [**(source)**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process) and is patented until 2037.

An additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up [**(https://www.azstarys.com)**](https://www.azstarys.com) instead of just 6-17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market.

The FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has **reduced impedance of childhood growth and development** [**(Section 6.1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf). This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD.

Critics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it’s potential duration **(the often referenced 30/13)** and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal. To me, this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective. Yes, certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied.

Furthermore this language's effect on actual sales is largely overestimated. All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is, in fact, a prodrug. And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the **smooth downward efficacy ramp** as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate. [**(Section 12.3 Figure 1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf)

To put it plainly, other extended release products are equivalent to a **caffeine crash**. I know this because I experience it every single day.

The more interesting takeaway is that this medication’s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products, **but from Vyvanse itself.**

The primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset [**(Up to 1.5 Hours)**](https://www.psycom.net/vyvanse-lisdexamfetamine) but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset. **This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won’t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse.**

And while I don’t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse, it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play. **Corium’s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed. Who better to have on your product's side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business.**

And as a final anecdote, I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication. Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales. But because I've tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible. **And Azstarys just seems better.**

So that just leaves one last question: can KemPharm continue to innovate?

The answer… **Travis Mickle.**

While there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person, I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster. I’ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself:

>“It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg. Dr. Mickle has stated that ‘given sufficient funds, he doesn’t have enough life left, to develop all of the possibilities.’ This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses."
2021-04-24 18:51:19,stocks,"I am not convinced for the following reasons.

Kempharm's stock is not moving despite an FDA approval, which signals to me that this drug is either not that great or has no chance to carve out an equitable market share. If it was really great, someone should have bought it by now. Anyways, when you look deeper you notice both that the drug might not be that special nor able to gain much market.

Azstarys' primary clinical trial provides no evidence that it is more safe or effective than the current standard of therapy. You need to show that you are either safer or more effective than the current standard of care to convince healthcare providers to switch. They aren't going to capture share form Vyvanse, the dominant, block-buster drug owned by pharmaceutical juggernaut Takeda. Not with this clinical trial result, and certainly not with their smaller marketing muscle.

More importantly,  the ADHD market contain some big players, such as Janssen, Takeda, and Novartis. How is Kempharm going to acquire GPO and wholesale distribution contracts to distribute their drug? They aren't big enough to play in this space, they need a big player to purchase their drug from them, and no one seems to be doing that right now. However, should someone show interest and suddenly go into talks about acquiring the drug then the calculus changes. If a big player started to show interest, then everything you mentioned above could play out and the investment could be attractive."

I had no issue when selling a covered call in this exact same fashion for this exact same stock back in march (for a 4/16 exp call). Does it have anything to do with that previous covered call I sold, even though it expired a week ago? Also, if it is relevant, I have level 1 options trading on Fidelity (same as a month ago when I sold my other covered call). 

Please help!"

2021-04-24 10:42:10,stocks,"I think perhaps you should do more research on options, they can be extremely risky.  I am not familiar with Fidelity. However, I assume your option is in the money and you want to close your position. Not exercise an option to buy. So you need to just close the position.  and reap the windfall. Just right click on the stock and several things should pop up and hit close position. This will close out your position, and any gain or loss will be realized."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Will Shroom stocks be the next ""Weed Boom""? (Mind Medicine Approved to be listed on Nasdaq, Peter Theil backed ATAI to IPO a soon as well). Could Shrooms be the next hot industry?

Mental health awareness is finally getting more recognition after Covid. Shrooms can be treated to treat disorders like anxiety and depression.

Mind Medicine (backed by Shark Tank's Kevin O Leery) just got approved to be listed on the Nasdaq next week.

Peter Theil's backed ATAI will IPO soon as well.

Is this industry boom just getting started or has it already boomed?

What are your thoughts?

I know there are plenty of pharma stocks if you want to invest in mental health. But Shrooms kinda has that ""oompf"" in a market where people chase momentum and crave stocks that are ""sexy"" (kinda like the weed stocks) and/or with meme potential. 

Disclosure:

I am long Mind Medicine and Numi Wellness and could see this go either way"

2021-04-24 19:41:30,stocks,"Magic mushrooms are literally worth pennies. They're free in states where they naturally grow. Once you have them you potentially have an endless supply. Don't have access to nature? Well the spores are legal in 48 states. They colonize fast (less than a month) and harvest even faster (a week), and grows provide multiple harvests. They need no equipment investment to grow and don't take utilities or large amounts of water and nutrients like cannabis.

Cannabis on the other hand needs much more to make. You need expensive lights, more space, temperature control measures, possible odor control measures, take months to grow, only get one harvest per grow, take electricity which can rack up utility bills, seeds which are much more expensive than spores, and the process of curing adds onto the turnover time even more. It's why people still buy it instead of just making it themselves.

The value of cannabis is substantially more than shrooms. The market is also much larger. Cannabis is a social drug, you can use in social settings. Shrooms are not. You aren't going to take them and go to work, or the store like you would cannabis (if you're intelligent). Cannabis is more difficult to make and takes much longer and costs much more. Shrooms are simple, fast and all but free."

Since anyone half smart under the age of 35 knows the war on drugs was a joke, and tend to also have a more stable and logical outlook on drugs in general.

A much better recreationally used drug with (other) medical benefits is ketamine. Anti-depressants (ssri's in particular) only change 5% of your brain chemistry, whereas ketamine can change 50%.

If it can help people thats great but mushrooms like weed are easy to grow. I also think we should be able to sell weed and mushrooms without much regulation like we do any other herb fruit and vegetable. I get not anyone wants to grow but there is no reason to make it so restrictive. 

Thats part of my fundamental analysis. I think we could see a pump and dump like any other hype trend. My real problem with investing in companies like this is revenue. Im not parking my money in a company that doesnt make a lot of money. 

You may have your reasons for doing so but going back to my first paragraph, i dont see a thriving market. 
The best case scenario is psychedilic assisted therapy and i believe that the whole mushroom is best. I wont discount the science if they prove it can be better.

Before anyone talks about getting sick, first realize that you dont need to stuff shrooms in your mouth like a savage. Just brew some tea."

Years ago (mind you I smoked pot, and tripped balls on shrooms in a household of very strict religious Hispanic rule followers as a way to cope with teenage angst) I mentioned a Wired article(most likely) on the benefits on marijuana on depression and shrooms benefits. 

She initially thought I was high, or joking. 

Last year 2020, in NJ as it became possible that this might be a legit treatment her doctor suggested she might be able to be treated using medicinal marijuana. 

Just as a side note I also mentioned to her that probable use of combining adderal as a supplement to anti anxiety medicines as they have similar affects to increase dopamine and avoid the effects of sluggishness caused by Xanax or the likes. I assumed the more tired a person was because of anti anxiety meds, the more their schedules would be off, the less productive, and therefore the less useful a person might feel. 

Not a doctor."

In my neck of the woods you can literally go outside some months of the year and in an afternoon pick an entire years' supply of shrooms.

Two possibilities:

1. Psychedelic medicine has the margin of food products (i.e. negligible), not pharmaceuticals, because shrooms are so easy to grow
2. These companies lobby Congress to throw your grandma in jail for doing the same shit they do and corner the market. This requires that enforcement of laws against the usage of psychedelics be stepped up. That means more stormtroopers in your neighborhood, btw.

You are betting on number 2. This being America, the Land of the Free (Terms and Conditions apply), and at least one of these companies being bankrolled by that faceless vulture Thiel, you have a decent chance of being correct on 2. But if you've *actually* done shrooms or ayahuasca, you should agree this is a terrible consequence for society as a whole. Oh, and 2 isn't even guaranteed, even if you're only looking at things from the perspective of your portfolio's bottom line."

Mediation being an amazing and *free* practice is something not everyone does regularly. That being said, mediation doesn’t have a lot of potential for $$ behind it. 
Something as organic and available as shrooms -as you mentioned- yes, many are able to collect their own during season. However, I look at these psychedelics as Physiotherapy for example. We are all able to stretch and practice positive body movements at home on our own, but having a guided professional session is a thing and also $$. 
One example, many have struggled with severe crippling depression and that is something tricky to understand if never personally experienced; no matter how many different kinds of pharmaceutical, antidepressants used to find relief. The possibility of some people being helped with such a treatment is amazing and very organic, even beautiful! Similar to a hypothesis session. Ha. That too, has had its moments of success. 
Will Psychedelics trump the pharmaceutical industry? Probably not, but there is a beautiful possibility here to offer another option for many. I believe that is magic of the bigger picture.

My dad is weird. Obviously, he’s older and can’t afford the risk that I take, but since he’s a government employee, he has access to a lot of streamlined funds to invest in for retirement. The fund that he usually buys is tied to the DJIA, but recently he said to me that he pulled out before election season and hasn’t bought back in. I was surprised he said that because, well, he’s investing into the DJIA fund. It’s what I believe to be ‘guaranteed money’ considering the power and influence the US government exerts on the market. He says he’s been waiting for it to fall hard, and at this point he’s just losing money. Now, instead of convincing him to buy back in considering yesterday’s dip and the guaranteed growth of the DJIA, I decided to get into an ETF tied to the DJIA, because why not. I have $4,000 sitting around and I should put it somewhere. 

So I took the $400 I had already in my brokerage account and will buy one $DIA ETF today, and once the other $4,000 gets here, I’ll show my dad how it’s done. I told him I’m confident that I’ll make $25 per share by the end of this year, and needless to say he was extremely doubtful. I’m ready to beat him at his own game.

I’m sure some of you are cringing because I ‘don’t know what I’m talking about’ and you’re probably right, but I have money and having it sit in a bank does me no good, so getting into ETF’s is probably good for me."

**But here's the twist** you can't bring up meme stocks that have been hotly discussed in the past several weeks.  Those stocks that everyone has been talking about, you can't bring up here or they'll be autoremoved.  Why?  It's to keep this thread pure & focused.

The current [list of meme stocks can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/meme-stocks)  So don't mention these stocks in this post or your comment will be removed.

2021-04-24 10:26:00,stocks,"MY bad for the delay here.  I bought into CP (which is an expensive stock ATM) and CSX.  Both are performing very well over the course of the last 2-3 weeks. 

A great way to see the market is just by looking at railroad stocks, if they are up the market is up.  It's an old adage but it reads true."
2021-04-24 19:42:27,stocks,Oh yes I have been looking at those 2 tickers and KSU but since they are getting bought out I think that's not a good idea
2021-04-23 22:32:26,stocks,"\# of shares outstanding is a biggie for me.  I like to invest a lot microcap with upsides.  When they have billions of shares outstanding, that's a big red flag...Big limit to upside."
2021-04-24 11:04:03,stocks,"Politics, futures, commodity markets. There positioning in the market. etc etc, what normies think of stuff. So and so forth. Actually myself use the product."
2021-04-24 04:46:10,stocks,"So I interviewed at Bed, Bath & Beyond's headquarters around a year ago as the pandemic was taking off, and they are far behind their competitors when it comes to eCommerce sales. One of the things I was tasked with for the interview was to point out what you would change on the site and suggest improvements. I'm not a web designer or developer by any stretch of the imagination, and I had pages of suggestions. I like the company, but pretty much everything in the store can be found online and for cheaper. My guess is that they possibly don't want to rock the boat with vendors, and don't push very hard when it comes to negotiating cost. I'd watch their post-pandemic recovery very carefully, and see if they close any stores before I invest."
2021-04-23 21:32:06,stocks,Thanks for the good resource. Is there a possibility that the price didn't go the direction where the internal staff goes?
2021-04-24 02:35:58,stocks,Thank you. This site is amazing!!
2021-04-24 03:03:48,stocks,Question is there something similar for european markets?
2021-04-23 21:40:54,stocks,"I'm sure it happens all the time. 

Its information not magic."
2021-04-23 21:42:57,stocks,Was trying to find concrete case studies... and it's interesting to know :)
2021-04-24 05:17:23,stocks,"there was a thread like a few months back but it's probably outdated. Some brands will definitely restock in the following few months, but I'm pretty sure (sadly) Nvidia GPUs are not part of them :("
2021-04-23 21:03:16,stocks,"Agreed

Corsair owns a ton of popular brands and has an endless array of console and pc products with a fraction of the market cap that Logitech does. If Corsair moves into software or office products like webcams, the stock will most likely make a big upward move."
2021-04-23 21:27:42,stocks,"Spent almost all of my dry powder on yesterday’s dip. It paid off today. 

Time to reload the cash reserve."
2021-04-23 22:03:36,stocks,"I'm trying to tread lightly right now, so I have 30% cash, 30% stocks, 40% bonds. This is due to current market conditions and a lack of experience on my part."
2021-04-23 22:30:08,stocks,3.50%
2021-04-24 00:06:29,stocks,"I try to have one unit on the sideline.  So if you buy $1000 worth of stock at a time, you’d have $1000 on the side."
2021-04-24 00:37:00,stocks,10-20%
2021-04-24 02:20:00,stocks,"70 percent cash currently... I've been a bull for some time now but I can see market tops potentially forming on some of the major indexes. 

If I was a long term investor I would hold but I trade more stocks then a monkey on crack and if they market was bearish for some time my returns would be severely negative... I'm happy to buy some gold and hang out for a year or two. I've had a miracle run I would hate to get greedy and lose it all..."
2021-04-24 07:27:05,stocks,Including coupons?
2021-04-24 12:16:00,stocks,20% weekday 30% weekend
2021-04-24 13:52:00,stocks,About 20 bucks.  I add cash from checking/savings when I want to buy a dip.
2021-04-23 20:10:46,stocks,"I was up in PINS by 140% or someshit.

There was a pull back and it went from 70+ dollars to just under 70. 

During the pull back, my favorite stock ADM pulled back too by 3-4%. So I sold PINS and load up more in ADM and got nice dividends and it went up 4-5%. 

My ""cash on the side"" is just my stocks. 

I hate cash because it's just sitting there doing shit. You mind as well shove it in a dividend stock or dividend funds. They'll go sideway while paying you rent."
2021-04-24 08:32:55,stocks,"Mr. Money bags  stop you're bragging

I have £0 .27p"
2021-04-23 20:00:05,stocks,"Alternative viewpoint. You can only acquire shares by buying them from other people with cash. You exchange cash for the shares. 

Cash starts on the sidelines in your pocket and ends in the sidelines in the seller's pocket. Cash does not leave the sidelines, it just moves from one person's part of the sidelines to another's. Reflect on this."
2021-04-23 20:01:50,stocks,don't look at margin sexily. believe me you don't want to be getting margin calling you all times of the day and night asking you for more
2021-04-24 07:48:15,stocks,"tbh when people say there is “cash on the sidelines” they are usually referring to bonds & other similar investments

bond inflows over the last decade have greatly outpaced equity inflows"
2021-04-24 13:12:16,stocks,"This is assuming that people don't reinvest the cash from shares they sell. When people are feeling very bullish about the markets, they don't leave cash in their accounts. They invest it."
2021-04-23 21:11:37,stocks,">Now if you could price in stress, anxiety and physical toll in the body, bonds would always be the only choice haha

Maybe I'm just a grizzled vet, having invested through 2008. Or it could be that I honestly, truly believe in my investment philosophy, where I buy cash producing companies, and I have faith that in the long run, the value that those cash flows bring will eventually be returned to me. But I don't really stress about investing, even in 2020 I stayed pretty cool. 

>What would you say is the best play to make when you do see a need to buy something but are out of liquid funds?

So when I run out of ideas, I typically throw money into a market index fund. Over the past few years, I've held about 20-30% in just the sp500. When I have new ideas, I'll fund it with incoming funds or pull from those market ETF's."
2021-04-24 01:03:51,stocks,Where are you getting 3.3.% APY on a checking account?
2021-04-23 23:29:11,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-24 10:58:58,stocks,That’s for the weak
2021-04-24 11:43:12,stocks,"Are bonds somehow immune to this? I think not.

Cash starts on the sidelines in your pocket and ends in the sidelines in the seller's pocket.

Once again, it's zero sum. Cash moves from your part of the sidelines to the ex-bondholders sidelines."
2021-04-24 16:35:18,stocks,"And when they invest it, they buy; which means someone sells; that person receives money and ...."
2021-04-23 20:02:35,stocks,brave considering the burn rate of stockdemort
2021-04-24 06:40:51,stocks,"OP explained a double buffer concept, which is emergency savings, and more emergency savings in cash at their brokerage account. It seems like an ok strategy, since they admitted emotional investing („dip is large enough to tempt me into it“). So hopefully for OP their strategy works out right.

Nonetheless you are perfectly right, there is serious self-contradiction in the posting."

not the same for the Federal Reserve, investment banks & primary dealers

it's not zero sum"
2021-04-24 11:15:38,stocks,MWK is the best stock you can find in the market rn.
2021-04-23 22:19:10,stocks,MAXN is going to really run. Been averaging down and now it looks clear to reverse
2021-04-24 04:36:42,stocks,"SKLZ. mobile gaming is growing rapidly and will take over console gaming in 5 or so years I think (mobile phones are becoming more powerful each year, and everyone has one. Consoles are bulky, expensive and not as easily playable - cant bring a console on the morning commute)."
2021-04-24 08:50:42,stocks,"RKT. Their P/E, Forward P/E, revenue, growth, etc. all scream undervalued."
2021-04-24 16:18:36,stocks,Almost all Chinese stocks I own.
2021-04-23 23:52:05,stocks,Who knows when it’ll get that high again.  I this this week will be interesting for us ARK bag holders though.  Tesla reports Monday. Kind of scared if it’ll be the usual reaction where a company reports blow out earnings and the stock tanks anyway.
2021-04-24 11:01:37,stocks,"I think once earnings are reported for all of these high growth stocks, we should shoot up back to all time highs again. That’s what my thinking is however we need earnings to be blowouts"
2021-04-24 01:28:25,stocks,19 % here
2021-04-24 14:55:47,stocks,Just 12-13%?  Consider yourself lucky.
2021-04-24 06:38:47,stocks,"I think coinbase was a great move but possibly to early, but what do I know. If you followed the last 8 months on crypto it has developed a ton. I don't mean price wise, who cares, that jumps all the time, but if you look back what Bitcoin wanted to be its right now viewed more serious than ever before and could actually reach a state of almost equivalent value in an everyday life like regular money has. 
As usual with ARK its a pure growth play."
2021-04-23 23:41:27,stocks,Cathie pls
2021-04-24 10:58:49,stocks,"I thought about doing the exact same thing, thinking this would be a way to a quick double."
2021-04-24 15:00:22,stocks,"yeah, I'm starting to feel that way."
2021-04-24 02:53:51,stocks,"PS ratio is better to look at, especially in growth stocks"
2021-04-24 10:53:56,stocks,The explanation you are wanting is extremely complex. Like a whole book about options complex. Perhaps you should start there. Trading options is like playing on nightmare mode.
2021-04-24 01:59:01,stocks,"This is important.  OP, you also don't mention how much value difference you are talking about.  Some change in value can be explained purely by volatility of prices due to lack of sufficient liquidity."
2021-04-24 14:20:13,stocks,"how significant is her leaving? she's a 24 year old gymnast (meaning she's at the  end of her career), and there's a very real possibility that the 2021 olympics don't happen this year given that japan's major cites just went into another lockdown and some athletes/countries are starting to pull out from various events.

VERY few athletes still have marketing power after their professional competing days are over, and it seems unlikely she'll be one of those few."
2021-04-23 20:47:31,stocks,"Which NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, or MLS team she plays for again? Yeah ik its fucked up & i hate to be the bearer of bad news but thats the kind of financial world we live in rn. There will be a day when EVERY athlete, entertainer, etc. will impact the stock market & what have you but that time isnt now. Someday though."
2021-04-23 21:18:26,stocks,"Uh, no. Simone Biles isn’t leading a battalion of valuable athletes out the doors of Nike.

This won’t impact the stock price one iota."
2021-04-23 23:32:59,stocks,lol i don't think she will do anything to the nike stock. think a bigger impact will be lebron or jordan leaves. even kobe contract ending didn't do much impact.
2021-04-24 06:32:21,stocks,Who cares
2021-04-23 20:58:42,stocks,"Yeah at this point everyone knows and their customers and stake holders dont care. Ultimately, there are millions of athletes that their biggest dream is to land their own Nike shoe line. They will continue to acquire top athletes and continue to protect their fat margins."
2021-04-23 21:11:14,stocks,"I got GPS a few weeks ago +75 shares. It's been really good to me, I've been waiting for a dip to get 25 more shares but the stock hasn't dipped. I holding on until the Yeezy collaboration, this should be a nice bump. I like the stock!"
2021-04-24 14:21:21,stocks,"> How is GAP more ethical than Nike though? It’s all the same slave labor and irresponsible materials sourcing.

don't confuse virtue signalers with rational well-informed people."
2021-04-24 05:25:29,stocks,"You both are absolutely right, but if this becomes a trend in the current climate, it could spell trouble for Nike in the long run. Brand is incredibly important in this industry and if the discussion heats up around their practices and people turn towards more conscious consumerism, the pipeline of new athletes signing with them could dry up. The brand definitely benefits from having most of the top athletes onboard, but if that’s no longer the case, what then?

Also, I’m mostly familiar with the basketball situation, but more and more top NBA guys are signing with Under Armor (Steph Curry, Joel Embiid), Adidas (James Harden, Dame Lillard), and even companies like Puma (LaMelo Ball, Deandre Anton) and the Chinese company ANTA (Klay Thompson, Gordon Hayward). Kobe’s estate didn’t reach an agreement with Nike on a new contract and his are in my view some of the best non-Jordan shoes under the Nike brand. 

You still have some rising stars like Zion Williamson signing with Jordan and plenty with Nike, but I personally see the early stages of the tide turning and I’m not super bullish on the brand’s future position relative to the competition. I would personally bet on them seeing somewhat steady market share for the next 5-10 years maybe, but it wouldn’t surprise me to see the bottom fall out if they don’t get out in front of current trends."
2021-04-23 22:30:47,stocks,"I pulled it from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191908/participants-in-gymnastics-in-the-us-since-2006/)

But looking now into how they got their numbers (survey of under 40k and then weighted) I can see how it is probably inaccurate and exaggerated depending on where they surveyed.

I was a gymnast so I'm probably biased with how many people I know involved in the sport or that have a kid that has done it."
2021-04-23 23:31:11,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-23 23:44:24,stocks,"The over 5m figure you are citing is people that are interested in gymnastics, not gymnasts. The part talking about being involved in gymnastics is under 5m people and the only criteria is being over 6 years old and participating in gymnastics once a year, kids doing a single program factor into that number, wouldn’t just be serious gymnasts"
2021-04-24 18:16:53,stocks,"USAG is only one small competitive sector of the sport. There is also AAU Gymnastics, and most gyms do non-competitive recreational gymnastics which is the biggest sector. My first gym I coached at had 45 competitive kids and about 600 recreational kids. The next one had over 90 team kids and has hit over 1k recreational kids in a single month. Those two gyms are only a 5 miles apart, so that's a good amount of kids per capita! Each city has about 30k people in it."
2021-04-23 23:50:07,stocks,"True. I'm honestly mad at myself for not looking into the data deeper before sharing. This would be an easy F on my grad school papers.

If it helps make up for the poor data Simone does have 3.9 million instagram followers so a few million people are at least interested in her 😁."
2021-04-24 11:08:39,stocks,"Yea read them all the more you read the better, eventually you will see what to do. I understand 10-k's are important and whatnot but you can see things like insider trading and stuff as well. Which may or may not mean anything."

2021-04-23 20:45:44,stocks,"I actually used to hold a lot of DGS. Sold it all for EYLD, ironically after comparing the two on WisdomTree’s fund comparison tool. I liked that EYLD had much better historical performance and filtered for companies with less leverage - they also had more growth. The fee difference is small, I think like 10 bps.

2. The stock is highly discussed and high volume 

3. PM price is up significantly but then opens lower or drops in the first 30 minutes.

Unless you were putting it on the Dog coin in which case... yeah it’s best that you get out of that with any money you need. I’d definitely look into keep a good amount in ETH and BTC (which has dipped and is probably a great buy right now) though. I don’t think you can really be fully diversified without it."

I think you'll have to keep watching it over the next month. If it goes above 140, it could theoretically end the downward trend, but if it dips below ~130 in the next week, it could signal a continuation of the downward momentum.

The loss is added to your cost basis if you buy the same/similar security within 30 days. This is to close a sort of loophole to decrease tax burden by selling in one tax year and rebuying within another tax year.

Example: buy at $100. Sell for loss at $90. Buy back at $80 but actual cost basis is now $90. Sell at $85 and you still have a loss of $5.

Edit: If you wanted to make a profit on this stock after buying back within 30 days, you would have to sell at $90+"

ASO has only reported 2 quarters of earnings since[ASO](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0E35eDy8GZcnW15LSJzxdGuTQ) it’s been public. Each quarter was a blow out beating estimates. The reason they went public is because the founders sold 70% to a private equity Wall Street firm. But not just anyone to the Barbarians at the Gate, (reference to book and movie) KKR, KOLBERG KRAVITZ ROBERTS who engineered the largest leveraged buyout ever of RJR Nabisco. KKR brought in new world class management who have been hitting the ball out of the park. If ASO traded at the same multiple as Dicks it would be at $48/sh. And I believe it deserves a premium multiple to dicks.

US can and definitely will fail from    massive tax hikes like this . Only fools will believe it won’t. Europe tried to start class warfare with excuse like widening wealth gap and you can see what happened with their stocks, corporate competitiveness. It’s a big shot show overall and Biden wants to become like them.  

If it really is too big to fail fed won’t come out every week to try calm the market with 0% interest rate indefinitely. Yellen won’t go around and make every country set a minimum Corp tax rate.

May be it's 30% in the end, However that is still super high, with corp gains tax and a reversal of a long few decades of tax cut trend, US cannot sustain higher PE compared to rest of the world. US stocks are more expensive only because US chose the right route of tax cuts, tax breaks, low IRS funding, low interest rate and at times deregulations. That's what the US is at its best, now all that is fading, good luck. It makes sense to go all in US under trump, and it makes sense to rebalance out under the biden regime.

Also you are very wrong. Investing is about finding lowest risk investment, only idiots will still choose to have most of their portfolio with US stocks at this point when US is turining into Europe or having taxes even higher than them. With overall lower PE, international stocks is a golden opportunity, especially now that so many idiots like you decide to hold onto their US stocks despite facing some worst anti growth policies.

Clearly that was the wrong choice.  I should have ""overpaid"" and bought into Amazon when I believed the story a decade ago.  


I bought into UiPath on 4/22.  Waiting only increases the odds that I'll never buy in like I did with Amazon.  I'll take the potential 25% short term downside risk to the potential 10-100x upside gain over the next 20-30 years.  


Is it overvalued?  Yes.    
Did I overpay?  Maybe.    
Is it going to drop to 55-65 in the next 6 months?  Maybe.    
Is it going to go over 100 a share in the next 6 months?  Maybe.  


Everyone is guessing, including the pros.  I bought into UiPath because I believe it's going to be a 300b+ company in 20 years.  I've been following the automation crisis for a long time, and I feel UiPath is well positioned within it.    


I think people may be greatly underestimating the potential market for RPA automation.  UiPath will continue to develop their tools to open more jobs to RPA.    


It's the market leader and has insane margins.  


Finally, I'm impressed with the CEO, Daniel Dines.  I expect him to adapt and expand UiPath into other services, growing UiPath's potential market cap.  I expect that he'll be a household name like many of the other big tech guys in 10 years.

2021-04-24 09:02:05,stocks,"UiPath is a comprehensive platform comprised of robotic process Automation and AI / intelligent automation technologies such as NLP, OCR, ML; task and process mining, and more. Their suite is taking on the test automation, intelligent document processing, process mining industry leaders as well. 

Rpa will mimic manual tasks - so think about any enterprise and all the repetitive, manual work employees do - from mouse clicks to key strokes to moving files and data. Rpa will automate that - both on the desktop and in the back office - and turn a 10 minute process into a 1 minute process. The bot can run 24x7 and the work output is significantly higher than any human (10x plus). This allows human employees to focus on value add work vs repetitive mindless work. 

Core components are bots (unattended and attended), cloud or on prem orchestration, and studio (development) licenses.

When it comes to subjectivity, the human is needed and UiPath has solved for that with their action center product. Intelligence is also addressed with their suite.... reading or comparing invoices, resumes, applications, checks, etc. The bot will use document understanding to process and interpret those documents and loop the human in for subjectivity quickly and easily. 

UiPath is the market leader with a lengthy lead over Its competitors including MS. 

Most enterprises are leveraging only core components and slowly adopting the more advanced part of the suite, if at all. So there’s definitely hype. Also, only a fraction of their customers are spending over 100k / year. UiPath marketing is excellent and has the market believing anyone can build bots but it’s not so...hence the slow growth of adoption within individual enterprises, unless the customer leverages an SI. 

UiPath is mostly software sales, followed by support revenue, and might be in the red on their professional services sales."

2021-04-23 20:40:18,stocks,"Dude, at this point you just sound like someone who can't admit that they're wrong. You keeping spewing anecdotal stories and cherry picking one-off data that fits your narrative.  I've cited where I've found all my data - anyone can check. If you're not trolling , please cite where you're getting your numbers. Otherwise you have zero credibility.  

> *Service charge is subject to change, and has historically been as high as 14%.* 

Why don't you post the whole footnote? It says *""Beginning on September 30, 2020, for new offers, Opendoor’s service charge will be no more than 5%. Service charge is subject to change, and has historically been as high as 14%.""* 

Prior to September 30, 2020, fees were as high as 14% for risker properties. Beginning September 30, 2020 fees are capped at 5%. Yes they are subject to change, but haven't so far. What contradicting about that?

>They also will offer below market. They are flippers. Something you haven’t touched on.

I mentioned it over and over in this post, but I'll say it again.  **They are not home flippers .** A 2019 study by Mike DelPrete can be found [here](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2019/11/12/do-ibuyers-like-opendoor-and-zillow-make-fair-market-offers) and indicates Zillow and Opendoor purchased homes for about **98.6% of their estimated value**. The source of the research is over 20,000 transactions undertaken by Opendoor and Zillow and encompasses 95% of all transactions during 2018 and 2019 using **public records**. 

> I’ve gathered estimates from actual reviews of Opendoor customers. 

Again with the anecdotal data. OK, how many customer samples have you collected? Is it significant? Are you cherry picking unhappy customers and saying that represents the whole picture? Opendoor had 28,712 home transactions between 2019 and 2020. The above research I stated sampled 20,000 transactions. If you're saying yours is more accurate show me the data.

>With Opendoor:  
>  
>Offer price typically 3% below market: $291,000

Again study [above](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2019/11/12/do-ibuyers-like-opendoor-and-zillow-make-fair-market-offers) says 1.4% below market value. Where are you getting your 3%??Here's also what you say on your other post 

> They are offering below market value. I’d say at best 10% below appraisal. 

You went from 10% to 3% pretty fast lol, but it's still the wrong number. Why do you keep switching numbers? Which number do you truly believe in and where is your source?

> You can negotiate down the seller commission 

Again with anecdotal and cherry picking, you just love doing this don't you. Yes, you can negotiate anything in a transaction. Some new agents will do a transaction for almost nothing. But the average commission is around 6%. This can found in multiple sources. We compare averages to averages so its apples to apples. If it's so easy to negotiate a realtor's commission down to 1% the average will be closer to that.

>Avg days on market is currently 7 for this price point (around here it’s 1). But lets be conservative and bump that to 30 for easy math. 

You're lying. Show me a source that says the **average days** on the market for a **significant sample** size is 1, or even 7. Can't? Because it's not true. Yes there are homes that sell within a day, maybe you even saw a few in your market. But if you take an **average** there is no way what you said is true. 

> Guaranteed closing is pointless. Every signed offer should come with earnest money. For this price point, usually $2,000. The whole purpose of that is to reimburse holding costs. So that isn’t much of a risk. Especially since the rate of failed closings is less than 5%. 

You know earnest money is fully refundable until contingencies are removed  ight? This is true for the majority of the states. If a buyer decides to pull out before contingencies are removed the seller has to start all over again. For someone whose home purchase is contingent on their old home selling, this is a disaster. There are also costs like taxes and mortgages associated with holding a property. So how is it pointless again?

> You can’t compare Opendoor to Zillow/Redfin. Their business models are entirely different. They are using their algorithms and access to MLS data to mine for underpriced homes and immediately send offers to grab them up. They do send out offers, but their offers are notoriously low. They aren’t aggressive in the “We buy houses” business. It’s more of a, “If you want to unload your asset for dirt cheap, sure we’ll take it.” 

Again, with the underpricing false narrative. Research of 20,000 samples say they (and other ibuyers) offer 98.6% of a home's appraisal. If you have a significant sample size that says otherwise, let's see it. Zillow has 3 operating segments - they got in ibuying at 2018 and are spending a lot of capital to try to compete with Opendoor. Redfin is a smaller player but they are also in the market. You can find all of this in Zillow and Redfin's 10-K, or public annual filings. But you don't like facts, you just like spewing out information that fits your narrative.  

If you don't like Opendoor, don't invest in it. If you have a legitimate argument against it, please state it. If not, please stop."

The peer group worships their news sources and expects perfection or it is either unjustifiably rationalized or completely dropped. Even if Motley Fool was 10% valuable they would miss it because of their cynical hate.

2021-04-24 09:04:46,stocks,"Because the stock market always looks far into the future and people tend to overbuy and oversell. 

Barring acts of god (e.g. another aircraft incident), with covid over and clearing of 737 max to fly again, it will most likely recover to 80% of its all time high 439 (20% lower because of the 65 billion USD debt it accumulated over the last 2 years). 

I do think 350+ USD per share by end of this year is recovering a little too fast and not fully justified, but given the euphoria of the market, it will likely happen, though how long it holds at the price is another question.

As I mentioned, you really should buy Airbus (which is also down significantly) and Boeing at the same time to hedge the risk. The 2 companies together has a duopoly on commercial jets, and if one of them gets in serious trouble, the other is the only competitor capable of taking over the lost market share, so the share price losses in one company will be quickly recovered by the other company.

One advice I would give you is that public opinion flips a lot on the stock market, and don't let that affect you too much. Just look at intel, 3 months ago, there was mass hysteria that they will lose out to AMD and their share price dropped to the low 40s, because they don't know what they are doing. Then they changed CEO and announced some news that we all excepted are coming, and 2 months later, the share price increased almost 50%.

But then again, Im just a random guy on the internet, so I can be wrong. 

I hold 150 shares of Boeing (avg at 192 USD) and 300 shares of Airbus (avg at 82 EUR)."
2021-04-24 10:35:15,stocks,Thank you for the explanation. Does airbus have a foreign tax for buying securities. I had one company that charged money for purchasing the securities as a foreign tax fee
2021-04-24 16:36:03,stocks,"Depends on the local regulations. I live in Europe, so buying european stocks has no foreign tax fee for me."
2021-04-24 09:23:06,stocks,Same!
2021-04-24 09:27:12,stocks,"Agreed with asml, amazing company that is perfectly positioned right now."
2021-04-24 17:02:47,stocks,As is LRCX.  I just divide between the two in my ROTH.
2021-04-24 09:26:03,stocks,It amazes me more people haven't heard of asml they effectively have a monopoly on high end chip production.
2021-04-24 15:13:27,stocks,"Don’t mean not knowing ASML or LRCX, just not into semi equipment companies. More on companies like TSMC, etc. that uses their equipments."
2021-04-24 00:55:45,stocks,"Buying back stock does not affect the total earnings (net change 0), and in fact boosts earnings per share (since there are less shares).     
So it is not a ""yet they still hit 20% up "" but a ""that's why they can hit 20% up in eps"""
2021-04-24 19:00:31,stocks,"GSK simply doesn't have as many newer cash cows compared to its competitors. GSK doesn't have a lot of drugs in the pipeline compared to the other big pharmaceutical players, and many of its drugs are older drugs that either have generic alternatives or that will soon have generic alternatives. More worrying, many of its newer drugs are not selling well, with the exception of Trelegy and Shingrix, which are both respectable blockbuster drugs. Compare that to other big players, such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Both companies have 4 newer drugs that are blockbusters."

2021-04-24 05:07:54,stocks,You don't have a mattress??
2021-04-24 14:55:58,stocks,"You are not a peloton mom with matching bikes for them and their husbands or a ""broke ass b$@&h"" wishing they had one while using the app on an old lifecycle. A friend now has two bikes and planning for a tread+."
2021-04-24 15:54:54,stocks,Agree with the post-earning fall prediction. The trend is so strong across the board. Don't know why you're being downvoted.
2021-04-23 21:03:59,stocks,Burry has also gotten burned bad on Tesla mini!!

2021-04-24 04:14:31,stocks,Price competition is tough with all the Chinese state-owned lithium mining companies getting state subsidies and beating Western ones on profits. risky this one
2021-04-24 10:53:08,stocks,"Thanks for the post, and for getting her name right 😜"
2021-04-24 11:38:58,stocks,Hahaha it ain’t cathy
